      "sentences": "All right, read it and weep. A rough, rough day for stocks at the corner of Wall and Broad, averages that were just touching records just yesterday, selling off big-time today.  The catalyst for a lot of this was something you just heard with Jon Scott and Chad Pergram, among many factors dissuading stockholders, the idea that the United States government is on the verge of right now owing more than the United States through its goods and services is worth.  If that wasn't a Debbie Downer, the expiration of extra unemployment benefits at the federal level, and Mitch McConnell doubting that a new spending package can come together anytime soon, renewed tensions between U.S. and China and friction certainly targeted toward Chinese diplomats already here, add it, and a big, big sell-off in technology shares, and you had a big sell-off, the biggest we have seen in more than three months right now, and concern that maybe this leads to still more selling.  Perspective is an order here. Things are still pretty good. Some of those technology stocks that were swooning, by the way, are still up in excess of 30 percent from where they were a little more than a couple of weeks ago. That's with the sell-off. The read right now from Susan Li, following all those numbers -- Susan.",

      "sentences": "Neil, worst day on Wall Street since June. And you're right. Big tech, momentum plays, stocks that have run up a lot this year, were the main drags today. So, Apple saw its worst day since March, just before the stock market hit bottom.  Now, Apple, the world's largest company, and also the single most influential stock on Wall Street in close to half-a-century, it's so big that, when it falls, it takes the broader market along with it, so Apple taking a breather, along with the rest of markets, after a really hectic pace of gains since the end of March, ending the shortest bear market in history.   Apple, Salesforce, Microsoft, Home Depot, and Amgen accounting for more than half of the Dow's losses. Also, Amazon, Google, Facebook, other tech high-fliers recording steep losses in the session as well. Investors were even selling off the popular Elon Musk and Tesla. That says something, Tesla on its worst three-day sell-off since March, at the height of COVID. Now, remember that Tesla is one of the best-performing stocks this year. It's up over 400 percent, catapulting Elon Musk as the third richest man on the planet, overtaking Mark Zuckerberg this week. Zoom has also been a name and one of the, if not the lockdown winner of the year, rallying close to a 50 percent in one single session on Tuesday after earnings. Zoom, along with other work-from-home winners, the DocuSigns, the CrowdStrike, and the Pelotons giving back some of their incredible gains this year.   But I did look around for some winners for you, Neil. So, I want you to think of energy and oil plays. Travel, Carnival Cruise Lines and Hyatt Hotels, these stocks have been decimated, but they have been staging a comeback in the past month or so. And, Neil, don't forget, we have a long weekend coming up, and so Wall Street tends to close up their books early, and don't want to hold too much risk if they can't sell out when the markets are closed.",

To put this in perspective on how rampant or widespread this selling got today, on the Big Board, declining issues were swamping gaining ones by an 18-1 margin, 18-1, in other words, 18 times more selling than buying.   On the Nasdaq, what do you think was going on there? -- 70-1, 70 decliners for every one gainer. Now, here's what we're going to do before I get to my next guests, because I want us to be all over this. And we will leave for you.  As you can see, Verizon, American Express the two gainers within the Dow 30 today. We are going to rifle through all the biggest developments in sector moves, what other countries were doing, where we are, not only today, but I thought it would be very handy to give you a perspective with today's sell- off where we still are, so not to just sort of look at this day as a single snapshot of all the days. It's not. It is an anomaly. So, no matter what we're talking about and who we're talking to, this will continue throughout this show. So, if you bear with us on that, no matter who's talking -- and it could be on a political development -- we will rifle through all of this, because we feel we owe you a lot more than just give you a headline number or a headline stock report, without giving you some context for that.  So, if you can -- don't mind being blitzkrieged by data, we're going to blitzkrieg the data.  With all of that, I do want to get a take on people who follow these type of movements very, very closely, whether this is a time to step back and pause or get out of Dodge. Ted Weisberg, the market institution -- in fact, many have recommended putting him in one. He's that good.",

They're sharp. They're painful. It's hurtful. I'm not sure we're out of the woods yet. But the fact that they pulled -- kind of pulled the plug on the techs, and the rest of the market followed today, I think it's just a sign that the market was simply overbought.  It's probably been overbought for the last two or three weeks, if not the last month or so. And so these corrections happen. Fundamentally, I'm not sure that anything changed. We all know what the issues are. I don't think there's anything dramatically new today fundamentally to cause this.  So, from my perspective, I'm not sure we're through it yet, but I view it as a technical pullback from an overall positive trend.

And I think we need to take into consideration, Neil, what brought us to Apple rising 100 percent from its low, what took us 50 percent higher on the S&P following March 23.  And the answer, Neil, is the Fed stimulus and federal government stimulus, neither of which is going to end anytime soon. So, if we don't get what I fully expect to occur, the cash that's waiting with breathless anticipation on the sidelines for a dip, a comfortable dip, I call it, of this magnitude, 3 percent, 4 percent.  It's not a meltdown. So, I think guys are going to step in. I expect that to happen today and tomorrow. And I think, if that doesn't happen, the Fed steps in. The Fed has shown us that they're willing and able to back up the markets. They're already buying high-yield bonds. They will increase their high-yield bond purchases.

So, the Fed has basically been very Wall Street-friendly. I'm not sure I would agree with your other guest that we can count on the Fed coming in to bail us out all the time. I think they have already done that. I think, really, what we're experiencing here, Neil, is a market that just got way ahead of itself. Stocks are not rational. Stock pricing is not rational. And stock markets are not rational. They tend to get overbought. And they tend to get oversold. And I simply think that we have reached a point where we are way overbought.

The five biggest tech names are the ones that have taken the markets higher. If you discount those five names, the markets are flat. So it is those names that have really taken markets to where they are. So we're recommending a rotation to industrials, which hasn't done as well, and to banks. Those are the ones that have really pulled up the rear, energy less so because it's such a highly volatile asset, specifically oil. But I will defer with Teddy. I think this is the Fed moving the markets. I think the Fed is largely manipulating the markets. We have seen that both in treasuries, mortgage-backed securities, and now in investment-grade and now high-yield bonds. So I think the dislocation between a 10 percent unemployment rate, 30 million people still claiming unemployment benefits, and a market at all- time record highs can only be, can only be attributed to both fiscal and monetary stimulus. And let's not forget that 30 -- and this comes from the BLS, the Bureau of Labor Statistics -- 30 percent of people's personal income now comes from the federal government.

      "sentences": "By the way, everyone is focusing on what happens tomorrow, right? And the granddaddy of all economic reports comes out. That would be the employment report for the month of August. And the betting seems to be will gain a million or so jobs. But what they're really focusing on -- and this is something they don't always do -- is that unemployment rate, which had climbed well near 16 percent for a while, gotten down to 10.2 percent in the latest month, talk that it could go under that tomorrow, be in single digits, certainly for the first time since this whole virus shutdown started. I want to go to Charles Payne on that and the importance of that report.   So, Charles, let's say we get the read that I just said is that estimate for the employment report. What would the markets do with that? Or are they now focused more on looking at the downside of any number than the upside? CHARLES PAYNE, HOST, \"MAKING MONEY\": You know, that's a great question. And I'm not 100 percent sure, I will say, the bottom of today's session was 334. Then we saw -- we actually saw a flurry of buying, again, ahead of this number tomorrow. I think good news will be good news, because, to your earlier point, we're still going to be in a lot of trouble historically compared to where we have been. So a number like two million would be phenomenal. The unemployment rate is not as an important if we don't see people come back into the labor force. We don't want one of these skewed unemployment rates, that moves down, but that's because people have left the labor force for good. That's really not good news.  So I'm still overall believing that Wall Street wants to see a better number, wants to see this momentum continue. But I think the issue, really, though -- and this market, I hope, sends a message to Congress today -- that there's work to be done, that this bridge that they provided has been -- was wonderful.",

And I will say, for these particular stocks that have led us, like Tesla, for instance, back in 2000, there was a company called World Online. A lot of people don't know about this, because it was an IPO in Europe, a Dutch online company, one of the biggest in history. It was his. They raised the most amount of money ever at that time.

But I think what we can do right now is create a framework, be sensitive and accountable for the safety and welfare for our businesses, our parents, so that there are no downstream negative consequences or those unintended consequences. And being -- having said that, we're a very large country. And I think that there are some communities that can potentially open up, and some that won't be able to.

He's going to be speaking here in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, at 7:00 p.m. tonight at this airport hangar. And this is in Westmoreland County. He won this county with 64 percent of the vote. This is Trump country. But this is on the heels of what we're seeing, a bunch of new information from some of the polls. A Monmouth poll released yesterday showed a race that is tightening among registered voters. It shows that Biden has just a four-point lead over Trump, 49-45. That is a shrinking lead compared to the same poll that was done at the end of July, which showed a 13-point lead. We're also receiving new information from a Quinnipiac poll that was released just this afternoon. And in that poll, it shows that Biden has a lead over Trump by eight points among likely voters, not just registered voters, but likely voters. And in that poll from Quinnipiac, it showed that voters believe that the economy is the most important issue. As a fact -- matter of fact, 29 percent of likely voters say it's the economy, followed by the coronavirus at 16 percent. But here's what's interesting. On the issues on who they trust the most, Biden leads Trump on every one of the issues here in Pennsylvania, except for the economy. On the issue of the economy, they have President Trump leading Biden 52 percent to 45 percent here in Pennsylvania. And that is the message that we have been hearing from the president here in Pennsylvania. He is really speaking to the blue-collar workers. We expect that message to continue. He's going to go after the former vice president, who is a Scranton native. He's going to probably repeat the same things we have heard, that he has abandoned the workers of Pennsylvania with supporting NAFTA and those other bad trade deals. And we will see what else he has to say tonight. But one last thing, Neil, a really interesting point in this Quinnipiac poll, it shows that 94 percent of likely voters in Pennsylvania have already made up their mind. Just 5 percent of voters are in the middle. So, this is an election that we have spoken to pollsters who say this is all going to be about turnout. Who can really bring out their base? And, tonight, President Trump will be speaking in Trump country in Southwestern Pennsylvania to that base, a big crowd here in the airport hangar. It feels very much like the rallies we have seen in the past, before COVID-19, except now people are wearing masks -- Neil.",

The catalyst for a lot of this was something you just heard with Jon Scott and Chad Pergram, among many factors dissuading stockholders, the idea that the United States government is on the verge of right now owing more than the United States through its goods and services is worth. If that wasn't a Debbie Downer, the expiration of extra unemployment benefits at the federal level, and Mitch McConnell doubting that a new spending package can come together anytime soon, renewed tensions between U.S. and China and friction certainly targeted toward Chinese diplomats already here, add it, and a big, big sell-off in technology shares, and you had a big sell-off, the biggest we have seen in more than three months right now, and concern that maybe this leads to still more selling. Perspective is an order here. Things are still pretty good. Some of those technology stocks that were swooning, by the way, are still up in excess of 30 percent from where they were a little more than a couple of weeks ago. That's with the sell-off. The read right now from Susan Li, following all those numbers -- Susan."

      "utterance": "Neil, worst day on Wall Street since June. And you're right. Big tech, momentum plays, stocks that have run up a lot this year, were the main drags today. So, Apple saw its worst day since March, just before the stock market hit bottom. Now, Apple, the world's largest company, and also the single most influential stock on Wall Street in close to half-a-century, it's so big that, when it falls, it takes the broader market along with it, so Apple taking a breather, along with the rest of markets, after a really hectic pace of gains since the end of March, ending the shortest bear market in history. Apple, Salesforce, Microsoft, Home Depot, and Amgen accounting for more than half of the Dow's losses. Also, Amazon, Google, Facebook, other tech high-fliers recording steep losses in the session as well. Investors were even selling off the popular Elon Musk and Tesla. That says something, Tesla on its worst three-day sell-off since March, at the height of COVID. Now, remember that Tesla is one of the best-performing stocks this year. It's up over 400 percent, catapulting Elon Musk as the third richest man on the planet, overtaking Mark Zuckerberg this week. Zoom has also been a name and one of the, if not the lockdown winner of the year, rallying close to a 50 percent in one single session on Tuesday after earnings. Zoom, along with other work-from-home winners, the DocuSigns, the CrowdStrike, and the Pelotons giving back some of their incredible gains this year. But I did look around for some winners for you, Neil. So, I want you to think of energy and oil plays. Travel, Carnival Cruise Lines and Hyatt Hotels, these stocks have been decimated, but they have been staging a comeback in the past month or so. And, Neil, don't forget, we have a long weekend coming up, and so Wall Street tends to close up their books early, and don't want to hold too much risk if they can't sell out when the markets are closed."

      "utterance": "Very good perspective, Susan. Thank you very, very much, Susan Li, on all of that. To put this in perspective on how rampant or widespread this selling got today, on the Big Board, declining issues were swamping gaining ones by an 18-1 margin, 18-1, in other words, 18 times more selling than buying. On the Nasdaq, what do you think was going on there? -- 70-1, 70 decliners for every one gainer. Now, here's what we're going to do before I get to my next guests, because I want us to be all over this. And we will leave for you. As you can see, Verizon, American Express the two gainers within the Dow 30 today. We are going to rifle through all the biggest developments in sector moves, what other countries were doing, where we are, not only today, but I thought it would be very handy to give you a perspective with today's sell- off where we still are, so not to just sort of look at this day as a single snapshot of all the days. It's not. It is an anomaly. So, no matter what we're talking about and who we're talking to, this will continue throughout this show. So, if you bear with us on that, no matter who's talking -- and it could be on a political development -- we will rifle through all of this, because we feel we owe you a lot more than just give you a headline number or a headline stock report, without giving you some context for that. So, if you can -- don't mind being blitzkrieged by data, we're going to blitzkrieg the data. With all of that, I do want to get a take on people who follow these type of movements very, very closely, whether this is a time to step back and pause or get out of Dodge.

They're sharp. They're painful. It's hurtful. I'm not sure we're out of the woods yet. But the fact that they pulled -- kind of pulled the plug on the techs, and the rest of the market followed today, I think it's just a sign that the market was simply overbought. It's probably been overbought for the last two or three weeks, if not the last month or so. And so these corrections happen. Fundamentally, I'm not sure that anything changed. We all know what the issues are. I don't think there's anything dramatically new today fundamentally to cause this. So, from my perspective, I'm not sure we're through it yet, but I view it as a technical pullback from an overall positive trend. And I would -- I would think that, at some point, the trend will re-exert itself."

The trend again continues, those with continuing claims down two million from what people thought they would be. So that looked good going into trading. And then all hell broke loose.

      "utterance": "I tell them it's an opportunity to buy, Neil. I think that this is -- as Teddy correctly said, this is a fullback and a dip. And I think we need to take into consideration, Neil, what brought us to Apple rising 100 percent from its low, what took us 50 percent higher on the S&P following March 23. And the answer, Neil, is the Fed stimulus and federal government stimulus, neither of which is going to end anytime soon. So, if we don't get what I fully expect to occur, the cash that's waiting with breathless anticipation on the sidelines for a dip, a comfortable dip, I call it, of this magnitude, 3 percent, 4 percent. It's not a meltdown. So, I think guys are going to step in. I expect that to happen today and tomorrow. And I think, if that doesn't happen, the Fed steps in. The Fed has shown us that they're willing and able to back up the markets. They're already buying high-yield bonds. They will increase their high-yield bond purchases. And if this continues in the downside, I personally don't think that the Fed would discard buying equities."

      "speaker": "WEISBERG",
      "utterance": "No, Neil, I don't think so. I think the one thing we have experience, thanks to the Fed, since the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009, is that we have seen the Fed that's been in a very accommodative mode, and that really has created a back -- a positive backdrop for equities through most of the teens and now again because of the pandemic. So, the Fed has basically been very Wall Street-friendly. I'm not sure I would agree with your other guest that we can count on the Fed coming in to bail us out all the time. I think they have already done that. I think, really, what we're experiencing here, Neil, is a market that just got way ahead of itself. Stocks are not rational. Stock pricing is not rational. And stock markets are not rational. They tend to get overbought. And they tend to get oversold. And I simply think that we have reached a point where we are way overbought. And so we're due for a correction. You can wrap around any rationale you want around it. And what we have learned today is that stocks -- and we know this always -- stocks always go down faster than they go up."

And this will be an opportunity for those folks that haven't already to perhaps put a lot of money to work when things get just a little more reasonable in price."

But what do you tell investors, then, Kathryn, who've had these big gains in some stocks, at Apple, let's say if they're lucky enough to hold Amazon or Microsoft, some of the big technology giants? You don't lose money until you sell. So I get that. It's all on paper for the time being if you don't move."

    {
      "speaker": "ROONEY VERA",
      "utterance": "So what we have been telling them to do is to rotate away from tech, because tech since 2017, Neil, is five specific names, actually. And we all know what they are. The five biggest tech names are the ones that have taken the markets higher. If you discount those five names, the markets are flat. So it is those names that have really taken markets to where they are. So we're recommending a rotation to industrials, which hasn't done as well, and to banks. Those are the ones that have really pulled up the rear, energy less so because it's such a highly volatile asset, specifically oil. But I will defer with Teddy. I think this is the Fed moving the markets. I think the Fed is largely manipulating the markets. We have seen that both in treasuries, mortgage-backed securities, and now in investment-grade and now high-yield bonds. So I think the dislocation between a 10 percent unemployment rate, 30 million people still claiming unemployment benefits, and a market at all- time record highs can only be, can only be attributed to both fiscal and monetary stimulus. And let's not forget that 30 -- and this comes from the BLS, the Bureau of Labor Statistics -- 30 percent of people's personal income now comes from the federal government. So, consumption heretofore has been pushed by the government."

      "utterance": "By the way, everyone is focusing on what happens tomorrow, right? And the granddaddy of all economic reports comes out. That would be the employment report for the month of August. And the betting seems to be will gain a million or so jobs. But what they're really focusing on -- and this is something they don't always do -- is that unemployment rate, which had climbed well near 16 percent for a while, gotten down to 10.2 percent in the latest month, talk that it could go under that tomorrow, be in single digits, certainly for the first time since this whole virus shutdown started. I want to go to Charles Payne on that and the importance of that report. So, Charles, let's say we get the read that I just said is that estimate for the employment report. What would the markets do with that? Or are they now focused more on looking at the downside of any number than the upside? CHARLES PAYNE, HOST, \"MAKING MONEY\": You know, that's a great question. And I'm not 100 percent sure, I will say, the bottom of today's session was 334. Then we saw -- we actually saw a flurry of buying, again, ahead of this number tomorrow. I think good news will be good news, because, to your earlier point, we're still going to be in a lot of trouble historically compared to where we have been. So a number like two million would be phenomenal. The unemployment rate is not as an important if we don't see people come back into the labor force. We don't want one of these skewed unemployment rates, that moves down, but that's because people have left the labor force for good. That's really not good news. So I'm still overall believing that Wall Street wants to see a better number, wants to see this momentum continue. But I think the issue, really, though -- and this market, I hope, sends a message to Congress today -- that there's work to be done, that this bridge that they provided has been -- was wonderful."

We were working on sort of fumes. And Teddy and Kathryn made some wonderful points. And I will say, for these particular stocks that have led us, like Tesla, for instance, back in 2000, there was a company called World Online. A lot of people don't know about this, because it was an IPO in Europe, a Dutch online company, one of the biggest in history. It was his. They raised the most amount of money ever at that time. There was a big party. Everyone's drinking champagne. And a reporter says to the CEO, hey, what are you going to do now with your newfound wealth?

But I'm saying, a company like Tesla, where yesterday the company says they're going to sell $5 billion worth, then this morning we find out the second largest shareholder has dumped a lot of stock, that really put the brakes on the momentum stocks. But I do believe Kathryn is right, in the sense that people are rotating. The banks, we will see what happens. Wall Street has believed the banks could carry us for a long time. The open trade, cruise ship, airline stocks look phenomenal. Believe it or not, brick-and-mortar retailers have been really doing very well the last couple of weeks. So we want good news tomorrow.

Keep in mind that Pfizer had indicated on the same day, actually within two hours, of whether -- when Fauci was making those remarks on CNN, saying that it will be in phase three trials of its own vaccine drug that looks promising by at least that time. Nevertheless, Dr. Fauci and his comments did rattle a lot of folks. It's a good time to sort of say, forget about investors and the reaction here. What is the likelihood of a vaccine this year? Dr. Anita Gupta joins us, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, anesthesiologist, physician. You name it, she does it all. And she knows her stuff. So I defer to your expertise, Doctor. I mean, he is saying I think what's pretty obvious. We don't know for sure. We hope, but the idea of a vaccine in October that a lot of people think is sort of locked in place might not be. Is that true? Do you think that's real?"

And keep in mind, this isn't something that's going to be handled by Dr. Fauci alone. I think it's something that's being done on a global level. And it's being done by the health care industry as we speak. And we have to reach 300 million Americans, right? And we may have to do it multiple times. So, everyone in the United States and beyond is at a global race. And so I think that we will get there, and we will get there very quickly. I think that we are at an unprecedented rate. And I think that we will get there to the front lines to patients, but we have to do it very carefully. And it's not whether we get there now or whether we get four months to now. We need to begin preparation. And I think that's what you're seeing right now, the preparation, the planning. It's never too early to begin action."

Other schools are kicking around the same possibility amid spikes in cases, the University of South Carolina and elsewhere, so many others.

And there's evidence that we need our children there. And there is absolute benefit there. But this is a complex problem. It's not a one-size-fits-all. And the school closures are happening for many reasons, potential exposure, potential policies that are not being put in place early enough. So, I think our economy, our families, our children, our young adults need it. They need it for their social and emotional development. But I think what we can do right now is create a framework, be sensitive and accountable for the safety and welfare for our businesses, our parents, so that there are no downstream negative consequences or those unintended consequences. And being -- having said that, we're a very large country. And I think that there are some communities that can potentially open up, and some that won't be able to. So, I think we need to be considerate of that and plan accordingly."

I think it's really impactful to walk the streets firsthand; 60th Street, where much of this happened, is, in better times, the Fourth of July parade route. My favorite memories are kids standing there waving flags and collecting candy. It's impactful. And when you walk those streets and you see the damage that occurred in the center of the city of Kenosha, if anything, it reminds you of the importance of making sure we fund police and how dangerous of an idea it is to defund police."

Want to go to Bryan Llenas right now, because this idea kind of candidates going to key states, you're seeing a lot more of that, particularly the president, who has kept a very, very frenetic schedule in Pennsylvania, a key battleground state, the state he surprisingly won four years ago and picked up its 20 electoral votes. I guess he's trying to do a repeat -- Bryan Llenas, to you."

The last time, I spoke to you from Old Forge, Pennsylvania, obviously a very important battleground state, 20 electoral votes. He won this state in 2016 by less than 1 percentage point. He's going to be speaking here in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, at 7:00 p.m. tonight at this airport hangar. And this is in Westmoreland County. He won this county with 64 percent of the vote. This is Trump country. But this is on the heels of what we're seeing, a bunch of new information from some of the polls. A Monmouth poll released yesterday showed a race that is tightening among registered voters. It shows that Biden has just a four-point lead over Trump, 49-45. That is a shrinking lead compared to the same poll that was done at the end of July, which showed a 13-point lead. We're also receiving new information from a Quinnipiac poll that was released just this afternoon. And in that poll, it shows that Biden has a lead over Trump by eight points among likely voters, not just registered voters, but likely voters. And in that poll from Quinnipiac, it showed that voters believe that the economy is the most important issue. As a fact -- matter of fact, 29 percent of likely voters say it's the economy, followed by the coronavirus at 16 percent. But here's what's interesting. On the issues on who they trust the most, Biden leads Trump on every one of the issues here in Pennsylvania, except for the economy. On the issue of the economy, they have President Trump leading Biden 52 percent to 45 percent here in Pennsylvania. And that is the message that we have been hearing from the president here in Pennsylvania. He is really speaking to the blue-collar workers. We expect that message to continue. He's going to go after the former vice president, who is a Scranton native. He's going to probably repeat the same things we have heard, that he has abandoned the workers of Pennsylvania with supporting NAFTA and those other bad trade deals. And we will see what else he has to say tonight. But one last thing, Neil, a really interesting point in this Quinnipiac poll, it shows that 94 percent of likely voters in Pennsylvania have already made up their mind. Just 5 percent of voters are in the middle. So, this is an election that we have spoken to pollsters who say this is all going to be about turnout. Who can really bring out their base? And, tonight, President Trump will be speaking in Trump country in Southwestern Pennsylvania to that base, a big crowd here in the airport hangar. It feels very much like the rallies we have seen in the past, before COVID-19, except now people are wearing masks -- Neil."

Last night, the president signing a memorandum targeting cities like Portland, Seattle, Washington, D.C., and New York City, saying he just might withhold federal funds if they can't get a handle on law and order and lawlessness. That prompted New York's attorney general, Letitia James, to say, you touch one penny of our budget from the federal government, we're going to take you to court.

And maybe that was political, but there are many, many New Yorkers who are now Floridians. It's just too expensive. The taxes are too high. The social climate has deteriorated enormously.

But I don't think you can just say, if you're the governor, sit back and say, well, we have an awful mayor, the city is going down the tubes, isn't it sad? If I were mayor -- governor today, I would use my emergency powers to take over the entire question of the homeless. Right now, one of the reasons for that spike in crime, one of the reasons for the decline in quality of life are mentally ill homeless wandering the streets, threatening people, and too often engaging in violence. It is an emergency. I would use the governor's emergency power to remove that from the mayor, who obviously can't deal with that issue appropriately, and put in place the appropriate steps.

So, what I did is what I know works. And that is, you have to grow the private sector. You have to create an incentive for wealthy people, not just not to leave, but to come back. You have to create a program of economic incentives, deregulation, lower tax burden, where companies want to invest and expand and hire people and grow the economy. That's what we did. It worked. It would work again. Right now, the taxes are way too high. The regulatory climate is awful. The social climate, the crime and other things, are just deteriorating day by day. And so, if you're a wealthy person who can move, or an investor looking to build a factory or an office, you don't look in New York. That's got to change.

And now he's actually coming out and saying, in the month of September, we're going to give you an answer. It may be good, it may be bad, but you guys deserve an answer. And now that just leaves -- it still leaves me confused. It still doesn't leave me very happy, because I don't understand why everybody else has just been given a direct answer, direct dates, a direct future, and we, unfortunately, haven't. We have definitely been doing the best we can. I'm here trying to support my neighborhood people, my family, my friends. I mean, we hosted a rally today at Il Bacco. It actually went very, very well. We had about -- I would say about 150 to 200 people there. And everyone came out in support. And, actually, at the rally, I heard people talking other perspectives on Northern Boulevard, the restaurant across the street, the restaurant down the block. And to hear other people's experiences of the past six months, it really brings it close to home for you. It just opens up your eyes to how much this is just affecting everybody.

We don't care about them? What about him? He doesn't go out to eat? He doesn't go inside indoor restaurants? So is he -- I mean, it's just -- it's preposterous to me, to be honest. I hear lots of people say multiple things. I have heard Cuomo say, oh, they could go over the bridge, and eat in Jersey. Now I hear people saying that we should go out in Long Island. It's almost like people are advocates for people leaving the city of New York. And that's truly how I feel. I'm not here to point fingers and say -- I'm not here to point fingers and get upset at anyone. But just yesterday, the county executive of Nassau County, Laura Curran, made a speech, wine and dine in Nassau County, where we will -- we will keep you away from the cold. She made a comment like that.

I know you're thinking, all right, restaurants, Mark Penn and the economy issue, but for a reason. Because these are issues that matter sometimes to a lot of people, Mark, a lot more than some of the bigger issues like the economy or the markets on a crazy day. I'm just wondering how this falls out in areas that cannot get back to normal, and it's delay upon delay and delay. What do you think?"

      "utterance": "Well, it's interesting. I was just looking at our latest polls on this. And the public is very cautious. I mean, the public is willing to shut things down and keep them shut, and -- but mostly because they think that the virus is increasing. They think there's no vaccine for, well, half the people, six months or more, three-quarters, at least three months. So, people don't see an end right now. They're very pessimistic about the virus. And so I think -- I think that also leads to a lot of situations here that -- where the public is, like I said, surprisingly cautious."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "How does it play out politically, though, Mark? I always wonder, because, today notwithstanding, a crazy day in the markets, I get that -- they come and go. They're jarring, but they do remind you the risks of just investing in the markets. But the bigger picture here, the economy has been improving. The numbers have been looking better, today notwithstanding, the markets as well. But it's these lifestyle issues. It's these life concern issues, whether it's violence and crime, not being able to go to your favorite restaurant, not being able to return to work. These seem to be much more substantive than then they're given credit."

    {
      "speaker": "PENN",
      "utterance": "Yes, I think -- I think most people say, hey, it's the issues I care about. I think I have identified three V's and an E, right? The virus, where I think Trump was doing well, and then he fell back, and he's got a deficit now that he's got to come back from, the violence, where you can see Trump has been making this an issue. It is one of the most important issues; 90 percent think it will be a big issue. The vaccine, which -- because no one expects it, if it comes out -- and I can't tell, between the CDC saying it will come out and Fauci saying it won't come out, and everybody -- if it is, it is. And that will shake things up. And the economy, where, despite the economic problems, Trump has a very strong advantage in that area, relative to anything else or anybody else."

      "speaker": "PENN",
      "utterance": "It's interesting. I think you're going to have to wait another week or to see how they're gelling. Some -- we just came back with a poll nationally that was six points. So I thought some of the FOX battleground polls were maybe a little higher, because we're showing that likely voters are tightening, tightening to a greater extent. I think we have a real election now. I think -- I think, a month ago, this thing was wide-open for Biden. And now it's going to be a real election that's going to be close. And the debates are going to be big."

      "utterance": "All right, my friend, thank you very, very much. From restaurants, to stocks, the economy, you covered it all, Mark. Good job, Mark Penn, the former Clinton pollster, much, much more. All right, end with a focus on tomorrow, whether we repeat this, a big employment report, which could go a long way to either easing fears or just adding to them.
