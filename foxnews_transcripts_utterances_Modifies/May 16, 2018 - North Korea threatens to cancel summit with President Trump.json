This is a guy who wields a real stick, not just a yummy carrot, which is why there's real reason to be optimistic, even with the North Korean threats. I'd be more uncertain without such threats. It's a sign of engagement.  Granted, for this deal to happen, you have to think big and believe you can actually pull it off. Take a way smaller achievement: Wollman Rink, a Manhattan attraction that languished for years because the city couldn't get it running. Trump got involved and in months turned it into a wildly popular tourist attraction. So, why does that happen? Because some guy thought he could do it. Do not underestimate the power of positive thinking, especially when it's coming from someone who knows the good guy from the bad and how to speak both their languages.   And, look, haven't we seen results already? Today, North Korea threatened to cancel a meeting. Months ago they were threatening to nuke us. I call that progress. Dana, Dana, Dana.

And, he's not holding all the cards anymore because now he's dealing with someone who has a pretty strong history of being a tough negotiator.

Not surprising their behavior. But, I think Donald Trump should stay tough. I think he's doing exactly what he should be doing. He should just completely unfettered by this whole thing and say, look, my end goal is the same. I'm going to be tough on you. I'm not going to stop talking about human rights violations just because you think that's something we shouldn't be talking about.

I know that the Chinese are really important, but the South Koreans want this more than anything. And President Moon is going to be coming to the White House on Tuesday, so the president will have a chance to meet with him face-to-face.

He brought the U.N. Make sure they had the blockade over certain vessels. The fuel was drying up. They did have limited access to capital. So, that was all good. So that was the truth of why this has happened. Yes, he did say some good things. He said we're going to give the hostages back. We're going to destroy this nuclear testing site.

He could say, well, I don't like Bolton and I'm not going to do this if you expect me to disarm. And, he's not holding all the cards anymore because now he's dealing with someone who has a pretty strong history of being a tough negotiator. I just want to remind the media, though, when you're president is going up against Kim Jong-un you should be rooting for your president. Not so pretty across the board type of thing. Not surprising their behavior. But, I think Donald Trump should stay tough. I think he's doing exactly what he should be doing. He should just completely unfettered by this whole thing and say, look, my end goal is the same. I'm going to be tough on you. I'm not going to stop talking about human rights violations just because you think that's something we shouldn't be talking about. And I'm going to stay true to American values and American principle and be strong to this whole thing. And that's the best he can do.

He never spoke to President Trump about the Air Force One statement. And the whole thing turned out to be a nothing burger. So, Juan, how does a nothing burger taste?"

He says that when he was talking about the meeting, he asked who is going to be coming to the meeting, and was never given any of the names of people that were coming to the meeting. He didn't know he was actually meeting with Russians. He knew that the meeting was about dirt that the Russians may have had, but he didn't go into the meeting knowing there were Russians there.

And my problem with this is why would he go to that meeting, why would he trust any information coming from Russia, honestly, because I certainly wouldn't. And why wouldn't you know that even if it was tempting to get dirt on an opponent, as many people in that position may have felt that way, wouldn't you be afraid that this would ultimately hurt your dad if it came out? So, I feel like, for me, this has to bother Republicans and Democrats alike, because you wouldn't want any politician -- I don't care if it was, you know, Don Jr., or Chelsea Clinton, or whoever it is, I don't want anyone allying themselves with Russia in an effort to undermine another politician in the United States. And believe me, I didn't want Hillary Clinton to get elected. I'm glad Donald Trump won that election over her, but that doesn't mean that this doesn't bother me."

They didn't know -- everybody meets with somebody offering dirt, even when they're not in politics. I tried to get dirt on you all the time, Jesse. Do you know what collusion is? And I may use this metaphor. Many of us go to like Safeway on Sundays, and we buy rotisserie chicken. That's what collusion is, because by Wednesday you're desperately trying to pick at the insides of the chicken because you're running out of meat. And so, right now, they're on Wednesday of Sunday's rotisserie chicken.

They should apply gun control to movie guns. And the only way you could do this is tax movies by amount of guns and by the amount of bullets they use per movies. Now this way -- so I'm going to -- I'm going to wonder. Hollywood's gun-control activists, and there are lots of them, like Alyssa Milano, Judd Apatow, whatnot. Will they be OK for a gun-control tax on movies with guns? Tax the bullets. Ten thousand dollars every time there's a bullet. A hundred thousand dollars for a gun. Would they do it?

Interview with Keith Levine, original guitarist for The Clash, later in PIL, one of the classic legendary musicians in the punk movement. Listen to it. We talk about block change (ph) and Bitcoin. And if you haven't forgotten, go to Amazon and pre-order my book. Pre- order my book. Show proof to me that you pre-ordered it, and I will draw you -- I will draw a portrait of you. No, this is a contest. Only one of you. That would be -- that would be very -- that would be a big disaster."
