      "sentences": "Jonathan Turley on this show earlier, this first panel will deal with Cohen, Michael Cohen, what he pled today in New York in the southern district. Rudy Giuliani, the president's attorney, saying \"There is no allegation of any wrongdoing against the president and the government's charges against Mr. Cohen. It is clear that, as the prosecutor noted, Mr. Cohen's actions reflect a pattern of lies and dishonesty over a significant period of time.\" Lanny Davis, Cohen's attorney, says \"Today he stood up and testified under oath that Donald Trump directed him to commit a crime by making payments to two women for the principal purpose of influencing an election. If those payments were a crime for Michael Cohen, then why wouldn't they be a crime for Donald Trump?\"  With that, let's bring in our panel: former senior National Council spokesman Michael Anton; Catherine Lucey, White House reporter for the Associated Press, and Matthew Continetti, editor in chief of the Washington Free Beacon.  Catherine, in the plea information that we have, Cohen admits to reimbursing these payments for Karen McDougal and Stormy Daniels. But in the case he agrees to reimburse the National Enquirer for the payment made to Karen McDougal. The plea also states that the McDougal payment was made in coordination with the chairman of the corporation, David Pecker, and one or more officials from the campaign. Basically it's the first indication from this plea agreement we've had that Cohen and the campaign were connected to this payment by McDougal through National Enquirer. A lot of developments today but let's focus on the Cohen part.",

But what we are seeing here is details from the president's personal lawyers, his personal fixer, a person who he worked with closely for many years about how these payments which we've all been reporting on and talking about for some time were carried out. Back in April, I was on Air Force One with the president and asked him if he knew about the $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels. At the time he said no, he didn't know anything about it.

And so now the same arguments are going to be applied over to President Trump's alleged involvement in this payment. What I am more struck by, Bret, is that for years now Donald Trump has kind of kept his enemies scrambled. They don't know how to criticize him, they don't know how to respond to him. And in the past few months what we have seen is the way to actually respond and get Trump in trouble is by adopting his own reality TV approach to the world. And so who was causing President Trump the most trouble these days? It's Michael Cohen who did the dramatic reversal and have the secret tapes.",
