      "sentences": "Hannity, you had a fantastic show. Absolutely, I am Laura Ingraham and this is “The Ingraham Angle” from another busy Washington tonight. The Democrats refused to accept President Trump denouncing hate and of course white the premises. So will it anything satisfy them at this point? Former ACLU Executive Michael Myers and Former DNC Spokesman Luis Miranda are here to debate that. Then Raymond Arroyo is here with an astonishing look at the common characteristics of these mass shooters that are being ignored amid the blame game.  Plus John Nyou (ph) on California's attempt to keep Trump offs the ballot there in 2020 how democratic of them. But first Democrats fan the flames of hatred. That's a focus of tonight's “Angle.”  Since last night's “Angle” and we exposed the Democrats exploitation of human tragedies for political gain. Things have gotten worse if you can believe it. In the last 24 hours, the left smears and attacks have been become more ghoulish, more vicious and more unhinged. With the help of prominent media collaborators they have launched what I think is basically a three-pronged assault designed to.  Number one, profit from the massacre through political fund-raising. Number two; raise their public profiles in a competitive campaign season. And number three, target and silence their political opponents through defamation and demonization. Now the Democratic National Committee sent out an email signed by Former Representative Gabby Giffords, remember she her herself was almost killed by an assassin and that mailing encourage people to split their donations between the DNC and Gifford's own pack in the wake of these tragedies.  Elizabeth Warren whose candidacy the Dayton shooter supported you may remember is also getting in on the act, writing in an email\" If we are going to address the gun violence epidemic in our country we need to take back the Senate in 2020.\" She then urges people to donate to several Democrat Senatorial candidates. Then today on MSNBC Stephanie Ruhle focused at least on important stuff.",

Now, completing the evil racism of a deranged killer with Trump's reasonable and much needed call for border security, it's not just offensive. It's absolutely up seen. And by the way, I didn't see any Republicans trying to read blame into the murderer's radical environmental and anti-corporate angling's. Well, those have gone largely unreported. I wonder why? Now this is how leftist darling Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez decided to honor the victims of these massacres and lower the temperature.",

Now, it's so bad that today Democratic Congressman Joaquin Castro went on Twitter to list the names and employers of 44 top Trump donors in San Antonio. He wrote their contributions are fueling a campaign of hate that labels Hispanic immigrants as \"Invaders.\" Now, a sitting congressman is doxing slandering and frankly endangering his own constituents. Forget persuasion. Democrats have decided to demonize and just altogether write off a huge swath of the population as just a bunch of racists. This is a campaign of intimidation and I'm telling you it's going to end up getting more people hurt.  Let me show you where all this leads. Once mainstream Democrats start branding all Trump supporters's as deplorable racists, they all become targets in their own way. A despicable group were they not only of marginalization but elimination by any means necessary.  Now this was the scene outside of Mitch McConnell's house.

They want to stir up grievance and hatred for political purposes while ignoring the trends that may be fueling some of these mass killings that the country so many are suffering through tonight.

The Democrats refused to accept President Trump denouncing hate and of course white the premises. So will it anything satisfy them at this point? Former ACLU Executive Michael Myers and Former DNC Spokesman Luis Miranda are here to debate that. Then Raymond Arroyo is here with an astonishing look at the common characteristics of these mass shooters that are being ignored amid the blame game. Plus John Nyou (ph) on California's attempt to keep Trump offs the ballot there in 2020 how democratic of them. But first Democrats fan the flames of hatred. That's a focus of tonight's “Angle.” Since last night's “Angle” and we exposed the Democrats exploitation of human tragedies for political gain. Things have gotten worse if you can believe it. In the last 24 hours, the left smears and attacks have been become more ghoulish, more vicious and more unhinged. With the help of prominent media collaborators they have launched what I think is basically a three-pronged assault designed to. Number one, profit from the massacre through political fund-raising. Number two; raise their public profiles in a competitive campaign season. And number three, target and silence their political opponents through defamation and demonization. Now the Democratic National Committee sent out an email signed by Former Representative Gabby Giffords, remember she her herself was almost killed by an assassin and that mailing encourage people to split their donations between the DNC and Gifford's own pack in the wake of these tragedies. Elizabeth Warren whose candidacy the Dayton shooter supported you may remember is also getting in on the act, writing in an email\" If we are going to address the gun violence epidemic in our country we need to take back the Senate in 2020.\" She then urges people to donate to several Democrat Senatorial candidates.

Now, completing the evil racism of a deranged killer with Trump's reasonable and much needed call for border security, it's not just offensive. It's absolutely up seen. And by the way, I didn't see any Republicans trying to read blame into the murderer's radical environmental and anti-corporate angling's. Well, those have gone largely unreported. I wonder why? Now this is how leftist darling Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez decided to honor the victims of these massacres and lower the temperature."

Now, it's so bad that today Democratic Congressman Joaquin Castro went on Twitter to list the names and employers of 44 top Trump donors in San Antonio. He wrote their contributions are fueling a campaign of hate that labels Hispanic immigrants as \"Invaders.\" Now, a sitting congressman is doxing slandering and frankly endangering his own constituents. Forget persuasion. Democrats have decided to demonize and just altogether write off a huge swath of the population as just a bunch of racists. This is a campaign of intimidation and I'm telling you it's going to end up getting more people hurt. Let me show you where all this leads. Once mainstream Democrats start branding all Trump supporters's as deplorable racists, they all become targets in their own way. A despicable group were they not only of marginalization but elimination by any means necessary. Now this was the scene outside of Mitch McConnell's house.

When President Johnson, who was my hero until 2015, when I discovered what happened under his watch, when they hired a 100,000 federal social workers to go throughout the country and get the black father out of the home and the government became the father of the home, they put the women on welfare and they were pregnant. They would approach them and put them on welfare, but the father could not be in the home. The government became the father. And that is when so many so many of our black boys went to prison. That caused the destruction of our family even till today. I see the effects of it now. And most people don't know that. My book will tell it all."

They want to shut it down, and they want to call anyone who raises questions about various policies as racist, as white supremacists, or you are anti-immigrant. If you believe in legal immigration you are now anti-immigrant. This is the level of discourse we gotten to. And none of us are perfect. I'm sure everybody gets hot under the collar every now and then, and that's fine. But this is now at a point where people's lives are being taken, and other bloodshed could occur because of the demonization game. And I think a black conservative today, because I worked for Justice Thomas, you can say anything about an African-American conservative because they are demonized to such an extent."

Somebody is going to get hurt. People have already been killed as a result of it.

And I'm telling you, with the congressman framing people who donate to campaigns as complicit to murder, which was what Joaquin Castro did tonight, it wasn't just we're going to publish names, it's all public information anyway. It's the frame around it, Dennis, you know what I'm talking about. The frame around it is, you give to Trump, you are complicit in murder. You give to Trump, you might as well pull the trigger.

Alcohol and drug abuse, isolation. A reverence for other shooters and seeking validation of their motivations. And an announcement of their intentions. Laura, we have suicides exploding in this countries, 33 percent increase since 1999, 47,000 Americans killed themselves in 2017. Something is happening, particularly among the young.

And at a time when priests are breaking their vows and pastors are violating their principles, it's a tough moment for the church and morality, and you need it, and family structure. But we need to identify these people, almost profile them, Laura, discover their difficulties and get them the help they need. They are out there, they're crying out, but they are in isolation.

Last week Governor Gavin Newsom signed a law requiring presidential candidates to release their tax returns in order to be on the primary ballot. His predecessor Jerry Brown vetoes similar legislation in 2017 over concerns it could be unconstitutional. Joining me now, John Yoo, former deputy assistant U.S. attorney general. We have three quick topics to get into with John. John, is that California law constitutional?"

The Constitution allows states to manage access to the ballot, but the Supreme Court clearly said in a case about term limits that states can't do it in a way that changes the qualification for federal office. Here obviously California is trying to meddle with the ballot in order to oppose President Trump, and it's clearly something California is not allowed to do. It also violates the right of the Republican Party or any political party to choose its leaders under the free speech clause and under the 14th Amendment."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "It was just so obvious to anyone who has even a cursory understanding of the law, and yet it doesn't matter. They will do it anyway. John, I also want to get to another story that anti-Trump former official Peter Strzok is now suing the FBI and DOJ for his firing last June. He claims that making his anti-Trump text, taking them violated his First and Fifth Amendment rights. Does he have some case?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "YOO",

Imagine if an FBI agent during the Hillary Clinton investigation had said, I hate Hillary, we have to get Donald Trump elected. Obviously, someone like that should be fired, too. I'm not sure whether the FBI should ever be involved in ever investigating presidential campaign, but if it's going to be, it has to have integrity. The FBI can't have people who are political hacks or even partisan affiliations working on these kinds of investigations. Strzok, he obviously displayed a failure of leadership. He obviously displayed an inability to manage. And he showed himself to be biased. I think the FBI had every grounds to fire, and I expect he will lose his lawsuit."

John, to top Dems on the House Judiciary Committee today sent a letter to the National Archives for documents from Brett Kavanaugh's time in the White House Counsel's Office. They are still going after Kavanaugh. So is the White House Counsel's Office in the White House now going to shut this down?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "YOO",
      "utterance": "I actually hope President Trump here says, don't produce the documents. And he's got a good ally on this, and that's George Washington. This is a principle that our country has lived under for over 200 years. The House wanted to get from George Washington documents about a treaty, and George Washington said no because the House is not involved in ratifying treaties. The same principle applies here. President Trump should say the last time I looked at the Constitution, the House is not involved with confirming Supreme Court judges. Because of that you have no right to the information about Kavanaugh's background because you have no constitutional function here. So if I was President Trump I would say no on the documents, and I will say my good friend George Washington is the precedent that shows I'm right."
