      "utterance": "So, what that does is allow us to get meaningful growth from it and allows us, I think, to move towards permanence, which, again, Neil, I know I preach about it, and so does the speaker, an awful lot. But, look, we want to make bold changes. We want our families and businesses to be able to depend upon this. So I want as much permanence as I can get through this tax reform."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "How about making them retroactive? Any talk of that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BRADY",
      "utterance": "So, continuing to work on that all fits in with the final details of this. At the end of the day, again, I think this will be left to the committees to finalize the plan, because, again, the president, Senate and House tax writers, we're not going to lay out every detail here. We want input from our committee members, from our conferences. That's the right way to do it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, now, the president, as you know, sir, has made overtures to Democrats, particularly Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, on everything from DACA to this other effort a couple of weeks back to lift the debt ceiling and attach hurricane relief to it. And you, as a Texan, of course, were OK with that at the time. But I do wonder whether, in the move to win over Democratic votes, the president could have promised the upper income don't get a tax cut, and that would win over Democratic votes and might tick you off, but it could get Democratic votes. Do you think it could?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BRADY",
      "utterance": "So, remains to be seen. And I'm not convinced the president made any deal like that. Look, if you're serious about lowering the tax rates..."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Well, he did say, sir, that he wasn't keen on a tax cut for the rich, that they would pay about what they're paying right now, maybe a little more. Now, whether that was an overture -- and I'm sorry -- you clarified it -- whether it was an overture to win Democrat votes, I don't know. But he did say that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BRADY",
      "utterance": "I will leave that to the president. But I will make this point."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Sure."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BRADY",
      "utterance": "Look, if you're serious, Republican or Democrat, about lowering our rates, making America competitive, and delivering on a big middle-class tax cut, we're serious about working with you. And so I'm hopeful Democrats will stay at the table with us and see if we can't find some common ground."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, you have a lot more wiggle room in your committee, the House Ways and Means Committee, than your counterpart does in the Senate. There are a couple of committees working on this there. So, are you afraid whatever you come up with or draft in the House is going too moderated, toned down in the Senate?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BRADY",
      "utterance": "Well, look, there's a process here. This is a major lift. I think having the president, the White House, the House and Senate tax writers together on the same page is, one, unprecedented, and, two, really lays out sort of the framework of where we want to get. Will these committees have the ability to adjust and tailor and target? Absolutely. And we want that to happen. That's a healthy process going forward. But the framework, how bold we're going to go, I think is critically important. And that happens and all this accelerates starting next week."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Chairman, how does this Cassidy-Graham health care rework plan affect what you want to do? They want to have a vote. I guess Mitch McConnell in the Senate wants a vote next week. That's about the same time all of this stuff is apparently coming to fruition in Washington. It's looking like planes backed up at Reagan National here. What's going on?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BRADY",
      "utterance": "Well, isn't this the way Washington always works?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Yes, it does. You're right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BRADY",
      "utterance": "Where all these things tend to collide on the exact same afternoon, it seems like. But, look, it doesn't stop either the announcement going forward next work or the work we're doing in the committees. And, look, I wish the Senate well. If they can return decision-making in health care to the states..."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Could that help you? If that were to pass -- I'm sorry, sir. If that were to pass -- I just want to be clear -- that was some of the benefits of getting that done first before getting the tax cuts -- that would be a surprise bennie for you, wouldn't it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BRADY",
      "utterance": "I think, on the momentum side, yes. On the tax side, probably a wash. Look, it doesn't take the $1 trillion of ObamaCare taxes out of the economy. I wish it did. But I think it builds momentum that there's -- that Congress and the House and Senate can deliver on these big issues, health care being one and tax reform being the other."

    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, Chairman Brady, I want to thank you very much. Whether people agree or disagree, no one, no one has worked harder on these tax cuts coming to fruition, long before anyone was running for president or anything else. It's you. So, thank you, sir, again. Very good seeing you."

      "speaker": "BRADY",
