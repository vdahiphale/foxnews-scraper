Over 600,000 are now without power. Coastal areas have been devastated by flooding and the rain is not stopping any time soon.  And coming up, we're going to bring you live reports from the ground. But, first, we have a lot of breaking news today in the media as most of it wrong and they're not covering the important stuff. Paul Manafort did agree to cooperate with the office of special counsel.  But, despite what you are hearing from the destroy Trump left wing press, the plea deal, it doesn't have to do with the president at all, nothing to do with the 2016 campaign at all, nothing to do with Russian collusion at all. But, tonight, we can report the deep state house of cards is tumbling and tonight also, we have more damning Strzok-Page texts that have been uncovered. We will share with you and the level of corruption we now see is beyond shocking.  And, tonight, I'm going to explain why Robert Mueller has no choice but to end his witch-hunt and how, if he doesn't, he will forever destroy great institutions in this country like the FBI, the DOJ, the CIA and more. The choice, the power is in his hands. Also tonight, we have an update to bring you on the Democrat's dirty tactics. Last-minute tactics to block the Kavanaugh confirmation. We have a brand new media blitz from Democratic savior, yes, the great one is back, Barack Obama. Yes, the anointed one. You're going to see what is a veiled cheap shot that he is taking at FOX News and talk radio.  So, sit tight, buckle up, it's time for tonight's Friday edition opening monologue.",

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "sentences": "Everybody should remember that these charges are old, old charges, completely predating 2016, the presidential election.  Now, the president's attorney, Rudy Giuliani, who will join us tonight in just a minute, he released a statement that says, quote, once again an investigation has concluded with a plea having nothing to do with President Trump or the Trump campaign. The reason? The president did nothing wrong.  Let me reiterate. Multiple sources have confirmed to me and others tonight despite what the media is reporting this guilty plea has nothing to do with the campaign, Trump or any collusion with Russia. We have numerous sources confirming to us tonight. Instead it has everything to do with Manafort not paying federal taxes on millions of dollars which he made as an unregistered lobbyist for Ukraine's former pro-Russian president. \"The Daily Caller\" is reporting tonight that Manafort's cooperation has nothing to do with Russia and collusion with the special counsel and has a lot more to do with the man by the name of Tony Podesta. He's the brother of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta. He's founder of a once very large lobbying organization called the Podesta Group. And according to the Manafort indictment, if the media would ever take the time read it, various employees of companies A and B understood that they were receiving direction from Manafort and, yes, that president of Ukraine. And The Daily Caller is reporting that company B is the Podesta Group. Politico is reporting that a letter from the Justice Department shows that Podesta knew that Manafort was working at the direction of the Ukrainian government, and even a New York fake news Times is reporting, quote: Mr. Manafort could also be instrumental in investigations now underway of lobbyists and influence brokers who work with him in Ukraine. Including, New York Times says it, Tony Podesta, a prominent Democratic lobbyist; Vin Weber, former Republican member of Congress and Greg Craig you may remember him from the impeachment days, former White House counsel and the administration of President Barack Obama and he represented Bill Clinton back in the day.   Now, we have reached out to Tony Podesta, his lawyers for comment. As of tonight, we have not heard back.  And that's not all. More bad news from Democrats coming out of the Manafort probe. Breaking just moments ago, we now have learned the federal prosecutors weighing whether or not to charge former Obama White House counsel Craig Greg, why? For failing to register as a foreign agent. Now, Mueller is moving away from the fabricated accusations of so-called Trump-Russia collusion and pursuing other leads might finally be a good sign that we might in this country possibly be returning to equal justice and equal application of our laws. This witch-hunt may actually be coming to an end sooner than we thought.  And there is one other reach that Mueller made this deal with Manafort today. Now, to be very blunt. There is now in this country a cancer. It is now growing on every single intelligence agency that we once respected in this country. We're now at a tipping point.  As a result of all of the corruption, it's taken a long time that we have exposed on this show, including all week this week, at the highest levels, corruption in the FBI, the DOJ, the CIA, and even corruption leading straight from Steele, Christopher Steele, to Bruce Ohr, right into Robert Mueller's office. Every single institution, main institutions of law enforcement in this country have been so tainted by corruption, so tainted by desire to take down the president, if Mueller cares at all about the future integrity of these institutions, this all needs to come to an end, because these once great institutions tonight are hanging in the balance. And we have all the evidence to prove that they have been corrupt. A deep state, based on a deep hatred and deep bias. Example after example of how these institutions broke the law, abused their power, how they have been proven corrupt at the highest levels of these institutions, using their power to favor one candidate over another, trying desperately to destroy Trump before the election, trying to destroy him after he was elected, trying to undo a presidential election in this country -- a duly elected president of we the people -- and in some cases real actual true allusion.  Remember, this all starts, can you all trace it back to Hillary Clinton, her campaign, funneling money, through a law firm, Fusion GPS taking the money, paying ex-foreign spy Christopher Steele. They put together a phony dossier, now, we know filled with Russian lies and prop began does, rumors and misinformation. Steele himself won't even stand by his own dossier under oath. He said, oh, no, I can't say if it's true or not. Maybe 50/50. That's when he was under the threat of perjury in interrogatory in Great Britain.   That dossier was then passed off to the highest levels of the DOJ and the FBI. And then after FBI people that we know, Comey, Strzok and others, after they put the fix in on the Clinton investigation. We know she broke the law. We know she violated the Espionage Act. We know she obstructed justice -- well, they exonerated their chosen candidate Hillary anyway.  Then they used her campaign op research from Russia that she paid for, the dirty dossier, as the basis of an investigation into so-called Trump-Russia collusion. None of them ever verified or corroborated, any of their contents. The FBI, the DOJ, used the dossier to obtain multiple FISA warrants against a Trump campaign associate. Now, we learned all week they were leaking the contents of that dossier to you, the American people before the election and influence the presidential election after the election, through 2017 to destroy a duly elected president in the Trump administration. These are facts. The evidence is overwhelming and incontrovertible. Mueller, are you paying attention? All of this based on Clinton bought and paid for Russian lies. The FBI, the DOJ, they covered for her. They spread her lies and now irreparable damage to some of the greatest institutions in American history are happening in the balance tonight. And tonight, yet again, we have brand new just unearthed text messages between Strzok and Page. By the way, I hear there's more coming next week, which show even more leaking to the press of nothing but dossier, phony lies and misinformation. We have been reporting all week that Strzok and Page, you know, that they have been doing this and we have the text messages to prove it.   By the way, CNN got late into the game tonight. Welcome aboard. You are only a year and a half too late. They actually uncovered the texts we have been telling you about all week. Welcome to actual journalism for five seconds, fake news CNN. Look at this text from Lisa Page to Peter Strzok, the date December 2016. At that point, President-elect Trump, both Trump haters wrote, quote: It will make your head spin to realize how many stories we played a personal role in. Next stop, text January 2017, it's even more damning. Sitting with Bill watching fake news CNN, I added that part, a ton more out. Hey, let me know when you can talk. We are discussing whether now that this is out, we use it as a pretext to go interview some people.   So, what you see here is an obvious effort from Strzok and Page not only to leak information, then used that leak information to justify further investigations and intimidation of other people, exactly what we have been telling you for over a year.  And there is more. Look at this text, April 27th, 2017, that shows even more damning evidence of leaking. It's going to be very apparent we cooperated and gave access. A lot for that article that I think is going to be very negative. Add all of this for what we have been reporting for a year and earlier this week where Strzok and Page were texting about media leak strategy. They were also working together on Russian interference op-ed in the lead up to the 2016 election.  We also learned, thanks to Catherine Herridge, the FBI sisters in the CIA that were, quote, leaking like mad after the election that were on a vendetta, well, that was the CIA, of course, leaking to the press, lying to numerous FISA court judges, colluding with a foreign spy with deep Russian ties, propagating Russian lies. This is real. This is serious. These are crimes -- by the way, if this special counsel won't investigate it -- we need a special counsel that will. If Mueller's inquiry wraps up without addressing any of this -- well, here's what Lindsey Graham had to say about this very topic. Take a look.",

They weren't investigators. This screams for a special counsel. So, I agree with Jeff.

The Department of Justice, our CIA, if we can't trust them, if we don't resolve this abuse of power, if people aren't held accountable. We will lose this constitutional republic. That's how serious this is. We are going to have a lot more reaction to the latest deep state developments. Gregg Jarrett and Sara Carter coming up. Rudy Giuliani coming up. But we also have update on the looming Supreme Court confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh. Last night, well, we first reported Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein's Hail Mary attempt at the last minute to destroy Kavanaugh's reputation. She issued what was a cryptic statement about alleged misconduct from Kavanaugh, so-called from an anonymous source that didn't want to be known dating back to when Kavanaugh was in high school -- in other words in the 1980s.  Feinstein said she reported the allegation to the FBI. Kavanaugh has been investigated 30 times by the FBI and has been investigated the whole time. And they are declining to investigate.  Now, this charge was made public after Kavanaugh's private hearings, after all of his private meetings with Democrats and months after Feinstein first learned about the so-called alleged misconduct. She also met privately with Kavanaugh and never asked him about it. Now, as \"The Wall Street Journal's\" Kimberley Strassel noted, Feinstein suddenly thought the charges were serious enough to refer to the FBI but apparently not serious enough to ask him a single question about it during his testimony. And Judge Kavanaugh is just days away from being affirmed, he reputed all of these claims, and he wrote, quote: I categorically, unequivocally deny this allegation. I did not do this back in high school or at any time. And by the way, there were 65 other women that he knew at that time that spoke up in favor of his character, including another person supposedly mentioned in the letter said it's not true.  What you are seeing from Feinstein is an embarrassing, blatant attempt to smear and slander the character of Judge Kavanaugh. And it's not the only sad moment from the Senate's Democrats' attempt to block Trump's Supreme Court nominee. Remember when Senator Cory Booker himself comparing himself to a Roman gladiator Spartacus for threatening to release the documents to the public except he was told he could release them because they were already released.

It's what the Russians do to other countries. But, instead, it appears that the FBI and possibly members of the CIA were doing it right here in the United States, to their own government. So, there needs to be a special counsel, they said. There needs to be a thorough investigation. Lindsey Graham is right. There needs to be somebody outside of the DOJ to investigate this because the one thing we can't have in our country is have our own agencies, agencies that we entrust ourselves to, our lives to, actually working covertly against their own government and against the people of the United States.",

Started getting rain 30 hours ago and the storm has moved 150 miles is all in the last 30 hours. So, an incredibly slow-moving storm. You can see on the radar picture, not moving much at all. We've got flooding going on. You see these gauges. Here is our big concern -- these are rivers that are at major flooding. That's the purple, moderate flooding is the red. Take a look at what happens over the next five days, Sean, it completely gets major flooding going on down across South Carolina, North Carolina, in across parts of Virginia, because of the rain that's going to fall. That's going to go down all the rivers and we're going to be seeing a lot of rivers well above their record levels that they have ever seen and likely stay that way for a good part of say, five to six days. Here's a satellite image from this. You see right there, the center has moved in across parts of South Carolina, Myrtle Beach still an offshore flow. So, water going away from the ocean, but anywhere to the east of that still seeing this onshore flow. That's where it came on shore 7:15 this morning. We're 14 hours away and it's moved 60 miles. We're also still seeing that energy up across areas towards the outer banks and take a look at this. A lot of areas, Sean, over 20 inches so far probably another 20 inches to go before we are done.",

I talked to a captain who flies these waters, actually he's boat is normally tied up dry dock. And he said there are part of the waters around here, those rivers upstream that Rick was talking about that people can't even get to that he said were absolutely devastated so far. And we haven't even begun to really see the high water that is about to come in the next couple of day us. It's very easy in a time like this when you stand out the storm sort of passed or you are between bands, you go, oh, well, it doesn't look so bad. You know, the docks behind you aren't trashed and you then take about another 24 to 48 hours and realize the lives that have been totally upended by this storm. It is going to be extensive damage. The damage will continue now over out next couple of days before we can get to a lot of the areas that are hardest hit. Obviously, we've already had a number of fatalities here. The oak trees so famous in North Carolina turned deadly when they snapped and flew into a house. It's also really hampering a lot of the rescue efforts because the ground has become so saturated by this rain and will continue to become so saturated that even the wind we are feeling now that ordinarily wouldn't be that terrible is enough to snap and uproot some of these oak trees, they fall over. Totally block traffic. Each one of those trees cleared before fire, police, fire crews come back in and also cell phone tower crews to clean stuff up -- Sean.",

Kavanaugh says quoting, \"I categorically and unequivocally deny this allegation. I did not do this back in high school or at any time.\" Republicans are rallying behind Kavanaugh. As you mentioned Senate judiciary Chair Chuck Grassley today released that letter signed by 65 women who knew Brett Kavanaugh back in high school defending him as a good person. And while some liberal groups are calling on Kavanaugh to withdraw, Democratic senators at least so far have been mostly quiet about the issue, so two have swing vote Republican senators, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska.

Coastal areas have been devastated by flooding and the rain is not stopping any time soon. And coming up, we're going to bring you live reports from the ground. But, first, we have a lot of breaking news today in the media as most of it wrong and they're not covering the important stuff. Paul Manafort did agree to cooperate with the office of special counsel. But, despite what you are hearing from the destroy Trump left wing press, the plea deal, it doesn't have to do with the president at all, nothing to do with the 2016 campaign at all, nothing to do with Russian collusion at all. But, tonight, we can report the deep state house of cards is tumbling and tonight also, we have more damning Strzok-Page texts that have been uncovered. We will share with you and the level of corruption we now see is beyond shocking. And, tonight, I'm going to explain why Robert Mueller has no choice but to end his witch-hunt and how, if he doesn't, he will forever destroy great institutions in this country like the FBI, the DOJ, the CIA and more. The choice, the power is in his hands. Also tonight, we have an update to bring you on the Democrat's dirty tactics. Last-minute tactics to block the Kavanaugh confirmation. We have a brand new media blitz from Democratic savior, yes, the great one is back, Barack Obama. Yes, the anointed one.

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Everybody should remember that these charges are old, old charges, completely predating 2016, the presidential election. Now, the president's attorney, Rudy Giuliani, who will join us tonight in just a minute, he released a statement that says, quote, once again an investigation has concluded with a plea having nothing to do with President Trump or the Trump campaign. The reason? The president did nothing wrong. Let me reiterate. Multiple sources have confirmed to me and others tonight despite what the media is reporting this guilty plea has nothing to do with the campaign, Trump or any collusion with Russia. We have numerous sources confirming to us tonight. Instead it has everything to do with Manafort not paying federal taxes on millions of dollars which he made as an unregistered lobbyist for Ukraine's former pro-Russian president. \"The Daily Caller\" is reporting tonight that Manafort's cooperation has nothing to do with Russia and collusion with the special counsel and has a lot more to do with the man by the name of Tony Podesta. He's the brother of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta. He's founder of a once very large lobbying organization called the Podesta Group. And according to the Manafort indictment, if the media would ever take the time read it, various employees of companies A and B understood that they were receiving direction from Manafort and, yes, that president of Ukraine."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "And The Daily Caller is reporting that company B is the Podesta Group. Politico is reporting that a letter from the Justice Department shows that Podesta knew that Manafort was working at the direction of the Ukrainian government, and even a New York fake news Times is reporting, quote",
      "utterance": "Mr. Manafort could also be instrumental in investigations now underway of lobbyists and influence brokers who work with him in Ukraine. Including, New York Times says it, Tony Podesta, a prominent Democratic lobbyist; Vin Weber, former Republican member of Congress and Greg Craig you may remember him from the impeachment days, former White House counsel and the administration of President Barack Obama and he represented Bill Clinton back in the day. Now, we have reached out to Tony Podesta, his lawyers for comment. As of tonight, we have not heard back. And that's not all. More bad news from Democrats coming out of the Manafort probe. Breaking just moments ago, we now have learned the federal prosecutors weighing whether or not to charge former Obama White House counsel Craig Greg, why? For failing to register as a foreign agent. Now, Mueller is moving away from the fabricated accusations of so-called Trump-Russia collusion and pursuing other leads might finally be a good sign that we might in this country possibly be returning to equal justice and equal application of our laws. This witch-hunt may actually be coming to an end sooner than we thought. And there is one other reach that Mueller made this deal with Manafort today. Now, to be very blunt. There is now in this country a cancer. It is now growing on every single intelligence agency that we once respected in this country. We're now at a tipping point. As a result of all of the corruption, it's taken a long time that we have exposed on this show, including all week this week, at the highest levels, corruption in the FBI, the DOJ, the CIA, and even corruption leading straight from Steele, Christopher Steele, to Bruce Ohr, right into Robert Mueller's office. Every single institution, main institutions of law enforcement in this country have been so tainted by corruption, so tainted by desire to take down the president, if Mueller cares at all about the future integrity of these institutions, this all needs to come to an end, because these once great institutions tonight are hanging in the balance. And we have all the evidence to prove that they have been corrupt. A deep state, based on a deep hatred and deep bias. Example after example of how these institutions broke the law, abused their power, how they have been proven corrupt at the highest levels of these institutions, using their power to favor one candidate over another, trying desperately to destroy Trump before the election, trying to destroy him after he was elected, trying to undo a presidential election in this country -- a duly elected president of we the people -- and in some cases real actual true allusion. Remember, this all starts, can you all trace it back to Hillary Clinton, her campaign, funneling money, through a law firm, Fusion GPS taking the money, paying ex-foreign spy Christopher Steele. They put together a phony dossier, now, we know filled with Russian lies and prop began does, rumors and misinformation. Steele himself won't even stand by his own dossier under oath. He said, oh, no, I can't say if it's true or not. Maybe 50/50. That's when he was under the threat of perjury in interrogatory in Great Britain. That dossier was then passed off to the highest levels of the DOJ and the FBI. And then after FBI people that we know, Comey, Strzok and others, after they put the fix in on the Clinton investigation. We know she broke the law. We know she violated the Espionage Act. We know she obstructed justice -- well, they exonerated their chosen candidate Hillary anyway. Then they used her campaign op research from Russia that she paid for, the dirty dossier, as the basis of an investigation into so-called Trump-Russia collusion. None of them ever verified or corroborated, any of their contents. The FBI, the DOJ, used the dossier to obtain multiple FISA warrants against a Trump campaign associate. Now, we learned all week they were leaking the contents of that dossier to you, the American people before the election and influence the presidential election after the election, through 2017 to destroy a duly elected president in the Trump administration. These are facts. The evidence is overwhelming and incontrovertible. Mueller, are you paying attention? All of this based on Clinton bought and paid for Russian lies. The FBI, the DOJ, they covered for her. They spread her lies and now irreparable damage to some of the greatest institutions in American history are happening in the balance tonight. And tonight, yet again, we have brand new just unearthed text messages between Strzok and Page. By the way, I hear there's more coming next week, which show even more leaking to the press of nothing but dossier, phony lies and misinformation. We have been reporting all week that Strzok and Page, you know, that they have been doing this and we have the text messages to prove it. By the way, CNN got late into the game tonight. Welcome aboard. You are only a year and a half too late. They actually uncovered the texts we have been telling you about all week. Welcome to actual journalism for five seconds, fake news CNN. Look at this text from Lisa Page to Peter Strzok, the date December 2016. At that point, President-elect Trump, both Trump haters wrote, quote: It will make your head spin to realize how many stories we played a personal role in. Next stop, text January 2017, it's even more damning. Sitting with Bill watching fake news CNN, I added that part, a ton more out. Hey, let me know when you can talk. We are discussing whether now that this is out, we use it as a pretext to go interview some people. So, what you see here is an obvious effort from Strzok and Page not only to leak information, then used that leak information to justify further investigations and intimidation of other people, exactly what we have been telling you for over a year. And there is more. Look at this text, April 27th, 2017, that shows even more damning evidence of leaking. It's going to be very apparent we cooperated and gave access. A lot for that article that I think is going to be very negative. Add all of this for what we have been reporting for a year and earlier this week where Strzok and Page were texting about media leak strategy. They were also working together on Russian interference op-ed in the lead up to the 2016 election. We also learned, thanks to Catherine Herridge, the FBI sisters in the CIA that were, quote, leaking like mad after the election that were on a vendetta, well, that was the CIA, of course, leaking to the press, lying to numerous FISA court judges, colluding with a foreign spy with deep Russian ties, propagating Russian lies. This is real. This is serious. These are crimes -- by the way, if this special counsel won't investigate it -- we need a special counsel that will. If Mueller's inquiry wraps up without addressing any of this -- well, here's what Lindsey Graham had to say about this very topic. Take a look."

I'm going to send a letter today to Rosenstein. These new text messages from Strzok and page about leaking information about the FISA warrant process to the media is just one in a series of events that spring for a special counsel. How much more has to be uncovered at the Department of Justice regarding a political agenda. The Department of Justice and the FBI were political operatives when it came to Trump. They weren't investigators. This screams for a special counsel. So, I agree with Jeff. He shouldn't beat on Sessions personally, but I don't know why Rosenstein who is in charge of this process doesn't see what I see an out-of-control Department of Justice and FBI and what's good for the goose is good for the gander.

That's how serious this is. We are going to have a lot more reaction to the latest deep state developments. Gregg Jarrett and Sara Carter coming up. Rudy Giuliani coming up. But we also have update on the looming Supreme Court confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh. Last night, well, we first reported Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein's Hail Mary attempt at the last minute to destroy Kavanaugh's reputation. She issued what was a cryptic statement about alleged misconduct from Kavanaugh, so-called from an anonymous source that didn't want to be known dating back to when Kavanaugh was in high school -- in other words in the 1980s. Feinstein said she reported the allegation to the FBI. Kavanaugh has been investigated 30 times by the FBI and has been investigated the whole time. And they are declining to investigate. Now, this charge was made public after Kavanaugh's private hearings, after all of his private meetings with Democrats and months after Feinstein first learned about the so-called alleged misconduct. She also met privately with Kavanaugh and never asked him about it. Now, as \"The Wall Street Journal's\" Kimberley Strassel noted, Feinstein suddenly thought the charges were serious enough to refer to the FBI but apparently not serious enough to ask him a single question about it during his testimony. And Judge Kavanaugh is just days away from being affirmed, he reputed all of these claims, and he wrote, quote: I categorically, unequivocally deny this allegation. I did not do this back in high school or at any time. And by the way, there were 65 other women that he knew at that time that spoke up in favor of his character, including another person supposedly mentioned in the letter said it's not true. What you are seeing from Feinstein is an embarrassing, blatant attempt to smear and slander the character of Judge Kavanaugh. And it's not the only sad moment from the Senate's Democrats' attempt to block Trump's Supreme Court nominee. Remember when Senator Cory Booker himself comparing himself to a Roman gladiator Spartacus for threatening to release the documents to the public except he was told he could release them because they were already released. Watch this."

Those were your words to President Trump in 2016. In 53 days, you, the American people, you have the power, you get to decide. You'll get the government you deserve. That means whether or not Obama's cronies get their power back or whether the Trump agenda continues with its success. Here now with reaction to all these breaking news tonight, the author of The New York Times bestseller, \"The Russian Hoax\", he is a Fox News legal analyst, Gregg Jarrett. He's number one on the New York Times list. And Fox News investigative reporter and contributor, Sara Carter. Sara, this is now five straight days in a row and I'm told more Strzok-Page messages. There's over 50,000 of them, are coming out next week that are even more damning than the reveals about the media leak strategy and everything else. Here's my question. Am I right, that tonight, the institutions that are so great in the minds of most Americans, including my own, the FBI, the Department of Justice, the CIA, the intel community, are they hanging in the balance based on the abuse of power of some at the highest level that now we have incontrovertible evidence about?"

This is hanging in the balance because all of this evidence, this isn't just circumstantial anymore. We are actually seeing the facts on its face point to one thing and one thing only. That this was a deception operation from the very beginning -- and let me explain that a little bit. A deception operation is what CIA is trained to do overseas. It's what the Russians do to other countries. But, instead, it appears that the FBI and possibly members of the CIA were doing it right here in the United States, to their own government. So, there needs to be a special counsel, they said. There needs to be a thorough investigation. Lindsey Graham is right. There needs to be somebody outside of the DOJ to investigate this because the one thing we can't have in our country is have our own agencies, agencies that we entrust ourselves to, our lives to, actually working covertly against their own government and against the people of the United States."

We've got all these people, they all have one thing in common -- they hate Trump. And it goes right into the special counsel's office himself because Steele texting Bruce Ohr, did you get my information over to the special counsel, your contacts there? So, it's the institutions of law enforcement. The FBI, the DOJ, the CIA, the intel community and the special counsel's office, how can anybody in this country have faith in the rule of law now that all of those institutions have been tainted not by rank and file but by the highest people with the most power?"

Strzok and Page are obsessed and transfixed with their quote/unquote personal role in leaking and shaping stories and then they are bragging that now we can use this as a pretext to interview people. It's not only mendacious and devious but to the extent that they were leaking highly classified information and they surely were, it is a crime. I'm no fan of a special counsel."

They built a narrative and then they tried to support that narrative. When I tell you this is a deception operation, that means they thought about this from the beginning.

Started getting rain 30 hours ago and the storm has moved 150 miles is all in the last 30 hours. So, an incredibly slow-moving storm. You can see on the radar picture, not moving much at all. We've got flooding going on. You see these gauges. Here is our big concern -- these are rivers that are at major flooding. That's the purple, moderate flooding is the red. Take a look at what happens over the next five days, Sean, it completely gets major flooding going on down across South Carolina, North Carolina, in across parts of Virginia, because of the rain that's going to fall. That's going to go down all the rivers and we're going to be seeing a lot of rivers well above their record levels that they have ever seen and likely stay that way for a good part of say, five to six days. Here's a satellite image from this. You see right there, the center has moved in across parts of South Carolina, Myrtle Beach still an offshore flow. So, water going away from the ocean, but anywhere to the east of that still seeing this onshore flow. That's where it came on shore 7:15 this morning. We're 14 hours away and it's moved 60 miles. We're also still seeing that energy up across areas towards the outer banks and take a look at this. A lot of areas, Sean, over 20 inches so far probably another 20 inches to go before we are done."

Rick was talking about 24 inches of rain in Morehead City. We have been outside for most of those 24 inches of rain and effects have been devastating. I talked to a captain who flies these waters, actually he's boat is normally tied up dry dock. And he said there are part of the waters around here, those rivers upstream that Rick was talking about that people can't even get to that he said were absolutely devastated so far. And we haven't even begun to really see the high water that is about to come in the next couple of day us. It's very easy in a time like this when you stand out the storm sort of passed or you are between bands, you go, oh, well, it doesn't look so bad. You know, the docks behind you aren't trashed and you then take about another 24 to 48 hours and realize the lives that have been totally upended by this storm. It is going to be extensive damage. The damage will continue now over out next couple of days before we can get to a lot of the areas that are hardest hit. Obviously, we've already had a number of fatalities here. The oak trees so famous in North Carolina turned deadly when they snapped and flew into a house. It's also really hampering a lot of the rescue efforts because the ground has become so saturated by this rain and will continue to become so saturated that even the wind we are feeling now that ordinarily wouldn't be that terrible is enough to snap and uproot some of these oak trees, they fall over. Totally block traffic. Each one of those trees cleared before fire, police, fire crews come back in and also cell phone tower crews to clean stuff up -- Sean."

Now I know that because I have been privy to a lot of facts I can't repeat. But the reality is no evidence of collusion. All you had to do was look at the plea. The plea is to crimes that have to do with Manafort's past, no involvement with Trump. No involvement with the campaign. No involvement with Russia.

That they were involved in spreading propaganda, misinformation through her bought and paid for dossier that they also used to get a FISA warrant.

Never revealed properly to the court by the way, completely fraudulent FISA wires leaked illegally, now admitted totally crime, as Gregg Jarrett points out both in his book and now with you.

He is talking about praying he doesn't get exposed. He's also talking about fire walls holdings. Strzok and Page talk about and insurance policy.

Though it's unclear how many senators have actually read it. The accusation is from an unnamed woman who claims Brett Kavanaugh tried to force himself on her in a locked room at high school party some 35 years ago. Kavanaugh says quoting, \"I categorically and unequivocally deny this allegation. I did not do this back in high school or at any time.\" Republicans are rallying behind Kavanaugh. As you mentioned Senate judiciary Chair Chuck Grassley today released that letter signed by 65 women who knew Brett Kavanaugh back in high school defending him as a good person. And while some liberal groups are calling on Kavanaugh to withdraw, Democratic senators at least so far have been mostly quiet about the issue, so two have swing vote Republican senators, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska.

    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "The left as is common practice they will use anything, everything to try to attack President Trump. Now they are even using the hurricane that's been hammering the Carolinas to criticize the president. Saying he complicit with the hurricane. And it gets worse than that. Take a look."

      "utterance": "Here with reaction Salem nationals -- nationally syndicated radio host Larry Elder, the author of the bestseller coming out \"Why We Fight,\" our friend, Fox News national security strategist Dr. Sebastian Gorka. Larry, I guess he is complicit. He has such a close relationship with God that he conspired with God and maybe Putin, too, to build a hurricane that's going to hurt innocent people. That's how sick they've gotten."

    {
      "speaker": "LARRY ELDER, SYNDICATED RADIO SHOW HOST",
      "utterance": "Well, Sean, this is all about portraying Trump not only as incompetent, not only a climate change denier but as racist. Remember what they did to George W. Bush, Kanye West during a fundraiser says George W. Bush doesn't care about black people. Representative Barney Fyffe called George Bush's response to Katrina ethnic cleansing by inaction. And just recently one of the pundits on CNN said that if 3,000 white people had died during the Puerto Rican storm Trump would not have called that a success. Wink, wink, nod, nod. Trump is a racist, he only cares about white people. It is absolutely outrageous but that's what the left does."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Well, just like in the election, this is a white lash. I mean, that was the reaction on fake news CNN. You remember well, Dr. Gorka, because I think you compared them to the Cartoon Network at the time."

      "speaker": "SEBASTIAN GORKA, FOX NEWS NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGIST",
      "utterance": "I did and CNN and Anderson Cooper will never forgive me but hey, ratings are ratings. Yes, they are desperate, Sean, because there is no evidence of collusion, even Bob Woodward's book couldn't find any evidence, so now Donald Trump is colluding with God and with the gods of weather. It's absurd. And every quote you just had, all of those clips, none of those people, none of them know Donald Trump like you know him, like I know him. He is driven above all else by one thing, Sean, by keeping Americans alive and keeping them safe. Whether it's crushing ISIS, whether it's staunching the flow of MS-13 across our border, and stopping the opioid epidemic."

Do you think people that voted for Trump, are they going to go out and they are going to protect the House and Senate from Nancy Pelosi and company. Larry, we will start with you."

The first day when the Democrats take control of the House, they are going to begin impeachment proceedings. I have told you before, Sean, I know I'm the minority on this. I think there will be 20 or 30 insane Democrats who won't impeach. Because they realize if you impeach Trump for petty reasons or political reasons, because you don't like his style. Then the next guy or gal who comes in could be impeached because we don't like his or her policies or his or her style--"

The issue is Donald Trump doesn't owe anything to anybody that's why he's dangerous. He doesn't owe the GOP anything. He doesn't owe the media anything. He doesn't owe the Democrats. he doesn't owe anybody. He is there for one reason, to represent the Americans who believe that we should be a great nation again. And, in 53 days, it is all at stake. The economy, the national security we've gained. Our international relations. It is that serious. And Donald Trump, his agenda is on the ballot when you go to vote at the midterms."

More records on unemployment than we have ever set. Thank you both. We appreciate it. When we come back, another update on Florence and the damage the storm has left in its wake. It's severe. Our thoughts and prayers are with everybody. We'll continue."

      "speaker": "LELAND VITTERT, FOX NEWS ANCHOR",
      "utterance": "Yes. Well, you can sleep later, Sean. Right now, frankly we don't have it nearly as bad as anybody else does in this storm. You know, you said Morehead City. Now we are at 24 inches of rain and counting as more rain continues to come down. Certainly when we left you last night at this time, the conditions were far worse. So things are improving, but it is telling how slow they are to improve. Normally it would only have been about 8 to 12 hours of really intense conditions. We have had 24 hours of it. And that's one of the conditions that this storm is going to be so destructive, it may not have the wind speed but it certainly has that unbelievable amount of flooding and rainfall. It has the storm surge and it sticks around for so long that this is there is this exponential effect. And we've seen that as we just drove a couple of miles around here. That's as far as we could go as in terms of looking at the damage."
