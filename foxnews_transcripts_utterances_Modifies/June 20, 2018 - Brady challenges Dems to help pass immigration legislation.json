That's the hope anyway. But it's not going away easily.  As I told you, the president even signing this executive order today that will stop this treatment of separating kids from their parents along the border.   The ACLU is complaining. Some prominent Democrats are complaining, even though the president has done exactly what they wanted him to do, wield the power of his pen, in this case a felt tip pen, and end this process. It's not good enough. The read from the House Ways and Means Chair Kevin Brady. Congressman, he can't win for love or money, but maybe the feeling seems to be that he's got to do more. And the pressure is on Republicans to do just that, more, and have a comprehensive deal complete, and soon.   What do you think?",

And, tomorrow, if Democrats are really interested in keep families together and finding a good solution for the dreamers, tomorrow, about this time, they will have a chance to join Republicans to do this.  I think, look, this a very, I think, strong bill. It shuts the back door of illegal immigration, starts to fix the front door of legal immigration, which needs it, keeps the families together, and finds a path to legal status for dreamers who earn it, who work, get an education or serve in the military.   I think this is a very strong bill. And I'm challenging Democrats to join us in making this the law.",

Look, six months, it's hard to find an economic measure that isn't better significantly now than it was before tax reform.  And the big news, I think, today was our manufacturers. In America, they used to be the most pessimistic about the future. Now they have the highest optimism as of today in their 20-year history. And more than seven out of 10 are either hiring, raising wages for their workers, or planning to invest more. So, clearly, America's back for our manufacturers. The tax codes and more balanced regulation, that's the reason for it.",
