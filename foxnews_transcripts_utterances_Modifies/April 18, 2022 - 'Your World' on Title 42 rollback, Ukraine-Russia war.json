But now there is a renewed sense that there may be able -- there may be a possibility that Democrats can get enough of them on board to pass a slimmed-down or skinny version of what was the president's Build Back Better agenda. Senator Elizabeth Warren saying in an op-ed today that it is mandatory for the president to try to do something, because, if he does not, she does not see Democrats holding the majority in Congress in the midterms in November. And White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain also signaled that there may be some negotiations going on for a revised reconciliation bill headed into the summer and fall. Inflation, though, has been a top concern of some Democrats, like Senator Joe Manchin, and one of the reasons why he has been a roadblock to passing Build Back Better through reconciliation. But it's not just on some Democrats' mind. It's also on voters' mind. Even today, we have seen how inflation is impacting one of the most beloved events in the spring here at the White House, the White House Easter Egg Roll. Today, the president hosted the annual event after a two-year break during the pandemic. And we found it is more expensive than before because of inflation. Today's event featured over 14,000 hand-dyed Easter eggs. A dozen eggs today are 85 percent more expensive compared to what they were priced at just one year ago. And it is price spikes like that, that are a drag on Biden's approval rating. You can see from this chart, as inflation goes up, President Biden's approval rating goes down. And the White House knows that it is a problem for them in the polls, but they're pointing at Republicans for not having an answer to the problem.",

So the Biden administration started off initially saying it was a high- class problem, we should be happy, it's a good thing. Then they said it was transitory.

And these, of course, designations are made after careful review. So while we have those authorities, I don't have any update on that or prediction of that. That assessment would be made by the State Department. What I would note, which I think is important, is that for the countries that have been designated state sponsors of terrorism -- so I named a couple of them for you -- that the four main categories of sanctions that result from designation under these authorities include restrictions on U.S. foreign assistance, a ban on defense exports and sales, certain controls over exports of dual-use items, and other financial restrictions. And what we've already done to date is, of course, impose significant financial sanctions, export controls, and curtailed restrictions on financial assistance. So when you're thinking about the impact, these are already a lot of steps that we've taken. But I have nothing to predict on that front.

We will show you what we're talking about. Take a look at this graphic right here. What you're looking at are hits on the TSDB. That is the Terrorist Screening Database, which is compiled by the FBI.

But keep in mind, those are only the ones they know about. You heard Peter Doocy press Jen Psaki about the got-aways. Well, if we can pull up this file video of runners down here at the border, Peter is exactly right, because CBP sources tell us, in the last six months alone, there have been more than 300,000 known got-aways at our border, more than 62,000 in the month of March alone.

They lost the battles of Kyiv, of Chernihiv, and of Sumy in the north, and the Ukrainians one. So the Russians have refocused in the area where they have made some gains, very hard-fought. And they're going to reinforce that in the east and the southeast, and then presumably further down around the port of Mariupol, when those defenders, incredibly resolute, really the Alamo of Ukraine in many respects, when that ultimately falls. And his discussion of shaping, normally, for us, that would also include preparatory fires. It would include a variety of positioning of logistical assets, medical evacuation, resupply, ammunition caches, refueling assets, and so forth. And they're doing quite a bit of that. But they have struggled, as Admiral Kirby noted. And I know him well from the war years in the past. They have struggled with the logistical aspects of this, as, as he rightly noted, they have struggled with so much else, including air-ground, including combined arms affects, where you use not just tanks, but infantry, engineers, artillery, mortars, and so forth all together, protected by air defense.

I have been that part of Ukraine pre-COVID, certainly when I visited the front lines in the Donbass. It is much more advantageous terrain to the kinds of offensive operations that we presume that the Russians will want to conduct, again, armor, infantry fighting vehicles and so forth. The question is whether or not they're going to be able to go off-road onto the fields, or whether they will still be muddy, as they reportedly are right now. And, in that case, the -- even the track vehicles will get mired in those fields. And that would be very, very helpful for Ukraine, which has to stop these forces in order to then hit them with these sophisticated shoulder-launched anti-tank guided missiles, the Javelins, take out their aircraft with the Stingers, employ a variety of the other systems. And I'm very, frankly, enthusiastic about the addition of 700 of the so- called Switchblade drones to the list that's being provided. These are -- could be game-changers, because, when the soldiers get out of their vehicles, these are loitering munitions. They're launched by Ukrainian forces out of a tube. They're quite intuitive to use. There's an iPad like device that the operator looks at. And he picks the target. It's circling above. It's electric, so you can't hear it. And then it just takes out that target. So it is literally silent, but deadly. What we're sending are the anti-personnel versions. I'd love to see a lot of the armor version, but they're literally just not in our arsenal. And let me just highlight something that is a challenge for us. I think we'd like to provide a great deal more for Ukraine. The challenge is that we do not have the ammunition that they need. It is Eastern Bloc ammunition.

Yes, we had our eye on Twitter shares today because this is the first day that trading resumed since markets were closed on Friday, the day that the poison pill defense to Musk's takeover bid was announced. Some had concerns that we'd see volatility after that poison pill announcement. But, today, we are seeing a good deal of resilience in Twitter. You can see shares up more than 7.5, closing higher than $48 a share. This is still lower than Musk's bid of roughly $54 a share. And that adds to the debate on whether Musk's bid fully reflects the company's value. And, for now, it seems that Elon Musk shows no signs of backing down on his bid takeover on Twitter, as he says that he would pay board members nothing if he were successful. Musk claims taking the board member salaries down to zero would save shareholders about $3 million a year. Board members are paid between $250,000 and $300,000 a year. But in this battle for control of Twitter, employees of the social media giant are also weighing in. According to The New York Post, an internal survey of Twitter employees shows that 78 percent believe that Musk does not have the best interests of Twitter and its shareholders in mind. Now, the Twitter board, for its part, has not responded to Musk's takeover bid just yet. And CEO Parag Agrawal says he's not sure when a response from the board is going to come -- Charles.",

But now there is a renewed sense that there may be able -- there may be a possibility that Democrats can get enough of them on board to pass a slimmed-down or skinny version of what was the president's Build Back Better agenda. Senator Elizabeth Warren saying in an op-ed today that it is mandatory for the president to try to do something, because, if he does not, she does not see Democrats holding the majority in Congress in the midterms in November. And White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain also signaled that there may be some negotiations going on for a revised reconciliation bill headed into the summer and fall. Inflation, though, has been a top concern of some Democrats, like Senator Joe Manchin, and one of the reasons why he has been a roadblock to passing Build Back Better through reconciliation. But it's not just on some Democrats' mind. It's also on voters' mind. Even today, we have seen how inflation is impacting one of the most beloved events in the spring here at the White House, the White House Easter Egg Roll. Today, the president hosted the annual event after a two-year break during the pandemic. And we found it is more expensive than before because of inflation. Today's event featured over 14,000 hand-dyed Easter eggs. A dozen eggs today are 85 percent more expensive compared to what they were priced at just one year ago. And it is price spikes like that, that are a drag on Biden's approval rating. You can see from this chart, as inflation goes up, President Biden's approval rating goes down. And the White House knows that it is a problem for them in the polls, but they're pointing at Republicans for not having an answer to the problem."

I had 17 county meetings last week in Iowa. And inflation came up at every one of them. I think it's one of the main reasons, maybe the main reason, that Biden's poll numbers are so bad. And I would think that they would start realizing that, when people like Larry Summers, former secretary of Treasury in the Democrat administration, says that, way back a year ago, on January, we had already spent too much money and the economy was turning around before Christmas 2020, that you're going to have inflation.

So the Biden administration started off initially saying it was a high- class problem, we should be happy, it's a good thing. Then they said it was transitory. And then they blamed a few other things before they pivoted to Putin. And now they're saying, well, what's the Republicans' plan? So they're trying to throw the ball back in your court.

Just think what that does to the morale of people that have been giving us cheap energy. We were an energy-independent nation January 19. And then, January 20 of 2021, we become energy-dependent.

Besides, if you assume that, you have got to have some responsibility for paying that off. That's a choice you made. It was a free choice you made. And I think, when it comes to education, everybody ought to have some skin in the game if you're going to do that."

The court can concludes that the mask mandate exceeds the CDC's statutory authority and violates the procedures required for agency rulemaking under the APA.

In terms of how long it will take to get up drilling because of the court action, I don't have any assessment on that from here.

One of the reasons that this was so troubling to him is because he is so committed to that objective as President. And we continue to propose -- have continued to propose a historic investment in addressing the climate crisis, something that we will continue to discuss with Congress.

That's in direct contrast with our predecessor who withheld hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid from Ukraine, including Javelins, which Mr. McCarthy, who was critical of us in this moment, defended at the time as, quote, the rightful thing to do because he claimed people believed there was corruption in the Zelenskyy administration.

I also wanted to note a couple of comments for anyone with questions -- which probably isn't anyone in this room, but maybe -- whether these sanctions are having an impact. One is by the chairwoman of the Russian national -- central bank, who said these sanctions are -- quote, will now begin to increasingly affect the real sectors of the economy, and, quote, practically every product. She also said that, quote, that sanctions are being tightened almost every day, and, quote, the period during which the economy can live on reserves is finite, meaning these are really having the squeeze that the President, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Treasury, and others have conveyed.

What our focus continues to be on is providing Ukraine, the Ukrainian government, and Ukrainian leaders a historic amount of security assistance -- assistance that's been adapted based on their needs and their successes on the grounds. And, obviously, that can be attributed largely to the courage and the bravery of Ukrainian leaders. But the second reason is because of the military assistance we provided. I would note, because I know this is an understandable question you all have asked, that if anyone were to go -- there's no plans for the President to go, so let me just reiterate that -- but we would not outline from here or anywhere from the government who, if, and when for security reasons.

      "utterance": "So that is a process that -- it's an authority that obviously exists within the government and at the State Department. And in order, just broadly speaking, for any country to be designated a state sponsor of terror -- and there's only three - North Korea, Sudan, and Iran -- at this point in time, just for your full perspective -- the Secretary of State would need to determine the government of that country has repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism. And these, of course, designations are made after careful review. So while we have those authorities, I don't have any update on that or prediction of that. That assessment would be made by the State Department. What I would note, which I think is important, is that for the countries that have been designated state sponsors of terrorism -- so I named a couple of them for you -- that the four main categories of sanctions that result from designation under these authorities include restrictions on U.S. foreign assistance, a ban on defense exports and sales, certain controls over exports of dual-use items, and other financial restrictions. And what we've already done to date is, of course, impose significant financial sanctions, export controls, and curtailed restrictions on financial assistance. So when you're thinking about the impact, these are already a lot of steps that we've taken. But I have nothing to predict on that front. That's a -- that's a process that would have to be reviewed through the State Department."

And, Ron, let me just start where -- with that last question that was presented on those mounted officers who were accused of whipping the migrants who were attempting to come into the country. The photographs didn't look great. But everyone there said that was a misjudgment. Nevertheless, President Biden had harsh words for them. So did Jen Psaki and others.

They neglected their duty to the Constitution to go on the side of wokeness and to blame agents who were put in an impossible situation to try to help control an out-of-control border in Del Rio, when thousands and thousands of Haitians elected to cross the border all at the same time. We saw those images. The reporter who took that image said no one was struck physically. And here we are. They're still neglecting to praise the Border Patrol for the job that they did. And there's -- they don't want to exonerate them. They said they said they were going to bring charges, that they were going to pay for what they did.

That was a public health measure that's in the law. It exists. It's existed since, I think, the '70s. It was employed here to protect us from the pandemic. And yet they don't want that -- they gave everybody -- all the smugglers a six-week head-start and saying they're not going to do that anymore.

And just a few moments ago, we heard Peter Doocy press Jen Psaki about these CBP records that FOX News has obtained via a Freedom of Information Act requests that show at least 23 known or suspected terrorists were caught at our Southern border here last year. We will show you what we're talking about. Take a look at this graphic right here. What you're looking at are hits on the TSDB. That is the Terrorist Screening Database, which is compiled by the FBI. And what you're seeing is a sector-by-sector breakdown of where these hits came across, four in San Diego Sector, four in El Centro, two in Yuma, two in Tucson, three in El Paso, four in Del Rio, and four in the Rio Grande Valley Sector, again, totaling up to 23 in total. But keep in mind, those are only the ones they know about. You heard Peter Doocy press Jen Psaki about the got-aways. Well, if we can pull up this file video of runners down here at the border, Peter is exactly right, because CBP sources tell us, in the last six months alone, there have been more than 300,000 known got-aways at our border, more than 62,000 in the month of March alone. That's more than 2,000 a day, as Peter mentioned.

This sort of thing happens every single day out here in Del Rio Sector, as well as down in Brownsville down in the Rio Grande Valley Sector. And, Charles, back out here live, what you just witnessed there, that is one of the reasons why Texas Governor Greg Abbott has started shipping these buses to Washington, D.C. He says these local communities out here, very small communities, are sick of these mass releases. They can't handle anymore.

      "utterance": "Well, really, it just comes down to preparing, Charles. And good to be with you. This could be a pivotal moment in the war in Ukraine, as the Russians obviously gave up on the effort to seize Kyiv, topple the government and replace President Zelenskyy with a pro-Russian figure. They lost the battles of Kyiv, of Chernihiv, and of Sumy in the north, and the Ukrainians one. So the Russians have refocused in the area where they have made some gains, very hard-fought. And they're going to reinforce that in the east and the southeast, and then presumably further down around the port of Mariupol, when those defenders, incredibly resolute, really the Alamo of Ukraine in many respects, when that ultimately falls. And his discussion of shaping, normally, for us, that would also include preparatory fires. It would include a variety of positioning of logistical assets, medical evacuation, resupply, ammunition caches, refueling assets, and so forth. And they're doing quite a bit of that. But they have struggled, as Admiral Kirby noted. And I know him well from the war years in the past. They have struggled with the logistical aspects of this, as, as he rightly noted, they have struggled with so much else, including air-ground, including combined arms affects, where you use not just tanks, but infantry, engineers, artillery, mortars, and so forth all together, protected by air defense. All of these have been very, very challenging for them, and surprisingly so, given the months that they supposedly spent on training and maneuvers in Russia and also in Belarus before taking the operations to invade the country."
    },

      "speaker": "PAYNE",

It sounds really ominous, in my mind, that, strategically and certainly the way they carried out the plan so far, has -- it's been a series of blunders, but they still are capable of maybe significant damage."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PETRAEUS",
      "utterance": "Well, we think that's the case. But we will have to see. The one challenge of the east that was not present in the north is that the train is a good bit more open. I have been that part of Ukraine pre-COVID, certainly when I visited the front lines in the Donbass. It is much more advantageous terrain to the kinds of offensive operations that we presume that the Russians will want to conduct, again, armor, infantry fighting vehicles and so forth. The question is whether or not they're going to be able to go off-road onto the fields, or whether they will still be muddy, as they reportedly are right now. And, in that case, the -- even the track vehicles will get mired in those fields. And that would be very, very helpful for Ukraine, which has to stop these forces in order to then hit them with these sophisticated shoulder-launched anti-tank guided missiles, the Javelins, take out their aircraft with the Stingers, employ a variety of the other systems. And I'm very, frankly, enthusiastic about the addition of 700 of the so- called Switchblade drones to the list that's being provided. These are -- could be game-changers, because, when the soldiers get out of their vehicles, these are loitering munitions. They're launched by Ukrainian forces out of a tube. They're quite intuitive to use. There's an iPad like device that the operator looks at. And he picks the target. It's circling above. It's electric, so you can't hear it. And then it just takes out that target. So it is literally silent, but deadly. What we're sending are the anti-personnel versions. I'd love to see a lot of the armor version, but they're literally just not in our arsenal. And let me just highlight something that is a challenge for us. I think we'd like to provide a great deal more for Ukraine. The challenge is that we do not have the ammunition that they need. It is Eastern Bloc ammunition. Their artillery shoots 152-millimeter howitzer ammunition. We shoot 155. That's why we're providing the howitzers and then also tens of thousands of rounds to go with it, because their artillery won't go into it."

I mean, we can't give them F- 16s, and we don't have MiG-29s. Now what we are doing and they're working very hard is to get the Eastern European countries that have this equipment, have this ammunition, have those planes to transfer them to the Ukrainians, which they can use right away, because they're very similar.

Then they wanted to, in essence, launder it through the U.S. and get a guarantee that we provide F-16s, which we can't. All the ones coming off the assembly line are committed to another nation, and in the Indo-Pacific, which, after all, is still the priority, despite what is going on here and the way that we're focused very, very much on that."

Some had concerns that we'd see volatility after that poison pill announcement. But, today, we are seeing a good deal of resilience in Twitter. You can see shares up more than 7.5, closing higher than $48 a share. This is still lower than Musk's bid of roughly $54 a share. And that adds to the debate on whether Musk's bid fully reflects the company's value. And, for now, it seems that Elon Musk shows no signs of backing down on his bid takeover on Twitter, as he says that he would pay board members nothing if he were successful. Musk claims taking the board member salaries down to zero would save shareholders about $3 million a year. Board members are paid between $250,000 and $300,000 a year. But in this battle for control of Twitter, employees of the social media giant are also weighing in. According to The New York Post, an internal survey of Twitter employees shows that 78 percent believe that Musk does not have the best interests of Twitter and its shareholders in mind.

      "speaker": "BAKER",
      "utterance": "I have never seen, Charles, a political party, which -- all politicians think they're right all the time, obviously. But I have never seen a political party and a political establishment be so out of line with where the people are, where the people's interests are. And that's the problem for the Democrats at the moment, whether it's crime, immigration, the pandemic, the state of the state -- the state of the economy generally, and particularly on this issue of inflation. People are really concerned about inflation. The way to deal with it, look, inflation, you -- as you well know, once inflation is embedded in an economy, it's really hard to get rid of. It's not like dealing with a recession. It's not like dealing with a foreign policy crisis. It takes a long time to overcome inflation. But what you can do as a government is, you can make it worse. You can make it worse by spending money that you don't have, by adding to the deficit, by pouring more money onto -- pouring more fuel onto that fire. And that's exactly what the Democrats are proposing to do."

Is it -- I honestly believe that it's the -- that none of this ever has anything to do with economics. It's a paternalistic thing, where they just simply think they know better than the rest of us, and their idea of what a perfect country would look like, I guess, for right now involves runaway inflation."

      "utterance": "It is an established fact in the progressive mind-set that they are better than the rest of us, they are better morally than the rest of us, they are more intelligent than the rest of us, they know what's right. So, it doesn't matter what the voter says. It doesn't matter that the voters don't want to do this. It doesn't matter what this is going to do. They know that, in the long run, it's right. And, as far as inflation is concerned, yes, their main priority is to increase the size of government more and more and more, because it's a ratchet effect. The more you -- the more you increase government, the harder it is to reduce it. So they are prepared to pay the price of higher inflation, which they know will come, because they will get a larger government. And that's their primary objective."

On the one hand, the administration doesn't want to remove the mask mandate, because we're still in an emergency, although a judge, as we know, overturned that today. On the other hand, they say, actually, we are no longer in the emergency. So we have got to lift Title 42. Of course, it's just an -- of course we know what the impact is going to be. It's going to be a rush -- a further surge -- illegal immigration is already surging. It's going to be a further surge. They know that very well. And, again, it's part of their overall political agenda that is not addressing the needs of the country. It's addressing their longer-term ideological objectives."
