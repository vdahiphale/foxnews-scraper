Articles of impeachment have now been filed against the Deputy A.G. Rod Rosenstein. Now, the days of Rosenstein's obstruction may soon be coming to an end. We will have full coverage of this breaking news throughout the hour. And first, another day, another scandalous, oh, the sky is falling. The earth is shattered. Days and days of breathless, peddling of lies by the mainstream media. We've got the best montage I think we've ever put together. This time, America's professional Trump haters are spinning in circles over a totally insignificant audio recording between Michael Cohen and Donald Trump. It's clearly the media's anti-Trump meltdown du jour, but in moments, we'll show you how this tape is much ado about nothing.   Plus, we're going to take you on a very frightening journey tonight, you got a buckle up, you may want to warn the kids, through some of the worst examples of the destroy Trump media moving daily, crisis to crisis to crisis. We've got the tape, it's amazing. And we'll do something you will not see in the mainstream media. We have amazing great news tonight on the economy and other news on the foreign policy front with the Trump administration. By the way, including strong new poll numbers, so much for all the media beat downs. And, of course, we are expecting Friday, the quarterly, second quarter GDP numbers, it should make America proud. We're hoping for a major breakthrough, and we had one breakthrough today on the one of the biggest economic partners we have -- oh, there's no trade war. They said this guy was falling there too.  Free and fair trade on the horizon, huge concessions the president got today as it relates to the European Union and significant diplomatic progress under the leadership of the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Wow, what a beat-down he gave senators today, and we'll show you how he helped actually educate Democrats on the president's strong, sound, yes, tough on Russia policy.   We have a lot of real news to get to and tonight's breaking news full hour opening monologue.",

And if they can't weaponize the story against President Trump, they don't really seem interested at all in covering it. News is non-existent in this country on these so-called news channels. Right here on this show, we have been sounding the alarm about the serious corruption, real corruption real abuse of power a real Russia scandal at the highest levels of the DOJ and the FBI. Over at the destroy Trump media, crickets. And naturally, the media goes to great lengths to avoid talking about all the positive developments surrounding the country and the Trump administration. They won't want you to know about the huge successes out of the White House.  For the first time in years, we'll find out Friday America's GDP is seeing healthy real growth. Remember, it was just a short time ago, the Obama administration wanted Americans to accept our so-called new normal, like Jimmy Carter saying wear a sweater, a pathetic growth rate of 1 or 2 percent. Now, according to projections, our second quarter growth should be about 4 percent, maybe higher. Add to that, we now have historic job growth, 2 million fewer people on food stamps, there were more jobs available than there are people on unemployment in the country and, oh, by the way the greatest labor participation rate in history. Wow, good news for the forgotten men and women, the ones that voted for President Trump even though the fix was in for Hillary and, of course, they covered up her crimes, and then they turned their sights on Trump and they even lied to FISA court judges, a massive accomplishment that you never hear about. And, yesterday, the president tweeted this out. Our country is doing great, best financial numbers on the planet, great to have the USA winning again. And on Friday, we expect that full GDP report for the second quarter. We'll bring you those numbers as they become available. But tonight, we have even more positive developments that you'll never hear in the media on the economic front, after months of negotiations and fear-mongering by the media, oh he's starting a trade war -- well, the president put fears of that wart with Europe to rest as he signed off on a significantly improved trade deal for American businesses free of tariffs, barriers and subsidies.

After months of obstructing what is congressional subpoenas and failing to comply with these subpoenas and inhibiting the important investigation and the FISA abuse, their Russia witch-hunt and so much more, Rod Rosenstein must now be held accountable. It's called congressional government oversight. It's called checks and balances, co-equal branches of government, and, yes, the United States Constitution, and it's time for Rod Rosenstein to be held accountable.

Jordan and Meadows said they weren't in compliance, that after nine months, they still didn't even know how many documents they needed to turn over to them.  There was another issue that came up which I thought was very interesting. The FBI did agree with Congressman Jordan that struck did not answer 90 percent of the questions that he could have answered that he took a very, very broad interpretation.

The idea that within months of leaving office you are attacking the sitting president, calling him treasonous and accusing him of committing high crimes and misdemeanors is absolutely outrageous. Secondly, you mention it in your introduction -- how is it that John Brennan even got a job at the CIA when he admitted to voting for the communist party at the height of the Cold War when the Soviet Union had 25,000 nuclear warheads aimed at this country and when it was committed to our destruction. I would like to find an investigation as to why he was employed by the CIA, let alone become its director. And lastly, Daniel, let me expand upon what Daniel said. There are only two reasons after you retire from government service at his level that you should maintain a security clearance. Number one, you are actively involved in a current government project as a contractor, John Brennan isn't. Secondly, your advice is requested by your successors so that the new CIA director can listen to you.

We will have full coverage of this breaking news throughout the hour. And first, another day, another scandalous, oh, the sky is falling. The earth is shattered. Days and days of breathless, peddling of lies by the mainstream media. We've got the best montage I think we've ever put together. This time, America's professional Trump haters are spinning in circles over a totally insignificant audio recording between Michael Cohen and Donald Trump. It's clearly the media's anti-Trump meltdown du jour, but in moments, we'll show you how this tape is much ado about nothing. Plus, we're going to take you on a very frightening journey tonight, you got a buckle up, you may want to warn the kids, through some of the worst examples of the destroy Trump media moving daily, crisis to crisis to crisis. We've got the tape, it's amazing. And we'll do something you will not see in the mainstream media. We have amazing great news tonight on the economy and other news on the foreign policy front with the Trump administration. By the way, including strong new poll numbers, so much for all the media beat downs. And, of course, we are expecting Friday, the quarterly, second quarter GDP numbers, it should make America proud. We're hoping for a major breakthrough, and we had one breakthrough today on the one of the biggest economic partners we have -- oh, there's no trade war. They said this guy was falling there too. Free and fair trade on the horizon, huge concessions the president got today as it relates to the European Union and significant diplomatic progress under the leadership of the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Wow, what a beat-down he gave senators today, and we'll show you how he helped actually educate Democrats on the president's strong, sound, yes, tough on Russia policy. We have a lot of real news to get to and tonight's breaking news full hour opening monologue."

This is literally now every minute, every hour of every day, the media their friends on the left three years running, obsessing over the crisis of the second, totally ignoring the biggest issues that we the people are facing in this country and ignoring the massive success out of the Trump administration. And if they can't weaponize the story against President Trump, they don't really seem interested at all in covering it. News is non-existent in this country on these so-called news channels. Right here on this show, we have been sounding the alarm about the serious corruption, real corruption real abuse of power a real Russia scandal at the highest levels of the DOJ and the FBI. Over at the destroy Trump media, crickets. And naturally, the media goes to great lengths to avoid talking about all the positive developments surrounding the country and the Trump administration. They won't want you to know about the huge successes out of the White House. For the first time in years, we'll find out Friday America's GDP is seeing healthy real growth. Remember, it was just a short time ago, the Obama administration wanted Americans to accept our so-called new normal, like Jimmy Carter saying wear a sweater, a pathetic growth rate of 1 or 2 percent. Now, according to projections, our second quarter growth should be about 4 percent, maybe higher. Add to that, we now have historic job growth, 2 million fewer people on food stamps, there were more jobs available than there are people on unemployment in the country and, oh, by the way the greatest labor participation rate in history. Wow, good news for the forgotten men and women, the ones that voted for President Trump even though the fix was in for Hillary and, of course, they covered up her crimes, and then they turned their sights on Trump and they even lied to FISA court judges, a massive accomplishment that you never hear about. And, yesterday, the president tweeted this out. Our country is doing great, best financial numbers on the planet, great to have the USA winning again. And on Friday, we expect that full GDP report for the second quarter. We'll bring you those numbers as they become available. But tonight, we have even more positive developments that you'll never hear in the media on the economic front, after months of negotiations and fear-mongering by the media, oh he's starting a trade war -- well, the president put fears of that wart with Europe to rest as he signed off on a significantly improved trade deal for American businesses free of tariffs, barriers and subsidies. Here's the president explaining all of this earlier today. Let's take a look."

Great news for goods, services made right here in the United States, good for the American worker that was unemployed in the Obama years. Despite the constant negativity coming from so much of the media and Democrats, you think they want the economy to grow and be prosperous? No, they want their power back. More and more Americans, you're seeing the truth with your own eyes. We got a new poll out today. In spite of all the media hysteria, oh, look at \"The Hills\" poll. The president's approval rating is now higher than ever, nearly 50 percent. Oh by the way, same with Gallup, same with NBC/\"Wall Street Journal\". And on the world stage, the president has also seen progress which is good for our kids and grandkids. The president's pick I think an excellent choice, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, hit the ground running. He's overseeing steady significant progress out of North Korea, China and, yes, we're being tougher on Russia than Obama ever dreamed of, because he was sending messages, tell Vladimir I have more flexibility after the election. Well, today, the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, he testified on the hill and he explained to some of these dumb senators that the president's peace through strength strategy to counter the hostile actions of Vladimir Putin and the hostile regime of Russia, and what we're doing about it.

Last but definitely not least tonight, some major breaking news out of the deep state. This is important. Moments ago, a group of 11 House Republicans have officially now introduced articles of impeachment against the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the guy that signed the last FISA warrant. After months of obstructing what is congressional subpoenas and failing to comply with these subpoenas and inhibiting the important investigation and the FISA abuse, their Russia witch-hunt and so much more, Rod Rosenstein must now be held accountable. It's called congressional government oversight. It's called checks and balances, co-equal branches of government, and, yes, the United States Constitution, and it's time for Rod Rosenstein to be held accountable. We got a lot to get to tonight, a lot of reaction. Rudy Giuliani in a minute. Joining us first with reaction is former U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, Joe diGenova, and Fox News contributor Sara Carter. Sara, we'll start with you and the breaking news.

One of the things that happened today, I think it was the straw that broke the camel's back, Sean, was the fact that when Meadows and Jordan went to meet with the DOJ and FBI, once again they refused to comply. They said they were in compliance with giving the documents over to Congress. There was I guess a lot of arguing back and forth. Jordan and Meadows said they weren't in compliance, that after nine months, they still didn't even know how many documents they needed to turn over to them. There was another issue that came up which I thought was very interesting. The FBI did agree with Congressman Jordan that struck did not answer 90 percent of the questions that he could have answered that he took a very, very broad interpretation. This is Peter Strzok when he provided testimony, the FBI agent. So, they are going to be calling Peter Strzok back to testify before Congress and hopefully he will be answering a lot of the questions that Congressman Jordan had asked him that he refused to answer."

This is a guy -- he signed the fourth warrant which was the bulk of information was that phony Russian dossier paid for by Clinton. They didn't tell the FISA court judges. They didn't verify the information. They didn't follow the law. They didn't follow up behind protocol. And Rod Rosenstein signed the last one, the third renewal, the fourth, all together. Your reaction?"

Rosenstein remembered, didn't even read the final application he had people explain to him what was in it. Rosenstein is the one responsible for the crisis that the president has faced in the Mueller probe. Without Rosenstein there is no Mueller probe. He did it purposely to avoid having to make difficult decisions in a political investigation. He should be ashamed of himself. He's getting precisely what he deserves. But what's more important than that, Sean, is that you are watching a president of the United States who has astride the globe, and he is being assisted ably a secretary of state in full. We no longer have a namby-pamby foreign policy. We have a secretary of state who today performed beyond any expectations any Americans could expect of a secretary of state.

It is an outrageous abuse of power and if Jeff Sessions and Rod Rosenstein have not begun a grand jury to investigate all the people involved in the phony dossier and everything involved on it, ultimately when Mueller is done, Rosenstein and Session should be fired. This is a clear case of criminal law violation in the FISA application.

He is one of the biggest Trump haters out there, now a political hack for conspiracy theory TV where I guess he belongs. This is, now remember, the CIA protocol says if you want to keep your clearance, you've got to act like a modern-day CIA employee, you can't be doing stuff like this."

I and so many other national security officials are speaking out because of the abnormal and aberrance behavior of Mr. Trump. This is a very large and painful national kidney stone.

The CIA we did put it up on the screen last night, yes, if you want your clearance you've got to act as though you a current the same way a current CIA employee would act. Is that the actions of a current CIA employee?"

First of all, for the rank and file retired intelligence officers who retain a security clearance is because they have a job to do as a contractor back in the intelligence committee which requires the clearance. Secondly, there's no evidence that John Brennan or Jim Clapper has revealed classified information. In fact, they have like, willfully spoken untruths not based on intelligence. Jim Clapper claims that the Russians tilted the election to Donald Trump, not true. And absolutely contradicts the intelligence that was produced and resulted in the January 2017--"

      "speaker": "SEBASTIAN GORKA, FOX NEWS NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGIST",
      "utterance": "I have three things to say, Sean. Number one, since the CIA was created in 1947, not one former CIA director has behaved as disgracefully as John Brennan. The idea that within months of leaving office you are attacking the sitting president, calling him treasonous and accusing him of committing high crimes and misdemeanors is absolutely outrageous. Secondly, you mention it in your introduction -- how is it that John Brennan even got a job at the CIA when he admitted to voting for the communist party at the height of the Cold War when the Soviet Union had 25,000 nuclear warheads aimed at this country and when it was committed to our destruction. I would like to find an investigation as to why he was employed by the CIA, let alone become its director. And lastly, Daniel, let me expand upon what Daniel said. There are only two reasons after you retire from government service at his level that you should maintain a security clearance. Number one, you are actively involved in a current government project as a contractor, John Brennan isn't. Secondly, your advice is requested by your successors so that the new CIA director can listen to you. This administration does not want John Brennan's advice, therefore, the president should strip him of his security clearance right now, Sean."
