You don't get good P.R., the media hates you. You're painted as a bigot. There're all this short term consequences to a long term benefit which is that your -- the changes in immigration is not being kept up with the current system. We update our phone every year. We have a system that we refuse to update for fear of being yelled at. So -- immigration highlights the differences between the constrained and unconstrained. Conservatives are constrained. They believe humans are fallible and will gain the system. So you need to have a process. But the left, unconstrained, believe in moral progress, and that laws are just temporary. And so --"

And, look, so if you're just not paying attention to this day-to-day and you see that Comey says, I'll come and testify, I just want it to be open so there's no leaking.

He reminds me of the conservative intellectuals out there that say they're the only ones that are conservative, or I am -- I'm so perfect. I think a lot of American people are turned off by him, especially because there are so many inconsistencies, investigates Hillary Clinton about a private email server, he has a private email, he investigates leaking, he leaks.

And she see like what actually happened to the country there. So, she's trying to let everybody know, this is a disaster waiting to happen. She looks at it because she says the problem is that led to the rise of right-wing extremists. The people who are in Germany say, well, not -- maybe -- OK -- but also it led to the rise in crime and a rise in all these other problems that have unfettered immigration allows. So she's trying to send a warning signal that that is what President Trump is trying to do as well. He's saying we've learned from Angela Merkel's mistakes. So, we agree with you, Hillary.
