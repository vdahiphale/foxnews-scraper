Now we're waiting for the next moves. And we have got you covered with Greg Palkot in Kiev, Ukraine, on what comes next over there, Jacqui Heinrich at the White House on the fallout right here, and Rebeccah Heinrichs on where this all goes from here. We will be speaking to Senate Energy Committee member Bill Cassidy on why all this could mean more pain at the pump for Americans. But we begin with Greg in Kiev -- Greg.",

Secretary of State Blinken meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov for 90 minutes in Geneva. Lavrov called it constructive and useful. Blinken described the moment as critical. And what seemed critical for Blinken, after the muddled message from President Biden earlier this week, to come out strong and forceful. Here's a bit of what he said.",

Russia also sticking to its demands that NATO stay out of Ukraine and its U.S.-led troops get out of Eastern Europe, nonstarters for the U.S. Again, Ukraine probably appreciates the clearer line from the U.S. today. Ukrainian President Zelensky was critical of Biden's earlier comments this week, and will also approve of another commitment of military aid to Ukraine. Blinken also shared information about all this meeting with Ukraine's foreign minister.

Now we have word that Germany is blocking critical weapons from NATO allies going into Ukraine. And so, if you don't have Germany standing with the NATO alliance, there's really not a whole lot we can do at this point. And the beginning of the end was when Joe Biden decided not to sanction Nord Stream 2 and to allow that to go through between Germany and Russia. And at this point, all we can do, we can hope that the Brits keep sending in aid. Thank goodness for the Brits. Thank goodness for the Poles that are helping. The Canadians have sent in special forces reportedly, so we can hope that other NATO allies might be able to do enough to help the Ukrainians if something does happen.

We can penalize Russia to the extent that we can. But, again, the previous comment is so true. We need to have NATO solidarity if we're going to have NATO sanctions, and we cannot do that with Germany. This administration has not understood the importance of leaning hard even on our allies. Do it privately. You don't have to beat Donald Trump, and do it publicly. But you have got to do it privately.

I got to tell you, digging into the oil prices and the oil purchases by this country under this administration, Senator, I was blown away when we dug into government data this morning, this after talking to Senator Barrasso yesterday, that we have doubled, as a country, our oil purchases from Russia in just the first year of this presidency under the Biden administration.

We have had so much of our action this year down across parts of the South, instead of the North. And that's one of them. We had some snow across parts of Texas. We had some mixing even in places like New Orleans. And now the bulk of this energy, what will really see this storm is going to be here along the coastal areas of the Carolinas. We're already just now -- you see that pink popping up there -- beginning to see that freezing rain start. That will very quickly make every road impassable. So, hopefully, everybody is home. Good thing it's on a Friday. People don't have to go to work in the morning. Stay home until, as Robert was saying, the day warms up tomorrow and we get a bit of a break with that melting of that ice that's going to happen. Now, this, it goes in about another hour from now. We have got that ice along the coast. We will have a band of the snow across interior sections. And then take a look at this. This is 6:00 a.m. tomorrow morning. For the most part, it is offshore, and it will not be a storm for the Northeast. It's going to move far enough offshore that we don't have any big concerns. Snow to come still yet. We might see a few spots four or five, six inches of snow right across interior sections, a lot of places getting two to three inches. And these are places that don't get a lot of snow. So it's going to have a bigger impact than it might in a place that is used to dealing with all that. And then the ice forecast, as Robert was saying, we will see some spots, probably quarter to half-an-inch, maybe a couple spots a little higher than that. That will topple over any trees. That will probably topple over some power lines. And that's why they're having all those preparations. But take a look at this. We're talking about an ice storm all the way to the coast there across North Carolina and South Carolina. There is one other aspect to the storm, and that is going to be down across parts of Florida as the front moves through, chance for a little bit of severe weather there.

Now we're waiting for the next moves. And we have got you covered with Greg Palkot in Kiev, Ukraine, on what comes next over there, Jacqui Heinrich at the White House on the fallout right here, and Rebeccah Heinrichs on where this all goes from here.

Secretary of State Blinken meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov for 90 minutes in Geneva. Lavrov called it constructive and useful. Blinken described the moment as critical. And what seemed critical for Blinken, after the muddled message from President Biden earlier this week, to come out strong and forceful. Here's a bit of what he said."

      "utterance": "Still, the gap between the two sides remains dangerously wide, Sandra. Blinken demanding Russia pull back its 100,000-plus troops on the borders with Ukraine. Lavrov saying they didn't intend to invade. Russia also sticking to its demands that NATO stay out of Ukraine and its U.S.-led troops get out of Eastern Europe, nonstarters for the U.S. Again, Ukraine probably appreciates the clearer line from the U.S. today. Ukrainian President Zelensky was critical of Biden's earlier comments this week, and will also approve of another commitment of military aid to Ukraine. Blinken also shared information about all this meeting with Ukraine's foreign minister. Sandra, late and developing news this afternoon, U.S. officials have confirmed to FOX News that the State Department is at least looking at a possible evacuation of U.S. diplomats' families -- back to you."

Yes, the U.S. can go in alone. But it really depends on NATO unity and NATO teamwork to get this job done. So there is talk of unity. But, again, the longer this drags out, the longer there could be issues, Sandra."

So as we look at a map of Russia, Ukraine and the surrounding European countries there, what exactly are the stakes over there and for us here? Let's ask Rebeccah Heinrichs, senior fellow at the Hudson Institute. So, Rebeccah, this is a crucial situation that we're watching develop there. What do you see happening next?"

    {
      "speaker": "REBECCAH HEINRICHS, THE HUDSON INSTITUTE",

The question is, at this point, how far is Russia going to go back into Ukraine? What is the extent of the military operation? I mean, you can kind of tell by President Biden's statement about a minor incursion that it's like this administration has simply thrown up its hands and just thinks that this is going to happen. Now we have word that Germany is blocking critical weapons from NATO allies going into Ukraine. And so, if you don't have Germany standing with the NATO alliance, there's really not a whole lot we can do at this point. And the beginning of the end was when Joe Biden decided not to sanction Nord Stream 2 and to allow that to go through between Germany and Russia. And at this point, all we can do, we can hope that the Brits keep sending in aid. Thank goodness for the Brits. Thank goodness for the Poles that are helping. The Canadians have sent in special forces reportedly, so we can hope that other NATO allies might be able to do enough to help the Ukrainians if something does happen. But I am not confident that we can stave off anything at this point."

    {
      "speaker": "HEINRICHS",
      "utterance": "Well, I mean, at this point, there isn't a whole lot we can do. I mean, what Biden should have done was leaned hard into Germany at the beginning of the administration a year into this. I mean, our hands are really tied. And so we're going to have to see to the extent of what Putin decides to do in the coming weeks, and then reevaluate our relationship with the Germans, our relationship with -- obviously, what we're going to do with Russia. We can penalize Russia to the extent that we can. But, again, the previous comment is so true. We need to have NATO solidarity if we're going to have NATO sanctions, and we cannot do that with Germany. This administration has not understood the importance of leaning hard even on our allies. Do it privately. You don't have to beat Donald Trump, and do it publicly. But you have got to do it privately. And this administration really made a major strategic air by throwing in with the Germans on Nord Stream 2."

We need to be focused on that region of the world as a primary theater. But that means that, if we have a war in Europe, we are going to be distracted, it's going to be awful for the United States. Obviously, you could talk about energy prices as an immediate thing that's going to hit the American family. And so we're distracted once again. This is why not everything is an area where we have to send troops and go to war, but we can't be stupid, Sandra."

We have got some increasing acts of aggression against adversaries, against -- from adversaries against the United States and our interests."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEINRICHS",
      "utterance": "Yes, there's -- but, again, you have to have Europeans with us, because the Europeans don't want to be hitting the pocketbook with gas prices either. And the Russians can really harm them when it comes to energy exploitation. And so, again, we can try to hit them and punish them and raise the cost of what they're doing."

Our next guest says this situation, combined with President Biden's energy policies, will have us paying even more. Louisiana Republican Senator Bill Cassidy is a member of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. He joins us now. Senator, great to see you. I mean, we're already paying as a national average $3.33 a gallon at the pump. That is already painful for most families in this country. What are you predicting could happen here with not just gasoline prices, but oil prices, heating oil? It's costing us all a whole lot more to heat our homes this winter. What are the implications of this fight for us here at home?"

So -- and, by the way, a byproduct of the Biden administration's decision to shut down American energy production, to kind of attempt to inhibit the use of Canadian tar sand, despite the fact that all this is produced in a better environmental and a better -- better environmentally than if we get Russian gas, it's kind of like the worst of all worlds. If they had come up with the worst policy, I'm not sure they could have done worse than they have done."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SMITH",
      "utterance": "Ah, that is a stark warning. And you have got Wall Street that is looking at these prices as well. Goldman Sachs got a prediction for $100 oil. The world is certainly watching. What I just asked Rebeccah about whether or not Germany's going to step up to the fight or other allies step up to the fight here, that is a looming question. I got to tell you, digging into the oil prices and the oil purchases by this country under this administration, Senator, I was blown away when we dug into government data this morning, this after talking to Senator Barrasso yesterday, that we have doubled, as a country, our oil purchases from Russia in just the first year of this presidency under the Biden administration. That seems shocking to me. But that is the reality of this moment. We are more dependent on foreign nations for our energy now than we were just a year ago."

Our dollars are going to Russia to support their economy, so they can do more militarily, while we take jobs away from our economy. It is like the worst energy policy you could come up with. And that's what they have done."

At least 11 arrests, for instance, in South Carolina, including on an assault charge, a theft charge here in Southern California, where he was free on $1,000 bail, and in Northern California, he served four months for assaulting a police officer. Combined with COVID-related prison releases and court shutdowns, his freedom to move around the country and the state led Smith back to Los Angeles last Thursday, and ultimately to the store where Brianna Kupfer was working alone. Hundreds of people gathered yesterday outside of that store, paying tribute to the 24-year-old and calling for the city's leadership to do more to keep the streets safe."

However, right now, our struggle with a district attorney, 12,000 cases his first year in office, he just decided not to prosecute. Those are 12,000 cases we investigated. And I guarantee you, among those 12,000 people that walk free will be people that are going to go on to commit more violent crimes and who knows, up to including murder.

When it comes to what can be done about this, a very powerful piece was written by my colleague Sean Duffy on FOXNews.com, writing about the infiltration of these woke DAs into a justice system. He says it will not be easy to fix, saying that this new woke army of activist prosecutors is on the rise and their goal is not the rule of law or even safety. That is a scary thought. You just heard it from those citizens there. So, I mean, we're dependent on voters and leadership to turn this thing around. But when you have got DA Gascon in charge there, you're still dealing with the effects of a hiring freeze when it comes to your police force.

But then he turns around and endorses Georgia Gascon, who does not prosecute thefts. He's legalized petty theft, all sorts of misdemeanors. He's legalized prostitution. Without a proper prosecution, it does us no good or very little good to just arrest people that are going to be released immediately. So that part equation is missing. We need a district attorney. And if he wants to be the public defender, I'm pretty sure he can get the job if he wants. But he needs to stop pretending that he's actually doing his job as a DA."

And then, again, it can be this -- according to Gascon, he's going to have a very minimal -- minimum amount of sentence possible for a murder is what Gascon is planning to do. There will be no enhancements. And, unfortunately, these enhancements are what keeps a lot of these killers in prison, not harming people. That's how we drove down these homicide rates back in the '90s was three strikes. It worked. It's put the worst of the worst behind bars, so they cannot harm other people.

A tiny little girl was shot, spending her birthday in the hospital here after being shot by gunfire in the Bronx, as a man walked -- ran down the street, I should say, firing his gun. The Manhattan DA, Alvin Bragg, is doubling down on a soft-on-crime memo he put out in January.

While, all those woke wonders are in office now, are -- it's all blowing up in their face. There is no data, there is no science, like Gascon says, that says that their policies work. They have been an absolute failure. We need to put that pendulum back in the middle, where it belongs.

We are expecting a very treacherous and dangerous evening and overnight ahead, as temperatures are set to plummet and the system move in up and down the Eastern Seaboard of not only North Carolina, but South Carolina. Now, inland, we're going to see accumulation of snow as well. Power crews for Duke Energy are here staging behind me. There are hundreds -- and there are about 2,500 utility workers around the state ready to go as soon as the potential for these power lines to go down occurs overnight. They are also expecting downed trees. The weight of this ice, anything a quarter-inch to a half-an-inch and above is going to cause a very destructive landscape all across these areas, the roads in particular not safe at all. As I speak right now, right now, if you're out there, get off of them. They are not safe. They are going to ice over momentarily as this sun goes down and throughout the evening into tomorrow morning. The good news is, is, tomorrow, by afternoon, as temps begin to warm up, we will see that ice dissipate. But the aftermath of this ice storm could be devastating to the region. That's why you see behind me all these trucks ready to rock and go out there and try and repair any power lines or downed tree -- Sandra."

My -- we have got winter storm warnings in effect, high storm warnings, winter weather advisories. The ice is going to be right along the coast. And this is a very strange storm. We have had so much of our action this year down across parts of the South, instead of the North. And that's one of them. We had some snow across parts of Texas. We had some mixing even in places like New Orleans. And now the bulk of this energy, what will really see this storm is going to be here along the coastal areas of the Carolinas. We're already just now -- you see that pink popping up there -- beginning to see that freezing rain start. That will very quickly make every road impassable. So, hopefully, everybody is home. Good thing it's on a Friday. People don't have to go to work in the morning. Stay home until, as Robert was saying, the day warms up tomorrow and we get a bit of a break with that melting of that ice that's going to happen. Now, this, it goes in about another hour from now. We have got that ice along the coast. We will have a band of the snow across interior sections. And then take a look at this. This is 6:00 a.m. tomorrow morning. For the most part, it is offshore, and it will not be a storm for the Northeast. It's going to move far enough offshore that we don't have any big concerns. Snow to come still yet. We might see a few spots four or five, six inches of snow right across interior sections, a lot of places getting two to three inches. And these are places that don't get a lot of snow. So it's going to have a bigger impact than it might in a place that is used to dealing with all that. And then the ice forecast, as Robert was saying, we will see some spots, probably quarter to half-an-inch, maybe a couple spots a little higher than that. That will topple over any trees. That will probably topple over some power lines. And that's why they're having all those preparations. But take a look at this. We're talking about an ice storm all the way to the coast there across North Carolina and South Carolina. There is one other aspect to the storm, and that is going to be down across parts of Florida as the front moves through, chance for a little bit of severe weather there. We're going to see that throughout the evening tonight and maybe even a little bit into the morning tomorrow. Watch primarily for some really strong winds, so Southeastern U.S. as the target once again -- Sandra."

The fans, they scooped up these tickets. And, yes, I'm not sure how you replace.

Morgan, Morgan Stanley, you name it. All the big New York players are in it, real estate, retail. About 30 of them today met with Bragg. I believe it was via Zoom. And they voiced their concerns. And here's essentially the bottom line. And I'm going to give you the bottom line and tell you some of the people who made those comments. The bottom line was, if you want to open New York City, OK, you want people to come back to the office, your memo was not -- your memo, which basically says, I'm not going to prosecute anything but somebody getting their head blown off in Manhattan, is not the way to go about it. People are scared. They don't want to come to the office. We can't get them back in the office because they think that -- because they believe, with good evidence, that the city, from a crime standpoint, is raging out of control. They made that point very forcefully. I mean, I heard it was a good meeting, productive. I mean, I don't think there was screaming and yelling involved. But they made that very forcefully. I think one of the more poignant aspects of the meeting was the first call. The CEO of Deloitte, we should point out, spoke first. Now, why is that important?

We can't get people into the office. Our people are scared. Crime is getting out of control. Now, the positive thing is -- here is, Bragg is saying listen, public safety is a huge concern. I definitely believe public safety -- at least he talked a good game. I'm going to go after people that do violent stuff. Somebody asked him, I believe, suppose I get hit in the head with a bat. Are you not going to prosecute that person? And he said, of course. That's assault with a deadly weapon. I have to prosecute it.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "SMITH",
      "utterance": "Well, you could soon be paying even more at the store, a new vaccine mandates set to kick in tomorrow for truck drivers. And with trucker shortages already a problem, it could drive inflation even higher. FOX Business correspondent Kelly O'Grady is at a truck stop in Vernon, California, with more on that What are you hearing?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KELLY O'GRADY, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Oh, I'm hearing frustration. I mean, these two vaccine mandates are going to make things a lot worse for truckers. Last weekend, Canada started preventing unvaccinated truckers from entering the country. Tomorrow, the U.S. is going to do the same. And I want to dig into what that's going to do for prices for Americans, OK? So the current vaccination rate amongst you as truckers is roughly 50 to 60 percent. That nearly -- that leaves nearly half of the work force at risk. To address this, carriers are shelling out incentive bonuses to compete for vaccinated workers. And those costs are already getting passed on to consumers."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JIM WARD, TRUCKLOAD CARRIERS ASSOCIATION PRESIDENT",
      "utterance": "Not enough of them have enough of the vaccines to be able to deliver all the freight and the demand. Freight rates are continuing to increase. Matter of fact, they're probably up about 30 percent over what they were here just a month or so ago. And we also are seeing surcharges and wage increases for labor."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "O'GRADY",
      "utterance": "Now, one example of how that's trickled down is fruit. The cost to move fruit from California and Arizona already claimed 25 percent since the Canadian mandate went into effect. If the U.S. mandate causes a similar trend, we could see price hikes on everything from cars to produce to even Cadbury chocolate, Sandra. I mean, Canada is one of our largest trade partners. That means more pain for retailers and more frustration for drivers. And less drivers means more inflation for Americans, Sandra."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SMITH",
      "utterance": "Kelly, you said higher chocolate prices. We're all listening."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SMITH",
      "utterance": "That just can't be. All right, all very serious problems. Thank you so much, Kelly. Appreciate it. Thank you. Earlier today, President Biden saying the growing economy is one of the main issues behind all the supply chain problems, which are adding to inflation. But is there more to that? Let's get the read from former Walmart U.S. president and CEO Bill Simon. Great to have you here, sir. I want to pick your brain on this issue, because it is something that we're all dealing with, from a consumer standpoint, from a producer standpoint, all the way until it gets to the dinner table. We're all paying more for just about everything. What do you see as the primary reason why we're all paying more for everything?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BILL SIMON, FORMER WALMART CEO",
      "utterance": "Well, over the last 20 years, our supply chain has been honed to a razor's edge, all the inefficiency taken out of it. And then, two years ago, we shut it off. And then we turned it back on and expected it to function absolutely normally, with increased demand, I might add, and it just hasn't been able to respond to it. You add to that some self-inflicted wounds, some of the energy policies that have driven up the cost of fuel, you add to it some of the COVID issues, vaccine mandates, like the reporter just talked about, and we have -- we have a tangled mess of wires that needs to be -- that needs to be untangled now."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SMITH",
      "utterance": "I mean, well said. That's it in a nutshell. It's complicated, and it's not. You look at, in some ways, how the current administration could get out of the way, as Larry Kudlow keeps saying, and some of these problems would solve themselves. What do we do to get ourselves out of it? Is it up to the Fed, like the president said the other day?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SIMON",
      "utterance": "If we have to wait for the Fed to take action, they're -- it's going to take them the entire year to adjust interest rates. We can't make it an entire year. Americans are literally in shock when they walk into a supermarket that they have walked into 1,000 times before, and there's no food on the shelves. And it's not just a few places. I travel a lot. And I have been in stores in North Carolina, in Arkansas, in Kentucky, in Florida, and shelves are empty everywhere. It's a problem, and it needs to be dealt with right away. There are things that could be done. You could just get out of the way and the system will take care of itself over time. If you're going to put things like mandates in place, you better be prepared to mobilize everybody in the military with a trucker's license to move freight, because you can't cut half of the truck drivers out and expect freight to move. It's just not going to happen. So either get out of the way or do something."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SMITH",
      "utterance": "You have any predictions? Does this get worse before it gets better?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SIMON",
      "utterance": "I have the utmost confidence in the American consumer and in American industry. I think it gets better quickly. I think we're going to look at things, and American ingenuity and the businesses that figure out and have figured out how to cope for many years will take charge and start moving freight. We got to get through some storms. We got to get through this current wave of Omicron that's sort of having a lot of callouts. But I believe, in the next 45 to 60 days, provided that we don't have any new mandates or new changes from the government or a focus that hurts things, I think we will start seeing some improvements. But it's not going to be completely fixed until the wires get untangled and some of the policies that caused this are reversed."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SMITH",
      "utterance": "Yes, all big points. I remember, under your leadership, always talking about how your customers, many of them live paycheck to paycheck. And when prices go up, it greatly affects those families. Sir, thank you very much for your time. Appreciate it."
