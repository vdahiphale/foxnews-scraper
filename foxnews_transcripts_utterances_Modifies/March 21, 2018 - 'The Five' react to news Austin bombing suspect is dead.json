It's 5 o'clock in New York City and this is \"The Five.\" We're awaiting an update from authorities in Pflugerville, Texas, where the Austin bombing suspect killed himself today as police closed in. We'll bring that to you as soon as it begins. The three-week manhunt is over, but police are urging residents to be on the lookout for any suspicious packages amid concerns there could be more explosives out there.  The suspect has been identified as 23-year-old Mark Anthony Conditt. He blew himself up on a roadside about 18 miles outside of Austin. He lived with two roommates who are reportedly both cooperating with officials. Conditt is believed to be linked to six bombs that killed at least two people and injured five others this month.  And, Kimberly, he really did terrorize that city. And there were so many law enforcement officials from the local, state, and federal level on the hunt, and they -- basically, using some old-fashioned police work, were able to trap him pretty quickly.",

Just like good old-fashioned top, you know, police work. And when you think about the juxtaposition of what they did and how they handle this here in Texas, compared to what we saw, unfortunately, occurred, you know, in Florida, it just really goes to show you there's a way that it can and should be done right, and this is, basically, a shining, you know, example of it, and the way they were able to identify him, you know, right away.",

First of all, I want to let everybody know that for the last several hours, explosive experts have been from the FBI, ATF officers working to safely remove and dispose of homemade explosives located inside of a residence in Pflugerville, Texas, and that address is 403 North Second Street, 403 North Second Street. Now, these federal agencies have been working around the clock with local and other federal agencies. Law enforcement have not left this investigation. They have left their families in order to keep our communities safe, and we're working together.  I want to ensure the citizens of Pflugerville and those in adjoining jurisdictions that the reason that we evacuated for a five-block radius was for their safety, to allow these law-enforcement agencies to do their job. What we're going to do soon is we're going to shrink that perimeter a few blocks, and you will see police officers and barricades coming up to the railroad Walnut and Second Street areas.   It will take several hours to process the scene, and I know that we have asked every resident in that perimeter to leave their home. That was a difficult task, but that's how much we cared about their safety. Ladies and gentlemen, patience is going to have to work for us here. We know everybody wants to go home. We know everybody wants to eat dinner with their families, and we want that for you. But we also want to assure that you sleep safe tonight. So we need to let these agencies do their job.  I will ask the Pflugerville residents to go to their library or their recreation center, which is open, until 9 o'clock tonight, if you don't have another place to go to. And we will help you. We anticipate several hours -- I can't give you a time limit right now because this situation is fluid. We will also be putting information on our city website and updating as soon as we can clear the perimeter and let everyone come home. And that is on pflugervilletx.gov. At this time, Pflugerville City Hall was closed down. It's part of the inner perimeter, and I need people to know that. And we will be taking some questions in a few minutes. So, I will let the other gentleman from the federal agency speak. Thank you.",

And so now, we have the ATF national response team processing the evidence in the house. That team has responded to every significant bombing in America for the last 40 years. They bring a wealth of information and experience.  There is components in there, we've talked about, the bomb maker and his signature and how we're able to tell that same individual manufactured all of these devices. There is componentry in there that makes us believe, have a high degree of certainty, that it is the same components that we have found in all the other devices. There is also some potential homemade explosives and so we had to address that. Our biggest concern was to make sure nobody else gets hurt, whether it's first responders, whether it's the neighbors. So, we apologize for any inconvenience, but our whole goal here was to make sure we have no other people hurt in this investigation. We're not done with this investigation. It will continue.

He says he's not a political person. I guess he said he leans conservative. We don't know yet if that was the motivation, if it was political. If there's a manifesto out there, we'll know more about that. We haven't heard anything about that yet.  But, just to go back to Kimberly's point, we've criticized law enforcement and the FBI on multiple levels for years, whether it's police brutality, whether it's these shootings that were botched, investigations, or FISA abuse, and this is one of those moments where you have to say you guys just did an amazing job. To piece together this with the speed that they did by looking at the receipts, and the matching of surveillance footage, and these batteries that were ordered from Asia, I believe, were very exotic.  And then, to ping his phone, and to see his Google search history, and do that in a really tight time span. And then get his car, and then tailed him until he blew himself up. I mean, we were thinking this could go on for a while. The Unabomber went on for years. I mean, this guy was over in a short amount of time, and law enforcement just did an amazing job. So I just want to say congratulations to you guys. And to the people of Austin, such an amazing city, I visited there several times, beautiful people there, and a great spirit.

But the larger picture to me is that we've seem to have more of these kinds of incidents, whether is with guns or bombs in America society today.  So everybody is looking at this one, they put it in a category of the Unabomber, or the Olympic Park bomber, or I think there's something called the Midwest pipe bomber too, all of these different bombings.

Asking a lefty for suggestions on national security is like asking a conservative for tips on vegan restaurants. It's not our wheelhouse. But first, I don't blame them. This is what ideologues do when they're out of power. You play defense. Sure, it's petty to block nominations, but when it's all you've got, it's all you've got. Republicans have done it, too, but this is different. This is national security. When Republicans block, they usually have stronger alternatives to fill those spots, not wimpier ones. If the right hates your choices for national security, it's because they know national security. So we've got to ask, what is your alternative, oh, concerned activists, that won't please our enemies? Chelsea Manning to head the CIA? Bill Ayers for secretary of state? I exaggerate because it's fun. But whatever a left-winger suggests will always be toothless, for national security makes them wince. When you believe that enhanced interrogation is really mean to bad people who aren't really bad at all because they're just victims of America's oppressive foreign policy, you should probably go away and let the adults handle this.

It's 5 o'clock in New York City and this is \"The Five.\" We're awaiting an update from authorities in Pflugerville, Texas, where the Austin bombing suspect killed himself today as police closed in. We'll bring that to you as soon as it begins. The three-week manhunt is over, but police are urging residents to be on the lookout for any suspicious packages amid concerns there could be more explosives out there. The suspect has been identified as 23-year-old Mark Anthony Conditt. He blew himself up on a roadside about 18 miles outside of Austin. He lived with two roommates who are reportedly both cooperating with officials. Conditt is believed to be linked to six bombs that killed at least two people and injured five others this month. And, Kimberly, he really did terrorize that city. And there were so many law enforcement officials from the local, state, and federal level on the hunt, and they -- basically, using some old-fashioned police work, were able to trap him pretty quickly."

Just like good old-fashioned top, you know, police work. And when you think about the juxtaposition of what they did and how they handle this here in Texas, compared to what we saw, unfortunately, occurred, you know, in Florida, it just really goes to show you there's a way that it can and should be done right, and this is, basically, a shining, you know, example of it, and the way they were able to identify him, you know, right away."

First of all, I want to let everybody know that for the last several hours, explosive experts have been from the FBI, ATF officers working to safely remove and dispose of homemade explosives located inside of a residence in Pflugerville, Texas, and that address is 403 North Second Street, 403 North Second Street. Now, these federal agencies have been working around the clock with local and other federal agencies. Law enforcement have not left this investigation. They have left their families in order to keep our communities safe, and we're working together. I want to ensure the citizens of Pflugerville and those in adjoining jurisdictions that the reason that we evacuated for a five-block radius was for their safety, to allow these law-enforcement agencies to do their job. What we're going to do soon is we're going to shrink that perimeter a few blocks, and you will see police officers and barricades coming up to the railroad Walnut and Second Street areas. It will take several hours to process the scene, and I know that we have asked every resident in that perimeter to leave their home. That was a difficult task, but that's how much we cared about their safety. Ladies and gentlemen, patience is going to have to work for us here. We know everybody wants to go home. We know everybody wants to eat dinner with their families, and we want that for you. But we also want to assure that you sleep safe tonight. So we need to let these agencies do their job. I will ask the Pflugerville residents to go to their library or their recreation center, which is open, until 9 o'clock tonight, if you don't have another place to go to. And we will help you. We anticipate several hours -- I can't give you a time limit right now because this situation is fluid. We will also be putting information on our city website and updating as soon as we can clear the perimeter and let everyone come home. And that is on pflugervilletx.gov. At this time, Pflugerville City Hall was closed down. It's part of the inner perimeter, and I need people to know that. And we will be taking some questions in a few minutes. So, I will let the other gentleman from the federal agency speak. Thank you."

And so now, we have the ATF national response team processing the evidence in the house. That team has responded to every significant bombing in America for the last 40 years. They bring a wealth of information and experience. There is components in there, we've talked about, the bomb maker and his signature and how we're able to tell that same individual manufactured all of these devices. There is componentry in there that makes us believe, have a high degree of certainty, that it is the same components that we have found in all the other devices. There is also some potential homemade explosives and so we had to address that. Our biggest concern was to make sure nobody else gets hurt, whether it's first responders, whether it's the neighbors. So, we apologize for any inconvenience, but our whole goal here was to make sure we have no other people hurt in this investigation. We're not done with this investigation. It will continue.

And with technology, one angry loser, one angry loser can get in the record books by doing this because you had a country paralyzed. And if you decide in life that life isn't worth living and that you hate everybody around you, this is the way to get there. Evil through the media provides a consistent reward.

He says he's not a political person. I guess he said he leans conservative. We don't know yet if that was the motivation, if it was political. If there's a manifesto out there, we'll know more about that. We haven't heard anything about that yet. But, just to go back to Kimberly's point, we've criticized law enforcement and the FBI on multiple levels for years, whether it's police brutality, whether it's these shootings that were botched, investigations, or FISA abuse, and this is one of those moments where you have to say you guys just did an amazing job. To piece together this with the speed that they did by looking at the receipts, and the matching of surveillance footage, and these batteries that were ordered from Asia, I believe, were very exotic. And then, to ping his phone, and to see his Google search history, and do that in a really tight time span. And then get his car, and then tailed him until he blew himself up. I mean, we were thinking this could go on for a while. The Unabomber went on for years. I mean, this guy was over in a short amount of time, and law enforcement just did an amazing job. So I just want to say congratulations to you guys. And to the people of Austin, such an amazing city, I visited there several times, beautiful people there, and a great spirit. And they don't have to be breathing a sigh of relief yet, but I think the worst is behind us. And it's just amazing that I can think now they can take a breath."

But the larger picture to me is that we've seem to have more of these kinds of incidents, whether is with guns or bombs in America society today. So everybody is looking at this one, they put it in a category of the Unabomber, or the Olympic Park bomber, or I think there's something called the Midwest pipe bomber too, all of these different bombings. But I just think -- you know, we've seen more of these outbreaks of kind of violence, and too often, you know, with young men.

The good news here is that, whenever anybody is doing a story on this, the relevant point in history is the Unabomber. That's actually good news because that was 20 years ago. So this actually isn't common. It's actually rare. The fact that you have to go back and look for something that -- what's like this? Oh, it's the Unabomber. You have to go back to '95, or I think '94 when he was caught. So there is some kind -- I think that's encouraging. We also know that violence is on the decline. We know that."

Whereas, this is something, like, you know, this is a deranged kid. He doesn't fit into a category. There's no way to kind of put him into a category and then attacked him to certain angles.

News ended up in the Washington Post of the president ignored warnings from his national security team not to congratulate the Russian president after his controversial landslide victory. White House officials say the leak of recent material is a, quote, fireable offense and likely illegal. President Trump responding moments ago on twitter saying, quote, I called President Putin of Russia to congratulate him on his election victory. In past, Obama called him also. The fake news media is crazed because they wanted me to excoriate him. They are wrong. Getting along with Russia and others is a good thing, not a bad thing.

Obama also congratulated the Iranian president in 2013, the Turkish president, shook hands with Castro, bow to the Saudi king. I mean, enough is enough with cozying up to dictators. The problem is, is that by saying congratulations to the Russian leader, the media seizes on that as him being soft. The president has not been soft on Russia. Just slapped new sanctions on them, and just sold Ukraine missiles. It is concerning because you do want to have a good relationship with the Russians. They're our adversaries. And the president is a businessman. So he wants to work you and cater to you, which is how he does business. In terms of the leak, think about that.

And the team surrounding him is, obviously, trying to undermine him to achieve their own personal motive. Sessions has not done a very good job on prosecuting leakers. He made this huge thing about how he was going to go after the leakers, and he had 27 active leak investigations open. And I don't think one person has been charged with the Espionage Act, instead a reality winner. And we've had presidential conversation that had leaked. We've had the Flynn leak, and we have this now. I mean, Sessions really need to step up and start charging people under the Espionage Act. Obama charged eight people on the Espionage Act.

But I also think that -- it's one of those things too, they seize on it. They make it into such a big deal that it does become the story about the leak and there's disloyalty in the White House, et cetera. I mean, the president does have a record of being tough on Russia, but he doesn't talk about it. All he talks about is that we're friends, and it's good to be friends, and everybody else is stupid, and I'm the best. But he actually -- the sanctions, the sale of missiles, liquid natural gas to Poland. There's actually a good record, but he doesn't talk about it.

And I can see, Trump is -- you know, a sales guy. You know -- good job, good job. We'll talk about it later. I don't think -- but the bigger issue that bothers me, why does the media and why do Democrats care? Because they didn't care when the USSR, again, was eight times the size of Russia now, and now you're appalled? Now you're appalled? You were the useful idiots for the Soviets for 40 to 50 years. I mean, the left cheered the Soviets while they destroy people's lives and ruined other countries like Cuba. And now you're saying, oh, we've got to be really hard on Russia. Save it, you goofballs.

Do not, do not congratulate Putin. So then, he goes against the advice of his own people. That's what I think is concerning. Did he read it? Some people say maybe he didn't even read the briefing. But if he read it, why would he go against his own -- the advice of his own folks? That leads that other people have begins having conversations about, what's going on?

The pressure is coming from left-wing activists, the exact people we need to decide who's in charge of national security. I joke. Asking a lefty for suggestions on national security is like asking a conservative for tips on vegan restaurants. It's not our wheelhouse. But first, I don't blame them. This is what ideologues do when they're out of power. You play defense. Sure, it's petty to block nominations, but when it's all you've got, it's all you've got. Republicans have done it, too, but this is different. This is national security. When Republicans block, they usually have stronger alternatives to fill those spots, not wimpier ones. If the right hates your choices for national security, it's because they know national security. So we've got to ask, what is your alternative, oh, concerned activists, that won't please our enemies? Chelsea Manning to head the CIA? Bill Ayers for secretary of state? I exaggerate because it's fun. But whatever a left-winger suggests will always be toothless, for national security makes them wince. When you believe that enhanced interrogation is really mean to bad people who aren't really bad at all because they're just victims of America's oppressive foreign policy, you should probably go away and let the adults handle this.

He said, \"We're going to look forward to making sure we don't share your information.\" The entire business model of Facebook is making -- keeping people's personal data and then shopping it out to commercial interests for profit. I mean, that's what they do. They're like a surveillance company. They get all your data and all your friends' data. And then they give it to advertisers, and the advertisers chop it up, and then they target you. It's what they do. Just to be clear, we said this the other day.
