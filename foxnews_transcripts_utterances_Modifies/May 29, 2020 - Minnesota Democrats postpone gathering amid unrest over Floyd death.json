Kislyak proposes for President Vladimir Putin to talk to Donald Trump on January 21st, the day after Trump was inaugurated. I want to read part of that conversation. Flynn, says, \"Listen, a couple of things. Number one, what would I ask you guys to do and make sure that you can convey this, OK? Do not allow this administration to box us in, right now, OK?\" Kislyak responds, \"We have conveyed it.\" Flynn goes on to say, \"depending on what actions they take over this current issue of the cyber stuff, you know, they're going to dismiss a number of Russians out of the country. I understand all of that and I understand that you know, the information they have and all of that, but what I would ask Russia is not to do anything, because I know, if you have some sort of action to only make it reciprocal. Make it reciprocal, do not make it go any further than you have to. Because I do not want to get us into something that has to escalate on, you know, a tit-for-tat. You follow me, ambassador?\"  Bret, Kislyak then responds, I understand what you're saying, but you know, you might appreciate the sentiments that are raging right now in Moscow.\" Now, this all comes, Bret, as Michael Flynn's fate hangs in the balance. The attorney general has oust to drop the separate criminal case against Flynn, a judge has not agreed yet on that. That is still playing out in the courts.

And the Mueller probe conflated those two issues. The much larger issue is that we were told it was legitimate to think this three-star general might be a Russian asset. Looking at these transcripts, that shows just how absurd and unfair the charge was. Pretty much everything involving the Flynn probe has been suspect and stinky. Starting it was ridiculous. Keeping it open on this basis of this phone, which was about national security interests, was bad. Coming up with this Logan Act, trying to get him fired, the ambush interview, the series of criminal leaks, the pressuring of the son, the fact that his first counsel was conflicted, the way the judge is acting out.

Now, Ric Grenell, he was the former acting director of National Intelligence. He went ahead and declassified these transcripts earlier this week. The new DNI on the right of your screen, John Ratcliffe, released them to members of Congress today. That call that jumps out at first though is December 29th, 2016 when Flynn talks to the ambassador about Russians in the United States, expelled by the Obama administration. Kislyak proposes for President Vladimir Putin to talk to Donald Trump on January 21st, the day after Trump was inaugurated. I want to read part of that conversation. Flynn, says, \"Listen, a couple of things. Number one, what would I ask you guys to do and make sure that you can convey this, OK? Do not allow this administration to box us in, right now, OK?\" Kislyak responds, \"We have conveyed it.\" Flynn goes on to say, \"depending on what actions they take over this current issue of the cyber stuff, you know, they're going to dismiss a number of Russians out of the country. I understand all of that and I understand that you know, the information they have and all of that, but what I would ask Russia is not to do anything, because I know, if you have some sort of action to only make it reciprocal. Make it reciprocal, do not make it go any further than you have to. Because I do not want to get us into something that has to escalate on, you know, a tit-for-tat. You follow me, ambassador?\" Bret, Kislyak then responds, I understand what you're saying, but you know, you might appreciate the sentiments that are raging right now in Moscow.\" Now, this all comes, Bret, as Michael Flynn's fate hangs in the balance. The attorney general has oust to drop the separate criminal case against Flynn, a judge has not agreed yet on that. That is still playing out in the courts. Bret, we're still digesting these transcripts right now. It's about 25 pages, all of them though, are posted right now on Foxnews.com. Bret."

It's not enough for some people on the ground in Minneapolis and for the Floyd family."

I can appreciate and maybe respect those words that this seemed to move fast, but what really moved fast was watching that video on how quickly that young man died for, allegedly, at least what the reports suggests, allegedly forging a $20 check. Now, he should have been punished for that, very likely, but death, a knee to the neck with others watching. Will Smith, the great actor, said that racism is not a new thing, it's just being videoed now. And as much as I understand the process has to take time to work, it's puzzling, it's confounding, it's painful, it's angering for Americans of all stripes, and I would say to those Americans who may not quite fully understand or can't quite grasp what's happening, imagine your cousin, your sister, your brother, your parent, your best friend dying and you not believing there's a way to right that wrong or for justice to be served. That's what so many people that's what so many people are feeling. And people say we need a conversation about race. Sure, we need a conversation about race. But we need a bigger conversation about how law enforcement, whom I support, how they're going to be held to a standard that prevents these things, not just punishes them, but how do we prevent young black men from dying for forging a check?"
    },

      "utterance": "Yes, Mollie, the flipside of the reaction to the looting and the situation on the ground in Minneapolis, many people say they understand the anger of the community, as Harold is articulating it there, but what's happening on the ground is quite something else. MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR, \"THE FEDERALIST\": Not just many people. I think everybody knows that this was a horrible wrong, that George Floyd lost his life wrongly. There was no dissent about this, whether it's left, right, socialist, libertarian, conservative. Everybody saw the video and everybody saw what was wrong. And I think it's important to make a distention between people knowing that's wrong and working hard to change what has led to things like this happening and the riots that we're seeing. Riots are the complete breakdown of rule of law. They serve no justice. They destroy small business owners and large business owners. They break down community trust. So there is a big difference between righteously angry at things like this continuing to happen and rioting, and I think that we should remember that a lot of people are upset and focus on ways to improve things rather than handing over large American cities and having them fall to mobs."

      "utterance": "Chuck? CHARLES LANE, OPINION WRITER, \"WASHINGTON POST\": I can't really add too much to what the other have just said, except to say that we can't be naive about how long this has been going on. One of my earliest memories is the uprising in Washington, D.C., in 1968 after the assassination of Martin Luther King. This has been happening over and over and over again as long as I've been around, as long as I've been alive, and I'm 58-years-old. And this is fueling the kind of -- you can't excuse the destruction and violence, but you can certainly comprehend the frustration. These cases keep coming up. There is no permanent reform. There's no permanent solution. I really have to fear, as Congressman Ford said, you have to be very concerned about the basic social fabric of this country if we aren't able to fundamentally reform these institutions in a credible way."

I don't want this to happen, and that's what the expression put out last night means. It was spoken as a fact, not as a statement. It's very simple. Nobody should have any problem with this other than the haters and those looking to cause trouble on social media.

Presidents, in moments like this, when I served in Congress, 9/11 occurred, and President Bush worked his tail off to unite this country. He brought us together. I think this president is facing a moment like that. He's faced many moments like this, but there's a moment involving race and how it's roiling us and has it has roiled us. This is one of those moments where his language, he's got to be very careful about the tweets. I'm not going to read any more into his tweets. I don't read a lot of them, but I'm not going to read any more into it than he wants us to, but he should be careful about what he says and how he says it."

I want to say something about this Twitter issue, though. Twitter is meddling in the 2020 election, and they started this week by appending an editor's note that was false, fact-checking a prediction about a future event, are not doing a good job of doing that fact-check, nothing short of meddling in the 2020 election. Then they amped it up by actually flat out censoring not just the president's personal Twitter account but official government communications.

I think it's a real watershed that, at least in symbolic terms, a lot of the details have not really been revealed yet, they are lumping Hong Kong back together with the rest of mainland China and aggregating this two track approach the United States had to customs and tariffs with that territory on the basis of a belief that China has reneged on its commitment. That is a huge moment. It's got implications for all sort of things, including the future of Taiwan. And China has really until about September to fill in the blanks on its policy change.

I do hope he decides to be more consistent here, because when peaceful protesters in Hong Kong were beaten, we didn't speak up. I'm glad to hear the president speaking more forcefully, and I've always been a believer that we need to take a little harsher posture towards China.

    {
      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "I think there is a lot there. There's a minor point and a major point. The minor point is we were told for years that General Flynn had lied about discussing sanctions with this ambassador. At the end of the Obama administration, they put on financial sections and they expelled diplomats. What Flynn talks about in these calls is the expulsion of diplomats. And the Mueller probe conflated those two issues. The much larger issue is that we were told it was legitimate to think this three-star general might be a Russian asset. Looking at these transcripts, that shows just how absurd and unfair the charge was. Pretty much everything involving the Flynn probe has been suspect and stinky. Starting it was ridiculous. Keeping it open on this basis of this phone, which was about national security interests, was bad. Coming up with this Logan Act, trying to get him fired, the ambush interview, the series of criminal leaks, the pressuring of the son, the fact that his first counsel was conflicted, the way the judge is acting out. What has happened to this three-star general shouldn't be happening to anyone in this United States."
