Also ahead, the director of the National Economic Council, Larry Kudlow, on what it will take for the rest of the country to get back to work. And in the middle of all of this, a dump of documents revealing exculpatory evidence in the Michael Flynn case. Congressmen Jim Jordan and Trey Gowdy are turning their attention now to FBI Director Christopher Wray and what he's done about it in the last two years. All that and a lot more right here, right now on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\"   And, tomorrow morning, much of Florida will enter phase one of a three- phase opening, with the exception of three counties with the most COVID-19 cases. That's Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach. The executive order allowing some businesses, retail stores and state parks to reopen tomorrow morning, but only at 25 percent capacity. Joining me right now to tell us how he's gearing up is Florida governor Ron DeSantis.  Governor, it's good to have you this morning. Thanks so much for being here.",

We're going to follow a safe, smart, step-by-step approach to Florida's recovery. We're going to follow data and facts. But we are intent on moving forward to be able to get the society on its feet again.  Florida, we were doing so well before this pandemic hit. Our unemployment rate was 2.8 percent. We were having businesses come left and right. Our coffers were overflowing, even though we have very low taxes.  And I think we can get back there. It's not going to be like turning an on- and-off switch, but I think tomorrow will be an important first step. I think it's also important to point out to folks the way Florida approached this. Even though our hospitalization and infection and fatality rates are much lower than many of these other big states, particularly in the Northeast and Midwest, we did not necessarily -- quote -- \"shut everything down.\"  I had construction going. We had a lot of retail that was open. I actually accelerated road projects, because the traffic was down, so places like Orlando, Tampa, Miami, we accelerated and surged workers, and were able to knock out a whole bunch of stuff in a very short period of time that's going to be, I think, very good going forward.",

It was so well-thought-out. And to this day, we really haven't been able to tie any outbreaks back to those theme parks. So I think they were really concerned about safety. I think they have even better ideas. So I think that they will come online. It's not going to be phase one, but I think it will be something that happens.

So, we immediately worked to limit -- not have visitation, all the staff members had to be screened thoroughly before being able to go to work. We required the wearing of PPE. We sent rapid-response teams to go look at infection controls, assess needs and report back.  I have sent National Guard. I have got 50 National Guard strike teams going to nursing homes, conducting surveillance testing, so that we can identify clusters, if they're there, and limit them. And then my secretary of health administration, she said from the very beginning to hospitals, you cannot send a COVID-positive patient back into a nursing home that doesn't have the capacity to isolate with negative pressure, because, when you do that, then it spreads like wildfire.  So she did a really good job with that. And so what we're doing going forward is, I'm going to be unveiling a mobile R.V. lab that we can drive across Florida. The results are going to back in 45 minutes. So we're going to go to nursing homes, is going to be our number one thing, test the staff, test the residents. And, eventually, Maria, once we get enough rapid tests, I'd like to be able to test the family members and let them go visit their loved ones. These people haven't had visitors for close to two months. That's not an easy thing.   Obviously we have got to err on the side of safety. But if a son or daughter can get a test, and they're negative, then they should be able to go in and see -- see their parents.",

I spoke with the president about this last week. He asked me to come up with some suggestions about how you do it. And my view would be, if you're in a country that has an outbreak, and you want to fly into the United States, then I think that there should be a rapid test done in that country at the airport, in conjunction with the airlines, so that if you're negative, you board the plane and come.   I don't think people should just show up here COVID-positive and then have Floridians have to scramble to contain it. So I think we may be able to get there. I have people working on this in Florida for the proposal. I'm going to give it to the president.  But I know he's very concerned about it, because we have done all this mitigation. It's caused a lot of problems. But we needed to do it to stop the spread and to keep our hospitals from being overwhelmed. The last thing we want to do is to be doing a good job here and then have it seeded through people coming in from foreign countries.",

I think we can get those back off the mat, but, going forward, that obviously is going to be a problem. What I would say is, it's one thing to help a state with lost revenue from the pandemic, but this pandemic should not be used to bail out obligations that were run up over 20 or 30 years. I think that would be very unfair to the states that have done it well. And so I think, if you're going to make a state whole from pre-pandemic, that's one thing.

The growth rate in the third quarter could be well over 20 percent. And I want to add to that, as we formulate our own policies, there will be additional policy discussions with Congress.

And the governors have been terrific working with President Trump and Vice President Pence. I was in some of those meetings in the Oval Office this week with the governors. So that's all to the good. Regarding overall state and local assistance, we will see. The president has mentioned, of course, that that could be tied to the listing of sanctuary cities, which I think is a long-run issue that could be attended to now. I don't want to get ahead of the curve. He hasn't made up his mind yet. So we will see about the state aid. On the other side, the president, as you know, wants to put a payroll tax holiday for the employee side. We have it for the business side. We would like it for the employee side. That creates a 7.6 percent increase in after-tax wages. That would be a positive thing. We want to make sure that, for small businesses and actually all businesses, full 100 percent expensing.

And, this morning, we have more breaking bombshell news in an investigation that we have certainly been doing a deep dive in into China, whereas the Chinese communist government lied about the coronavirus.  Tell us what's most important in keeping China held accountable, Senator.  CRUZ: Well, I think the most important long-term national security and foreign policy consequence of this coronavirus pandemic is going to be a fundamental reassessment of the United States' relationship with China. I believe China is the most significant geopolitical threat to the United States for the next century. And I have been saying that for years. Many in Washington have not been interested in hearing it or have refused to listen. I think this coronavirus pandemic has opened the eyes of many in Congress, many in Washington, and even some in the media. If you look at the pandemic itself, the communist government in China bears enormous responsibility, enormous direct culpability for this pandemic. We know they covered it up. We know that when heroic whistle-blower doctors tried to draw attention to it in December of last year, the Chinese government shut them up, it punished them, it silenced them. Had they behaved responsibly and sent in health professionals and quarantined those infected, there's a real possibility this could have been a regional outbreak, and not a global pandemic. And the hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide are in a very real sense the direct responsibility of the communist Chinese government's lies.",

I had spoke out loudly against it. A number of us had, because Huawei is a multibillion-dollar espionage agency for China.

He tells the president about the dossier, the dossier they already knew was false, they knew was Russian disinformation, and they knew was paid for by the Clinton campaign.

All that and a lot more right here, right now on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" And, tomorrow morning, much of Florida will enter phase one of a three- phase opening, with the exception of three counties with the most COVID-19 cases. That's Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach. The executive order allowing some businesses, retail stores and state parks to reopen tomorrow morning, but only at 25 percent capacity.

I think it's going to be an important step for people of Florida to know that there is a light at the end of the tunnel. We're going to follow a safe, smart, step-by-step approach to Florida's recovery. We're going to follow data and facts. But we are intent on moving forward to be able to get the society on its feet again. Florida, we were doing so well before this pandemic hit. Our unemployment rate was 2.8 percent. We were having businesses come left and right. Our coffers were overflowing, even though we have very low taxes. And I think we can get back there. It's not going to be like turning an on- and-off switch, but I think tomorrow will be an important first step. I think it's also important to point out to folks the way Florida approached this. Even though our hospitalization and infection and fatality rates are much lower than many of these other big states, particularly in the Northeast and Midwest, we did not necessarily -- quote -- \"shut everything down.\" I had construction going. We had a lot of retail that was open. I actually accelerated road projects, because the traffic was down, so places like Orlando, Tampa, Miami, we accelerated and surged workers, and were able to knock out a whole bunch of stuff in a very short period of time that's going to be, I think, very good going forward."

And you were accelerating road projects in Tampa, right, even while traffic was down, which was -- put you ahead of the game."

This has really allowed us to make some great strides. So, within a couple weeks, we will be able to open entirely new interchanges there that I think people will be really excited about."

These parks were open all the way through the middle of March. And they were doing -- it was under the radar. A lot of people don't know, but they were doing ridiculous safety precautions. It was so well-thought-out. And to this day, we really haven't been able to tie any outbreaks back to those theme parks. So I think they were really concerned about safety. I think they have even better ideas. So I think that they will come online. It's not going to be phase one, but I think it will be something that happens. And I think you're going to see a lot of new innovations just to give people the confidence that it's a safe thing to do."

I want to ask you what you're doing there, because we have seen a real disaster in terms of the nursing homes in New York. How are you going to avoid what has taken place there? What have you already done in terms of nursing homes in Florida?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DESANTIS",
      "utterance": "Well ,those were the first actions we took in March, because we knew that this was a virus that affected elderly much more severely than people who were younger, particularly people under 50 who -- with no conditions. So, we immediately worked to limit -- not have visitation, all the staff members had to be screened thoroughly before being able to go to work. We required the wearing of PPE. We sent rapid-response teams to go look at infection controls, assess needs and report back. I have sent National Guard. I have got 50 National Guard strike teams going to nursing homes, conducting surveillance testing, so that we can identify clusters, if they're there, and limit them. And then my secretary of health administration, she said from the very beginning to hospitals, you cannot send a COVID-positive patient back into a nursing home that doesn't have the capacity to isolate with negative pressure, because, when you do that, then it spreads like wildfire. So she did a really good job with that. And so what we're doing going forward is, I'm going to be unveiling a mobile R.V. lab that we can drive across Florida. The results are going to back in 45 minutes. So we're going to go to nursing homes, is going to be our number one thing, test the staff, test the residents. And, eventually, Maria, once we get enough rapid tests, I'd like to be able to test the family members and let them go visit their loved ones. These people haven't had visitors for close to two months. That's not an easy thing. Obviously we have got to err on the side of safety. But if a son or daughter can get a test, and they're negative, then they should be able to go in and see -- see their parents."

      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",

Sounds very interesting. I want to ask you about international travel, Governor, because, to me, that seems like the last thing that's going to come back here. But Miami -- Florida is in an important place in terms of entering -- having foreigners enter the country. You have got a big population from Brazil coming to Miami. When are you expecting international travel to resume as part of this reopening?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DESANTIS",
      "utterance": "Well, a lot of that has been going on the whole time, actually. The European travel was stopped, Asian. But you have had people go. I spoke with the president about this last week. He asked me to come up with some suggestions about how you do it. And my view would be, if you're in a country that has an outbreak, and you want to fly into the United States, then I think that there should be a rapid test done in that country at the airport, in conjunction with the airlines, so that if you're negative, you board the plane and come. I don't think people should just show up here COVID-positive and then have Floridians have to scramble to contain it. So I think we may be able to get there. I have people working on this in Florida for the proposal. I'm going to give it to the president. But I know he's very concerned about it, because we have done all this mitigation. It's caused a lot of problems. But we needed to do it to stop the spread and to keep our hospitals from being overwhelmed. The last thing we want to do is to be doing a good job here and then have it seeded through people coming in from foreign countries."

Real quick on what you need now, Governor, because we had the mayor of New York City on last weekend, Bill de Blasio. He said, we need $7.5 billion right now of federal money. We need to be made whole. A lot of conversation about a next stimulus plan, a relief package, if you will, that will be targeted at the states. How much money does Florida need?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DESANTIS",
      "utterance": "Well, Florida, we were flush before this. We were going well. Obviously, this is going to hit our revenues, because you have had key sectors of our economy, like tourism, that have taken a huge hit. I think we can get those back off the mat, but, going forward, that obviously is going to be a problem. What I would say is, it's one thing to help a state with lost revenue from the pandemic, but this pandemic should not be used to bail out obligations that were run up over 20 or 30 years. I think that would be very unfair to the states that have done it well. And so I think, if you're going to make a state whole from pre-pandemic, that's one thing. But to go beyond that and to bail out pensions or do things like that, a lot of these states weren't being managed properly."

National Economic Council's Larry Kudlow weighs in on that when we come back, as we look ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" Coronavirus closures and stay-at-home orders hitting some sectors of the economy particularly hard, closed businesses, grounded flights slashing the demand for oil, sending prices to unprecedented lows. Larry Kudlow is the National Economic Council director, and he joins me right now. Larry, nice to see a weekend where many businesses are beginning to open.

We have the federal guidelines, as you know, data-dependent. It's got to be, within 14 days, the numbers have to be coming down. The states themselves will have their own guidelines. Everyone is emphasizing best-practices behavior, distancing. Testing is picking up very, very rapidly. So I think things look a little better.

      "speaker": "KUDLOW",
      "utterance": "Yes, I am. Look, it's funny. These terms recession, I understand that, but this is different than past recessions. This is different than past history. We basically shut down the economy as a means of fighting this highly infectious virus. So, you know, nothing like this ever happened before in American history. So, yes, we are in a deep contraction. There's a lot of hardship out there. We have done the best we can with liquidity and cash to keep people afloat. It's very, very difficult. Unemployment, as you know, is going to continue to rise. But, having said all of that, as we move into the second half of year -- and I want to quote the Congressional Budget Office, as well as a bunch of private forecasters and The Wall Street Journal forecasting survey. Maria, they're looking for a substantial rebound of, say, 17 to 20 percent in the second half of the year, beginning in the third quarter. The growth rate in the third quarter could be well over 20 percent. And I want to add to that, as we formulate our own policies, there will be additional policy discussions with Congress. We want to move towards long- run growth incentives. President Trump cut taxes and regulations for middle-income folks, better trade deals, boosting the energy system. That worked. We had terrific growth in earlier years. Even the beginning of this year, we were growing at better than 3 percent."

Are you planning another stimulus or a relief package for states and for local areas? We had Mayor de Blasio on last week. He said New York City needs $7.5 billion right now, government -- the federal government has to make New York City whole. What about that? And then can you walk us through some of the incentives that you're working on to make 2021 one of the best economic years on record?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KUDLOW",
      "utterance": "Yes. Well, look, we will see -- in a few weeks, probably, we will see the discussion with our friends on Capitol Hill. The president is not necessarily opposed to medical-related supplies, to COVID-19-related assistance to the states. We have already given them, as you know, hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars for medical equipment and testing and a variety of ways. And the governors have been terrific working with President Trump and Vice President Pence. I was in some of those meetings in the Oval Office this week with the governors. So that's all to the good. Regarding overall state and local assistance, we will see. The president has mentioned, of course, that that could be tied to the listing of sanctuary cities, which I think is a long-run issue that could be attended to now. I don't want to get ahead of the curve. He hasn't made up his mind yet. So we will see about the state aid. On the other side, the president, as you know, wants to put a payroll tax holiday for the employee side. We have it for the business side. We would like it for the employee side. That creates a 7.6 percent increase in after-tax wages. That would be a positive thing. We want to make sure that, for small businesses and actually all businesses, full 100 percent expensing. You know, that's especially important. As these restaurants and shops and whatnot, as they open up, they're going to have to pay for a lot of new equipment to be safe and sound."

I believe China is the most significant geopolitical threat to the United States for the next century. And I have been saying that for years. Many in Washington have not been interested in hearing it or have refused to listen. I think this coronavirus pandemic has opened the eyes of many in Congress, many in Washington, and even some in the media. If you look at the pandemic itself, the communist government in China bears enormous responsibility, enormous direct culpability for this pandemic. We know they covered it up. We know that when heroic whistle-blower doctors tried to draw attention to it in December of last year, the Chinese government shut them up, it punished them, it silenced them. Had they behaved responsibly and sent in health professionals and quarantined those infected, there's a real possibility this could have been a regional outbreak, and not a global pandemic. And the hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide are in a very real sense the direct responsibility of the communist Chinese government's lies."

I had spoke out loudly against it. A number of us had, because Huawei is a multibillion-dollar espionage agency for China. And if they build the infrastructure, it gives them the ability to surveil and to intercept.

So they go into universities. M.D. Anderson had a number of instances of Chinese nationals on the payroll of the Chinese communist government making more from China than they were making from M.D. Anderson who were stealing their intellectual property. And this, by the way, isn't missile technology. This is treatments and cures for cancer. They're doing this at universities throughout the United States. They're doing this at businesses throughout the United States. You know, this week, I have got four pieces of legislation I'm introducing.

But when this case is over, I'm going to ask questions, like, why did the field office recommend dropping the case, and Peter Strzok and the seventh floor insisted that it go forward? Seems to me there's a tale of two FBIs here, the FBI agents that we all admire in the field office and this hit squad that McCabe and Comey put together operating out of the seventh floor. I want to know why Flynn was being surveilled by the Obama administration to begin with. The Obama administration is surveilling the national security adviser of the president-elect. What the hell was that all about? I want to know why they were looking at manufacturing a crime, rather than investigating the one -- investigating a crime. The field agents wanted to drop the case. It was the seventh floor at the FBI said, no, we got to go forward. It is now time to understand how the seventh floor operated. I will be all over that. Mr. President, don't give Flynn a pardon yet. Let the system work out. He deserves a new trial. And that case should be dismissed because of prosecutorial misconduct. That's the right answer here."

But it doesn't matter what I do or what Ted Cruz does or Tom Cotton or Marsha Blackburn or Martha McSally. Where is Pelosi and Schumer? We have all got good ideas on the Republican side. The president wants to be tough. Where is the Democratic Party? Don't give China a pass. So, to Senator Schumer and Nancy Pelosi, why don't you work with me and others to hold accountable -- China accountable for killing over 60,000 Americans, and having 30 million people lose their job?

Not one Democrat has come forward with any idea to hold accountable China for killing over 60,000 Americans by withholding information about the virus and putting 30 million Americans out of work, because that's what we had to do to save probably a million lives.

      "utterance": "That there was absolutely no evidence that Michael Flynn was an agent of a foreign power the entire time they spent looking at him. In December of 2016, they had nothing. So they're about to close the investigation without even interviewing him. Keep in mind, they had no interest in interviewing Michael Flynn. They're about to close the case. Then you get the call with Kislyak. And Peter Strzok seems more interested in setting up an American general than he is figuring out what the Russian generals were doing to this country. They send two agents over there without informing the White House, without informing the Department of Justice, and they wanted to set him up. That is not the FBI that this country needs."

January 6, the FBI and other people in the intel community in the Obama administration go to Trump Tower and try to set up the president. Remember, this is where Jim Comey says after the meeting is done, I want to talk to the president. He tells the president about the dossier, the dossier they already knew was false, they knew was Russian disinformation, and they knew was paid for by the Clinton campaign. And then, just two weeks after that, we have the FBI going to the White House to set up Michael Flynn. All that happens in three weeks' time. This shows you they were out to get the president, and they were willing to do whatever it took to get him, including going after a three-star general who had served our country for three decades."

Will we see accountability, Trey?"

I bet Jimmy can't name a single Democrat that is interested in the House at looking into the treatment of the FBI. When I was there, the Democrats finally found a cop that they liked. Unfortunately, his name was Peter Strzok, whose only interest in this investigation was if it would lead to the impeachment of Donald Trump."

You just said a minute ago on your way out, Jerry Nadler will not even bring Michael Horowitz in to question. We already know that they made 17 errors, according to the I.G. report. You're saying that your committee chairman will not bring him into find out what the heck happened here."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JORDAN",
      "utterance": "No. He had this scathing report about the Carter Page FISA, wouldn't bring him in. Neither would the Oversight Committee. And now Mr. Horowitz is working on a broader look at FISA. And just four weeks ago, he sent out a memo which said he's looked at 29 cases, 29 cases, random sample, 29 cases, and there were major problems in every single one. In four of those cases, they couldn't even find the Woods file, which is a file they keep which has the sort of basic evidence, underlying evidence, that they then use to take to the court. Couldn't even find the Woods file. And what I find interesting is, two months ago, when Chris Wray did testify, FBI Director Wray testified in front of the Judiciary Committee, he told us we could all sleep well at night, the FISA process is fine. Well, somebody is wrong here. Either Christopher Wray is wrong when he said, we can all sleep well at night, or Michael Horowitz. And I'll tell you what. Mr. Horowitz has done good work. So, I'm wondering what Christopher Wray is really up to when it comes to reforming this FISA process, which we know was at the heart of this whole Trump-Russia investigation."

He's the one who interviewed General Flynn. He was simultaneously working on an investigation into Hillary Clinton's e-mails. So, did he lie then? And did he lie on the Hillary Clinton e-mail investigation? Is that going to come up again?"

So, I'm going to ask you and your viewers, which of those words come to mind when you think of Peter Strzok promising to stop candidate Trump, interested in the impeachment, but not the interference? Which of those three words comes to mind when you hear Jim Comey say, we're going to see what we can get away with, or when you read notes about a pretextual defensive briefing? Which of those three words that are supposed to personify the FBI, which of those three words do you think about over the last four years, when the world's premier law enforcement agency has been riddled with bias and incompetence?"
