Consistent with the Committee's longstanding procedures, Committee staff appropriately advised the whistleblower to contact an Inspector General to seek legal counsel. At no point did the Committee review or receive the complaint in advance.\" That is the statement from Schiff's staff. Obviously, this is raising a lot of eyebrows here in Washington. Let's bring in our panel, Tom Bevan, Real Clear Politics co-founder and president, Susan Ferrechio, Chief Congressional Correspondent for the \"Washington Examiner,\" and Charles Lane, opinion writer for \"The Washington Post.\"   Susan, when this hit, the president jumped on it right away. And he was asked about it, and said he probably helped write the complaint. That is denied by Adam Schiff, but it does raise questions about the outreach. SUSAN FERRECHIO, \"WASHINGTON EXAMINER\": Yes, and Republicans have been sharing these concerns with me for quite a while, that they felt that Schiff had some kind of advance notice about the whistleblower, and their belief that he orchestrated or worked with the whistleblower to write this complaint, to have it look a certain way. Now, the Intelligence Committee Democrats are saying that is absolutely not the case, that they followed the protocol, that they sent him to a lawyer, but this does have the feel of something that maybe Schiff knew about in advance, and Republicans have been worried about this for quite some time.",

And they do emphasize the fact that when you have something moving this fast, people are going to commit to their footfalls. But I think the problem, I agree with Tom it will help the president muddy the waters. But the problem with muddying the waters is that the president, however this whistleblower thing came to light, whether it was a set up or not, the president himself released the transcript that supports the underlying accusation here, which is that he might have been up to no good in terms of steering -- conditioning aid to the Ukraine on their doing him a, quote-unquote, doing him a favor.",

Without that vote, Susan, it prevents ranking members on the Committee from issuing subpoenas on their own. It also prevents the minority from arguing the case on the House floor before that vote. And if you look at the formal impeachment inquiries before, Richard Nixon, the vote was 410 to four in 1974, Bill Clinton 258 to 176. This is to launch the formal impeachment inquiry. So she's not unprecedented right now what she's doing.",

They can just bring it up on the floor as articles of impeachment and they can proceed without special rules that would be set in place. For Bill Clinton, there were four hearings. The minority didn't get much. They can ask for subpoenas, but they don't have the power like the majority does to just issue them. They have to get agreement from the majority. So that's a little bit of a stretch to say they would be able to subpoena. However, they did get the White House Counsel to come on behalf of Clinton, so that did help. As part of their impeachment inquiry, they got one of their citizens. They could get that in this instance, too.  But what this does, I think, is it give the speaker maximum flexibility to decide how she wants to proceed. This just could go nowhere. If it was a formal inquiry, people would be expecting to come back on the floor at some point. So although it looks like this is barreling towards a vote on articles of impeachment, this gives her maximum control, which I know she really wants.",

And if Democrats go down this road and all they have is this transcript, as Chuck mentioned, which, by the way, the Republican side and Trump supporters see nothing wrong with what happened in that transcript, if that's all they've got and they are going to jam this thing through and try to get it done by Thanksgiving I think is what they are now saying, that could be a huge political mistake.",

And this talking point about the House vote is one of their stronger points, because it is an exception to the past practice, and so forth. But so far, I don't think that has affected, sunk through the way Tom is saying to the public perception of those. I think the Democrats -- Adam Schiff was not kidding.

      "utterance": "He did know, though. Official word from the spokesperson, \"The whistleblower contacted committee for guidance and how to report possible wrongdoing within the jurisdiction of Intelligence Community. Consistent with the Committee's longstanding procedures, Committee staff appropriately advised the whistleblower to contact an Inspector General to seek legal counsel. At no point did the Committee review or receive the complaint in advance.\" That is the statement from Schiff's staff. Obviously, this is raising a lot of eyebrows here in Washington. Let's bring in our panel, Tom Bevan, Real Clear Politics co-founder and president, Susan Ferrechio, Chief Congressional Correspondent for the \"Washington Examiner,\" and Charles Lane, opinion writer for \"The Washington Post.\" Susan, when this hit, the president jumped on it right away. And he was asked about it, and said he probably helped write the complaint. That is denied by Adam Schiff, but it does raise questions about the outreach. SUSAN FERRECHIO, \"WASHINGTON EXAMINER\": Yes, and Republicans have been sharing these concerns with me for quite a while, that they felt that Schiff had some kind of advance notice about the whistleblower, and their belief that he orchestrated or worked with the whistleblower to write this complaint, to have it look a certain way. Now, the Intelligence Committee Democrats are saying that is absolutely not the case, that they followed the protocol, that they sent him to a lawyer, but this does have the feel of something that maybe Schiff knew about in advance, and Republicans have been worried about this for quite some time."

And that turns out to not be true. Look, this is a gift to Trump. And as everybody is racing to try and frame the narrative here, this is a gift to Donald Trump in the sense that he can now muddy the waters and say, look, this was a set up. This is a fraud. This is a hoax. And as this impeachment train is now racing down the tracks, it is very valuable for Trump to be able to muddy the waters with this."

One was the made-up statement of the call which he read in Congressional testimony, which the president has hit on again and again, and then this story. CHARLES LANE, OPINION WRITER, \"WASHINGTON POST\": Yes, they're footfalls, I would say. And they do emphasize the fact that when you have something moving this fast, people are going to commit to their footfalls. But I think the problem, I agree with Tom it will help the president muddy the waters. But the problem with muddying the waters is that the president, however this whistleblower thing came to light, whether it was a set up or not, the president himself released the transcript that supports the underlying accusation here, which is that he might have been up to no good in terms of steering -- conditioning aid to the Ukraine on their doing him a, quote-unquote, doing him a favor."

      "speaker": "PELOSI",
      "utterance": "There is no requirement that there be a floor vote. That's not anything that is excluded. And by the way, some Republicans are very nervous about our bringing that vote to the floor."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Well, that is interesting. There are some moderate Democrats who are nervous about the possibility of that vote as well. Without that vote, Susan, it prevents ranking members on the Committee from issuing subpoenas on their own. It also prevents the minority from arguing the case on the House floor before that vote. And if you look at the formal impeachment inquiries before, Richard Nixon, the vote was 410 to four in 1974, Bill Clinton 258 to 176. This is to launch the formal impeachment inquiry. So she's not unprecedented right now what she's doing."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FERRECHIO",
      "utterance": "No, not at all. And I think you are right about that, it does shut out the minority. They can just bring it up on the floor as articles of impeachment and they can proceed without special rules that would be set in place. For Bill Clinton, there were four hearings. The minority didn't get much. They can ask for subpoenas, but they don't have the power like the majority does to just issue them. They have to get agreement from the majority. So that's a little bit of a stretch to say they would be able to subpoena. However, they did get the White House Counsel to come on behalf of Clinton, so that did help. As part of their impeachment inquiry, they got one of their citizens. They could get that in this instance, too. But what this does, I think, is it give the speaker maximum flexibility to decide how she wants to proceed. This just could go nowhere. If it was a formal inquiry, people would be expecting to come back on the floor at some point. So although it looks like this is barreling towards a vote on articles of impeachment, this gives her maximum control, which I know she really wants."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Right, and when I said the White House is pushing back, we're hearing there is going to be some formal pushback about the process, this lack of a vote, the lack of a minority representation, the Adam Schiff stuff, it will come formally."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BEVAN",
      "utterance": "It gives Speaker Pelosi maximum flexibility, but what it also does is impart to the public that it's not a serious inquiry, that she's not willing to take the step to make it a serious inquiry. And that implies that it's mostly political. And if Democrats go down this road and all they have is this transcript, as Chuck mentioned, which, by the way, the Republican side and Trump supporters see nothing wrong with what happened in that transcript, if that's all they've got and they are going to jam this thing through and try to get it done by Thanksgiving I think is what they are now saying, that could be a huge political mistake."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "On the flipside, Republicans obviously are trying to hold ranks here, but they've got some concerns of their own. And the president, speaking out, pushing back angrily today, because he feels like he's been under attack for his entire presidency."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LANE",
      "utterance": "Well, it is interesting that they are finally starting to, according to what you're reporting, organize a real impeachment defense, which is what other presidents have done with lawyers and organized communication strategy, and not the president just kind of raging and embarrassing the president of Finland at this press conference. And this talking point about the House vote is one of their stronger points, because it is an exception to the past practice, and so forth. But so far, I don't think that has affected, sunk through the way Tom is saying to the public perception of those. I think the Democrats -- Adam Schiff was not kidding. The Democrats are worried that this will sort of spiral on and on. And they want to do something crisp and quick. That would certainly be in their political interest, I think."

      "speaker": "FERRECHIO",
      "utterance": "And I think ultimately what is going to matter here is less the procedure, although with everything we are saying here, because once they bring up articles of impeachment, no one is going to be talking about an inquiry vote anymore. This is where the rubber meets the road here. Here is the article vote, let's have it. What is going to really matter is where these poll numbers are on the president's behavior. Do people feel like he should be impeached for this? Do people feel like he acted in the wrong way? That I think is going to ultimately dictate what happens on the floor of the House."

Mayor Emanuel was like that, Lori Lightfoot seems to be pushing it even further. This is a problem where we have federal law that says one thing and then we have states and local jurisdictions passing laws and policies that are in direct contravention of those and contradiction with those, and it puts people in an awful situation. Sanctuary cities are just one of them. We have the same thing with marijuana policy, we have the same thing with abortion policy, and this is something that's going on all around the country.

The key fact -- and again, I repeat, there is a lot we don't know --- the key fact is that he detained this person, right, he held him."

    {
      "speaker": "FERRECHIO",
      "utterance": "You are reading my mind. I think the great, untold story about immigration and the whole controversy is how it affects local jurisdictions, how it affects police officers, how it affects crime, school systems, school budgets, property taxes, quality of life. A lot of the people living illegally in Fairfax County, Montgomery County, places around Washington are members of the community who pay taxes and have been here for a long time. Some of them are people like the person pulled over driving on suspended license, may well have had other offenses there. That is often the case with people who are pulled over like this. These are issues that local communities grapple with, and they don't often know the details, what the jurisdictions are deciding in their favor. A lot of people don't even realize that someone is not going to be detained by ICE and that their governments have decided to do that."
