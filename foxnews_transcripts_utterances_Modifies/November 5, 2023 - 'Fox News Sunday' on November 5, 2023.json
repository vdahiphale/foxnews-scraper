And then we passed, as you saw, our first priority is an emergency immediate funding aid to Israel so they can defeat Hamas and protect and continue as a nation. That's what's at stake.

A group of Democrats say this and there's opposition from both sides on that plan, as well. But they say: Republicans can't move their extreme, cruel anti-immigrant agenda through the regular legislative process. So, they're trying to make an end-run around Congress and exploit two foreign wars to force it into law. They say Republicans don't actually want to work on things that would change the problems at the border, beefing up port entry, personnel, things like more legal pathways to citizenship and getting at a root crosses -- causes of migration.

But we have to take care of our own house first, and securing our border is an essential priority to American people. So they're not listening to their constituents, I think that's a tone-deaf response. Again, we can do all of these things together. But when -- when you couple Ukraine and the border, that makes sense to people because they say, if we're going to protect Ukraine's border, and we have to do what is necessary there, we don't want Vladimir Putin to prevail. We can't afford that. The free world can't afford that. But we have to take care of our own border first. And that's what we're saying. This is policy changes that are necessary. There's a growing consensus in the Congress, certainly amongst Republicans, but also even some across the aisle who recognize we have to change what is happening over 6.3 million illegal crossings since Joe Biden took office. It's more than the population of my state.

The Supreme Court of the United States is defined this extremely broadly it can be health, can mean something having to do with her income, it can have something to do with, about children she has, and again, it is the person performing the abortion in that clinic, who's going to make that determination, and there's no review of it. So as a practical matter, they were very mindful, the lawyers very mindful what they were, language they were using. This allows abortion at any point in the pregnancy. And that is just much, much too far. We've had on the books, for example, in Ohio, a law that deals with partial birth abortion and prohibits that. We had a doctor in Dayton, Ohio, who was performing these. We stopped that because of the law in Ohio. This constitutional amendment, because it is a constitutional amendment, not just a law, it would be a constitutional amendment would -- would trump that law as well as it would trump the parental consent law. So a very, a proposal that is just way too far and again, whether someone is pro-choice or pro-life. This is just not where the majority of Ohioans are.",

Olivia Beavers, congressional reporter for \"Politico,\" Fox News senior political analyst Juan Williams, Guy Benson, host of \"The Guy Benson Show,\" and former Bush national security official Michael Allen. Welcome to all of you. So, I want to pick up where we left off with the governor in Ohio. We do have important state elections this week. One of them involves Governor Glenn Youngkin, who is trying to prove his win was not a fluke in Virginia, which is very blue these days. This issue of abortion, new polling shows us it is something that Virginia voters are very dialed into. Here is what Younkin says. He argues that his proposal, which is a 15-week abortion limit with exceptions for rape, incest and life of the mother, represents a politically acceptable compromise between those who want to ban all abortions and those who would see no legal limits. He's quoted as saying, people recognize that's a reasonable place. Guy, that's just one of the issue on the ballot essentially, not - not, you know, legitimately, but in theory GUY BENSON, \"THE GUY BENSON SHOW\" HOST, TOWNHALL.COM AND FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes. And it's a completely reasonable position. It's sort of a European-style proposal. The Democrats, the ads they're running on this, are suggesting that the Republicans would ban every abortion ever in Virginia, which isn't true. What I'm struck by, watching this Virginia race develop, is, number one, Governor Younkin is very popular in the commonwealth. He's got plus 20, plus 25 approval rating. Can he parlay that into coattails down ballot? He's working very hard. He's very invested in this race. The other dynamic that I'm seeing is, the Democrats are running their 2022 playbook, which was pretty successful for them. Trump, MAGA, abortion distortions, in my view on the later part. The Republicans in Virginia are running the 2021 successful playbook that Younkin won with on schools, education, crime, economy and that sort of thing. It will be fascinating on Tuesday to see which two - which of those two approaches prevails.",

And then you get into some really difficult issues, as we saw in the debate this week, where, you know, Cameron was asked about something like vouchers. And you would think for Republicans that's a strong point. But in rural areas of the state, they see that as a threat to their public schools, so he wouldn't say his position.

Olivia, that's tough news for the White House this morning. And some of these, the margins are not close at all. OLIVIA BEAVERS, \"POLITICO\" CONGRESSIONAL REPORTER: No, there is -- in Nevada there is a 10-point lead for Trump. I would say this is pretty devastating. It was going over issues where they feel like Donald Trump is prevailing, on economy, on national security, on border and immigration, which are some of the top issues of this upcoming election, where they felt like Biden, which we were talking about, is leading is abortion.

Right now, we're with the Israeli military in an armored personnel carrier. The Israelis have cut the Gaza Strip in half. They fought their way to the Mediterranean Sea and encircled Gaza City.

As this is taking place, they've been ambushed. They've lost more than two dozen of their own soldiers and the battle continues.

The demonstrators are voicing anger for president's support of Israel and refusal to back a ceasefire.

We've got images of it and of what transpired last night when some of them took to the White House defacing one of the gates there, climbing on the gates. Are you surprised at all by the amount that we've seen of this kind of response -- and I have -- to be fair, a lot of people I saw in that rally yesterday were very much worried about civilian lives that are being lost in Gaza. But there were others who were saying things that were clearly indicative of making sure that Israel no longer exists on the world map."

Apparently, it's been dormant for a while, but this has given rise to that. And we're deeply concerned about it. The opening to the program today, Shannon, I think gave a great snapshot of the crisis that Israel faces. And that's why, right off the block, as soon as I became speaker, within the hour, we passed a resolution to make clear that Congress stands by our great friend in that region, we always will. And then we passed, as you saw, our first priority is an emergency immediate funding aid to Israel so they can defeat Hamas and protect and continue as a nation. That's what's at stake. I spoke to Prime Minister Netanyahu on Saturday evening a week ago and he said this is a battle between good versus evil, light versus darkness. I could not agree and the world can see that."

What they don't like is that in the House, we're trying to be good stewards of the taxpayers' resources. We offset that spending. Instead of printing new dollars and/or borrowing it from another nation to send over to fulfill our obligations and help our ally, we want to pay for it. What a concept, and we're trying to change how Washington works. And so, by taking that money from this giant fund, over $65 billion that's sitting there to build up the IRS, we weighed those priorities and said, you know what? It's more important to protect Israel right now than it is to hire more IRS agents."

And they said actually, if you take that funding from the IRS, it's going to add billions to the deficit because you cut IRS personnel. They are not then collecting that revenue that they bring in. One of your House colleagues, Democrat Brendan Boyle, put it this way. He says you are prioritizing, quote, deficit-busting tax giveaways for the wealthy over helping Israel."

Listen, we're taking care of our priorities and we will. We know that these other important measures that right there on the table and we're working through it hour by hour, day-by-day and we're going to meet those obligations. But we have to do things in the proper order and we are committed to changing how Washington works. I think you see a united and energized House conference. All of our members are working together in good faith trying to solve these great challenges that we face, and I'm very optimistic that we're going to do that. But we are going to also change the trajectory we're on. Shannon, right now, we have $33.6 trillion federal debt. Just last week, the Treasury Department and the Biden administration announced that we're going to have to borrow over $1.5 trillion over the next two quarters, six months, to continue our operation as a government. This is not a sustainable track. We can take care of our obligations and we can do it in a responsible manner and that's what we're committed to."

      "speaker": "A group of Democrats say this and there's opposition from both sides on that plan, as well. But they say",
      "utterance": "Republicans can't move their extreme, cruel anti-immigrant agenda through the regular legislative process. So, they're trying to make an end-run around Congress and exploit two foreign wars to force it into law. They say Republicans don't actually want to work on things that would change the problems at the border, beefing up port entry, personnel, things like more legal pathways to citizenship and getting at a root crosses -- causes of migration. So, are there things that you can work on, and you can get bipartisan buy- in in attaching that to Ukraine aid, or is this going to be about holding your caucus together and getting all the Republican votes where you have very small majority?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JOHNSON",
      "utterance": "What this is about is advancing the agenda and first priority is the American people. I don't know which Democrat gave you that absurd quote, but they're clearly not listening to their constituents. If you go into the country, people will say, look, we understand our role as a leader in the free world, we understand that we're the great superpower that needs to assist and ensure that freedom survives. But we have to take care of our own house first, and securing our border is an essential priority to American people. So they're not listening to their constituents, I think that's a tone-deaf response. Again, we can do all of these things together. But when -- when you couple Ukraine and the border, that makes sense to people because they say, if we're going to protect Ukraine's border, and we have to do what is necessary there, we don't want Vladimir Putin to prevail. We can't afford that. The free world can't afford that. But we have to take care of our own border first. And that's what we're saying. This is policy changes that are necessary. There's a growing consensus in the Congress, certainly amongst Republicans, but also even some across the aisle who recognize we have to change what is happening over 6.3 million illegal crossings since Joe Biden took office. It's more than the population of my state. We cannot continue this and everyone knows it and the fentanyl that's come over the border of human trafficking, the cartels making billions of dollars on our backs. We're going to stop that. And the House Republicans are committed to it. I think that people are with us, Shannon."

      "speaker": "BREAM",

We're running out of money here again, in a couple of weeks. Are we going to have another continuing resolution that temporary financial band-aid, how long would it last? Would it be clean? Are you going to try to attach other things to it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JOHNSON",

On a stopgap measure, we recognize that we may not get all the appropriations bills done by this deadline of November 17. But we're going to continue in good faith. And the difference between what we call on Capitol Hill and continuing resolution now and what we've dealt with in years past is that this would allow us time and everybody understands, allow us time to continue this appropriations process. We're committed to bringing 12 bills to the floor as the law -- statutory law requires Congress to do that hasn't been done in many years. But again, we're changing the way Washington works because we believe it needs to be more accountable and more transparent for the people. And so we're going to fight that fight every single day. And we'll get that job done."

One of the groups opposing you says this. He wants a total abortion ban with no exceptions. He supported bans that would not only criminalize abortion, but ban IVF treatments, and common forms of birth control. And that you voted against access to contraception.

So I come to Congress with deep personally held convictions. But guess what, sort of, my 434 other colleagues in the House, everyone comes to Congress with their deeply held convictions. But the process here is that you make law by consensus. And I've not brought forward any measure to address any of those issues. Right now, our priorities are funding the government, handling these -- these massive national security priorities that we have in crises around the globe, and taking care of changing and reforming how Congress works. That's what we're going to do. Listen, I -- prior to the modern time, I mean, until recently, actually, almost all of our nation's leaders openly acknowledged that they were also Bible-believing Christians. So I mean, this is not something that should cause great unrest. OK, it's just that Washington right now, what you're seeing, Washington and the Associated Press Corps are engaging with a leader who openly acknowledges faith and in the foundational principles of our country."

There's a lengthy guest essay in the New York Times, not surprisingly, not big fans of yours. It's titled this, \"The Embodiment of White Christian Nationalism in a Tailored Suit.\" They point to a definition in Christianity today of that saying it's a belief that the American nation is defined by Christianity, and that the government should take active steps to keep it that way.

Those are essential American principles. And so I've been labeled all kinds of stuff, but these people don't know me. Look, my family, it's no fun to be misquoted and maligned and -- and mocked, of course, but we know that comes with a job, and we're unfazed. We're going to continue to love all people.

And, two, that they recognize that helping the Palestinian people is not just a good thing to do, it is a smart tactical move, because what you want to do is separate Hamas and the Palestinian people. And you do that by making it appear, in fact, make it a reality that they can find some support, medical support, humanitarian support, within the Israel lines, and they can't find that within Hamas' controlled territory."

But what they have to do, not only for the complying with the rule of law, but also winning the battle of minds and hearts, is to do it in such a way as that they don't -- or they minimize the harm to civilians. And that's what we're trying to help them with. We want them to get better intelligence. We're helping them with intelligence. We want that intelligence to inform selected targets, precise targets, want them to use precision-guided weapons systems with smaller diameter bombs. So they really hit the people they're going after. And then we want them also to be able to show how not just Israel but the entire world community wants to provide basic necessities to Palestinian people. This would deliver a blow, not just tactically, but also politically to Hamas. And the goal is to end that threat to Israel, which is existential, Hamas does wonders for the State of Israel."

That was what the appetite was there. We know it's different over in the Senate. And there's talk of again, linking it together with Ukrainian aid. But it was interesting, the Gallup Poll shows now that Americans are growing skeptical of providing unlimited continued aid to Ukraine. The number of Americans who say the U.S. is doing too much in that particular conflict, has jumped 12 points since just June. Do you worry that tagging those things together may slow down as Ukraine is less popular? The aid actually getting to Israel in a more timely fashion?"

They're in the midst of a very serious conflict with the Russians. The Russians may have staged a major counterattack weeks ago. And they're tense casualties on both sides, particularly the Russian side. So we can't just sit back and let time go by, and we have to support the Ukrainians. And it's in our interest. And frankly, and when I was talking to Secretary Austin at the hearing on Appropriations, he indicated, which I believe is, listen, if we don't provide these resources to Ukraine right now, it raises the probability that in the months or years ahead, we'll have to send American forces. It's better in my view, to support the Ukrainian people now and their forces than to see a situation where we are pulled into a conflict with our young men and women. So this is a, not only the right thing to do, it's a, I think, a very, very smart thing to do."

See, look, this is what we've been talking about. Our greatest fears or nightmares, our coming true. And this is our time to stand up and fight back. Abortion measures generally have not done well in the post office decision after the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe.

It would enshrine in our Constitution the right to have an abortion up Until birth, so at any time during the pregnancy. The second thing it would do is really threaten a law that we've had on the books for many years, requires parental consent, if we're dealing with a minor. So the lawyers who wrote this vote were very mindful for what they were doing. It is a radical proposal. It does not fit Ohio. And that's what's going to be voted on in two days."

It says that the patient's treating physician, the pregnant woman, they have the ability to determine if the fetus has a significant likelihood of survival outside the uterus, with reasonable measures. The AP puts it this way, it says, Ohio lawmakers could still restrict abortion beyond the point where a fetus can survive outside the womb. And with modern medicine, referred to the point of as viability is typically about 23 or 24 weeks into pregnancy. There's wide support across the country for that. There is still the issue of viability. They -- you know, critics will argue that what you're saying is, it's not true that it's up until the moment of birth, your response?"
    },

      "speaker": "DEWINE",
      "utterance": "Now, that's just absolutely not true. Constitutional scholars who have looked at that certainly have a very different opinion. First of all, the viability question will be determined by the person performing the abortion at the Planned Parenthood or wherever that has been done. So that's the person who's going to determine it. And there's no review of that. Second, there is a wide, wide exception written into this law, which talks about the health of the mother. The Supreme Court of the United States is defined this extremely broadly it can be health, can mean something having to do with her income, it can have something to do with, about children she has, and again, it is the person performing the abortion in that clinic, who's going to make that determination, and there's no review of it. So as a practical matter, they were very mindful, the lawyers very mindful what they were, language they were using. This allows abortion at any point in the pregnancy. And that is just much, much too far. We've had on the books, for example, in Ohio, a law that deals with partial birth abortion and prohibits that. We had a doctor in Dayton, Ohio, who was performing these. We stopped that because of the law in Ohio. This constitutional amendment, because it is a constitutional amendment, not just a law, it would be a constitutional amendment would -- would trump that law as well as it would trump the parental consent law. So a very, a proposal that is just way too far and again, whether someone is pro-choice or pro-life. This is just not where the majority of Ohioans are."

      "speaker": "BREAM",
      "utterance": "For a deeper dive on all the big issues this week, including Tuesday's elections, let's bring in our Sunday group. Olivia Beavers, congressional reporter for \"Politico,\" Fox News senior political analyst Juan Williams, Guy Benson, host of \"The Guy Benson Show,\" and former Bush national security official Michael Allen. Welcome to all of you. So, I want to pick up where we left off with the governor in Ohio. We do have important state elections this week. One of them involves Governor Glenn Youngkin, who is trying to prove his win was not a fluke in Virginia, which is very blue these days. This issue of abortion, new polling shows us it is something that Virginia voters are very dialed into. Here is what Younkin says. He argues that his proposal, which is a 15-week abortion limit with exceptions for rape, incest and life of the mother, represents a politically acceptable compromise between those who want to ban all abortions and those who would see no legal limits. He's quoted as saying, people recognize that's a reasonable place. Guy, that's just one of the issue on the ballot essentially, not - not, you know, legitimately, but in theory GUY BENSON, \"THE GUY BENSON SHOW\" HOST, TOWNHALL.COM AND FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes. And it's a completely reasonable position. It's sort of a European-style proposal. The Democrats, the ads they're running on this, are suggesting that the Republicans would ban every abortion ever in Virginia, which isn't true. What I'm struck by, watching this Virginia race develop, is, number one, Governor Younkin is very popular in the commonwealth. He's got plus 20, plus 25 approval rating. Can he parlay that into coattails down ballot? He's working very hard. He's very invested in this race. The other dynamic that I'm seeing is, the Democrats are running their 2022 playbook, which was pretty successful for them. Trump, MAGA, abortion distortions, in my view on the later part. The Republicans in Virginia are running the 2021 successful playbook that Younkin won with on schools, education, crime, economy and that sort of thing. It will be fascinating on Tuesday to see which two - which of those two approaches prevails."

    {
      "speaker": "BREAM",
      "utterance": "And you're ready for that election to be over. But let's look to Kentucky as well because there is a tight governor race there. The current governor, Andy Beshear, is a Democrat. He is up against - increasingly popular, the polling shows this has tightened with the AG there, Daniel Cameron. \"The New York Times\" says this, though, \"Beshear is doing whatever he can to separate himself from Mr. Biden, whose approval ratings remain mired around 40 percent nationally and are much lower in Kentucky. Juan, what about that race?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST",
      "utterance": "Well, you've got -- Beshear is like one of the most popular governors in the country. I think like number 5. And the key point here is, with Beshear, a Democrat in a red state, is not to think so much party affiliation as to think good governance, like, you know, who's getting the roads paved, who's doing this or that. And then you get into some really difficult issues, as we saw in the debate this week, where, you know, Cameron was asked about something like vouchers. And you would think for Republicans that's a strong point. But in rural areas of the state, they see that as a threat to their public schools, so he wouldn't say his position. Similarly on Medicaid, you know, he's - he's very - he has sort of a halting, stuttering way of dealing with this issue, but it's very popular in the state. So, I think Beshear is in a - in the - in the cat seat there."

    {
      "speaker": "BREAM",
      "utterance": "Well, in Mississippi, you've got a governor's race there with an incumbent Republican. \"Cook Political Report\" says this, they've moved the race from \"likely to lean Republican.\" So, that's a race that's been tighter than expected. But some brand-new polling out this week takes us more broadly to the `24 race as we look to these states to see if we can gather anything about how voters feel about next year. \"The New York Times\"/Sienna College has a new poll out, six swing states, and President Trump is leading President Biden in five of those six states. Olivia, that's tough news for the White House this morning. And some of these, the margins are not close at all. OLIVIA BEAVERS, \"POLITICO\" CONGRESSIONAL REPORTER: No, there is -- in Nevada there is a 10-point lead for Trump. I would say this is pretty devastating. It was going over issues where they feel like Donald Trump is prevailing, on economy, on national security, on border and immigration, which are some of the top issues of this upcoming election, where they felt like Biden, which we were talking about, is leading is abortion. He has time to make it up, but right now these are so many points that if he lost those states in the Electoral College, he would be in big trouble."

I think it's all seen through the framework of the economy, inflation, his ignoring of immigration all these years. So, I think he is in a deep-seeded free-fall. And I can already hear the panic from the Democrats as they try to figure out what do you do with a candidate when 71 percent of the United States thinks you're too old to be president."

But also you have a broken Congress here on Capitol Hill. This looks dysfunctional. It looks like government's dysfunctional.

We're doing it - you know, well, they're not saying it. It's implied in how they're operating.

When they look at independent, if you add RFK Junior into the mix, this is what they find, 36 percent among independents support Kennedy, 31 percent support Trump and 30 percent support Biden. Guy, there is growing concern on the left, and the right, about some of these independent runs."

I suspect that that number that we just saw from Quinnipiac is a reflection of the American people and independent voters being deeply dissatisfied with their two likeliest options ahead of next year, not so much a full embrace of RFK Junior and all that he represents. I think those numbers would come down when people get a look at what he actually believes on a lot of issues. But it is useful because it again highlights how very unpopular both major party frontrunners are."
