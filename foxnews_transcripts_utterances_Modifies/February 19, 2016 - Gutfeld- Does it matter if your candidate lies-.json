It's those who let personality trump principle. We hate left-wing tribalism. You know: When you're critical, you're disloyal. Maybe we've become that too, calling lifelong conservatives RINOs, for criticizing a lifelong whatever.  We see now that the establishment vs. outsider shtick was baloney, meant to halt criticism. For as Rush and Mark Levin now hit Trump too, are they establishment also? Again, what would your choice do if he or she had more power?
