And, Doctor, welcome back to \"FOX News Sunday\".  DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY & INFECTIOUS DISEASES: Good to be with you Chris.  WALLACE: I want to start with those videos that Kristin Fisher just showed of those thousands of people at airports over night rushing to beat the travel ban, waiting on line for hours, you can see them here in close proximity. One assumes, coming back from Europe, some of them have the coronavirus.  As an infectious disease doctor, are you troubled seeing this?  FAUCI: Yes, I mean we'd like to not see crowds like that. I think what people need to understand, if you're an American citizen, if you are a family member, that you can get back. You don't need to rush back. You'll be able to get back. But it's understandable how when people see a travel ban they immediately want to hunker and get home. Hopefully, we don't have more of that but I think we probably unfortunately will see that.  WALLACE: And is that a problem in terms of the spread of the disease?  FAUCI: Obviously. Whenever you have crowds -- I mean, that's the thing we've been talking about and that we really want to implement is to have that kind of social separation. That is countermanding that and hopefully that people will understand that you don't have to rush back.  WALLACE: And to what degree is it on the airports to prevent that and not have those big crowds of people waiting for hours?  FAUCI: I don't know, Chris, what the airports can do about that to try and encourage people -- to tell them that if you are an American citizen you will be able to get back. It's not going to be a problem.  WALLACE: You testified before Congress this week and you made I think what most people would consider some pretty chilling comments. Here they are.  (BEGIN CLIP)  FAUCI: Bottom line it's going to get worse. The flu has a mortality of 0.1 percent. This has a mortality of 10 times that.  (END CLIP)  WALLACE: What's different about this virus? What's different in how contagious it is and how lethal it is?  FAUCI: Well, the -- I would say three things, Chris. One it's brand new so we don't have any prior experience about what it's going to do, what it's dynamics are going to be.   Number two, it spreads very easily. There's no doubt about that. It isn't like some of the other outbreaks that we had that just didn't adapt itself to spread among humans.  And number three, it's very serious in the sense of morbidity and mortality particularly among -- and very heavily weighted towards individuals who are more susceptible, the elderly and those with underlying conditions.  WALLACE: And in terms of contagiousness and lethality, worse than the flu?  FAUCI: Well, yes. I mean, it just is. And we've got to face that fact. We've got to be realistic. I mean, we've got to realize -- and I said that at the hearing, that things are going to get worse before they get better but the kinds of things we're doing now will hopefully mitigate that. I showed that curve --  (CROSSTALK)  FAUCI: But that's important because to think that right now, everything is going to be OK if you don't do anything that's absolutely incorrect. We've got a really always be ahead of the curve. I mean, I was -- I say now in a way that people can understand, I'd like to be -- the fact that we're criticized for being over reactive because when you're dealing with a virus outbreak, you are always behind where you think you are. So, therefore, you've got to jump ahead and stay ahead of the curve.  WALLACE: I want to ask you about this, on Friday both you and the president at one point mentioned eight weeks.",

But you're getting pushback from Democrats and Republicans in Congress who say it's not helping the people who need it most who are going to be thrown out of work or who work in the gig economy and don't pay payroll taxes.

At the end of the day, every country in the world, Chris, is going to get a coronavirus report card, right? They're going to get a grade on how their government responded to this public health crisis. If that report card was happening today, we would look at the fact that I think there are now almost 130 countries that have been infected. In most cases clustering mount Italy, China, and Iran. They each have 10,000 plus, so they would fail. We don't know how the U.S. would do if we had to grade them today because, again, without widespread testing, the epidemiologists say they don't know the real numbers so they can't model future accurate predictions.

We've seen what it's done to the economies of China. We see what's happening currently in Europe. This is a huge problem without which you can legislate, right? I mean you can't just pass a bill and make a pandemic go away. What we're looking at is a government that is trying to respond proactively to stop not only the health crisis that -- that could be affecting this country, but the economic impact over a period of time. You heard Secretary Mnuchin talk about, we're in the second inning. The first inning was an $8 billion bill that tried to get as many tests out there as possible. The second was all of this that you've seen being negotiated with Speaker Pelosi over the last week about proactively making sure that people who are in small businesses, employees have paid medical leave. All these things kind of things that can help kind of bridge the gap where hopefully we come out and emerge out of the back end of this with an economy that we can kick-start repeatedly through more action. So I don't think anybody is to blame for this. I -- what I think is, we've got -- all got to pull together to try to figure out how you, as a country, get from what is potentially a huge problem to, you know, hopefully this summer an economy that resembles the one we went in with.",

And by Wednesday, we were receiving phone calls from people who were in high levels in both the Bush and Obama administrations telling us, hey, guys, this is getting terrible. This could be a hit of like 5 percent to GDP. You guys need to be writing about this. So it evolved. The threat assessment evolved very, very suddenly. And I spent a long time on the phone yesterday with an investment advisors who I think presented a very realistic picture, which is, we could have a very, very short, sharp, bad, as he said, ugly quarter as we're -- as we're sitting here right now.

We're not in that situation. We are in the situation that Secretary Mnuchin just lined out, which is, we have to take this step-by-step. We have to get the help for the middle class, which is the next step. The third step, what he was talking about with travel industry, airlines, things of that nature.

If we ultimately emerge with an economy that looks anywhere nearly like the one we went in with, I think you mitigate a lot of those problems. The second thing -- way to look at it is, did we have a healthy -- healthy enough economy to absorb something like this? And I think, for the first time in a long time, you can say the American economy was positioned in a place where we have resources and the capabilities of actually undergirding the systemic problem that we're going to have as a result of this virus. So, look, I think that the argument changes significantly because you're not walking in -- waltzing into an election with these huge employment numbers and huge GDP growth. We're not going to have that. What we may well have is a reminder to the American people that our -- the strength of our economy can rebound under this administration, even under the most unprecedented crisis.",

When it comes to age, there's a million dollar question in this election cycle that I don't think anybody wants to ask, and that is, what if all top three presidential contenders contract this virus over the coming months? It's not a crazy question. We're in this unique cycle where all three, Trump, Biden and Sanders, are 70 plus. One source pointed out to me the other day, we know at least one of them has an underlying health condition. Sanders has had heart issue so far. It's not unreasonable given the amount of people they interact with every day that they might all contract this virus and, at some point, maybe overlap at the same time. What does that look like?

One assumes, coming back from Europe, some of them have the coronavirus. As an infectious disease doctor, are you troubled seeing this?  FAUCI: Yes, I mean we'd like to not see crowds like that.

That is countermanding that and hopefully that people will understand that you don't have to rush back.  WALLACE: And to what degree is it on the airports to prevent that and not have those big crowds of people waiting for hours?  FAUCI: I don't know, Chris, what the airports can do about that to try and encourage people -- to tell them that if you are an American citizen you will be able to get back. It's not going to be a problem.  WALLACE: You testified before Congress this week and you made I think what most people would consider some pretty chilling comments."

One it's brand new so we don't have any prior experience about what it's going to do, what it's dynamics are going to be. Number two, it spreads very easily. There's no doubt about that. It isn't like some of the other outbreaks that we had that just didn't adapt itself to spread among humans."

I mean, I was -- I say now in a way that people can understand, I'd like to be -- the fact that we're criticized for being over reactive because when you're dealing with a virus outbreak, you are always behind where you think you are. So, therefore, you've got to jump ahead and stay ahead of the curve.  WALLACE: I want to ask you about this, on Friday both you and the president at one point mentioned eight weeks."

We are not sure what the duration is going to be, number one. Number two, if you look at what happened in China, where they had that peak and then they are coming down, there were only 11 new cases in China, they dominated the new cases just a few months ago.  So it started off China, you know, two or three months ago, they started coming down within a two-month period. So if you're talking about reflecting what went on there, it's going to be about that time that we hopefully in the next couple of months are going to see the direction it's going to go.  Hopefully, what we're doing, in a very aggressive way of containment and mitigation, we'll be able to not only flatten it in the sense of not as many cases, but also diminish the duration.  WALLACE: President Trump announced a public/private partnership on Friday, and made it sound like the serious testing around the country, that we'll be seeing it soon. First, there was this.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  TRUMP: I want to thank Google. Google is helping to develop a website. It's going to be very quickly done, unlike websites of the past.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WALLACE: But Google's sister company, Verily, put out a statement later that said this test, which, according to him and other officials, first of all, will let you sort of check whether your symptoms indicate you have it, and two, if you do seem to have it, will tell you where you can get testing --"

      "utterance": "-- in fact, is just starting and is just in a pilot program for the Bay Area, and that it's going to take over time, they said, for it to be applied nationally.  And while the president made it sound like mass testing is going to start very soon, there are a lot of experts who say that whether it's staffing, public health staffing, or the products, or the chemicals needed for mass testing, that we're very behind the curve on that.  So I guess my question is, how soon can people across the country expect mass drive-thru testing?  FAUCI: OK. So there are two issues here, Chris. There's a website and when it's going to be fully open versus the availability of testing. They really are somewhat separate. So put aside the website and how it's going to be fully operational. The CEOs of the companies that we had at the White House, that the president met with, it's very clear that when I specifically asked them, when can we get started to start doing this where you can really have availability in a much easier way implementing, not just saying that it's out there? They're telling us that that will be starting up within the next week or so that it's going to go up.  Now, in the reality, there are going to be people a week from now who are going to say, I tried to get a test but I couldn't get it. But the totality of the picture is going to be infinitely better than it was a few weeks ago.  WALLACE: I want to talk to you about a few weeks ago, because there are continuing questions about why other countries, South Korea maybe the best example, are testing thousands of people a day. And so far, the CDC says that it and state labs total, the whole crisis, have tested 13,000 people.  Here's how you and the president answered questions about the testing lag this week.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  FAUCI: The idea of anybody getting it easily the way people in other countries are doing it, we're not set up for that. Do I think we should be? Yes. But we're not.  TRUMP: No, I don't take responsibility at all because we were given a -- a set of circumstances and we were given rules, regulations, and specifications from a different time.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  WALLACE: The president says the Obama administration set up rules and regulations that made it impossible to do testing. You were in the same position under the Obama administration. Is that true? Is that what stopped it?  FAUCI: You know, Chris, to be honest with you, I'm not sure what regulations or what it was that they're talking about. I really mean that. I mean, I'm trying to figure out what it is that these things were in place that were able to or inhibiting."

    {
      "speaker": "But one thing that I do know now is that the ability to get a test had some regulatory and other restrictions on it that the FDA now has just gotten rid of.  WALLACE",
      "utterance": "I mean, they could have done that day one.  FAUCI: Well, yes, they could have. But the fact is it wasn't. So I tend to -- like to -- instead of looking back, look at where we're going.  WALLACE: All right. You talk about slowing the virus down. You talk a lot, and I've very used to this now, you can either have a bump like this of cases or you could make it maybe the same total cases, but it's a much more gradual and slower and longer curve.  I want to put up some numbers. We have in this country about 950,000 hospital beds, and about 45,000 beds in Intensive Care Unit. How worried are you that this virus is going to overwhelm hospitals, not just beds, but ventilators? We only have 160,000 ventilators. And could we be in a situation where you have to ration who gets the bed, who gets the ventilator?  FAUCI: OK. So let me put it in a way that it doesn't get taken out of context. When people talk about modeling where outbreaks are going, the modeling is only as good as the assumptions you put into the model. And what they do, they have a worst-case scenario, a best-case scenario, and likely where it's going to be.  If we have a worst-case scenario, we've got to admit it, we could be overwhelmed. Are we going to have a worst-case scenario? I don't think so. I hope not. What are we doing to not have that worst-case scenario? That's when you get into the things that we're doing.  We're preventing infections from going in with some rather stringent travel restrictions. And we're doing containment and mitigation from within. So, at a worst-case scenario, anywhere in the world, no matter what country you are, you won't be prepared. So our job is to not let that worst-case scenario happen.  WALLACE: And final question. Three countries now in Europe -- Italy, Spain, and France are basically in total lock-down. People not allowed out. And in Italy, I think only pharmacies and grocery stores are open. You see people on their balconies singing songs and banging pots.  Could that happen here, either nationally or in some regions? And what about the possibility that we might have to have travel bans inside the country?  FAUCI: Well, a couple of questions there. So let me take one at a time.  WALLACE: Yes.  FAUCI: The idea, what's going on in Europe is that they have been -- they got into that escalation phase. So what they're doing now is playing catch- up. We feel that with rather stringent mitigation and containment, without necessarily complete lock-down, we would be able to prevent ourselves from getting to where, unfortunately, Italy is now.  With regard to domestic travel bans, we always talk about it, consider everything. But I can tell you that has not been seriously considered, doing travel bans in the country. Would it might be some time? We always leave an open mind.  WALLACE: Dr. Fauci, thank you. Thanks for coming in. An awful lot of people are relying on what you have to say. And, of course, we'll be tracking what the president's task force does this week. Thank you, sir.  FAUCI: Thank you. Good to be with you, Chris.  WALLACE: Up next, the threat to the U.S. economy as parts of everyday life shut down to contain the outbreak. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin joins us live, next."

There are some businesses that are booming.

I've been speaking to senators all day yesterday. We had conversations with Mitch McConnell and team along the way. One of the things I will tell you is we are hearing feedback that certain small businesses are concerned about the burden of this. We were very focused we need to get the money to people quickly. We don't want them to have to deal with big bureaucracy.

But you're getting pushback from Democrats and Republicans in Congress who say it's not helping the people who need it most who are going to be thrown out of work or who work in the gig economy and don't pay payroll taxes.

Now, as it relates to the Fed chair -- just a matter of policy, I don't comment on my conversations with the Fed chair. I can tell you, I am in daily conversations with Jay Powell. We're looking at the tools we have. They're looking at the tools they have. Certain tools were taken away from both of us after the financial crisis with Dodd-Frank.

Gillian, 52 days, more than seven weeks after the first coronavirus case was diagnosed in this country, the president, on Friday, declared a national emergency.

We're not saying that that's President Trump's fault, absolutely. We're not putting the blame on any one government agency. But it's a reality that needs to be repeated. At the end of the day, every country in the world, Chris, is going to get a coronavirus report card, right? They're going to get a grade on how their government responded to this public health crisis. If that report card was happening today, we would look at the fact that I think there are now almost 130 countries that have been infected. In most cases clustering mount Italy, China, and Iran. They each have 10,000 plus, so they would fail. We don't know how the U.S. would do if we had to grade them today because, again, without widespread testing, the epidemiologists say they don't know the real numbers so they can't model future accurate predictions.

We're now several months into this. There has been a lag in parts of the administration.

There's only a few cases. It will go away.

We've seen what it's done to the economies of China. We see what's happening currently in Europe. This is a huge problem without which you can legislate, right? I mean you can't just pass a bill and make a pandemic go away. What we're looking at is a government that is trying to respond proactively to stop not only the health crisis that -- that could be affecting this country, but the economic impact over a period of time. You heard Secretary Mnuchin talk about, we're in the second inning. The first inning was an $8 billion bill that tried to get as many tests out there as possible. The second was all of this that you've seen being negotiated with Speaker Pelosi over the last week about proactively making sure that people who are in small businesses, employees have paid medical leave. All these things kind of things that can help kind of bridge the gap where hopefully we come out and emerge out of the back end of this with an economy that we can kick-start repeatedly through more action. So I don't think anybody is to blame for this. I -- what I think is, we've got -- all got to pull together to try to figure out how you, as a country, get from what is potentially a huge problem to, you know, hopefully this summer an economy that resembles the one we went in with."

      "utterance": "Chuck, how big a threat do you see now? It was interesting, the Treasury secretary, understandably, didn't want to predict a recession. He didn't want to predict there wouldn't be a recession. He didn't, it seemed to me, want to come down on either side of that. How big a threat is this pandemic right now to the economy of this country and how would you assess, not finding blame, just trying to understand, how would you assess the government's response, the White House and Congress, to the economic threat so far?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHARLES LANE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "So it's been remarkable to watch this threat assessment evolve over the last seven to ten days. Very specifically, we had two business leaders visit \"The Washington Post\" in the week before this from Silicon Valley and Wall Street. This issue barely came up in those conversations, hour-long conversations. And by Wednesday, we were receiving phone calls from people who were in high levels in both the Bush and Obama administrations telling us, hey, guys, this is getting terrible. This could be a hit of like 5 percent to GDP. You guys need to be writing about this. So it evolved. The threat assessment evolved very, very suddenly. And I spent a long time on the phone yesterday with an investment advisors who I think presented a very realistic picture, which is, we could have a very, very short, sharp, bad, as he said, ugly quarter as we're -- as we're sitting here right now. But if all goes well on the public health side, that could then be a v-shaped recovery. So what a lot of economic experts are telling me is actually it's the public health response that will determine how well we do economically."

      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "Oh, absolutely. I mean this is all -- it is, as the Treasury secretary said, this isn't a financial crisis, this is a public health crisis leading to economic problems. Final question for you, Josh, which I was trying to press the Treasury secretary on. From your experience with Mitch McConnell and the Senate, will the Senate passed the bill the House passed on -- on early Saturday morning to provide relief to -- to people who are thrown out of work, people that need expanded food aid? Or do you think they're going to pass something else and this is going to ping-pong back and forth?"

    {
      "speaker": "HOLMES",
      "utterance": "Oh, I think the vast majority of what was in the House passed bill will pass the Senate. I don't know if there will be some slight tweaks. You know there's a technical correction bill that also needs to be passed in the House on Monday as well. So, look, I -- this is a little different legislative environment and the one we've been used to over the last 15 years. When you have a crisis, like think of TARP with the financial crisis or Budget Control Act, all of these various things had a hard deadline and your economy was basically -- we were told in 2008, if you didn't pass a bill in 72 hours, you wouldn't have an economy on Monday. We're not in that situation. We are in the situation that Secretary Mnuchin just lined out, which is, we have to take this step-by-step. We have to get the help for the middle class, which is the next step. The third step, what he was talking about with travel industry, airlines, things of that nature. This is going to go on for a while. And I imagine they're going to address each of these incrementally over a period of time."

Sanders has made it clear he's going to push, at least ideologically, the things he believes in.

Joe Biden also adopting Elizabeth Warren's plan on bankruptcy just this week. So he is taking on some of the ideological left. He's adapting some of it. But he's going to come out tonight and say, in every poll, I beat Donald Trump, Bernie doesn't. And right now, when we see a president lying about a website, saying he takes no responsibility, I'm the one who can beat him, that electability argument will be an even sharper relief tonight."

But I think what the big picture here is that the whole campaign has been completely transformed. I mean the whole subject of this campaign is now this virus and its economic fallout, which is like nothing everybody was expecting the campaign to be about two weeks ago. And so --"

But what I'm thinking also is it's going to focus attention on the fact that both of them are very old and both of them are literally in the risk group for this virus.

The first -- both relate, by the way, to how we ultimately emerge. If we ultimately emerge with an economy that looks anywhere nearly like the one we went in with, I think you mitigate a lot of those problems. The second thing -- way to look at it is, did we have a healthy -- healthy enough economy to absorb something like this? And I think, for the first time in a long time, you can say the American economy was positioned in a place where we have resources and the capabilities of actually undergirding the systemic problem that we're going to have as a result of this virus. So, look, I think that the argument changes significantly because you're not walking in -- waltzing into an election with these huge employment numbers and huge GDP growth. We're not going to have that. What we may well have is a reminder to the American people that our -- the strength of our economy can rebound under this administration, even under the most unprecedented crisis."

The only, it seems to me, hiccup there is, we don't know where we're going to be six months from now, which is when we're going to have this election. Now, you know, it -- if we've rebounded, obviously that would redound to the benefit of President Trump. But if things are bad, you wonder how people are going to feel."

      "utterance": "I suspect that a lot of American voters, not just this focus group, but folks all across the country, view this virus as like an act of God and politics is not really very closely related to it. Maybe six months from now they'll start thinking about how Donald Trump's administration responded to it. A quick note on what you and Chuck just talked about a minute ago. When it comes to age, there's a million dollar question in this election cycle that I don't think anybody wants to ask, and that is, what if all top three presidential contenders contract this virus over the coming months? It's not a crazy question. We're in this unique cycle where all three, Trump, Biden and Sanders, are 70 plus. One source pointed out to me the other day, we know at least one of them has an underlying health condition. Sanders has had heart issue so far. It's not unreasonable given the amount of people they interact with every day that they might all contract this virus and, at some point, maybe overlap at the same time. What does that look like? This becomes a national security concern very quickly."

You don't have to take cheap shots. But I think a lot of Americans are looking at how President Trump has handled this, downplaying it, not telling the truth, not giving clear guidance on whether you should go out, when and where you can get a test, and they look at that and all this notion that his voters had of blowing the system up, of discarding the expertise and the government, that's coming home to roost right now.
