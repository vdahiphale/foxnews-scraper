Tonight, we've got Joe Biden in Florida on the campaign trail. We're going to take you there in just a bit. Check in with Jacqui Heinrich. Also, President Trump and the first lady were in Tampa as well earlier today. Florida, obviously a major focus of attention right now, promising economic uplift for Hispanic voters in that region. School choice, another big issue in this campaign. And the president calling for a giant red wave to sweep across the country that as the incumbent battles to keep that state very important in his column. He has struggled there with women voters in the polls, senior voters as well. Tonight though, we will speak to three women about that. A few hours ago, we heard this from the first lady.",

That plan was scrapped due to weather that is spinning off of Hurricane Zeta tonight through the East Coast. But the president did have the wind at his back from a 33-point jump in economic growth in Q3 from July to September. And that fueled some of his stops today. It is a move up, a big move up from a big move down during the COVID economy. So, it is an increasingly tight race out there. And Florida is likely to be an early sign in the night of how things may go on Tuesday. After that, we'll be watching Pennsylvania for sure, which many believe could be the state that picks the winner of the White House in this race ultimately. So, today in Real Clear Politics, Susan Crabtree writes, the Biden campaign is paying a lot of attention to red states and Democrats fear that if he loses Pennsylvania and goes down in defeat, he will have repeated Hillary Clinton's monumental mistake of trying to run the table.

Well, in the final push for the state's 29 electoral votes, Joe Biden is trying to mobilize his reliable base in counties, Hillary Clinton won in 2016 rather than try to flip voters in Trump country. In a Monmouth poll out today shows Joe Biden has a razor thin lead over President Trump, four to six points based on different likely voter models with increased support among young people and a growing gender gap. But here's where things get tricky. Biden leads by a huge margin among people of color, but his lead is 10 points smaller among Latinos. And a Telemundo poll also out today showed Biden with an even narrower lead among Hispanics, just five points in that poll. And that all could spell trouble because even though Hillary Clinton won 62 percent of Florida's Hispanic vote, she still lost the state. Now, President Trump has been gaining ground among conservative Cuban Americans with ads calling Biden a socialist, portraying him alongside images of Latin American dictators, including Fidel Castro. And although Biden has long rebuffed claims that he's a puppet of the radical Left. Today, he addressed those people who fled socialist countries for Florida.",

We have Joe Biden right now according to the Real Clear Politics; average of polls has a 3.8 percent lead. But there's newer polls, more conservative polls from Trafalgar Group and others who are saying that he could even be ahead, that it's a much tighter race there. So, this is a big test for Joe Biden. And he hasn't been there as much as Trump has been there lately. He kind of did an afterthought on Monday and headed to Chester County, which is very close to Wilmington, and did an outing there on Monday.

And I think, Pennsylvania and the whole Rust Belt into Ohio, we're going to see if it's going to play out to be a big issue, a winning issue for Trump, because he's hitting it time and time again in these final days. Or if Biden has managed to overcome that problem, he has tried to sort of change his alter, his answer a little bit saying that he would stop fracking on federal lands.

It turned a blind eye to China, hollowing out the American Midwest and our manufacturing capability. And you contrast that with President Trump, he is the first president in my adult lifetime who recognized the threat from China, who put tariffs on China, who's called China out for its intellectual property theft. And then on the defense side, who adopted Ronald Reagan's peace through strength policy by rebuilding our military. Remember, our military had been decimated under the prior administrations defense sequestration and the president has rebuilt our military. So that deters China. So, it's a very different - I have no idea because Vice President Biden takes different positions on the campaign trail. And it's not my job to be political.

You'll see what I'm telling you. You've got that right, pal. He said, Trump is bankrupt, by the way, probably he is, he owes $400 million of somebody, anyway. Folks, we have to vote, we have to vote for our military families, no, not a joke. Folks, of all the things Donald Trump has said, nothing is bothering me worse than the way he's spoken to those who served in uniform, he called them losers and suckers. My deceased son, Beau Biden, who won the Bronze Star, the conspicuous service medal. In other words, volunteered to go to Iraq for a year, gave up his attorney general job to go with his unit. He wasn't a sucker or a loser. He was a patriot like all of you who served, like your sons, your daughters, your parents, and your grandparents. We have to vote for their dignity. Respect, they are due. We have to vote, because while Donald Trump fails to condemn white supremacy, we can deliver racial justice while he's trying to make it worse. Look, Donald Trump doesn't believe that systemic racism is a problem. He won't say Black Lives Matter. We know they matter. That's why a season of protest has broken out across the nation. But by the way, protesting is not burning or looting. Violence must never be a tactic tolerated, and it won't. But these protesters aren't a cry for justice. The names of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Jacob Blake will not soon be forgotten. Not by me, not by us, not by this country. When I met with the family. His little daughter said, looked at me, she's only about seven years old, and I knelt down to talk to her and the family. She looked at me, she said, Mr. Vice President, my daddy is changing the world. Well, guess what? The inspiration coming from her daddy would happen, this new wave of justice in America, but true justice is also more than just dealing with abuse. It's about economic justice. It's about schools, housing, access to capital, good paying jobs, a minimum wage of a minimum of $15 an hour, financial stability, giving families a color, a real shot to own their own home, start a small business, send the child a college debt free, so we can build wealth and pass on opportunities through generations like we did, like so many middle class families have in the past. But we have to vote to ensure the full promise of this country. We have to vote to meet the challenge of climate crisis because in Florida, it is a crisis. We're all seeing the impact more than most, devastating hurricanes that lay waste to whole communities. Economic toll is astounding, and it grows every year. But the human toll is worse. Lost lives, lost homes, small businesses shattered. First responders put at risk from the West Coast burning, the middle part of the country, flooding. Donald Trump, when he thinks climate change, he says hoax. Well, guess what, speaking to hoax, remember what he said about these increasing violent hurricanes and the frequency, he actually said maybe we should detonate a nuclear bomb over the Atlantic. By the way, the same stable genius has said the biggest problem we had in the Revolutionary War is we didn't have enough airports. I tell you what. Look, his answers to the families in Puerto Rico struggling through Hurricane Maria was - what did he do, toss rolls of paper towels at them. He doesn't have any real answers. We know we can do something about it while combating climate change means jobs, we can unleash American ingenuity in manufacturing and build a stronger, more climate resistant nation, creating millions of new high paying jobs. We can change the path we're on. We've got to act now. Time is running out. This country can't afford four more years of Trump who thinks he's only responsible, the people who voted for him. I don't see the presidency that way. I see them as an American, I'd run as a proud Democrat. But guess what? It's starting to rain. I'm going to shorten this for you all. I don't see America that way. In 2008, 2012, you place your trust in Barack and me. Well, guess what? Each day we were in office, we work for you, the entire country. It was never about red states or blue states, always about the United States of America. I was reminded of that last month when I visited Gettysburg. Folks, you know what, when I went to Gettysburg to make that speech, Abraham Lincoln said a house divided cannot stand, when a nation divided cannot stand. I was reminded that earlier this week.",

What made Donald Trump so popular in the summer months amongst African-American voters were Joe Biden's vote on the crime bill. But if you take a look at the numbers which I have done, thanks to my folks at (Inaudible) and the only millennial polling firm in this country -- what they found is this. Voters who have already voted 91 percent of them have voted for Joe Biden and only 4 percent have voted for Donald Trump. And the reason being is because in the home stretch, because of peer to peer communication, peer to peer persuasion, black men having conversations with black men, they've been able to move many of these -- one Trump supporting black men to go and vote for Joe Biden. I think the other impact that we've actually seen is also the Barack Obama effect. In the last two weeks Barack Obama hit the campaign trail with the direct target on African-African men and it seems to be working pretty effectively because the number also show that black men, thanks to Barack Obama and thanks to some of the works of the Biden campaign, seem to be moving to the left and they are showing that with their votes. And don't get me wrong, I do think we have to have a conversation about the impact of the 1994 crime bill has had on black communities but I think people are also looking at the impact that Donald Trump and his rhetoric has had on black communities. And they view that as more impactful in their vote than they do on the 1994 crime bill vote.",

Also, President Trump and the first lady were in Tampa as well earlier today. Florida, obviously a major focus of attention right now, promising economic uplift for Hispanic voters in that region. School choice, another big issue in this campaign. And the president calling for a giant red wave to sweep across the country that as the incumbent battles to keep that state very important in his column.

      "utterance": "It's the first time we've seen Melania Trump at an actual rally over the course of this campaign. They had planned after that to go to North Carolina. That plan was scrapped due to weather that is spinning off of Hurricane Zeta tonight through the East Coast. But the president did have the wind at his back from a 33-point jump in economic growth in Q3 from July to September. And that fueled some of his stops today. It is a move up, a big move up from a big move down during the COVID economy. So, it is an increasingly tight race out there. And Florida is likely to be an early sign in the night of how things may go on Tuesday. After that, we'll be watching Pennsylvania for sure, which many believe could be the state that picks the winner of the White House in this race ultimately. So, today in Real Clear Politics, Susan Crabtree writes, the Biden campaign is paying a lot of attention to red states and Democrats fear that if he loses Pennsylvania and goes down in defeat, he will have repeated Hillary Clinton's monumental mistake of trying to run the table. Here's President Trump's campaign manager, Bill Stepien."

      "utterance": "Good evening, Martha. Well, in the final push for the state's 29 electoral votes, Joe Biden is trying to mobilize his reliable base in counties, Hillary Clinton won in 2016 rather than try to flip voters in Trump country. In a Monmouth poll out today shows Joe Biden has a razor thin lead over President Trump, four to six points based on different likely voter models with increased support among young people and a growing gender gap. But here's where things get tricky. Biden leads by a huge margin among people of color, but his lead is 10 points smaller among Latinos. And a Telemundo poll also out today showed Biden with an even narrower lead among Hispanics, just five points in that poll. And that all could spell trouble because even though Hillary Clinton won 62 percent of Florida's Hispanic vote, she still lost the state. Now, President Trump has been gaining ground among conservative Cuban Americans with ads calling Biden a socialist, portraying him alongside images of Latin American dictators, including Fidel Castro. And although Biden has long rebuffed claims that he's a puppet of the radical Left. Today, he addressed those people who fled socialist countries for Florida."

But facing a positive economic report today, Biden said not to be fooled by a case shaped recovery where things look good for people at the top but get worse for those at the bottom. He said visits to food banks haven't slowed down. African Americans and Latinos still face double-digit unemployment. Now, Biden said today, the contest is over if he wins Florida, but it is surely a sprint to the finish in the last seven presidential contests, fewer than 20,000 votes have decided the winner in this state out of more than 51 million votes cast, Martha."

Tell me about that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CRABTREE",
      "utterance": "Yes, it's either a colossal mistake or it's a brilliant strategy to run the board, but it's going to really test his dependence on the polls this time and the reliance on their accuracy. We had the same situation going in a week ahead of time with Hillary Clinton last time around, she was about five percent lead in the polls in Pennsylvania in the Keystone State. We have Joe Biden right now according to the Real Clear Politics; average of polls has a 3.8 percent lead. But there's newer polls, more conservative polls from Trafalgar Group and others who are saying that he could even be ahead, that it's a much tighter race there. So, this is a big test for Joe Biden. And he hasn't been there as much as Trump has been there lately. He kind of did an afterthought on Monday and headed to Chester County, which is very close to Wilmington, and did an outing there on Monday. But it seemed like a little bit of a catch up and a little bit of trying to have a do over on the fracking issue and the oil issue that he kind of had a problem with during the debate last week."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CRABTREE",
      "utterance": "Well, certainly in Pennsylvania, it's a big issue, there's so many - there's 600,000 jobs that have to do with the fracking industry. And I think that, you can see it on the campaign trail. Trump is hitting this over and over again. And I think, Pennsylvania and the whole Rust Belt into Ohio, we're going to see if it's going to play out to be a big issue, a winning issue for Trump, because he's hitting it time and time again in these final days. Or if Biden has managed to overcome that problem, he has tried to sort of change his alter, his answer a little bit saying that he would stop fracking on federal lands. But there's so many times during the primaries where he came out so strongly against it, it was very hard. And of course, Trump likes to remind voters about those times."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yes, there's an F&M poll, Franklin & Marshall poll that came out today looking at Pennsylvania and it talks about an important component of Trump's 2016 victory coming from the massive vote advantage that he got in the counties that he won. But it says that Biden currently holds a larger vote share in the counties that Clinton won in 2016 than Trump holds in the counties that he won. So, this is - it's so much about turnout. And what is your sense on turnout in Pennsylvania?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CRABTREE",
      "utterance": "Well, we have - it looks like we're heading into it that this 5 percent advantage that Biden has been consistent in a lot of the polls and not the outliers like the Trafalgar Group. So, it's a really hardened opinion about these candidates. You have not very many undecideds. So, yes, that is what Trump is playing on. You can see that. That's why he's barnstorming the state in the last two weeks. He had Melania there. He has been there this week. He has Don Jr. going there with Ted Nugent tomorrow. He's trying to drum up that his get out the vote operation and mobilize his base, because in some places that were very rural, he had a 30 to 45 percent advantage. But with Biden showing these signs in the Franklin & Marshall poll that in the population centers, he is driving up and he has a bigger lead."

So, the mail in ballots can be counted even if they are received three days after Election Day without legible postmark. Now, you have every county, all the counties in Pennsylvania. They all approach this differently. They can't start until Election Day, but many of them don't start until the day after Election Day. It's going to be a long road ahead."

Wall Street is hungry to get a bigger piece of China's growing middle class, and President Xi is expanding his power by the day. While there are arguments from our allies for either U.S. presidential outcome, there are concerns that, for example, a Biden victory could mean that Japan will have to monitor closely any moves that downplay the China threat and that while some in the Asia Pacific Rim might welcome the defeat of President Trump, there are wary of Biden's ability to execute a tougher China policy."

Obviously, you work in the White House, you work with President Trump. So, I know that you think that his China policy is sound. But given what we know, and we haven't heard a whole lot about this during the campaign, how do you think China would perceive the difference between the two man, between President Trump and a potential President Biden?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROBERT O'BRIEN, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR",
      "utterance": "Well, we look at the past 40 years, but especially the past eight years with a lead from behind foreign policy and a strategic patience, foreign policy, where America turned a blind eye to Chinese unfair trade practices, it turned a blind eye to Chinese intellectual property theft of all of our great innovations. It turned a blind eye to China, hollowing out the American Midwest and our manufacturing capability. And you contrast that with President Trump, he is the first president in my adult lifetime who recognized the threat from China, who put tariffs on China, who's called China out for its intellectual property theft. And then on the defense side, who adopted Ronald Reagan's peace through strength policy by rebuilding our military. Remember, our military had been decimated under the prior administrations defense sequestration and the president has rebuilt our military. So that deters China. So, it's a very different - I have no idea because Vice President Biden takes different positions on the campaign trail. And it's not my job to be political. All I can do is look at what we faced when we came into office and what President Trump has done. And it's been pretty spectacular what the president has done with respect to China."

So, some might argue that the much more aggressive stance towards China might drive those two adversaries of ours closer together. Is that something that concerns you? And do you think it is a direct result of our more aggressive stance against China? Do you think a more conciliatory approach might have prevented those two from coming together?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "O'BRIEN",
      "utterance": "No. What we see is these two authoritarian regimes have been working closely together for many, many years. Much of China's defense industry came from Russia. The Russians have been supplying them for years and years. And we're going to see a battle. We're going to see a divide in the world. And the divide in the world isn't going to be the old USSR divide where there was a big non-aligned movement. You're now going to see a divide in the world between governments that believe in our values like Brazil and India and Europe and the UK and North America, democracies, governments, and countries that believe in the rule of law. And on the other side, you're going to have countries like Iran and Russia and China getting closer together. Those countries don't share our values, they're authoritarian. They spy on their own people. They abuse human rights. They expand their territory through the use of force. So, we're going to really see a difference in the coming years between the democracies and no one has strengthened our relationship with India, for example, between President Trump and Prime Minister Modi or with Brazil, where I was last week between President Bolsonaro and President Trump. We're making tremendous headway in bringing the democracies and the like- minded countries together as we confront the challenges that come from Russia and China."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So, there are indications that some of those countries are a bit nervous about having to shoulder more of the burden to stand up to China on their own in a potential Biden administration. But the Biden platform on this says that they would be better at bringing allies together against China and that they would be stronger on things like cracking down on the Uyghurs for example, there's a new Senate initiative between Senator Menendez and Senator Risch to try to be more forceful in calling that genocide. Is it a fair criticism? Has the Trump administration been tough enough on human rights issues in China?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "O'BRIEN",
      "utterance": "Well, first of all, with the allies, I don't think any country has done more to bring our allies together on China than the Trump administration. Remember, Huawei was running wild, they stole all our IP from our own telecommunications companies, put them out of business, and then became the world leader. We've got countries from Poland to Australia to Brazil to Italy to the UK saying no to Huawei. So, with NATO, we've got NATO spending $4000 billion more. That's something President Obama and Vice President Biden were never able to get. And when it comes to the Uyghurs, we're the only country in the first administration, this did not happen in the Biden-Obama administration previously. We're the first administration to sanction Chinese companies that use Uyghur slave labor to have sanctioned members of the Chinese Communist Party for suppressing the Uyghurs. No other country has done it and no other administration has done it. So, President Trump is the only one who's gotten tough with China on the Uyghurs. I can't imagine another administration being any tougher than President Trump has been already with respect to religious freedom in China."

      "utterance": "Like Donald Trump says, he wants to institute if he gets re-elected, he says will bankrupt Social Security by 2023 as my wife would say, Google it. You'll see what I'm telling you. You've got that right, pal. He said, Trump is bankrupt, by the way, probably he is, he owes $400 million of somebody, anyway. Folks, we have to vote, we have to vote for our military families, no, not a joke. Folks, of all the things Donald Trump has said, nothing is bothering me worse than the way he's spoken to those who served in uniform, he called them losers and suckers. My deceased son, Beau Biden, who won the Bronze Star, the conspicuous service medal. In other words, volunteered to go to Iraq for a year, gave up his attorney general job to go with his unit. He wasn't a sucker or a loser. He was a patriot like all of you who served, like your sons, your daughters, your parents, and your grandparents. We have to vote for their dignity. Respect, they are due. We have to vote, because while Donald Trump fails to condemn white supremacy, we can deliver racial justice while he's trying to make it worse. Look, Donald Trump doesn't believe that systemic racism is a problem. He won't say Black Lives Matter. We know they matter. That's why a season of protest has broken out across the nation. But by the way, protesting is not burning or looting. Violence must never be a tactic tolerated, and it won't. But these protesters aren't a cry for justice. The names of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Jacob Blake will not soon be forgotten. Not by me, not by us, not by this country. When I met with the family. His little daughter said, looked at me, she's only about seven years old, and I knelt down to talk to her and the family. She looked at me, she said, Mr. Vice President, my daddy is changing the world. Well, guess what? The inspiration coming from her daddy would happen, this new wave of justice in America, but true justice is also more than just dealing with abuse. It's about economic justice. It's about schools, housing, access to capital, good paying jobs, a minimum wage of a minimum of $15 an hour, financial stability, giving families a color, a real shot to own their own home, start a small business, send the child a college debt free, so we can build wealth and pass on opportunities through generations like we did, like so many middle class families have in the past. But we have to vote to ensure the full promise of this country. We have to vote to meet the challenge of climate crisis because in Florida, it is a crisis. We're all seeing the impact more than most, devastating hurricanes that lay waste to whole communities. Economic toll is astounding, and it grows every year. But the human toll is worse. Lost lives, lost homes, small businesses shattered. First responders put at risk from the West Coast burning, the middle part of the country, flooding. Donald Trump, when he thinks climate change, he says hoax. Well, guess what, speaking to hoax, remember what he said about these increasing violent hurricanes and the frequency, he actually said maybe we should detonate a nuclear bomb over the Atlantic. By the way, the same stable genius has said the biggest problem we had in the Revolutionary War is we didn't have enough airports. I tell you what. Look, his answers to the families in Puerto Rico struggling through Hurricane Maria was - what did he do, toss rolls of paper towels at them. He doesn't have any real answers. We know we can do something about it while combating climate change means jobs, we can unleash American ingenuity in manufacturing and build a stronger, more climate resistant nation, creating millions of new high paying jobs. We can change the path we're on. We've got to act now. Time is running out. This country can't afford four more years of Trump who thinks he's only responsible, the people who voted for him. I don't see the presidency that way. I see them as an American, I'd run as a proud Democrat. But guess what? It's starting to rain. I'm going to shorten this for you all. I don't see America that way. In 2008, 2012, you place your trust in Barack and me. Well, guess what? Each day we were in office, we work for you, the entire country. It was never about red states or blue states, always about the United States of America. I was reminded of that last month when I visited Gettysburg. Folks, you know what, when I went to Gettysburg to make that speech, Abraham Lincoln said a house divided cannot stand, when a nation divided cannot stand. I was reminded that earlier this week."

And President Trump has done more in the last three and a half years than Joe Biden has done in the last 47 years. And just take today for example. We got some great economic news. Jobs are coming back and Joe Biden has signaled that he is willing to shut down the country again if need be. And you know, and that means online schooling continues for our kids. And in our county in Fairfax the teacher's unions are pushing the school boards to continue online schooling into the fall of 2021.

Our kids are in the classroom because of our teachers and our educators are working hard, it's not because of Donald Trump. It's not because of anything that he has done. You can talk about the economy all you want and the great news that you think came out today but if you really compare quarter two to quarter three those are not apple to apple numbers.

President Trump has touted the economic gains for black and Hispanic voters pre-COVID, as well as his work with the First Step Act. But an op-ed in the L.A. Times argues that the appeal is about something else. Writer Erin Logan says black male support for President Trump is about, quote, \"toxic masculinity.\" She cites Georgia State Representative Vernon Jones, a Democrat who is a big Trump supporter now, the piece reads in part, Vernon Jones sees a continuance of Trump's fiscal policies as a way for black America to pursue financial uplift. He believes Trump's ability to, quote, \"swim against the grain defying elites in both parties is a sin of strength, just as black men have always had to be strong. But when Jones told me that Trump is a strong man and a man's man, I felt erased as a black woman, she writes. These traits can quickly devolve into toxic masculinity.\" So, Vernon Jones the aforementioned joins me now. He's a Democratic Georgia State Representative and a Trump campaign surrogate, and Richard Fowler, senior follow at the New Leaders Council and a Fox News contributor. Gentlemen, thank you very much for being here tonight. So, Vernon, how did you take what she wrote about you there, what's your take away?"

So why can't men support men? Why can't things and men appeal to men like things in women appeal to women? But if that reporter had not been thinking as a female and just wrote the story it would not have been an issue. But she as a female she took it personal. But she doesn't take it personal if she talked to a female who support Kamala Harris. And so, if she had written and just add, OK, this is how I feel, this is his information, then it would be fine. And that's the problem. And yes, Donald Trump appeals to African-American men, why? Because Joe Biden destroyed an entire generation of black men through mass incarceration. Stripped from their families, their mothers, their wives, of their sisters and their brothers and many black men died in jail because of those long sentences where they never got a chance to reunite with their family. We don't even talk about them. And look how many do the president's First Step Act that he's released from jail because of what Joe Biden did? So black men, yes, we've had a hard time.

What made Donald Trump so popular in the summer months amongst African-American voters were Joe Biden's vote on the crime bill. But if you take a look at the numbers which I have done, thanks to my folks at (Inaudible) and the only millennial polling firm in this country -- what they found is this. Voters who have already voted 91 percent of them have voted for Joe Biden and only 4 percent have voted for Donald Trump. And the reason being is because in the home stretch, because of peer to peer communication, peer to peer persuasion, black men having conversations with black men, they've been able to move many of these -- one Trump supporting black men to go and vote for Joe Biden. I think the other impact that we've actually seen is also the Barack Obama effect. In the last two weeks Barack Obama hit the campaign trail with the direct target on African-African men and it seems to be working pretty effectively because the number also show that black men, thanks to Barack Obama and thanks to some of the works of the Biden campaign, seem to be moving to the left and they are showing that with their votes. And don't get me wrong, I do think we have to have a conversation about the impact of the 1994 crime bill has had on black communities but I think people are also looking at the impact that Donald Trump and his rhetoric has had on black communities. And they view that as more impactful in their vote than they do on the 1994 crime bill vote."

The people of Michigan believe in his promises made, promises kept. His love of our military, he's building back our economy and his handling of the COVID here. I can tell you from being here tonight the folks behind us are tired of the current leadership's approach to it, they want to open up their businesses, they want to get back to work safely and provide for their families and build back the company under President Trump."
