The president trying to step back from this on Twitter this morning. \"The language used by me at the DACA meeting was tough, but this was not the language used. What was really tough was the outlandish proposal made - a big setback for DACA!\" \"Never said anything derogatory about Haitians other than Haiti is, obviously, a very poor and troubled country. Never said \"take them out.\" Made up by Dems. I have a wonderful relationship with Haitians. Probably should record future meetings - unfortunately, no trust!\"  However, despite the fact that two Republicans senators came out and said they didn't remember hearing it, another Republican senator there, Lindsey Graham, told a colleague he did hear exactly that, and then you just heard about Dick Durbin. Well, Rush Limbaugh talking about all the media said today on his radio show it amounts to moral preening from a drive-by media eager to project their phony supremacy onto the American people, quote, \"They offend me far more than Donald Trump does. These people in the media are a bunch of the biggest phony-baloneys on the planet acting like they don't talk this way. They think this way about Mississippi, they think this way about the American South, they think this way about flyover countries. I can't stand this phony supremacy and superiority that these people projected as though anybody who does think or talk that way is somehow subhuman, a reprobate, or other things.
