The Five only does great when there's a little spark of combat between us. If we all sit around here and agree, the audience gets bored and nobody watches. So that's what he is actually counter programming. And the more they impeach him, the better he does. That's great news. They should keep impeaching him.

And then he goes and botches the Trump Russia investigation the same way, by getting duped by fake news, a.k.a. the dossier.

Do they have a therapy llama in your bio or a therapy fairy that can keep him company? I just hope he's all right. I think that the word hack is not a good word. I think it's a lazy word. I don't think he's a hack. I think there are better words to come up with. But I think it's incredibly healthy for people in this world to view the press the same way that they look at pyramid schemes. That the only way the press can maintain power is to get you to believe in their story. And the sooner you realize that, the healthier you are. So the more antagonism towards the media there is, the better I feel. And I'm saying that as somebody who is in the media, but I loathe the media."
