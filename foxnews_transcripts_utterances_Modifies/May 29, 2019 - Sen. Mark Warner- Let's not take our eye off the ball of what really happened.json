And Democrats are pushing impeachment, saying that is why theirs is just beginning. And forget China. Is that the real reason why investors on Wall Street are worrying? We're all over it.  Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto. This is \"Your World.\"  And while Mueller didn't say anything that wasn't already in his report, maybe it was his emphasis. It's the door he left wide open for Democrats that could mean it will soon be open season on one President Donald Trump.  So, this hour, while Senate Judiciary Committee Republican Thom Tillis is not worried, why the top Democrat on Senate Intelligence, Mark Warner, says, maybe he should be, and why stocks on Wall Street already are. First to Catherine Herridge in Washington on what's going on right now.  Hey, Catherine.",

He tweeted this: \"Nothing changes from the Mueller report. There was insufficient evidence and, therefore, in our country, a person is innocent. The case is closed. Thank you.\" All right, case closed, because, they argued, Mueller said as much in his report and did again today, didn't have the goods, Neil, to accuse the president of anything specific, even though he had some evidence that made it impossible to -- quote -- \"exonerate him.\"  Still, Mueller said today it's over.

So, yes, we hit the lowest point of the session after Mueller's press conference, and we had the broader S&P 500 finishing at its lowest point in close to two months, while the Dow at its weakest in three-and-a-half months. But here's the good news. When markets actually started to sell off on the Mueller press conference, investors went in to buy, which is encouraging. It sets a floor, as we call it. And markets, as you know, Neil, are news- sensitive. And that includes political unknowns, like impeachment threats, and hence we have investors running to the safety of U.S. government bonds, and that's depressing bond yields. That's the amount of interest that you get back for holding U.S. treasuries, with the most widely held 10-year treasury note you its lowest interest in 20 months. And this is causing a concerning sign for investors, a phenomenon on the markets called a yield curve inversion, where short-term rates, in this case a three-month treasury, now higher than the 10-year note. And yield curve inversions are important, because they have virtually preceded every recession since the 1960s. Also adding to the flight to safety, U.S.-China trade tensions heightened overnight, with threats of retaliation coming from China.  China's propaganda mouthpiece, The People's Daily, had an op-ed piece warning the U.S. to not underestimate China's ability to strike back in this trade dispute, threatening to cut off exports of rare earths, which are needed in defense, energy, electronics and cars. So with all these uncertainties out there, that's why markets are now pricing in and betting there's an over 80 percent chance that the Federal Reserve will be cutting interest rates this year, cutting interest rates, Neil.

They found insufficient evidence to prove that there was a crime that was committed. The underlying crime that had to do with the election meddling, and then the other, which was the allegation that somehow justice had been obstructed, neither of them rose to a level to where they felt like they had an indictable offense, which is exactly why the impeachment process is pure theater. The fact of the matter is, we have a 400 -- almost 450-page report that found no evidence of wrongdoing. That's what the House would act on. And when it comes to the Senate, it's clearly not going to go anywhere. So it will be theater, more of these fund-raising e-mails from all the candidates who are running, a lot of politics.

Let's make sure we put some rules of the road in place for Facebook, so that Russia or others don't manipulate with fake accounts our elections going forward. And let's go ahead and pass legislation that would say, in the future, if any foreign government tries to intervene in our election, and I don't care for who, there ought to be an obligation that that campaign they're trying to help has an obligation to tell the FBI, tell law enforcement.

They -- can't tell you how many people we have walked up to their homes, and they start telling us their story. And one of the common things was, many of them, that they did not have a basement. They got -- they got in the bathroom and they got in the tub. And when you walked into the house, about all you saw that was standing was that bathroom. So people were really tuned in to the news media. They were following this storm, these storms, on their apps. They were doing it on TV, on radio. And I think, if I had just walked up and looked at all these homes without knowing anything, I would have thought a lot of more people were killed. My wife and I were in the (INAUDIBLE) tornado that hit Xenia, Ohio, where a number of people were -- dozens and dozens of people were killed. So I think we're blessed.

Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto. This is \"Your World.\" And while Mueller didn't say anything that wasn't already in his report, maybe it was his emphasis. It's the door he left wide open for Democrats that could mean it will soon be open season on one President Donald Trump. So, this hour, while Senate Judiciary Committee Republican Thom Tillis is not worried, why the top Democrat on Senate Intelligence, Mark Warner, says, maybe he should be, and why stocks on Wall Street already are. First to Catherine Herridge in Washington on what's going on right now. Hey, Catherine."

And it's important to listen to her choice of language. She commended House Democrats for pursuing issues of impeachment. But then she said if they proceeded, they needed to make such a solid case that even Republicans in the Senate would have buy-in. Here's a speaker."

      "speaker": "HERRIDGE",
      "utterance": "Special counsel Robert Mueller spoke for almost 10 minutes today. I want to emphasize he didn't take questions from reporters that might have clarified some of the issues and gone to his motivation for making a public statement. He talked about Russian election interference. He talked about that being systematic and broad, but the emphasis has been on the obstruction issue. He talked about something called the OLC opinion. This is the Office of Legal Counsel. It's like the internal lawyer to the executive branch. It's housed in the Justice Department. And he said that opinion says you can't indict a sitting president. And Mueller told reporters, this was a major stumbling block in the investigation."

      "speaker": "ROBERT MUELLER, RUSSIA PROBE SPECIAL COUNSEL",
      "utterance": "Under longstanding department policy, a president cannot be charged with a federal crime while he is in office. That is unconstitutional. Even if the charge is kept under seal and hidden from public view, that, too, is prohibited. The special counsel's office is part of the Department of Justice, and by regulation, it was bound by that department policy. Charging the president with a crime was therefore not an option we could consider."

      "speaker": "HERRIDGE",
      "utterance": "Mueller went on to say that, under the regulations, his team was able to gather information that could be used in the future. He didn't reference Congress or impeachment. But that seemed to be the subtext, Neil. But what's important is that this does appear to conflict with what we heard from Attorney General William Barr on the issue. The attorney general testified that, when he had a conversation with Mueller, and about the failure to reach a decision on the obstruction charge, that Mueller, according to Barr, had put this legal opinion to one side, and that there are also underlying facts that wouldn't go to a criminal prosecution."
    },

      "speaker": "WILLIAM BARR, ATTORNEY GENERAL",
      "utterance": "Special counsel Mueller stated three times to us in that meeting, in response to our questioning, that he emphatically wasn't saying that, but for the OLC opinion, he would have found obstruction. He's said that, in the future, the facts of a case against the president might be such that a special counsel would recommend abandoning the OLC opinion. But this is not such a case."

      "speaker": "HERRIDGE",

And there was another development that kind of flew under the radar with the special counsel statement. We have got something from the inspector general at the Justice Department, and they have confirmed now a second former senior FBI executive was guilty of unauthorized leaks to the media, and, more importantly, accepting gifts from the media. This goes to the ongoing probe of what people like to call the investigation of the investigators, those who were involved at the genesis of the whole Russia case, Neil."

But, for the first time today since the genesis of the Russia probe, we got a chance to hear from the special counsel himself, who was, dare I say, decidedly less clear about those very topics. Let me share a bit of what the president himself had to say today online. He was on Twitter, didn't say a whole lot today, which may have surprised some people."

Thank you.\" All right, case closed, because, they argued, Mueller said as much in his report and did again today, didn't have the goods, Neil, to accuse the president of anything specific, even though he had some evidence that made it impossible to -- quote -- \"exonerate him.\" Still, Mueller said today it's over.

Mueller seemed to throw the Democrats a bit of an olive branch by suggesting the main reason he couldn't go forward, Neil, with an allegation perhaps of obstruction was because of that long-established rule against it. The president's lawyer Rudy Giuliani, meanwhile, isn't buying that."

No one, not even the president of the United States, is above the law\" -- that from Jerry Nadler. As for Mueller, doesn't look like he will testify, short of a subpoena.

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, we should be clear here. Robert Mueller didn't say anything today that wasn't already in his report. So what are we to make of all of this? Former Whitewater independent counsel Robert Ray to do that. Robert, what's interesting is, neither did the final report say, if we had confidence that the president clearly did commit a crime, we would have said so as well. So they couldn't conclude either way. So what do you make of that?"

      "speaker": "ROBERT RAY, FORMER INDEPENDENT COUNSEL",
      "utterance": "Well, what has gotten the White House and White House lawyers and the president's own lawyers apoplectic about that is just what Rudy Giuliani said, how unfair it is, essentially, to once again throw that out there by a prosecutor, in a situation in which -- how is the president supposed to respond to that? And the only thing that you can say is, look, a prosecutor's job, just what Mr. Giuliani suggested, is to decide whether you have sufficient evidence to bring a case, something that Bob Mueller could have done in a recommendation to the attorney general. Ultimately, I think it would be the attorney general's call, no matter what happened, to decide whether or not, even notwithstanding the OLC opinion, whether to change that result and to..."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

Did we know -- like I thought, if we were two-thirds through this process, even before Barr was appointed as attorney general, and we had a heads-up that there will be not only any indictments, any prosecutions, anything that suggests even the word guilty of any of this, wouldn't people have said, all right, then why are we doing this?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RAY",

      "utterance": "Other people may come within the sights of the special counsel, but nobody should be under the illusion or delusion that this was anything other than the appointment of a special counsel to investigate conduct involving the president of the United States. And so it would be, I think, natural for someone to assume and for the public to come to expect that the special counsel was going to resolve that question, all questions involving the president."

      "speaker": "RAY",
      "utterance": "Well, he was mindful -- no, look, he was mindful of exactly what got Jim Comey into trouble. I mean, you're not going to charge somebody, but on the way out the door, you're going to say, well, the conduct was extremely careless. And similarly..."

      "speaker": "RAY",
      "utterance": "Well, I have to say, I mean, again, my takeaway from today is, did you learn anything new from this press conference that wasn't otherwise in the report? No. The only thing that we learned today is that the office is closing and that he's resigning and he's returning to private life. There's nothing in that statement that varies from what was already disclosed in the report. And, finally, I guess the other piece of news is that he has no intention of testifying. And I, frankly, agree with that. I mean, I have thought for the longest time that the country, in the nation's best interest, should accept Bob Mueller's determination that it is not appropriate for him to testify, because he shouldn't have anything further to say than -- other than what's already in the report."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "SUSAN LI, CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Definitely. That's a good way to put it, Neil. So, yes, we hit the lowest point of the session after Mueller's press conference, and we had the broader S&P 500 finishing at its lowest point in close to two months, while the Dow at its weakest in three-and-a-half months. But here's the good news. When markets actually started to sell off on the Mueller press conference, investors went in to buy, which is encouraging. It sets a floor, as we call it. And markets, as you know, Neil, are news- sensitive. And that includes political unknowns, like impeachment threats, and hence we have investors running to the safety of U.S. government bonds, and that's depressing bond yields. That's the amount of interest that you get back for holding U.S. treasuries, with the most widely held 10-year treasury note you its lowest interest in 20 months. And this is causing a concerning sign for investors, a phenomenon on the markets called a yield curve inversion, where short-term rates, in this case a three-month treasury, now higher than the 10-year note. And yield curve inversions are important, because they have virtually preceded every recession since the 1960s. Also adding to the flight to safety, U.S.-China trade tensions heightened overnight, with threats of retaliation coming from China. China's propaganda mouthpiece, The People's Daily, had an op-ed piece warning the U.S. to not underestimate China's ability to strike back in this trade dispute, threatening to cut off exports of rare earths, which are needed in defense, energy, electronics and cars. So with all these uncertainties out there, that's why markets are now pricing in and betting there's an over 80 percent chance that the Federal Reserve will be cutting interest rates this year, cutting interest rates, Neil. That's interesting -- back to you."

Cory Booker tried the same tactic against Brett Kavanaugh in the Supreme Court hearings. They put out baseless allegations and tried to keep that story alive. It didn't go well for him. He even had a Spartacus moment. They're trying to do the same thing again. There is no collusion. There is no obstruction. Mueller didn't produce anything new today. And we need to move on."

So, now you could just as easily argue that, if we had confidence the president clearly did commit a crime, they would have said so as well. But that's what's getting the attention. It was essentially an inability to come to a conclusion either way."

      "utterance": "That is exactly right. At a Judiciary hearing, when Attorney General Barr came before us, I asked him, was it common for, at the conclusion of an investigation, to actually seek to exonerate somebody? He said no. He found those passages very odd. What the Department of Justice was tasked to do is to determine if a crime was committed. They found insufficient evidence to prove that there was a crime that was committed. The underlying crime that had to do with the election meddling, and then the other, which was the allegation that somehow justice had been obstructed, neither of them rose to a level to where they felt like they had an indictable offense, which is exactly why the impeachment process is pure theater. The fact of the matter is, we have a 400 -- almost 450-page report that found no evidence of wrongdoing. That's what the House would act on. And when it comes to the Senate, it's clearly not going to go anywhere. So it will be theater, more of these fund-raising e-mails from all the candidates who are running, a lot of politics. But, at the end of the day, I think that these -- Bookers, the Harrises, the Warrens are really misleading the public and trying to make something out of nothing."

She's obviously walking a fine line here. She's no fan of necessarily diving head first into something like this. But she has still made it clear that there's enough to raise this very issue. What do you think Democrats end up doing. I mean, in the House, is it your sense they're going to pursue this? And then what do Republicans do?"

She may be forced, because of the pressure from the presidential candidates and from members of our caucus, to move forward. But I don't really sense that that's something that she wants do, because it's going to give us more opportunities to point out that there was no collusion, there was no obstruction, and this is pure, raw Politics. I see it played out on Judiciary Committee virtually every week. And I think the American people are getting fed up with it. We need to move on, let the president continue to do the good work he's doing, and let them find something meaningful on policies to run on, vs. the politics of personal destruction."

Let's not take our eye off the ball about what really happened. And how do we make sure it doesn't happen again on a going-forward basis? So I think, when Congress comes back, because the White House hasn't been willing to acknowledge and take action on their own, I think we ought to go ahead and pass bipartisan legislation to secure our elections, make sure there's a paper trail after -- after every voting machine, so we have got an ability to audit. Let's make sure we put some rules of the road in place for Facebook, so that Russia or others don't manipulate with fake accounts our elections going forward. And let's go ahead and pass legislation that would say, in the future, if any foreign government tries to intervene in our election, and I don't care for who, there ought to be an obligation that that campaign they're trying to help has an obligation to tell the FBI, tell law enforcement. My biggest interest, and why I have got the only bipartisan investigation still going, is to, how do we make sure that what the Russians did in 2016, they don't do again in 2020, for whatever candidate they choose?"

And I'm, candidly, proud of the fact that we have got unanimous conclusions about the way our voting system was manipulated, about what the Russians did, about their use and misuse of social media. And my hope is, again, on a going-forward basis, Russians may have helped one candidate I didn't I agree with in 2016, but that doesn't guarantee that, in 2020, they might not help somebody else. We need to make sure our systems are safe."

She's saying, hey, let's get more information. Let's only look at this on a methodical basis. And I think that process ought to continue. The one thing I would say that also came out of today, where I would probably disagree -- clearly disagree with the White House was, I think Mueller was pretty clear. He reached no conclusion about whether the president broke the law or not on obstruction. Now, House Judiciary Committee will pursue that. But he was quite clear that, if they had felt like the president was in the clear, they would have exonerated him. Mueller chose not to do that."

Again, we can leave that to legal scholars. But I think it would be hard to believe Mueller's statements today was an exoneration."

It might not go anywhere because of these rules and standards that have been set up, but unlike the Ken Starr report that used the term guilty a number of times, a prosecutable offense, a high crime and misdemeanor, no such terms were used here.

We're going to put forward ideas and put forward legislation, most all of it bipartisan, to make sure that our systems are not attacked again in 2020. I mean, I -- that was my biggest takeaway from Bob Mueller today, both at the beginning of his statement, at the end of his statement. That's what Chris Wray, the FBI director, warned us two or three weeks ago. And I really wish Congress would spend a little more time trying to make sure we protect the integrity of our democratic process. And I actually think there'd be pretty broad-based agreement, bipartisan. I wish we had a White House that would lean in on this as well. We have not. We actually had a White House that my understanding was, the homeland security secretary wanted to have a Cabinet meeting on election security in 2020, and she was told not to. That disappoints me.

If you look a little over here, you can see some of what we have seen in this area of Trotwood, a lot of homes missing their roofs, missing the sides of their house. It almost is like doll houses, where you can see into them so perfectly, that you could reach in and touch whatever you would like.

They -- can't tell you how many people we have walked up to their homes, and they start telling us their story. And one of the common things was, many of them, that they did not have a basement. They got -- they got in the bathroom and they got in the tub. And when you walked into the house, about all you saw that was standing was that bathroom. So people were really tuned in to the news media. They were following this storm, these storms, on their apps. They were doing it on TV, on radio. And I think, if I had just walked up and looked at all these homes without knowing anything, I would have thought a lot of more people were killed. My wife and I were in the (INAUDIBLE) tornado that hit Xenia, Ohio, where a number of people were -- dozens and dozens of people were killed. So I think we're blessed.

And we were -- Fran was texting back and forth with some of our adult children who live near us. And one daughter does not have a basement.

    {
      "speaker": "LAFFER",
      "utterance": "You shouldn't buy it. It's just not appropriate. I mean, what Nixon did that was great was China, opening up the United States, doing all that. But he wasn't a good president for the economy. I mean, he put on tariffs."

      "utterance": "Art Laffer, the former Reagan economic adviser, a lover of green. I guess that's not just the color green, just -- you know. All right, well, President Trump says case closed, as does Art Laffer. But many Democrats are opening fire with calls to impeach the president of the United States, based simply on now a statement over a report that was issued weeks ago. How far does this go? After this."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, you're looking live at Hillary Clinton. She's speaking at Hunter College in New York. She might have something to say about today's developments on the Mueller report or Bob Mueller himself commenting on that report. So we will be listening to that. You have heard from a number of Democrats and Republicans on this show where they think this is going. Let's hear from Turning Point USA founder and president Charlie Kirk, has the ear of the president, to say the least, The Wall Street Journal's Bill McGurn, who probably has the respect of the president and a lot of other people, as does Iona College professor of political science Jeanne Zaino. So, Professor, end it with you, begin with you. Do you think that impeachment proceedings now are inevitable? At least in the House, it's looking that way. What do you think?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JEANNE ZAINO, IONA COLLEGE",
      "utterance": "I hope that they are not inevitable. I think it is a bad strategy. I think it's a bad policy for Democrats to pursue this. But I think Nancy Pelosi has found herself caught between a rock and a hard place. They're increasing the rhetoric about impeachment. And liberals and progressives are right to say, if you think we're in a constitutional crisis, then you darn well better file impeachment -- or begin the impeachment proceedings. So I think this is a dangerous game for a leadership that has not wanted to pursue impeachment, but doesn't quite know how to maneuver and manipulate with this really, really thundering energy from the progressive left on this."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "I get a sense of that as well. And when we had Senator Mark Warner on, of course, dealing with a separate investigation on the Intelligence Committee, he wanted to move forward to making sure the Russians don't do this sort of thing again, but leave it at that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHARLIE KIRK, FOUNDER, TURNING POINT USA",
      "utterance": "It would be a lot easier to go forward with impeachment if the economy wasn't doing as well. If we were in a '08 or '09 kind of financial calamity, they would be able to intersect people's frustration with their livelihoods with their own political objectives. But the fact we have one of the greatest economies in American history, and we're still creating wealth and jobs at the record rate we are, it's a really tough sell."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "So you don't mess with that. That is the argument here. I mean, Richard Nixon wasn't helped by, of course, having a Democratic House and Senate, but also a lousy economy. Bill Clinton, I still argue, in retrospect, was saved by the fact that he had a good market and a good economy going for him. But where do you think this sorts out?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BILL MCGURN, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL",
      "utterance": "Well, I think there's something bigger with Donald Trump. I don't think he's guilty of any of the crimes, like some of the other ones, right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCGURN",
      "utterance": "That's the thing. There was no collusion. We had this huge investigation, and no collusion."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCGURN",
      "utterance": "And I think, when there's no underlying crime, what was he covering up? So I think it's outrageous that they go -- I think it's outrageous that Mr. Mueller declined to be -- the only decision a prosecutor is supposed to make is whether I prosecute or not, not to go out there and say, I'm not going to prosecute, I will leave that decision to someone else, but here are all the bad things they do."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Well, you do raise a very good point. And one of the things I noticed, Jeanne, is that we made a big deal of the fact, if we had confidence that the president clearly didn't commit a crime, we would have said so. By definition, then, you could just say, if we had confidence the president did commit a crime, we clearly would have said so. And he didn't."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ZAINO",
      "utterance": "He didn't. And I think what he did today was, he put more pressure on the Democratic leadership. He buttressed the argument of the progressives and the liberals who said, Bob Mueller, special investigator two years, he's saying this now is in the lap of the Democrats in Congress. But think about Nancy Pelosi. This is somebody who is a master vote counter. She never puts up a vote unless she knows she's going to win. You do not impeach unless you know not only bipartisan or bicameral."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "It would win in the House, but it's going to go nowhere in the Senate, right?"

      "utterance": "Nowhere."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCGURN",
      "utterance": "Let's just say, first of all, it's outrageous for a prosecutor to say, I didn't exonerate. It's not their job. I don't know what it is about former FBI directors that they feel their job is to look into someone's soul and exonerate."
    },

    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCGURN",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "And to say that he was limited constitutionally what he could say or not do..."
    },

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "And, by the way, don't take the job, but you're not limited in forcefully stating your opinion that he would be guilty of this or this is prosecutable."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCGURN",
      "utterance": "Exactly. Otherwise, he wouldn't take the job."

      "utterance": "Otherwise, don't do it, right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCGURN",
      "utterance": "Right. Why would you take the job if you can't go anywhere?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KIRK",
      "utterance": "It's an excellent point, because who gave him the authority to act as if he's guilty until proven innocent, as if the special prosecutor was put forth to prove Donald Trump's innocence? It's the exact opposite. They had..."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "And I wonder, too. If we went into this knowing that, all right, he was going to report like this and would be limited in what he could say, wouldn't any of you have just said, well, then why are we doing this?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ZAINO",
      "utterance": "Well, exactly. And I will tell you, the problem is the -- how the special prosecutor law is written. It was rewritten after the impeachment of Bill Clinton. It is a mistake. And it needs to be rewritten or gotten rid of completely. That is the problem. You don't put somebody -- and I appreciate what you're saying, but you don't put somebody in a position of investigating, and then tying their hands. If that's how Bob Mueller felt..."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "He could have said. He could have said."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCGURN",
      "utterance": "He could have said. Then he shouldn't have taken the job."

      "utterance": "Then he shouldn't have taken the job."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCGURN",
      "utterance": "It's on him. It's totally on him. Look, independent counsel's corrupt, absolutely, and special counsel's corrupt."
    },

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right."
    },

      "speaker": "MCGURN",
