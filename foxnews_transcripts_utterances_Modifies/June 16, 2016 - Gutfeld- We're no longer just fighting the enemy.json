Our response: Speed up refugee admissions in a time of war.  But that's not our only problem. Our problem is we can't settle on a problem. In the old days, if there were a threat to America, we galvanized and we pulverized. Now every threat is countered with a litany of attention-seeking competing political factions. Yes, ISIS wants us dead. But really, it's gun control. It's Islamophobia. It's climate change. It's childhood obesity. It's feelings, nothing more than feelings.   It's as if you're trying to do surgery and some clown keeps throwing balls at you. Imagine that after Pearl Harbor we prattled on about aviation control, swing dancing and zoot suits. So today, we no longer just fight the enemy; we fight ourselves, which causes us to fight Islamism incrementally. With ISIS, the president is acting like he's doing a jigsaw puzzle or growing tomatoes or working on his beach body. He's taking his time, isn't he? But it's our time, too. The good news is we've got the greatest military there ever is and there ever was. We just need to find the will and a leader. And we better find both soon before evil finds us.",
