I keep coming back to Pennsylvania, Bret, and I think over the next 70 plus days, really is going to find that, that is, you know, the coin of the realm in Pennsylvania. This is what we've done, we've put our battleground states in gray. We have 13 at the moment. That's going to change a little bit here and a little bit there as we get closer, some of these will be cancelled out. But we think in the race to 270, Biden starts at 213 and Trump starts at 126. So, if that is the case, Bret, how -- what's the key to victory? What's the path to victory? For Joe Biden, it's real easy if you win Pennsylvania, and then, you take a major state like Florida. It's only eight electoral votes away then you go hunting up here in the upper Midwest. Maybe you hold on to Minnesota, and if that's the case, Joe Biden would be the president under that scenario. And again, you can put in -- you can put in a hundred different scenarios here and get different outcomes.  For Donald Trump, I mean, we've got Texas on the map but maybe it's not as blue as they're saying. So, we'll give that to him, maybe he holds storage as well. And you mentioned these battleground states where the president's been traveling for the last two days. He wants to hold Arizona; he was there earlier today. He wants to hold Iowa; he was there as well. He was up here in the upper Midwest, as well. I'll get to that in a moment here. He won Florida by 100,000 votes, North Carolina by 3-1/2 points, in Ohio by around seven points. If he's able to hold those states, you're looking at 259. Then up here in the upper Midwest, where do you go and find the votes that you need to get to 270? Bret, between Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin in 2016, a total 78,000 votes determine the winner in all three of those states. But again, we're at 259 in this conversation. Does he hold onto Michigan? If so, he gets a second term. Remember, I have not touched Pennsylvania in this scenario. What about Minnesota? He was there yesterday. Could that happen? It could, but he would be one shy. Same for Wisconsin a 269. If that's the case you've got to go over here to New Hampshire or something to get back over to 270, 273 in this scenario. So it's going to change a lot, OK? And this mail-in vote issue is something that's going to be get a lot of attention, too. Look at this map. This is vote by mail states currently. At the moment, there are nine states plus the District of Columbia where every voter will be mailed ballot. That list is going to change, by the way, too, because they are already talking about it, Montana, maybe it's 10 states very soon, plus the District of Columbia, where you are as well. By comparison, four years ago in 2016 you had 33 million votes by mail or absentee votes out of a total of 140 million cast. They believe, Bret, that number, 33.2 million, could go as high as 80 million in 2020. And now you get all the attention on the post office, et cetera, toward the end of this week, and, again, next week with that herring. So a lot of ways to skin this cat, shall we say, and that's just a couple of them for tonight, Bret.",

He still hasn't even taken charge of making sure that everybody has enough PPE for crying out loud. There is no way to fully open the economy unless there's widespread testing.

One thing that was not brought up last night in the first night of the DNC was the increased violence in many cities across the country, including the city of -- that you know very well, Chicago. Shootings there up 40 percent year over year as is the murder rate. It's a big concern. July was the deadliest, most violent month in 28 years in Chicago. Are you concerned about this and are Democrats going to talk about it?"

You know, we have kids who are joining gangs when they're as young as eight, nine, 10 years old. But that's because we've cut funding for after- school programs, we've cut funding to our public schools, we have cut social services to the bone, so that there are no -- there are no more safety nets for our kids. And if we want to fight violence and we need to get into the communities and work with the communities to fight the violence. And we also need some sensible gun laws like universal background check, which by the way, 95 percent of all Americans support universal background checks."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "DUCKWORTH",
      "utterance": "Well, I don't accept moving funding from police forces. I -- what I support is putting more funding into community service programs. Our cops have a hard job and they do it every single day. But the fact of the matter is, when you're in Chicago, and you have somebody in your family that's having say, an overdose on opioid crisis, or is having a mental health problem, and you pick up the phone and you call 911. Because of all the cuts to social service programs, the person who comes to your door is going to be a police officer. And you're not going to get the kind of services that you need from a police officer. We need to allow our police officers to do their jobs of fighting crime."

But even when it comes to substance, we've already heard all Bill Clinton has to say. His message has not improved with time. His past actions, particularly his sexual misconduct, look worse in retrospect, not better.

Like putting money into our public schools, our kids can get back to school. Like investing in small businesses, like investing in parts of the country that need help.

      "utterance": "Yes, evening to you, Bret. It's complicated. OK, just at the outset. I'll lead you with that. I keep coming back to Pennsylvania, Bret, and I think over the next 70 plus days, really is going to find that, that is, you know, the coin of the realm in Pennsylvania. This is what we've done, we've put our battleground states in gray. We have 13 at the moment. That's going to change a little bit here and a little bit there as we get closer, some of these will be cancelled out. But we think in the race to 270, Biden starts at 213 and Trump starts at 126. So, if that is the case, Bret, how -- what's the key to victory? What's the path to victory? For Joe Biden, it's real easy if you win Pennsylvania, and then, you take a major state like Florida. It's only eight electoral votes away then you go hunting up here in the upper Midwest. Maybe you hold on to Minnesota, and if that's the case, Joe Biden would be the president under that scenario. And again, you can put in -- you can put in a hundred different scenarios here and get different outcomes. For Donald Trump, I mean, we've got Texas on the map but maybe it's not as blue as they're saying. So, we'll give that to him, maybe he holds storage as well. And you mentioned these battleground states where the president's been traveling for the last two days. He wants to hold Arizona; he was there earlier today. He wants to hold Iowa; he was there as well. He was up here in the upper Midwest, as well. I'll get to that in a moment here. He won Florida by 100,000 votes, North Carolina by 3-1/2 points, in Ohio by around seven points. If he's able to hold those states, you're looking at 259. Then up here in the upper Midwest, where do you go and find the votes that you need to get to 270? Bret, between Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin in 2016, a total 78,000 votes determine the winner in all three of those states. But again, we're at 259 in this conversation. Does he hold onto Michigan? If so, he gets a second term. Remember, I have not touched Pennsylvania in this scenario. What about Minnesota? He was there yesterday. Could that happen? It could, but he would be one shy. Same for Wisconsin a 269. If that's the case you've got to go over here to New Hampshire or something to get back over to 270, 273 in this scenario. So it's going to change a lot, OK? And this mail-in vote issue is something that's going to be get a lot of attention, too. Look at this map. This is vote by mail states currently. At the moment, there are nine states plus the District of Columbia where every voter will be mailed ballot. That list is going to change, by the way, too, because they are already talking about it, Montana, maybe it's 10 states very soon, plus the District of Columbia, where you are as well. By comparison, four years ago in 2016 you had 33 million votes by mail or absentee votes out of a total of 140 million cast. They believe, Bret, that number, 33.2 million, could go as high as 80 million in 2020. And now you get all the attention on the post office, et cetera, toward the end of this week, and, again, next week with that herring. So a lot of ways to skin this cat, shall we say, and that's just a couple of them for tonight, Bret."

The committee says those communications, including the interaction of the campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, posed a, quote, \"great counterintelligence threat.\" That said, Acting Intelligence Committee Chair Senator Marco Rubio said in a statement, quote, \"We can say without any hesitation that the committee found absolutely no evidence that then-candidate Donald Trump or his campaign colluded with the Russian government to meddle in the 2016 election.\" The University of Notre Dame is canceling in-person undergraduate classes for two weeks, at least for right now, after a spike in coronavirus cases that occurred since the semester began August 10th.

The beatings happened during a Black Lives Matter protest in downtown Portland with speeches like this aimed at police."

This is beyond socialism. Or we will indeed have Venezuela on steroids."

      "utterance": "President Trump in Arizona wrapping up at the top of this hour there, another campaign stop in another key state, tweeting out in reaction to former first lady Michelle Obama earlier today, \"Somebody please explain to Michelle Obama that Donald J. Trump would not be here in the beautiful White House if it weren't for the job done by your husband, Barack Obama. Biden was merely an afterthought, a good reason for that very late and unenthusiastic endorsement.\" This as the second night of the DNC, the convention rolls on virtually. Let's bring in our panel, FOX News senior political analyst Brit Hume, Mo Elleithee, executive director of the Georgetown Institute of Politics, Kimberley Strassel, a member of the editorial board at \"The Wall Street Journal,\" and Tom Bevan, Real Clear Politics co-founder and president. Mo, let me start with you. Some of the ratings TV-wise were lackluster, down from year-over-year for the last convention. The campaign itself is saying other people were screaming, we just aren't seeing all those numbers. What about this virtual effort?"

      "utterance": "Well, number one, there wasn't another choice, right. They couldn't gather, so of course they tried to do the best that they could with the situation. I am actually really interested in seeing the streaming numbers, because one thing that struck me as I was watching last night, we all know that conventions, both parties, these conventions over the past couple of decades have become made-for-TV events. The problem is they were getting less and less TV time. This seems to be the first major digital political convention. And we're going to see it again next week with the RNC. It was produced in a way that could be easily cut up, digested, shared online and on your mobile devices, so those numbers are the ones I'm really going to be looking for. But I thought they did a good job with it."

    {
      "speaker": "KIMBERLEY STRASSEL, WALL STREET JOURNAL",
      "utterance": "I think that was one of the more unfortunate aspects of the lineup, of having John Kasich say don't worry, the party is not turning left, followed by Bernie Sanders talking about and exalting in all the many ways that the party has turned left, from steps towards Medicare for all to basically the Green New Deal. And John Kasich, it was always understood, he was going to get rolled out at this. He's been a long time Trump critic. I don't think he has ever really got over losing that nomination battle. And he was going to say pretty much whatever they asked him to say. I don't think he really believes that the party hasn't turned left. The question is whether or not this convention, which there was a big effort on Monday night to suggest that there was a lot of moderates in the Democratic Party. Don't worry about our policy agenda. The question is, can you really convince Americans of that? And how good can Republicans do getting that point across to undecided voters?"

      "utterance": "Yes, it may be a big tent, but aren't we supposed to be, Bret, in the middle of a Me Too movement in which sexual predator politicians are supposed to be taboo? After all, Donald Trump's conduct is something Democrats never cease complaining about, and there are a number of examples of it, but so are they with Mr. Clinton as well. Four years ago, obviously, there was no way around it. His wife had been nominated and there was no way around having him there. But the Me Too movement has erupted since then, and it seems it's going to be suspended tonight, which I think is fun, interesting, different."

      "speaker": "TOM BEVAN, REAL CLEAR POLITICS CO-FOUNDER",
      "utterance": "It's going to be interesting to see where they go tonight. Last night was heavy on the anti-Trump stuff, and that's for good reason. Two-thirds to three-quarters of Democrats are going to turn out -- they says they are going to turn out to vote against Donald Trump, not necessarily for Joe Biden, and we saw that play out over the course of the night. It was very light on policy, very light on the vision thing. So I think that's something that we are going to see rolled out over the coming nights. It will be interesting to see how the speakers do that tonight."

      "speaker": "DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES",
      "utterance": "She was over her head. And frankly, she should have made the speech live, which she didn't do. She taped it. I thought it was a very divisive speech, extremely divisive. I wouldn't be in the White House except for Barack Obama, because they did a bad job, Biden and Obama. And if they did a good job, I wouldn't be here. I'd be building buildings someplace and having a good time."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "What about the president's reaction to the first lady's speech, Mo?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ELLEITHEE",
      "utterance": "Look, Donald Trump, if you look at all the polls, Donald Trump's biggest challenge right now is with a couple of key constituents. He's having challenges with independent voters. He's having challenges with suburban voters, particularly suburban women. He's having challenges with middle-class voters, self-described middle-class voters. Those are the voters who Michelle Obama had some of her strongest numbers with. I thought her speech last night was incredibly powerful, and for the president to actually take the bait and engage with her today, one of his biggest criticisms of her speech was that she undersold the number of COVID-related deaths. I'm not sure that's the right strategy for him to point that out. But for him to take that bait and try to go toe-to-toe with her today is only going to reinforce some of his negatives with those key groups."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Basically, I think he was saying that she didn't mention the right number and obviously didn't talk about Kamala Harris because it was taped before that. Kimberley?"

    {
      "speaker": "STRASSEL",
      "utterance": "Look, I agree with Mo in that Michelle Obama is very popular out there, she's a rock star within the Democratic Party. At the same time, this was an uncharacteristically divisive speech. I think it's going to be more interesting going forward in terms of what they end up focusing on. The entire first night, as Tom mentioned, was all about Donald Trump. It was about COVID and it was about character, and both trying to reflect negatively on him. But can they get away with an entire campaign about not talking about what they are really for and what they intend to do? I think that's going to be one of the big -- because that's going to be what this election really does come down to in the end."

    {
      "speaker": "HUME",
      "utterance": "These are the kinds of things, Bret, that the president could make some headway with, that and the fact that his cognitive abilities, Biden's, are not what they once were, if he had a focused message. But so far what you see with him, he's all over the place. He rises to every piece of bait. He responds to every criticism. Campaigns are won by discipline, focus, messaging delivered effectively. He needs to do that or this campaign, it seems to me, is not going to work."

It's the people in the crowds dancing like idiots. TREVOR NOAH, HOST, \"THE DAILY SHOW\": We all have to admit that a convention that takes place over Zoom just doesn't have the same juice. STEPHEN COLBERT, HOST, \"THE LATE SHOW\": Now, at one point they cut away for some quick reaction shots from the audience, then they stayed on these two women for, and I'm rounding down here, about.
