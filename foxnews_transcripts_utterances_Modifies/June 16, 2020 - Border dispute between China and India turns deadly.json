Because when Dylann Roof went into that church and murdered those nine people, and escaped to North Carolina, when he was arrested by three police officers, all of them approached his car with their guns drawn. But when they open the door of the car, they put their guns back in the holster. They didn't snatch him out of the car. He said that he was thirsty, and they gave him water to drink. He said that he was hungry, and they took him to a Burger King. That's the way he was arrested before coming back to Charleston. Now, compare that with the arrests that we've seen, George Floyd, a $20-counterfeit dollar. And look what happened to him. Look at this gentleman in Atlanta, the other night, how he was arrested. He talked for 20 minutes with the officer, being deferential. Yes, sir. No, sir. The two lessons to be learned from that.",

So, the Republicans control the House and the Senate. That goes as well for HBCU funding. All the HBCU funding that was historic in nature, first started with the House Republicans and the Senate Republicans, I'm agreeing with the President to fund them. And more importantly, permanent funding for HBCUs. The democratic plan was temporary. And we made it permanent, through negotiating with Lamar Alexander. And those are just the facts. You know, he can try to spin things as much as he wants, with all due respect to him. And then with opportunity zones, 75 billion to distressed communities across the nation.

In that executive order on police reform it creates credentialing, certification, and the best practices for the use of force. Part of that initiative, the president wants to ban the use of chokeholds unless an officer's life is in danger, addresses information sharing to track officers who have repeated complaints against them, and offers federal incentives to police departments to deploy social service experts on issues like mental health, homelessness, and addiction. Democrats, many of them, the House speaker saying it's weak, not enough. You heard from the House Majority Whip. Van Jones on another channel said it's a step in the right direction and progress. Where are we? Let's bring in our panel, Jeff Mason, White House correspondent for \"Reuters,\" Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at \"The Federalist,\" and Guy Benson, political editor at https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__Townhall.com&d=DwICAg&c=cnx1hdOQtepEQkpermZGwQ&r=tgDLkJy54PfJyWJwul3dKe54qGxqO7b7d5vjo7RcZds&m=-Egs3UuUUtorjl_swKtrkxaUxpL-VTgRaxztROyZnXg&s=YcyLWn2bzypB9eezfpYvHapNMEBVs3ss8m-9l44TBOM&e= , host of \"The Guy Benson Show\" on FOX News Radio. Mollie, let me start with you. I don't think the president believes that that's the be be-all, end-all on the executive order. Obviously, Senator Tim Scott is moving forward with legislation. He's hoping to get bipartisan support for that, and Democrats have their own. MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR, \"THE FEDERALIST\": The executive order lays out a number of things that are appropriate for federal executive action. And you have bills happening in the House and the Senate that deal with this as well. But I wonder if too much of our response has political and too federal. Policing is very local, and more than anything, there's this huge elephant in the room that nobody is talking about. If you want to improve the situation for people growing up in the United States today, one of the very biggest things you can do is ensure that children are raised in homes with their own married parents. And we have a crisis in this country with 40 percent of children not being born to married parents. And if you're talking about graduation of my school, getting into college, having a career, not getting in altercations with police, not being incarcerated, not being drug addicted, and all these types of things, this is one of the most important things we could do. Nobody seems to be talking about it, probably because it's very difficult to talk about it. But it's very important if we actually care about children in this country and improving their situation.",

The president talked at the beginning of his remarks today about expressing, or expressed his own concern and condolences to the families of victims of police, of police violence, and then pivoted pretty quickly after that, though, to a discussion of law and order and more of the tougher rhetoric that has characterize his response to this for the last couple weeks. So it seemed like he was looking for a little bit of a middle ground. The executive order, as you mentioned before, does take a position on banning chokeholds except when the officer's life is at risk. That is an issue that Democrats and Republicans on the Hill are not entirely aligned on. But in general, he still gave a pretty law and order themed speech today at the rollout of this executive order.",

He was acknowledging the pain that these families have gone through because of these various experiences, and I think it's just a human thing. If you are face-to-face with people who've lost someone at the hands of the police and have them sitting right in front of you, that may change not just your tone but also your heart a little bit in the way that you approach an issue. And it's right, he did pivot back to law and order. That is a theme that he has sounded many times over his adult life, saying that we are not going to defund the police and that sort of thing. But I think a few of these steps that were taken were smart, and now we turn to Capitol Hill. Will the Republicans and Democrats manage to find a few things that they can agree out and pass something, or is it going to become a political football to motivate political bases with nothing getting done before the election?

Go down to Charleston and talk to anybody down there, they will tell you and I've seen the headlines other local Charleston papers and opportunity zones in Charleston put Jennifer Kishan on steroids. I didn't write that headline. A white person wrote that headline. And you will hear it all over this country. That's what opportunity zones have done. Put justification on steroids.

But there are two things to learn from that event. And I would hope you will take a hard look at it. Number one, we learned a little bit about policing and what we're dealing with today. Because when Dylann Roof went into that church and murdered those nine people, and escaped to North Carolina, when he was arrested by three police officers, all of them approached his car with their guns drawn. But when they open the door of the car, they put their guns back in the holster. They didn't snatch him out of the car. He said that he was thirsty, and they gave him water to drink. He said that he was hungry, and they took him to a Burger King. That's the way he was arrested before coming back to Charleston. Now, compare that with the arrests that we've seen, George Floyd, a $20-counterfeit dollar. And look what happened to him. Look at this gentleman in Atlanta, the other night, how he was arrested. He talked for 20 minutes with the officer, being deferential. Yes, sir. No, sir. The two lessons to be learned from that."

In fact, the whole concept of prison reform came from the White House and being able to secure to build in the Senate came from the President's leadership with Republicans to get it on the floor and commitment from law enforcement. That's why we got the first step back. And for him to say that that's not true, it's completely wrong. And last of all, we're talking about a Republican Congress. So, the Republicans control the House and the Senate. That goes as well for HBCU funding. All the HBCU funding that was historic in nature, first started with the House Republicans and the Senate Republicans, I'm agreeing with the President to fund them. And more importantly, permanent funding for HBCUs. The democratic plan was temporary. And we made it permanent, through negotiating with Lamar Alexander. And those are just the facts. You know, he can try to spin things as much as he wants, with all due respect to him. And then with opportunity zones, 75 billion to distressed communities across the nation. What we need is local leadership for the places that he's talking about that gentrifying. These are localities, we have local leaders who haven't changed your local system to allow for the people to be beneficiaries of on growth in their communities. And so, if we can get local policy change, I think that'll work out well for all communities."

And so, if you want real change, listen to Donald Trump that's talking about bringing investments into communities and not just doing that, but bringing police and communities together. You can talk to Chuck Schumer about the families that were represented with this E.O. by giving us some of the key provisions such as bringing co- responders into neighborhoods, to deescalate. Co-responders and social workers will work with law enforcement to deescalate on crimes dealing with mental health or drug addiction or homelessness.

But I can tell you, it was a -- it was a very emotional moment when we got to hear directly from the families. But I think what speaks louder than anything, the words of the Executive Order that accounted for ways that we can reform our system in a positive way, along with law enforcement. And so, we had law enforcement leaders and the families together. And so, this is a watershed moment for America to start working on how we revitalize our communities and keep them safe by working with our police and not against them."

They're forgetting that like it's about the system. It's about giving economic opportunity to people. It's about allowing for people to get justice, in the justice system. It's about getting education and access to education. And that's what the President is all about, results. And that's why he was elected. Because people want to see something real and not just get lied to by politicians.

In that executive order on police reform it creates credentialing, certification, and the best practices for the use of force. Part of that initiative, the president wants to ban the use of chokeholds unless an officer's life is in danger, addresses information sharing to track officers who have repeated complaints against them, and offers federal incentives to police departments to deploy social service experts on issues like mental health, homelessness, and addiction. Democrats, many of them, the House speaker saying it's weak, not enough. You heard from the House Majority Whip. Van Jones on another channel said it's a step in the right direction and progress. Where are we? Let's bring in our panel, Jeff Mason, White House correspondent for \"Reuters,\" Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at \"The Federalist,\" and Guy Benson, political editor at https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__Townhall.com&d=DwICAg&c=cnx1hdOQtepEQkpermZGwQ&r=tgDLkJy54PfJyWJwul3dKe54qGxqO7b7d5vjo7RcZds&m=-Egs3UuUUtorjl_swKtrkxaUxpL-VTgRaxztROyZnXg&s=YcyLWn2bzypB9eezfpYvHapNMEBVs3ss8m-9l44TBOM&e= , host of \"The Guy Benson Show\" on FOX News Radio. Mollie, let me start with you. I don't think the president believes that that's the be be-all, end-all on the executive order. Obviously, Senator Tim Scott is moving forward with legislation. He's hoping to get bipartisan support for that, and Democrats have their own. MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR, \"THE FEDERALIST\": The executive order lays out a number of things that are appropriate for federal executive action. And you have bills happening in the House and the Senate that deal with this as well. But I wonder if too much of our response has political and too federal. Policing is very local, and more than anything, there's this huge elephant in the room that nobody is talking about. If you want to improve the situation for people growing up in the United States today, one of the very biggest things you can do is ensure that children are raised in homes with their own married parents. And we have a crisis in this country with 40 percent of children not being born to married parents. And if you're talking about graduation of my school, getting into college, having a career, not getting in altercations with police, not being incarcerated, not being drug addicted, and all these types of things, this is one of the most important things we could do. Nobody seems to be talking about it, probably because it's very difficult to talk about it. But it's very important if we actually care about children in this country and improving their situation."

The president talked at the beginning of his remarks today about expressing, or expressed his own concern and condolences to the families of victims of police, of police violence, and then pivoted pretty quickly after that, though, to a discussion of law and order and more of the tougher rhetoric that has characterize his response to this for the last couple weeks. So it seemed like he was looking for a little bit of a middle ground. The executive order, as you mentioned before, does take a position on banning chokeholds except when the officer's life is at risk. That is an issue that Democrats and Republicans on the Hill are not entirely aligned on. But in general, he still gave a pretty law and order themed speech today at the rollout of this executive order."

If you are face-to-face with people who've lost someone at the hands of the police and have them sitting right in front of you, that may change not just your tone but also your heart a little bit in the way that you approach an issue. And it's right, he did pivot back to law and order. That is a theme that he has sounded many times over his adult life, saying that we are not going to defund the police and that sort of thing. But I think a few of these steps that were taken were smart, and now we turn to Capitol Hill. Will the Republicans and Democrats manage to find a few things that they can agree out and pass something, or is it going to become a political football to motivate political bases with nothing getting done before the election? I know where my money is right now, but I hope I'm being too cynical."

The Department of Justice filing a lawsuit, a civil complaint against John Bolton, saying \"Simply put, the defendant struck a bargain with the United States as a condition of his employment in one of the most sensitive and important national security positions in the United States government. Now he wants to renege on that bargain by unilaterally deciding that a prepublication review process is complete,\" and essentially saying it should move forward. What about this? The ACLU says it has no chance, but clearly they're going to try to block this book."

And this happened to President Obama. It's happened other presidents. But it's just unseemly for advisors who have this sensitive information to just turn around before an election and try to publish a book, I think."

These young reporters from Colorado, tired of bad news -- I hear you -- covered everything from movies to their very own backyard water park. There you go. Seven-year-old Chase Gilchrist was surprised with a drive-by parade, nearly 200 cars at his home in New Jersey. The soon to be third grader found out that he is about to face his fourth battle with metastatic brain cancer. The stream of cars filled with neighbors and well-wishers made sure he knew they were pulling and praying for him and so are we. Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight.
