Let's review that world stage, shall we? Well, ISIS is more than handled, for now. North Korea, bold moves by Trump may create an historic thaw. Syria, he drew redlines and then he enforced them. He made that historic visit to the homes of each major religion. He embraced the new Saudi leader, a key ally. He recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital. And behind it all, he's rebuilding our military, telling the world that his priorities are that. And ain't the vanishing polar bears.

And as you've seen him come through the first year of his presidency, he's emboldened the allies. He's kind of distance himself from the people who aren't necessarily in our interests. Turkey is one of those examples. When it comes to Syria, he addressed that today. He talked about the Iran deal. Talked about the Syria strategy being, look, we want to get out eventually, but we have to have a plan because we don't want the Mediterranean, as he said, to be a free-for-all for the Iranians. And we're controlling that territory now. When it comes to the Iran deal, I also believe, based on the president's rhetoric in the past few months, and also today, he said it was built on decaying foundation and has continued to decay. That's the language is telling us he's going to scrap it. But the agreement is not -- or the disagreement isn't necessarily the Iran deal is bad. There's agreement on that.

Getting from a source some fitness reports and counseling records related to Dr. Ronny Jackson that were signed by President Trump but also ones that were signed by President Obama with commentary. President Obama writing \"Ronny's positive impact cannot be overstated. He's a tremendous asset to the entire White House team. Already, a level of performance and responsibility that far exceeds his current rank. Promote to rear admiral now.\" So this would have been seven years ago. Here's one dated 24 October of 2016 from President Obama: \"Ronny does a great job. Genuine enthusiasm. Poised under pressure. Incredible work ethic and follow-through. Ronny continues to inspire confidence with the care he provides to me, my family and my team. Continue to promote ahead of peers.\" So a real vote of confidence there from President Obama. He also, in another of fitness report, wrote, \"Exceptional physician and leader. Ronny has been a dedicated and valuable member of my team. He has tireless ensured not only my health and well-being but that of my family and entire administration. He has earned my complete trust and respect. Continue to groom and promote this highly capable officer.\" One more, dated 23rd of October 2014: \"A most impressive leader who continues to perform at the flag officer level. Ronny has earned my confidence and the gratitude of my family for his diligence and knowledge. Promote to flag immediately.\" And then one from President Trump which would've been probably earlier this year: \"Dr. Jackson is a great doctor and leader. Two-star material.\" So there we have evidence from President Obama and President Trump. But President Obama more importantly, because he was not considering promoting him to be the secretary of Veterans Affairs, giving laudatory commendations to Dr. Ronny Jackson, the rear admiral. But we have also confirmed that in 2012, Dr. Ronny Jackson ordered a watchdog report when he and another doctor in the White House medical unit, Dr. Jeffrey Kuhlman, were going through something of a power struggle. The watchdog report found that they both exhibited unprofessional behavior that led to low morale among staff members who described the work environment as being caught between parents going through a bitter divorce. It was recommended that either Jackson or Kuhlman or both leave the White House medical office. So that inspector general's report could be what people are alluding to today about inappropriate behavior and low morale in the White House medical unit. But if you compare that with the laudatory comments that were given by President Obama, I mean, there's definitely some ammunition there that might help him in his confirmation. So a struggle going on here between opponents of Ronny Jackson, supporters of Ronny Jackson. The president met with him in the Oval Office this afternoon. Earlier today at a press conference, I asked President Trump about Jackson. He said it's his decision, Jackson's, to make whether he wants to go through this confirmation process, which now, Kimberly, looks like it is going to be a fairly arduous process for Ronny Jackson. So we don't know what he's going to do. But opponents and supporters are lining up here to give their say on what they think about Ronny Jackson.",

And then, he supposedly enforces a redline and, of course, then you have people saying, well, this was pretty ineffectual. He didn't do much here. So, what is exactly the strategy? We don't have a strategy. And then, I think to myself, well, let me listen to Greg. Greg is saying this guy is a great foreign policy leader.

And as you've seen him come through the first year of his presidency, he's emboldened the allies. He's kind of distance himself from the people who aren't necessarily in our interests. Turkey is one of those examples. When it comes to Syria, he addressed that today. He talked about the Iran deal. Talked about the Syria strategy being, look, we want to get out eventually, but we have to have a plan because we don't want the Mediterranean, as he said, to be a free-for-all for the Iranians. And we're controlling that territory now. When it comes to the Iran deal, I also believe, based on the president's rhetoric in the past few months, and also today, he said it was built on decaying foundation and has continued to decay. That's the language is telling us he's going to scrap it. But the agreement is not -- or the disagreement isn't necessarily the Iran deal is bad. There's agreement on that.

They want to be able to have -- reconsiders the Iran nuclear agreement, and he wants them to get involved and go along with what he wants to do as it relates to Syria and Iran, in terms of that, you know, geopolitical area that is strife with problems in the Middle East. So, in terms of that, he's already gotten in his head some kind of negotiating chip. That they're going to have to play ball. They're going to have to be respectful. She's going to have to stop with the, you know, incessant criticism. Because, guess what? She's no longer the iron lady that she was.

You'll know it when you see it, in terms of getting to that point. I will say at this point, I think Republicans want to discuss impeachment more than Democrats because they're looking to fire up their base.

      "utterance": "Kimberly, good afternoon to you. Getting from a source some fitness reports and counseling records related to Dr. Ronny Jackson that were signed by President Trump but also ones that were signed by President Obama with commentary. President Obama writing \"Ronny's positive impact cannot be overstated. He's a tremendous asset to the entire White House team. Already, a level of performance and responsibility that far exceeds his current rank. Promote to rear admiral now.\" So this would have been seven years ago. Here's one dated 24 October of 2016 from President Obama: \"Ronny does a great job. Genuine enthusiasm. Poised under pressure. Incredible work ethic and follow-through. Ronny continues to inspire confidence with the care he provides to me, my family and my team. Continue to promote ahead of peers.\" So a real vote of confidence there from President Obama. He also, in another of fitness report, wrote, \"Exceptional physician and leader. Ronny has been a dedicated and valuable member of my team. He has tireless ensured not only my health and well-being but that of my family and entire administration. He has earned my complete trust and respect. Continue to groom and promote this highly capable officer.\" One more, dated 23rd of October 2014: \"A most impressive leader who continues to perform at the flag officer level. Ronny has earned my confidence and the gratitude of my family for his diligence and knowledge. Promote to flag immediately.\""

    {
      "speaker": "And then one from President Trump which would've been probably earlier this year",
      "utterance": "\"Dr. Jackson is a great doctor and leader. Two-star material.\" So there we have evidence from President Obama and President Trump. But President Obama more importantly, because he was not considering promoting him to be the secretary of Veterans Affairs, giving laudatory commendations to Dr. Ronny Jackson, the rear admiral. But we have also confirmed that in 2012, Dr. Ronny Jackson ordered a watchdog report when he and another doctor in the White House medical unit, Dr. Jeffrey Kuhlman, were going through something of a power struggle. The watchdog report found that they both exhibited unprofessional behavior that led to low morale among staff members who described the work environment as being caught between parents going through a bitter divorce. It was recommended that either Jackson or Kuhlman or both leave the White House medical office. So that inspector general's report could be what people are alluding to today about inappropriate behavior and low morale in the White House medical unit. But if you compare that with the laudatory comments that were given by President Obama, I mean, there's definitely some ammunition there that might help him in his confirmation. So a struggle going on here between opponents of Ronny Jackson, supporters of Ronny Jackson. The president met with him in the Oval Office this afternoon. Earlier today at a press conference, I asked President Trump about Jackson. He said it's his decision, Jackson's, to make whether he wants to go through this confirmation process, which now, Kimberly, looks like it is going to be a fairly arduous process for Ronny Jackson. So we don't know what he's going to do. But opponents and supporters are lining up here to give their say on what they think about Ronny Jackson."

During the transition time, he was invited, because President Trump was inviting -- at the time candidate Trump -- everybody to come, whether they were on a different side of the environmental issues or climate change or business or building the economy. So when you show somebody respect like that, say, \"I want to take the time to see it face to face, hear what you have to say,\" that is respect. That was good. So he's being honest.

Take a look at this. The cops called a bunch of semis, a bunch of truck drivers, told them to park underneath the bridge so when the guy couldn't jump -- he couldn't jump anywhere. So that actually prevented the suicide. The guy ended up walking off the bridge, where he was taken to a hospital for evaluation. That, my friends, is a great idea."

Now, it sounds like a small idea, but there are 400 acres of property at that V.A. facility. It took ten years to get ten parking spots so that these homeless vets who have run into hard times have somewhere to sleep at night.
