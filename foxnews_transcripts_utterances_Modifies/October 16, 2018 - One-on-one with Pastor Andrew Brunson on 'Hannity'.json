      "sentences": "Buckle up. A lot of breaking news. Welcome to \"Hannity.\" We are only three weeks away until one of the most important midterm elections you'll ever see in your lifetime.  Democrats tonight are reeling. Three weeks from tonight, you have the power to once again shock the world. You have it all.  Now, for months, they predicted the so-called blue wave. Tonight, there is a full panic mode. Party leaders, 2020 hopeful Elizabeth Warren is frankly making the whole party look absurd. Her DNA publicity stunt has backfired.  Her decades-long claims of Native American heritage is nothing more than a fraud. Meanwhile, many Democratic Senate candidates are losing massive ground all over the country and still, the future of the U.S. Congress, the House, that remains very much in doubt tonight, especially in the House of Representatives.  Coming up tonight, we're going to show you how a vote for any Democrat three weeks from today in November is actually a vote for Nancy, Pelosi Chuck Schumer and yes impeach 45, Maxine Waters. And while some on the left are campaigning as so-called moderates, with the help of an undercover report from Project Veritas, we have exclusive video tonight. We will expose how this is one big fraud. It's not true.  Also tonight, Trump hating rapper T.I. has released a vile despicable disgusting video featuring the First Lady Melania Trump looking like a stripper in the Oval Office, and Democrats defend -- where are they defending the first lady against what is a horribly sexist offensive attack tonight? Well, so far, we haven't heard from them and it's now been four days. Crickets. We'll also have full coverage of the Saudi journalist who has now feared dead as our Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is now in Turkey after being in Saudi Arabia. And coming up later, freed Pastor Andrew Brunson held because of his Christian faith, he will join us and talk about his ordeal.  Sit tight, buckle up, a lot of news. Time for our breaking news opening monologue.",

      "sentences": "All right. For decades, Senator Elizabeth Warren claimed to be a Native American. From 1986 to 1995, she listed herself as a Native American in the directory of the Association of American Law Schools. She also identified as a Native American during her tenure as a professor at the University of Pennsylvania and later while teaching at Harvard Law School, she was described as the, quote, the only tenured minority woman on multiple occasions. Senator Warren stated that her mother and father were forced to elope because of racism surrounding her mother's Native American lineage. She was featured in a Native American cookbook entitled \"Pow Wow Chow\". As it turns out, according to a DNA test released by Senator Warren herself just yesterday, she is only approximately one sixty-fourth or one one-thousandth twenty-fourth Native American. That's less than 0.1 percent Native American.   According to the American Journal of Human Genetics, that would be less than the average white American living in the United States. And just to recap, Senator Warren claimed to be a Native American in her professional career and her political career all for personal gain, then laughably tried to prove her detractors wrong by releasing a DNA test showing less than 0.1 percent Native American heritage. So, what kind of fantasy world is she living? Is this really the best the Democrats have to offer? And now, even the mainstream media, while initially supporting her, they're now mocking Elizabeth Warren's DNA debacle. And Senator Warren, a leader among the left, the Democratic Party, and tonight, she is turning into a national embarrassment along with that party, and this comes at the absolute worst time for Democrats, with just three weeks to go until the midterm elections. That's three weeks from today  The Democratic Party is in disarray, all across the country. But especially in red states, Democratic candidates have been coached to avoid any divisive topics and basically to lie to you the American people. They want you to believe that they're fair-minded moderates. They are lying.  There are virtually no moderates left in the modern Democratic Party.   Still, the left-wing Center for American Progress, John Podesta's group, advised that congressional hopefuls, don't -- don't talk about immigration, don't do it. Meanwhile, party leaders are begging Democrats not to talk about plans to impeach the president. But some like Maxine Waters, well, she's even admitting they're telling her not to talk about it, but she just can't help herself. Take a look.",

New Jersey 11, GOP candidate Jay Webber facing Democrat Mikie Sherrill.  She leads Webber by four in a recent poll. Pennsylvania one, Republican incumbent Brian Fitzpatrick up against Democrat Scott Wallace. Finally, we have Pennsylvania five where Republican Pearl Kim has her hands full against Democrat Mary Scanlon and the Dems may take this one if Republicans don't get out with voting with a sense of urgency.  This is it. Three weeks from tonight, you'll tune in for results. Joining us now: Salem nationally syndicated radio host, friend of the program, Larry Elder. Fox News investigative reporter and contributor, Sara Carter. Also, the author of the new book \"Why We Fight\", Fox News national security strategist, Sebastian Gorka. Look, I know, Dr. Gorka, America is going to survive if the people don't get out and Pelosi becomes a speaker. But their agenda is clear.",

Simple question. LARRY ELDER, SALEM RADIO NATIONAL HOST/AM 870: And the answer, of course, is obviously yes. As you pointed out, the black unemployment, all-time low and President Trump is doing something about something that inner-city blacks have wanted the president's to do for a very long time, and has to stop the flow of illegal, unskilled work that workers, that pose competition to jobs and puts downward pressure on wages. And for once, for a change, the president's doing something about it. My friend who sits on the Civil Rights Commission, Peter Kirsanow, sent a long letter to his Congresswoman Marcia Fudge who at the time was head of the Congressional Black Caucus about this problem of illegal immigration. She didn't even respond. And Peter said, all of the members of the of the Civil Rights Commission, the moderates, the independents and the conservatives all talked about the threat posed to unskilled workers black and brown from illegal immigration, and no presidents doing anything about it until Donald Trump. And believe me, black people are responding to it. That's why you have somebody like Kanye West coming out in favor of Donald Trump.",

Democrats tonight are reeling. Three weeks from tonight, you have the power to once again shock the world. You have it all. Now, for months, they predicted the so-called blue wave. Tonight, there is a full panic mode. Party leaders, 2020 hopeful Elizabeth Warren is frankly making the whole party look absurd. Her DNA publicity stunt has backfired.  Her decades-long claims of Native American heritage is nothing more than a fraud. Meanwhile, many Democratic Senate candidates are losing massive ground all over the country and still, the future of the U.S. Congress, the House, that remains very much in doubt tonight, especially in the House of Representatives. Coming up tonight, we're going to show you how a vote for any Democrat three weeks from today in November is actually a vote for Nancy, Pelosi Chuck Schumer and yes impeach 45, Maxine Waters. And while some on the left are campaigning as so-called moderates, with the help of an undercover report from Project Veritas, we have exclusive video tonight. We will expose how this is one big fraud. It's not true. Also tonight, Trump hating rapper T.I. has released a vile despicable disgusting video featuring the First Lady Melania Trump looking like a stripper in the Oval Office, and Democrats defend -- where are they defending the first lady against what is a horribly sexist offensive attack tonight? Well, so far, we haven't heard from them and it's now been four days. Crickets. We'll also have full coverage of the Saudi journalist who has now feared dead as our Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is now in Turkey after being in Saudi Arabia.

From 1986 to 1995, she listed herself as a Native American in the directory of the Association of American Law Schools. She also identified as a Native American during her tenure as a professor at the University of Pennsylvania and later while teaching at Harvard Law School, she was described as the, quote, the only tenured minority woman on multiple occasions. Senator Warren stated that her mother and father were forced to elope because of racism surrounding her mother's Native American lineage. She was featured in a Native American cookbook entitled \"Pow Wow Chow\". As it turns out, according to a DNA test released by Senator Warren herself just yesterday, she is only approximately one sixty-fourth or one one-thousandth twenty-fourth Native American. That's less than 0.1 percent Native American. According to the American Journal of Human Genetics, that would be less than the average white American living in the United States. And just to recap, Senator Warren claimed to be a Native American in her professional career and her political career all for personal gain, then laughably tried to prove her detractors wrong by releasing a DNA test showing less than 0.1 percent Native American heritage. So, what kind of fantasy world is she living? Is this really the best the Democrats have to offer? And now, even the mainstream media, while initially supporting her, they're now mocking Elizabeth Warren's DNA debacle. And Senator Warren, a leader among the left, the Democratic Party, and tonight, she is turning into a national embarrassment along with that party, and this comes at the absolute worst time for Democrats, with just three weeks to go until the midterm elections. That's three weeks from today The Democratic Party is in disarray, all across the country. But especially in red states, Democratic candidates have been coached to avoid any divisive topics and basically to lie to you the American people. They want you to believe that they're fair-minded moderates. They are lying.  There are virtually no moderates left in the modern Democratic Party. Still, the left-wing Center for American Progress, John Podesta's group, advised that congressional hopefuls, don't -- don't talk about immigration, don't do it. Meanwhile, party leaders are begging Democrats not to talk about plans to impeach the president. But some like Maxine Waters, well, she's even admitting they're telling her not to talk about it, but she just can't help herself. Take a look."

This time, we have the campaign of Claire McCaskill, her staff caught on tape admitting their political strategy -- lie to the voters, the people of Missouri, pretend to be something you're not, a moderate. This is what we have been telling you all along. Take a look."

In 2003, even suggested, oh, it's okay for Americans to go fight for the Taliban. She also promoted events at Arizona State University with a lawyer who represented the blind sheikh. Yes, that blind sheikh. She also organized an anti-war rally with self-described witches and invited them. And tonight, even more past comments continuing to surface.

In their third district, GOP Representative Tom MacArthur running against former Obama national security official Andy Kim. Recent poll had MacArthur up by only two points. In New Jersey seven, Republican Leonard Lance in a crucial class with another former Obama official, Tom Malinowski. New Jersey 11, GOP candidate Jay Webber facing Democrat Mikie Sherrill.  She leads Webber by four in a recent poll. Pennsylvania one, Republican incumbent Brian Fitzpatrick up against Democrat Scott Wallace.

Simple question. LARRY ELDER, SALEM RADIO NATIONAL HOST/AM 870: And the answer, of course, is obviously yes. As you pointed out, the black unemployment, all-time low and President Trump is doing something about something that inner-city blacks have wanted the president's to do for a very long time, and has to stop the flow of illegal, unskilled work that workers, that pose competition to jobs and puts downward pressure on wages. And for once, for a change, the president's doing something about it. My friend who sits on the Civil Rights Commission, Peter Kirsanow, sent a long letter to his Congresswoman Marcia Fudge who at the time was head of the Congressional Black Caucus about this problem of illegal immigration. She didn't even respond. And Peter said, all of the members of the of the Civil Rights Commission, the moderates, the independents and the conservatives all talked about the threat posed to unskilled workers black and brown from illegal immigration, and no presidents doing anything about it until Donald Trump.

We just went through that with Justice Kavanaugh, and he was innocent all the way as far as I'm concerned. So we have to find out what happened. Although, that end, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was in Saudi Arabia today meeting with the king and crown prince, and tomorrow he's heading to Turkey.

      "speaker": "BRUNSON",
      "utterance": "They weren't and that was one of the very difficult things is that I was isolated by culture and by language, but especially by religion.  And it was very difficult to be the only Christian among them."

      "speaker": "HANNITY",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BRUNSON",
      "utterance": "Well, what was surprising is that they told me that I was being held for terrorism and for trying to overthrow the government. And the truth is if we had been preaching Jesus Christ, sir. That's why we were in Turkey for 23 years, up until that time, is to share the gospel of Jesus Christ with Turks. We done that openly and never had a problem. So it was very shocking to be accused of terrorism."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Well, and also -- but it really came down to your Christian faith in many ways, which is -- and I thought your prayer was extraordinarily touching with the president. I want to talk -- what was your worst moment?  Because I can imagine that when you lose your freedom you pretty much lose everything, especially in a foreign country, not being know why -- not knowing why you're even being held. And, you know, not having anyone to share your faith, your values with you, what was your lowest moment?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BRUNSON",
      "utterance": "Well, when I was arrested and it kept going on and on, and it seemed that there was no way out, and I lost a lot of hope. And what helped me -- I began to see that there was value in my suffering especially as time went on. I saw that many people around the world began praying for me. And I began to see that God."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "How did you find out about that? How did you hear about that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BRUNSON",
      "utterance": "Well, this is, especially, through my wife because she was the only contact I've really had with the outside world. And she could visit me for about half an hour every week through a glass and speaking on the phone and she would bring encouragement to me and tell me that people were praying for me. And as I learned that, I began to see that God was involved in this, and that God was going to do something with my suffering that had value."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Why did you say this morning in an interview that I was one of the most hated man in Turkey, probably?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BRUNSON",
      "utterance": "Well, I've been accused of trying to overthrow the government of being aligned with the terrorist movement, also being part of the PKK which is a Kurdish guerrilla terror movement. And also, I was blamed for the economic problems Turkey had. So, there are probably aren't too many people who like me there right now."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Let's talk about that moment that touched a lot of people, you're a man of great faith and, obviously, a strong Christian and you prayed for the president, let's talk about that moment."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BRUNSON",
      "utterance": "Well, it's something that we had hoped to be able to do. My wife had -- for some time wanted to pray some verses over him from Isaiah, just asking for the spirit of God to come upon him. And before we went to meet him, when we've learned we would be able to visit him in the White House, we've prayed together, my wife and I, and asked God to give us an opportunity to pray for the president. And it's a great privilege. I think many pastors would love to do it. And our president needs prayer."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "You know, pastor, we're glad you're home, for you and your family. It was a very touching moment. I think all of us -- I'll start with me, could use more God in our lives. And I think you impact a lot of people. Welcome home, sir. We're glad to have you back."
    },

      "speaker": "BRUNSON",

    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Very welcome to do it, sir. Jay Sekulow did an amazing job. The president stood strong, and thank God you're here. All right, when we come back, the left continues to literally berate the First Lady Melania Trump in the most disturbing, disgusting video. And we'll compare what would the reaction in the media be if this was, say, Michelle Obama or Hillary Clinton. Also, we told you about our interview with Rush Limbaugh, Thursday. We have another announcement straight ahead tonight."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "All right. Last week, rapper T.I. tweeted out what is a despicable, disgusting vile video attacking the first lady, Melania Trump as a stripper. We're not going to show a lot but here's a part of it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "The left's never ending and recent vile smears against the first lady didn't stop there. Last Friday, one of the cohosts of The View suggested that the first lady may have been President Trump's mistress.  These are vile attacks. Watch this."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "UNINDENTIFIED FEMALE",
      "utterance": "Is it possible that she's not concerned with his mistresses because she was one of them? Is that possible?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "It's no wonder the first lady told ABC that she was one of the most bullied people because it's true. Here with reaction, senior adviser to Donald J. Trump for President, President Trump's daughter-in-law, Lara Trump. I know Melania. I've had a chance to really meet her. English is her fifth language, an amazing background, life, career, we saw the incredible trip she just took. The dignity, the class she has. If you're not a Democrat, the Democrats are silent. LARA TRUMP, SENIOR ADVISER FOR TRUMP 2020: Of course."
    },

      "speaker": "HANNITY",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "TRUMP",
      "utterance": "This supposed party of women, Sean, is -- as you've said, completely silent here. I'm waiting for anyone to speak up against this on the Democrat side. And we have heard absolute crickets from them. It's disgusting. And sadly it's not that shocking anymore because we know that there is no low, too low for the left, for the media, for Hollywood, when it comes to the president, to the first lady, and to the entire first family. And I don't care what side of the political aisle you're on. The First Lady of the United States deserves respect. This is disgusting and it should be condemned by everyone."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Well, I don't hear any calls for an FBI investigations -- Keith Ellison, you know, like they did with Judge Kavanaugh."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TRUMP",
      "utterance": "Yeah, of course not."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "And some of those allegations were so over-the-top, it was patently absurd. I don't see them ever defending Melania Trump ever.  Where's Hillary? Where's Pelosi? Where's Feinstein?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TRUMP",
      "utterance": "Double standard across the board. And you think about how differently this would have been treated if this were our previous first lady. Again, I think it is horrible -- it doesn't matter who you voted for whether or not you are Democrat or Republican, this is disgusting and it absolutely should be condemned by everyone."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "I know you're working on 2020, but an interesting phenomenon is happening. We do have this important election. Things seem to have shifted dramatically especially in the senate races. I worry more about the house. I hope people pay very close attention if they vote for a congressman, they're voting for Pelosi. Vote for the senate."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TRUMP",
      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "When you see real trouble for Claire McCaskill who's been exposed, Bredesen has been exposed. Dean Heller is doing better in Nevada.  Krysten Sinema is collapsing in Arizona. Heidi Heitkamp is collapsing.  Joe Donnelly is in trouble. What do you say to people about these House races who are more concerned tonight?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TRUMP",
      "utterance": "Well, the entire midterm election is so, so important. And that's why you see the president out on the road like he's been. And I think he's having a real impact. You just mentioned all these races, Sean, this is making an impact with people across the country who are voting in the midterm elections. And again, often times the midterms are not as exciting for people to get out and vote in. Often time people stay home. You cannot stay home on November 6th. Early voting on North Carolina starts tomorrow. I was there all day today, campaigning with some great candidates down in North Carolina. You've got to get out, you've got to vote early, and you've got to vote for Republicans."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Their agenda is simple, impeachment, endless investigation. They want."

      "utterance": "Take back the tax cuts."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Open borders, but don't say it. Impeachment, don't say it. Keep Obamacare. That's the whole agenda."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TRUMP",
      "utterance": "And socialism, of course. I mean, it's crazy what the Democrats are proposing. And I hope everybody is paying attention because we have to keep the house and the senate in the midterm."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "All right. Lara Trump, thank you for being with us. And -- on behalf of so many, we apologize our first lady deserves so much better and it's sad. All right. When we come back, Rush Limbaugh who will be on this show for the full hour, Thursday night, will explain what happens if the Democrats do take the house. And, yeah, we have one more announcement tonight, a lot of announcements this week. Straight ahead."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Early today on this program, Rush Limbaugh had a stark warning to what's coming if the Democrats do win the house three weeks from tonight."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RUSH LIMBAUGH, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST",
      "utterance": "It's easily predictable. It's a no- brainer. But I'm here to tell you that the objective is going to be to force Trump out of Washington, D.C. as soon as they can. They don't want to wait for reelection campaign in 2020. They don't want that. They're going to do everything they can to make sure that the Trump administration essentially ceases to exist in January of 2019, if they win the house."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Just a reminder, I will be interviewing Rush Limbaugh for the full hour right here in this program, Thursday night, and we hope you'll join us at 9 Eastern, Thursday. And we do have another big announcement, this weekend I'll be in Texas and around the Beaumont and Houston areas and it will be doing interviews and a town hall with Senator Ted Cruz, and much, much more. We're going to air some of that video on Monday night. An important race in Texas, Ted Cruz, that's happening this Saturday with more details to come. We will always be fair and balanced. We're not the destroy Trump media. And let not your heart be troubled. The news continues, why?  Because there she is in the swamp, in the sewer.
