Take L.A.'s top prosecutor, George Gascon. He's getting called out for his silence amid rampant theft in the city. The zero veil policy he loves just freed 14 looting suspects.

If you were mayor right now of a big city, they have to look at three or four things on the table. One, how do you -- if you did have a bail reform package that passed over the last year, how do you reform that bail reform package because we're letting out violent offenders. It's not working like we want it. We wanted to try to protect nonviolent offenders. What we're doing is enabling violent offenders to get out. Two, we have a mental health crisis in the country which we have talked about this around this table. And mayors and others, if I were the head of the mayor's association I'd be appealing to this administration and to my congressman and senator and governor to help us -- help us figure out how we have some sort of comprehensive way to deal with this mental health crisis on our streets as well. And then finally, even with the 18-month challenge we have, maybe we ask some retired officers to come back. I know Katie you talked about many are moving outside of some of these big cities. What can we do to incent some of these trained officers to come back until we're able to get those who wish to go into this profession, a noble and honorable profession to do that? And finally, mayors have got to try to help rebuild this trust between communities and police officers. When I was growing up I wanted to be a police officer. When you were a kid you talked about wanting to be a police officer. I realized I was not strong enough or fast enough to do it, yet, that's what I wanted to do. You now probably don't have as many kids saying that, certainly as many diverse kids and the diversity in this nation, you have to have police officers that come from different backgrounds.

And you have people -- criminals with guns coming into a holiday party and robbing everybody at the holiday party. We have the physical therapy office in Beverly Hills, all these guys come in with guns rob the doctor, take his watch, rob all the people in the physical therapy office. There's no deterrence. I know the cops aren't going to be there. They're not afraid of getting arrested because they'll be released. And they also know that everybody there has been put in a position where they are not allowed to own a firearm without jumping through a number of hoops and they know there will be no response because there can't be or people will be vilified by the very people like Mayor Lori Lightfoot, and as we've seen when people have defended themselves before.

But based on what's happened in the trial so far, I think all of us are very jealous of Matt Finn because he actually gets to watch this in the courtroom. We all wish we could watch it live. And my main question throughout this whole thing before the trial, the argument from Jussie Smollett, was that two guys in MAGA hats were white, beat him up in the middle of a blizzard in Chicago and yelled, this is MAGA country and other slurs at him. Well, if that were the case before the trial started, shouldn't the cops were looking for those people if they were really on the run? And shouldn't his defense team be very concerned that these white supremacist are out on the streets of Chicago and they could commit more crimes. They've never been concerned about that. Now his story is well, the guys were actually the brothers who are testifying against me who are not whites. They're Nigerian. And they're the ones who did this to me in order to get money from me to get contracts. So, maybe he can convince one juror. One, it just takes one, that he's telling the truth.

Liberal bail reform policy is wreaking havoc all across the country and the radical district attorneys and politicians who helped put in place those dangerous reforms don't think there is anything wrong with what is going on. Take L.A.'s top prosecutor, George Gascon. He's getting called out for his silence amid rampant theft in the city. The zero veil policy he loves just freed 14 looting suspects.

Well, he was asking for it. I would give him a spanking and send them to a therapist because he thinks cookies talks to him. This is crazy. We are seeing -- and there's no way to fix this because they've gone so hard on our boys and women in blue. The police department in California, in my hometown, they have either retired or they have moved somewhere else.

I mean, do you not want to have retail stores on Madison Avenue in Chicago? Is that -- or Michigan Avenue, excuse me, Chicago. That was Michigan Avenue. It's a beautiful street and it's been -- that's a hallmark of a place where Chicago is a wonderful place to live and it can be a great place to visit. But if you are worried as an employee about going to work because you're afraid for your life or if you're a customer and you think, maybe it's just better not to go into the store. Maybe I'll just buy it online. They are going to drive more and more people out and then that also hurts the small business people because they have those jobs that they want right next to the fancy ones so that they can get the foot traffic. The only foot traffic is a career criminal. You're not going to sell anything."

      "utterance": "-- for a city official is what Tyrus -- what you just said about the time it's going to take if we decide to fully fund the police which we should as a nation. If you were mayor right now of a big city, they have to look at three or four things on the table. One, how do you -- if you did have a bail reform package that passed over the last year, how do you reform that bail reform package because we're letting out violent offenders. It's not working like we want it. We wanted to try to protect nonviolent offenders. What we're doing is enabling violent offenders to get out. Two, we have a mental health crisis in the country which we have talked about this around this table. And mayors and others, if I were the head of the mayor's association I'd be appealing to this administration and to my congressman and senator and governor to help us -- help us figure out how we have some sort of comprehensive way to deal with this mental health crisis on our streets as well. And then finally, even with the 18-month challenge we have, maybe we ask some retired officers to come back. I know Katie you talked about many are moving outside of some of these big cities. What can we do to incent some of these trained officers to come back until we're able to get those who wish to go into this profession, a noble and honorable profession to do that? And finally, mayors have got to try to help rebuild this trust between communities and police officers. When I was growing up I wanted to be a police officer. When you were a kid you talked about wanting to be a police officer. I realized I was not strong enough or fast enough to do it, yet, that's what I wanted to do. You now probably don't have as many kids saying that, certainly as many diverse kids and the diversity in this nation, you have to have police officers that come from different backgrounds. So, I get her frustration but she was wrong to say that, the mayor."

They don't think that this is a problem because they believe in blowing up the system, tearing it down and replacing it with chaos. And that's exactly what they're doing now. None of this is happening in a vacuum. It's happening in blue cities. Well, what else do a lot of these blue cities have? Very strict gun control. So when you look around at what's happening, when you had this Palisades holiday party for example. It's not just happening at stores. And you have people -- criminals with guns coming into a holiday party and robbing everybody at the holiday party. We have the physical therapy office in Beverly Hills, all these guys come in with guns rob the doctor, take his watch, rob all the people in the physical therapy office. There's no deterrence. I know the cops aren't going to be there. They're not afraid of getting arrested because they'll be released. And they also know that everybody there has been put in a position where they are not allowed to own a firearm without jumping through a number of hoops and they know there will be no response because there can't be or people will be vilified by the very people like Mayor Lori Lightfoot, and as we've seen when people have defended themselves before. And for the mayor of Chicago to say that the stores need to hire more security, okay, well, what do you want them to do then or will the security guards be allowed to be armed. Probably not."

So this whole philosophy of what they think, it's not just one thing. It's not just the bad D.A.'s, the defund the police, it's also defunding people's ability to defend themselves and then blaming them for it and then daring to, you know, and then completely criticizing them and vilifying them and destroying their lives in the media should they decide to take on these criminals that the politicians and the D.A.'s have allowed to run rampant, not just at the stores, but in people's communities."

I don't care if you're a Democrat or Republican. You do that, it's your own peril. You generally lose a race. You meet people where they are and if you want to take them to another place you first got to meet them. You got to explain what your plan is and how and why your vision is better than their opponents. Right now, the opponent Democrats have really is just a non-Biden, non-Democrat vision. If you look at the most recent polling from \"The Journal\" people are disappointed with what we think are the priorities for the country. Our priorities have to match what every day Americans are thinking, whether it be what they're buying at the grocery store, what they're buying at the pump -- the gas station or be what their kids are learning in school. We can still win this thing. Its 11 months away. I think about where we were 11 months ago today, we're obviously in a very, very different place. Now a lot will have to change. I would focus on the border. I would focus on the economy. And I would focus on COVID.

They're hearing directly from constituents who are calling their office every single day about inflation. Kyrsten Sinema, senator from Arizona, a Democrat, has talked about this a lot. She's been one of the people holding up Joe Biden's agenda in the Senate and says inflation's actually a real problem for people in Arizona and the administration is not addressing it properly.

But I thought the president today did what -- did what he had to do and I think he probably did it more effectively than we thought. Look, what Putin can't have is the oligarchs attacked and attacked being economic attacks and the kinds of threats that we're making to put the economic clutch around him is pretty doggone strong. Because if -- Putin is not necessarily afraid of voters in Russia. He is afraid of the oligarchs. But if you have the voters in Russia concerned about the -- how their economic output is and economic productivity and you have the oligarchs concerned about their resources, I think that's the pinch you have to put on him for him to want to change and to get that smirk off his face which he always has when he talks with our presidents."

But it's going to be so brutal and so bloody and so costly for the Russians that it's going to really almost destroy that country. So, Dana talked about it. We've been playing a game with Ukraine. We dangle NATO membership over Ukraine to like screw with Putin's head and it destabilizes him. He's kind of off balance because they need Ukraine out of NATO, but we play this dance because we don't really want Ukraine in NATO. It's an indefensible country. It's just flat. They'll just roll right through it. So, we don't want it but we pretend like we want it. And it just makes Putin go crazy and he does all this crazy stuff. So, I just think you just sell Javelins to the Ukrainians. Just give them as many Javelins as possible. They just take these tanks out like that. They're great. And then you tell Putin we're not going to buy any oil, stuff it. And then bolster security in the Baltics, but just keep your eye on the Pacific. Don't let this distract you from the Chinese."

That comes after another shocking reveal from Smollett testifying that CNN's Don Lemon texting him during the start of the investigation that cops did not believe his account. Katie is it bad that -- well first, there's a lot elements here. What's your take on the trial and the -- and the Don Lemon piece? I don't quite understand it if that is relevant in any way.

But based on what's happened in the trial so far, I think all of us are very jealous of Matt Finn because he actually gets to watch this in the courtroom. We all wish we could watch it live. And my main question throughout this whole thing before the trial, the argument from Jussie Smollett, was that two guys in MAGA hats were white, beat him up in the middle of a blizzard in Chicago and yelled, this is MAGA country and other slurs at him. Well, if that were the case before the trial started, shouldn't the cops were looking for those people if they were really on the run? And shouldn't his defense team be very concerned that these white supremacist are out on the streets of Chicago and they could commit more crimes. They've never been concerned about that. Now his story is well, the guys were actually the brothers who are testifying against me who are not whites. They're Nigerian. And they're the ones who did this to me in order to get money from me to get contracts. So, maybe he can convince one juror. One, it just takes one, that he's telling the truth.

The Veterans received the hero's welcome in Hawaii, where they were honored with a special event featuring a red carpet walk, chef-cooked meals and entertainment. They also made several appearances at commemoration sites in military installations. The Best Defense Foundation is a nonprofit dedicated to helping military veterans and their families. American Airlines and the Gary Sinise Foundation also worked with foundation to make a special trip happen.
