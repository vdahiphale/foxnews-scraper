Robert Mueller has submitted his report on the Russia investigation to Attorney General William Barr. Fox News is reporting that Barr will deliver a letter to Congress as early as tomorrow and that letter will summarize Mueller's key findings. Here is what else we know. Mueller is not going to indict anybody else and Mueller was not obstructed in anyway during his investigation. So at the end of nearly two years of investigating, no one has been charged with anything relating to Russian collusion, and they won't be.  ABC News is reporting that President Trump is in quote, \"great mood\" and told friends at Mar-a-Lago that he was quote, \"glad it's over.\" He even hit the links with Kid Rock at Trump International earlier today.

This is probably the best panel assembled outside of a \"Hannity\" show. So I'm just happy to be part of it. And I will begin with you, Dan because I know you have been chopping at the bit all day. I can just see it in your eyes.  Here is how I feel because I am a feelings guy, I want to tell to you guys about how I feel about this. On the one hand I feel like this delivers a knockout blow to the press and the Democrats who've been saying collusion, collusion, collusion for the last two years and when you couple that with a hot economy and the decimation of the ISIS caliphate, this is a two-term presidency, so the Democrats are going to have to start working with this President and not working against them. But on the other hand, I'm pretty angry because the people that set this up, what's going to happen to them? What is going to happen to the people that set this whole thing in motion? Are they going to be accountable or not, Dan?",

I think what's getting lost in this scrum here after the Mueller report and the report that there's going to be no additional indictments -- you know, a lot of people who knew there was no collusion are obviously celebrating because the truth came out.   But Jesse, think about the damage here. The real case - the FBI's case was entirely based in this dossier. The dossier is the collusion scandal. That's everything, so if Mueller could not indict and vindicate even one small component of that dossier, all of the players who spied on Donald Trump, used human intelligence assets, weaponized the Intelligence Agency have now nothing to fall back on. And one more quick point on this. Here's the key question here, Jesse, when exactly did Mueller find out there was no collusion? Because this whole initial memo and his reason for existence was to investigate collusion and that begs the question, what is that second scope memo that he got? What does that say? Because I think Mueller knew early on this thing was a big stinking pile of dog -- you get it -- was a hoax.",

They buy this warrant to spy unconstitutionally on several campaign officials. They throw spies to infiltrate the campaign and then at the end of the day, once he takes over and during the transition, everybody starts leaking and unmasking everybody.  There's a lot of potential felonies that happened and abuse of power from the Obama administration. Are they going to get away with it? Because it looks like, potentially they might.",

We had two dozen Members of Congress who called on a Special Counsel to investigate the collusion that went on with the Clinton campaign where you had hundreds of thousands of dollars paid to the Clinton Foundation to influence policy.   Also as I think Dan correctly pointed out, the real collusion here were Democrats hiring a foreign spy who was a known liar to the FBI to work with Russians to tell lies about the President to destabilize what has now become one of the most successful presidencies in the entire modern era. And so here, it's 675 days the Mueller investigation took longer than the U.S. -- the United States' involvement in World War One and the Whiskey Rebellion combined, out of those we freed Europe and got cheaper whiskey; out of the Mueller investigation, we didn't get a single indictment on collusion with Russia that was the underlying issue.  I don't think that that the President's supporters should uncork the champagne quite yet. I think there will be negative things about the President in the report, but I mean this was a biased group of people that only looked at President Trump and didn't look at the true collusion that Dan pointed out and I know Dr. Gorka and I have talked about on Salem Radio.",

They're focused on both the election whether there was election fraud, the family, the foundation while we have on the other end probably one of the biggest, most egregious breaches with our intelligence community just as Dan said and Congressman Gaetz said with the FISA, of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant, malfeasance within the FBI and also within the DOJ and we have to realize, right now there is also an Inspector General who is working on this. Inspector General Michael Horowitz, whose report hasn't come out yet and will come out probably within the next month and that should tell us a lot more about what happened during the Hillary Clinton investigation, but more importantly what happened during the Russia investigation, Jesse. And I think that what we're going to see is William Barr, we're going to see a lot of these criminal referrals move forward. We're going to see indictments, but not of President Trump, not of President Trump's family, but of people within the FBI and people within the DOJ and people within the intelligence community that abused the law and abused the Constitution of the United States.  So the Democrats can keep pushing and pushing and pushing and they will, but they're only going to exhaust the American public's patience. People are exhausted of this.

The Special Counsel was just trying to cover up the abuse of power and the sting operation from the get-go.

This is the biggest political scandal in American history and all I can tell you is when the President told me 2017 in the Oval Office, \"Sebastian, they'll never find anything because there is nothing.\" We've spent two years on a witch hunt and the President was vindicated.

Mueller is not going to indict anybody else and Mueller was not obstructed in anyway during his investigation. So at the end of nearly two years of investigating, no one has been charged with anything relating to Russian collusion, and they won't be. ABC News is reporting that President Trump is in quote, \"great mood\" and told friends at Mar-a-Lago that he was quote, \"glad it's over.\" He even hit the links with Kid Rock at Trump International earlier today.

This is probably the best panel assembled outside of a \"Hannity\" show. So I'm just happy to be part of it. And I will begin with you, Dan because I know you have been chopping at the bit all day. I can just see it in your eyes. Here is how I feel because I am a feelings guy, I want to tell to you guys about how I feel about this. On the one hand I feel like this delivers a knockout blow to the press and the Democrats who've been saying collusion, collusion, collusion for the last two years and when you couple that with a hot economy and the decimation of the ISIS caliphate, this is a two-term presidency, so the Democrats are going to have to start working with this President and not working against them.

I think what's getting lost in this scrum here after the Mueller report and the report that there's going to be no additional indictments -- you know, a lot of people who knew there was no collusion are obviously celebrating because the truth came out. But Jesse, think about the damage here. The real case - the FBI's case was entirely based in this dossier. The dossier is the collusion scandal. That's everything, so if Mueller could not indict and vindicate even one small component of that dossier, all of the players who spied on Donald Trump, used human intelligence assets, weaponized the Intelligence Agency have now nothing to fall back on. And one more quick point on this. Here's the key question here, Jesse, when exactly did Mueller find out there was no collusion? Because this whole initial memo and his reason for existence was to investigate collusion and that begs the question, what is that second scope memo that he got? What does that say? Because I think Mueller knew early on this thing was a big stinking pile of dog -- you get it -- was a hoax."

They buy this warrant to spy unconstitutionally on several campaign officials. They throw spies to infiltrate the campaign and then at the end of the day, once he takes over and during the transition, everybody starts leaking and unmasking everybody. There's a lot of potential felonies that happened and abuse of power from the Obama administration. Are they going to get away with it? Because it looks like, potentially they might."

      "utterance": "They were getting away with it under Jeff Sessions in Rod Rosenstein. The hope is with Bill Barr as the Attorney General, there's a new sheriff in town. We had two dozen Members of Congress who called on a Special Counsel to investigate the collusion that went on with the Clinton campaign where you had hundreds of thousands of dollars paid to the Clinton Foundation to influence policy. Also as I think Dan correctly pointed out, the real collusion here were Democrats hiring a foreign spy who was a known liar to the FBI to work with Russians to tell lies about the President to destabilize what has now become one of the most successful presidencies in the entire modern era. And so here, it's 675 days the Mueller investigation took longer than the U.S. -- the United States' involvement in World War One and the Whiskey Rebellion combined, out of those we freed Europe and got cheaper whiskey; out of the Mueller investigation, we didn't get a single indictment on collusion with Russia that was the underlying issue. I don't think that that the President's supporters should uncork the champagne quite yet. I think there will be negative things about the President in the report, but I mean this was a biased group of people that only looked at President Trump and didn't look at the true collusion that Dan pointed out and I know Dr. Gorka and I have talked about on Salem Radio."

They are definitely exploiting everything they can with the Southern District of New York and those cases that are there now in the Southern District of New York, but let's talk about this. They're focused on both the election whether there was election fraud, the family, the foundation while we have on the other end probably one of the biggest, most egregious breaches with our intelligence community just as Dan said and Congressman Gaetz said with the FISA, of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant, malfeasance within the FBI and also within the DOJ and we have to realize, right now there is also an Inspector General who is working on this. Inspector General Michael Horowitz, whose report hasn't come out yet and will come out probably within the next month and that should tell us a lot more about what happened during the Hillary Clinton investigation, but more importantly what happened during the Russia investigation, Jesse. And I think that what we're going to see is William Barr, we're going to see a lot of these criminal referrals move forward. We're going to see indictments, but not of President Trump, not of President Trump's family, but of people within the FBI and people within the DOJ and people within the intelligence community that abused the law and abused the Constitution of the United States. So the Democrats can keep pushing and pushing and pushing and they will, but they're only going to exhaust the American public's patience. People are exhausted of this. They don't want to see another two years of this and I tell you, it's going to backfire on the Democrats big time."

Dr. Sebastian Gorka, my theory on this whole thing is that they tried to set Trump up during the election. Trump caught them, fired Comey. They triggered the Special Counsel. The Special Counsel was just trying to cover up the abuse of power and the sting operation from the get-go. So to me the Mueller report looks more like a whitewash of all the Federal abuses that were going on and less of a search for the truth because like Dan pointed out at the top, we knew early on there was no collusion."

We had two years, $25 million dollars of our taxpayer money, your taxpayer money wasted to prove what? That Paul Manafort lied on his mortgage application? This is a travesty. The fact is the only reason we had the Mueller probe was because Hillary Clinton lost and they had to have a cover-up for everything they did to spy on another Presidential campaign. This is the biggest political scandal in American history and all I can tell you is when the President told me 2017 in the Oval Office, \"Sebastian, they'll never find anything because there is nothing.\" We've spent two years on a witch hunt and the President was vindicated. People have to pay a penalty for what they did with our money and how they used the law enforcement powers of this country as a political weapon, Jesse."

First, it was treason, then he was a traitor, then it was collusion, then it was obstruction. They've come up empty-handed on every single one of these. Obstruction is dead in the water. McCabe has already testified in the Hill under oath.

So we're going to have to see how that goes, but I actually have a different theory about all of the chaos that's going on, on the left and these contenders who are competing for the most outrageous claim of the week, still can't quite get over the circumcision prohibition or watching a dirty movie with your mother who sat all the way through it, but I will say perhaps, this is all just a tactic sort, a sort of a strategy to distract from the real issues because as long as we're talking about this, they're not talking about the policies that they want to promote."

If it turns into a referendum on Trump's personality, then he's got a problem, which is why the best thing that he could do is simply stand there and point -- just point at the Democrats and then with his other hand, point at his economic and foreign policy record and I think he would do really well.

To understand that that's not the history of America, you really do have to understand the ideas of the founding fathers and going back even further, you have to understand the ideas that the founding fathers were basing their thought on because those ideas not only made the west what it is, but raised 80% of people from abject poverty across the globe, freed hundreds of millions, if not billions of people from tyranny around the globe, it has created the most prosperous, free and equal society in the history of mankind. It is amazing. There's this profile of AOC in \"Time\" magazine and the journalist, Charlotte Alter suggested that millennials have not experienced prosperity.

      "utterance": "Joining me now radio show host, Larry Elder. All right, Larry, I think I know why it's so personal with the media and why they hate him so much, it is because he's tearing apart the Messiah's legacy. Barack Obama was loved by these people. It's in tatters. He's putting all these people on the Supreme Court. He proved all the pollsters and the prognosticators wrong on Election Day. He's Teflon when it comes to political correctness. They can't take him out like that and he just goes over their head with Twitter and makes them feel useless. So that's why they're so angry at him and that's why they despise him so very much."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LARRY ELDER, RADIO SHOW HOST",
      "utterance": "I would also add, Jesse, they're also angry because they know they helped to create him. Remember all the free publicity they gave him. They thought it was a joke at first. And every time they put him on the poll, their ratings went up and they just thought for sure he was not going to go all the way, so no harm no problem. Surprise, surprise. And then of course, he viciously went after the media for their bias. It was about time a President has done that and he's done it effectively and as you pointed out, he's got 60 million followers on Twitter, so he can go around CNN, go around MSNBC and get his message to the people and they hate that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Right, no one has punched back at the media ever, Republican or Democrat, so they don't know how to handle it. You talked about before, you know how vicious and nasty they are. Think about the things that they've said about the First Lady? What about the things they've said about Ivanka? The C-word. I mean they put out this dirty dossier which now caused two years of total chaos and they tried to Bourke his Supreme Court justice. To say that they're just holding him accountable is not true. I mean these people are actively cheerleading his impeachment and I think Ted Koppel hit the nail right on the head."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ELDER",
      "utterance": "Well that's right. They are actively cheering for this man's impeachment. I've never seen the like of it. Now, the media has never liked Republicans. They attacked Ronald Reagan, Walter Cronkite went after Ronald Reagan after he retired. He went after George W. Bush and accused Bush of arrogance for the Iraq War. So they've always disliked Republicans, but this is a whole another level of disdain and again, it's because they created Trump. They regret it. They feel guilty about it and now they feel responsible to take him down."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "That's true. All right, just to show everybody how villains and heroes are framed in today's media. You remember the New Zealand shooting the other day. Some prankster gets up, some New Zealand senator said some really nasty thing about Muslims, he then cracks an egg on him. Watch this."

      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "So egg boy is famous. The media loves this guy showering him with love and affection. He has raised like 50 grand from his GoFundMe thing and I remember the Covington kid close to the same age did nothing. He just stood there in the face of someone very aggressive and he was vilified as some sort of racist."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ELDER",
      "utterance": "Yes, and remember when that Iraqi reporter through two shoes at George W. Bush and he ducked and the media laughed at all of that. This is how they roll. The reason they cheer the egg boy is because of the statements that were made by the politician that were anti-immigrant and so they made a hero out of him. They assumed that the kid from the school, Covington was a racist and so they were mocking him. So it depends on whether or not they agree with the left side's point of view."

You know she perpetuated this story about her heritage and it turned out to be a lie, but you have to understand now, Elizabeth Warren is also pushing for reparations. We want to know why. So maybe it's something in her family history that is horrible that she don't want the public to know about, but she wants to atone and sort of amend all of that and make all of that go away with the reparations push. But Elizabeth Warren did all of this to herself."

She's a white woman. Anyway, all right, we've had enough of Liz Warren. It's almost every week she does something silly. Beto, he went down to New Mexico to eat some regenerative dirt to kind of cleanse his palate and find himself after he lost the Senate race in Texas to Senator Ted Cruz. Ladies, who eats dirt on purpose?"

      "utterance": "Time now for \"Last Call.\" We came across a video on Twitter, one of the wildest things I've ever seen. Check out this footage from a little while ago, all right. A man who appears to be just a little bit intoxicated busting through a security barrier at an airshow, running away from security, then climbing into an airplane and taking it for a ride. He gets the plane off the ground. He wobbles from side to side. You'd think he's going down at one point. He actually takes it straight up vertical in the air, but he barely hangs on, all right. But not all is it seems. The pilot isn't drunk at all. He's a flying ace who does this all for fun. \"Gotcha.\" That's all for us tonight.
