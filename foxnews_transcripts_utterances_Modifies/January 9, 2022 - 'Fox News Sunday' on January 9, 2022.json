First of all, the vast majority of children who are in the hospital are unvaccinated, and for those children who are not eligible for vaccination, we do know that they are most likely to get sick with COVID if their family members aren't vaccinated. So the most important thing we can do for those children to keep them out of the hospital is to vaccinate them and to vaccinate their family members around them. We also know that --"

So, really, the highest risk of being on a ventilator if your child is if you're unvaccinated. We also have recent data out just this week that's demonstrated that dangerous MIS-C syndrome that we are seeing in children, 91 percent protection if you've been vaccinated."

I'll tell you that, right now, 17 -- if you're unvaccinated, you're 17 times more likely to be in the hospital and 20 times more likely to die than if you're boosted. And so, what my responsibility is, is to provide guidance and recommendations to protect the American people. Those recommendations strongly recommend vaccination for our children above the age of 5 and boosting for everyone above the age of 18 if they're eligible."

      "speaker": "WALENSKY",

What we are seeing with the omicron variant is that it tends to be milder person by person, but given how large the numbers are that we're seeing more and more cases come into the hospital. In some hospitals that we've talked to, up to 40 percent of the patients who are coming in with COVID-19 are coming in not because they're sick with COVID, but because they're coming in with something else and have had to -- COVID or the omicron variant detected."

      "speaker": "WALENSKY",
      "utterance": "Yes, of course. With omicron, we are following that very carefully. Our death registry, of course, takes a few weeks to -- it takes a few weeks to collect and, of course, omicron has just been with us for a few weeks. But those data will be forthcoming."

Healthy service members, some of them have circulating antibodies in their blood from past infections, but they're not the antibodies the government recognizes. Is that fair?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALENSKY",
      "utterance": "You know, I think the thing that's most disruptive to any business or industry is to have half the workforce out because they're sick with COVID. We have seen with the omicron variant that prior protection protects you less well than it had with the current -- with -- then when it had with prior variants. So having previous infection seems to not protect you as well as -- against omicron. Right now, I think the most important thing to do is to protect Americans. We do that by getting them vaccinated and getting them boosted."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Yeah, and I know that's the message, but the omicron variant is infecting the vaccinated. And the vaccinated are transmitting the virus, correct?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALENSKY",
      "utterance": "That is true. It's infecting them at a lower rate and importantly, those people who are vaccinated and infected with omicron are not the ones who are ending up very sick in the hospital. Those are the people who are unvaccinated."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Right, but will the CDC take natural immunity seriously, to study its effect on the big picture? For example, why not include recovery from infection as the equivalent of at least one shot the way other countries do?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALENSKY",
      "utterance": "You know, we have taken this very seriously. Several months ago, we provided a scientific brief with dozens of studies providing the updated science with this. Of course, that science is ever evolving, as has this -- as has this variant. And so, we need to update that science with regard to what we learn about omicron, which so far has demonstrated that prior infection protects you less well."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "As recently as this past week, President Biden called this a pandemic of the unvaccinated. According to your CDC data, the omicron variant accounts for 95.4 percent of cases, delta is 4.6 percent of cases. Again, the vaccinated are getting this infection. They're transmitting it to others. Considering all of that and these percentages, how is it that pandemic of the unvaccinated is a terminology that should be used?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALENSKY",
      "utterance": "You know, we do know that people who are vaccinated are still protected about 70 percent against infection, especially if they are boosted. So the people who are ending up in a hospital, the people who are ending up very sick with omicron are the ones who are unvaccinated."

    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Dr. Walensky, you mentioned the confusion about the guidance and over the past year, the most recent example obviously is on isolation and testing, but other guidance is the mask wearing, educators being vaccinated before returning to the classroom. Before you took this job officially, you emphasize that one of your primary goals was to restore public trust. But in this time, do you think that it's fair to say that the trust and confidence the public has gone down with the CDC?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALENSKY",
      "utterance": "Thank you, Bret. You know, this is hard. We have ever evolving science with an ever-evolving variant and my job is to provide updated guidance in the context of rapidly rising cases. And that is what we've done and I'm here to explain it to the American people and I'm committed to continuing to do so and to continuing to improve."

    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "And we appreciate you coming on, we really do. I'm just getting facts out there. I do want to read this quote from this piece looking at how universities are handling this. At Georgetown University, fully vaccinated students are randomly tested for COVID every week using a PCR test, which can detect tiny amounts of dead virus. Asymptomatic students who test positive are ordered to a room in a designated building where they spend ten days in confinement. Food is dropped off once a day at the door. Georgetown is still using a 10-day quarantine. What you say to the major companies and universities who are ignoring your new guidance and sticking to the ten days isolation or quarantine for asymptomatic people?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALENSKY",
      "utterance": "Yeah, this is really important and what I would say is that guidance that we put out is for the general public. We -- I'm committed to wanting to keep schools open and you want to keep universities open. Many of these universities have kids living in multi-person rooms, so they're going to have to adapt our guidance for the safety of their congregate settings."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Right, but sticking them in a room for ten days, doesn't that sound extreme to you?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALENSKY",
      "utterance": "You know, that is what our guidance was before. If a student were to -- and our updated guidance actually says you can leave isolation after five days if you can wear your mask all of the time, including being able to eat meals alone so that you are not infecting others while you eat. That may need to be what's happening in these congregate settings."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",

      "speaker": "WALENSKY",

    {
      "speaker": "WALENSKY",
      "utterance": "Yeah, really important question. We now have numerous treatments that we can use against omicron, including our monoclonal antibodies, both for treatment and prevention. Two new antivirals, one from Pfizer, one from Merck. So, many opportunities now. Remdesivir, to be able to be used in an outpatient basis with three daily infusions. All of those are now being distributed. Many of those are harder to make and take some time to make, but the administration is rapidly scaling up what they are able to purchase and get out to the American people."

Burbio, which tracks school closures, has found more than 5,000 schools are currently closed for in-person instruction due to COVID. There's been a lot of money given to school districts and states across the country after the COVID relief bill. What do you tell them, these school districts?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALENSKY",
      "utterance": "Yeah. You know, really importantly, I want to remind people that in the fall of this year, we had a delta surge, and we were able to safely keep our children in school before we had pediatric vaccination. Fast forward to now, we have pediatric vaccination. Of course, every jurisdiction is going to have to make these decisions locally, but what I will say is the most important thing we can do is get our children vaccinated, get our teachers vaccinated and get our teenagers vaccinated. And then to practice all of those layered mitigation strategies that have been proven to work -- masking, ventilation, Test to Stay strategies have saved hundreds of thousands of person days for kids staying in school. All of those things have been proven to work."

To that point, Miami-Dade has seen more than 237 percent increase in hospitalizations, according to this press briefing, in the last 14 days, and a 111 percent increase in new cases. So simple question, is Florida experiencing the surge in Coronavirus cases and hospitalizations or -- or not?"
    },

      "speaker": "SUAREZ",
      "utterance": "Well, of course we are. I mean, I think every city across America right now is seeing a surge with the Omicron variant. And the variant seems to be significantly more contagious but also not quite as severe as the Delta variant. So what we are just seeing is a gross number which is significantly higher than with Delta. And so that's pushing all the other numbers. That pushes hospitalizations. That pushes all the other metrics. So what we're doing in the city of Miami is, number one, we're obviously allowing people to get tested and expanding our testing capacities and our vaccination capacities. And we are seeing a correlation between those that are hospitalized and them being not vaccinated."

The majority of the 5,400 COVID patients in Florida are in the hospital for non-COVID reasons.\" And I guess, Mayor, what do you say to people who accuse Republican elected officials of downplaying the rise and spread of COVID and the hospitalizations?"

It is a fact that there are many cases of people that are coming to the hospital with COVID as opposed to because they have COVID. And I think that is something that you highlighted with the CDC director in your prior segment. There is a differentiation, you know, the fact that there are so many more cases which is what's driving hospitalizations, and the fact that it's also not quite as high as it was at the peak. So, you know, there -- I think we just have to talk about this on a factual basis and try to depoliticize it as much as possible."

So, you know, I think Florida is doing very well. You know, obviously the surge is something that is hitting the entire country. But I think the state of Florida, I think the city of Miami is doing significantly better than other parts of the country. We have a very high vaccination rate. I think we are at about 80 percent in the city of Miami. And so we are -- we are dealing with this the very best that we can. And, listen, you know, many people who are not vaccinated and who are young and healthy are getting it and are now very -- there's a high level of asymptomatic impact and effect, and so they're not getting severe symptoms."

      "utterance": "Yes. You know, particularly a few months ago or maybe even closer to a year ago, we -- you know, we had a disagreement over masks because I felt that, you know, as a tool, masks are something that we could implement and it could reduce a number of cases without affecting people's ability to go to work, right? I think the biggest issue was making sure that this did not harm the environment, particularly, you know, at a time where our unemployment rate was skyrocketing. Now in the city of Miami, our unemployment rate is at 3.7 percent, which is almost a percent lower than the entire state of -- the rest of the state of Florida. So what we've implemented is pro-business policies that could keep people safe and I think using a mask was one of those."

I mean, these are the building blocks of the future for our children in America. And so for me, you know, it's a tremendous concern when you see schools being closed. I think both Republicans and Democrats, if you hear the CDC director, and even pronouncements from the president, have made every effort to keep school open and want schools open.

I think you will see in Miami, we just hired, this particular fiscal year, 30 new police officers./ We increased funding for police while many other cities have talked about or actually decreased funding for police. And we saw dramatic reduction in homicides by 25 percent, and 14 percent in what they call \"contact shootings.\" So certainly investing in your public safety should be the number one goal. Police officers in America, I think, now have the hardest job in America. They -- you know, they have -- you know, they have to do the most number of things for the least pay with the most scrutiny of any profession in this country. And I think we should not only invest in them in terms of the sheer number of them and their pay, but I think we should also invest in technology and giving them the tools as a force multiplier to -- you know, to do their job better. And that's something we've done in Miami. We have a gun fire detection system. We have a NIBIN (ph) machine that is a ballistics machine. We have a Cellebrite (ph) machine. So we have a variety of different technologies that allow us to solve crime, that allow our officers to be more effective at doing their job. And we've seen the results. And I think it's something that can be replicated across America. Everybody deserves to be safe."

I do believe that America's cities, which have 85 percent of the population of America and constitute 91 percent of the GDP of this country need to be heading in the right direction. It's a generational opportunity for our country. And if we get it right, we are going to have generational prosperity. So once, you know, being president of the U.S. Conference of Mayors is over, which is a year- and-a-half from now, I will look at the landscape and decide if I want to serve at a higher level.

Most people who are now serving at the federal level have at one time served in some capacity at the state and local levels as well. So they too have an understanding. I would also refer him to Federalist Papers, I think it's 59, where Alexander Hamilton talked very cogently about this and he says there that these federal elections cannot be left up to the states, should not be left up to the states. That's why states were not allowed to put term limits on federal officials. So the elections or not solely conducted by the states. That's why the 1965 Voting Rights Act was necessary and that is why the 50th Amendment to the United States Constitution was a moment, that's why the 18th Amendment of the United States Constitution was necessary.

Meantime, Russia is poised to invade neighboring Ukraine. Tens of thousands of Russian troops are amassed along the border there. Russia wants to keep Ukraine out of NATO, wants to expand its influences in the region. The U.S. has threatened serious consequences if Russia invades. It's time now for our Sunday group. Fox News contributor Karl Rove, Fox News correspondent Gillian Turner, and Fox News political analyst Juan Williams. Gillian, just this morning Secretary of State Blinken said the prospects are not that great for seeing some major movement here in Geneva as the U.S. and Russia sit down on these talks.

So, the key question for the Biden administration going into this week in the high-stakes talks is, is it smart to continue to broadcast this as our number one policy objective when it's essentially unachievable? Every Russia expert you talk to will tell you, normalized relations are not in the cards in the near future. And, by the way, every U.S. expert -- excuse me, U.S. official you talk to, at least behind closed doors, will say the same thing, this becomes an issue of saying something 17 million times doesn't make it any more true."

And to surrender countries like Ukraine and Poland and the Baltics and eastern and central Europe to Russian domination would be a grave mistake. It would simply embolden Putin and act against the interest of the United States and diminish our standing in the world and the standing of our allies. So, we have vital interests in Europe and the idea that we would -- those interests would be well served by turning Europe back into -- eastern and central Europe back into part of the Russian empire is ridiculous."

So I think the primary accomplishment of the Biden administration so far on this issue is molding the U.S. and European allies into a united front against this chest-pounding effort to, you know, reimagine the former Soviet Union by Vladimir Putin. Right now you have the potential for sanctions that would punish Russia substantially in terms of removing them from the international financial system in terms of potentially recreating or expanding NATO to the non- Europeans -- the west -- eastern European countries that are not aligned at the moment. And then, of course, you had the critical issue of Nordstrom, the national gas pipeline that would go from Russia to Germany. I think Germany has been reluctant to shut that down but now you have President Biden working with Olaf Scholz, the new German chancellor, saying, you know what, we have to look at this seriously and look at if there are alternative sources for natural gas to get to Germany. That's a major, major shift in thinking among the Germans and a critical sanction, critical punishment potentially for the Russians."

    {
      "speaker": "TURNER",
      "utterance": "Well, the reasons you just laid out, the fact that Kazakhstan is a relatively oil rich nation are some of the reasons why Putin is interested in the first place. But what happened this week, Bret, inside the country is remarkable because the president there essentially flip sides, seemingly overnight. He had been a sort of stand-up, low-key bureaucrat who people saw plodding along into the future. He had allied himself with the former regime there, not Putin. Now, he's teamed up with Putin against the protesters, the rioters inside his own country. It shows essentially that Putin's wish to kind of remake the world or that region of the world in the image of the Cold War is still alive and well. A lot of leaders of these former satellite states will team up with Putin if they deem that it's sort of politically expedient for them to do so. The threat of Putin remaking that part of the world is alive and well."

But the critical point I made -- she made, I should say, is that she said, you know, thank you, Bret, for asking this question about whether the American people have more or less confidence two years -- in the CDC, two years into this pandemic? And she said thanks for that question because she said, look, it's an evolving issue. The science is evolving, the crisis is evolving and I'm trying my best. And on that level, you know, I guess that's the best she could do. But, you know, people do have questions about the extent to which we should quarantine, whether or not a negative test is required. There's no question about the efficacy of the vaccine itself, about masking, social distancing.

But you continued to mention Democrats, saying they should be, quote, resisting their leadership's petty habit of aggravating partisan fault lines by indiscriminately condemning all who came to Washington that day.

Look, Republicans have to acknowledge that what happened on January 6th was atrocious and that the people who invaded the Capitol, assaulted 140 police officers, made threats against the lives of the leadership of our Congress and attempted to disrupt a constitutionally mandated statutorily required joint session of Congress to receive the Electoral College votes, that every one of those people ought to be identified, prosecuted and found guilty, punished.

Jim Clyburn, whom you had on earlier, let's just remember, in 2005, he was one of the 31 members of the House of Representatives who made outrageous claims about the 2004 election, including the electronic flipping of votes in Ohio and voted not to certify the election of George W.
