This never would have happened if they actually had been kept up with our coverage at Fox of all of this -- of all this harrowing footage, nonstop footage.

Searchers are using drones, dogs, ATVs as well as their feet penetrating the area where the terrain is rough, swampy, much under water. There is also a dive team here and cadaver dogs. And side sonar is being used to look for objects or terrain underneath the dark water. Laundrie's parents say their son went here for a hike last Tuesday. According to his parents their sone went for the hike on Tuesday of last week. The following day, Wednesday, they say they came here and retrieved a Mustang that he had parked at the nature reserve, but went home without him. Then on Friday, claiming they had not seen their son in three whole days, that is when they finally called police to report him missing. Greg?",

We know they're lying to us. And the only way to resolve this is not to do a massive P.R. It's to basically get the border tight just the way Donald Trump did it, to make sure that they stay in their own countries. I don't want to know the reason they're coming here. Let a court decide. If the reason they want to come here is for asylum, are they entitled? They can't just come here and say I want to live here. He let -- open the welcome mat for me.

They're -- the press and Jen Psaki is going after the border patrol for doing their job because Biden and the enabling media wouldn't do their job. This never would have happened if they actually had been kept up with our coverage at Fox of all of this -- of all this harrowing footage, nonstop footage. They had to wait for that one image, one singular image as Chris Cuomo points out so that they can manufacture a story out of one image. It's a consequence, though, of their own corruption.

According to his parents their sone went for the hike on Tuesday of last week. The following day, Wednesday, they say they came here and retrieved a Mustang that he had parked at the nature reserve, but went home without him.

Swing state voters are reportedly getting buyer's remorse with the President's approvals sinking fast in several battleground states like Michigan, Virginia, and Iowa. And making matters worse for Biden, the Democratic Party is currently feuding over aspects of his trillion-dollar spending agenda. OK, on the one hand, you know, Joe Biden -- I'll start with you, Dana. Joe Biden started out saying he's going to unify everybody. And now, it appears he can't even unify his own party because he's -- on the one hand, he's got these leftist, progressive Democrats, and then he's got the more moderate Democrats, and now he's got the $3.5 trillion spending bill that is, you know, apparently causing a lot of people to say we didn't send -- we didn't vote for him to do this."

And then he became president, and all of a sudden, he's being led around by the nose by the progressives, and the Bernie Sanders crowd. And the moderates who actually have very tough races, who will need something to bring home, they want this infrastructure bill, and then they'll talk about the $3.5 trillion. The $3.5 trillion, that's got the progressives all worried. So, now, they're at a stalemate. That's why they -- instead of meeting with Republicans today to try to get them to support the bills, he's having to meet with his own people. And we'll see. He might have some success there. They might figure out a way to save some face and bring some things together. But one of the problems is, he is mishandling all these other issues we've talked about, the border, Afghanistan, and inflation also being another issue, that -- and crime let me add that one. It's making his political capital account decrease."

Defrost him, like a Swanson's dinner, bake back better. That would be his new thing. Because right now, everything you're saying is correct. Nobody's buying Moderate Joe anymore.
