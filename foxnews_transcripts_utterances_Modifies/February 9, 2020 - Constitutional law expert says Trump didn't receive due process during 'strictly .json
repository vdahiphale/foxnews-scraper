So it's both guilt and innocence that must be assessed and a legal standard, an objective legal standard that you could have been on notice of in advance that also must have been violated.

As you know, Mark, as a lawyer, cross examination is one of the hallmarks of freedom. The ability to call your own witness, that's the right of confronting your accusers and also the right to call your own witnesses. Those were not done.  The President was not accorded any opportunity to participate until the very last minute when it had gone from the Intelligence Committee where all the work was being done to the Judiciary Committee where no work was done. And then he was invited to sit in at that point -- his lawyers.

Nobody is above the law. In the case of impeachment, though, it's not justiciable. It's not something that the courts would get involved with other than to evaluate the merits of subpoenas let's say.  But with respect to what's an impeachable offense, that is not who checks the House. The institution that checks the House is the Senate. That's where you get review. Its Senate review instead of judicial review of whether what has happened in the House meets the standard of due process. And that is exactly what I think persuaded a majority of the senators to vote the way they did, regardless of whether or not the President had misbehaved.   Clearly, the House had misbehaved and to create an incentive or a future precedent in which the House, anybody, no matter which party controls, can continue to act politically and abuse their impeachment power is something the Senate was charged with stopping, and I think that's what they did.",

The remedy for all of that Presidential misbehavior has been exposure and the political process.  Impeachment is reserved for those situations in which the removal of the President is imperative. It's imperative.  And so far in our history, that hasn't proven to actually been the case. It has never carried today, except for Nixon, where we didn't actually put it to the test. But it is -- other than Nixon, it has never carried the day that the President needed to be removed. And so this is just consistent with our history of presidential misconduct that is addressed politically and not addressed by removal. Because removal has the effect of in some sense disenfranchising the voters who have put that President in office. And that's the reason why partisan impeachments are so significant, because if the motive force for removing the President are all the people that voted against him, then the people who voted for them are not going to credit that. It's going to undermine the legitimacy of impeachment.  And I'm afraid, Mark that that is really one of the big downsides, one of the big costs of this is another check on governmental power. Impeachment has now been politicized to the point where people don't care about impeachment. They should. It should be a weapon that you can threaten Presidents with and get them to conform, because it's such a heavy, serious matter. But if you're going to diminish its importance to this point, then a President is going to go, hey, impeach me. Go ahead. What do I care? Well, that's not a positive development, and all of the checks and balances that we have built in, when they get in the way of a progressive political agenda. They need to go. The Senate needs to go. The Electoral College needs to go. The impeachment power is going to be used in such a way, it will also be gone.

And then what had happened was the abuse of individual rights. And the Constitution was developed as a way of solving a problem with republicanism, and that is, it was majority rule. And it was not only James Madison, who said this, but Governor Morris, and Roger Sherman, and one framer after another at the Philadelphia convention said, the ills we face are due to an excess of democracy. Meaning, majority rule. And it didn't mean majority democracy in the sense of town halls or referenda. They were representative governments. So if you go to the dictionary and you look up Republic, they'll say representative democracy. That's not right, because they were that representative democracies, but they needed checks on the democratic process. In other words, majority rule is not the solution to the problem of legitimacy. It is the problem for which our constitution and republicanism is the solution, the checks on power.  So the meaning of the word republicanism changed -- changed with the Constitution. And after that, all of the states copied it. And they put that kind of Republican form of government into action in each state.",

And democracy or republican -- republicanism at that point was the protection of individual rights. The next sentence of the Declaration is the one that we forget about. It says, to secure these rights -- to secure these preexisting individual rights, governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed. Not all powers, not unlimited powers, but only their just powers.  Which powers? The powers necessary to secure the rights retained by the people. And that's what the Constitution was set up to do.

And the idea is you should put power in the hands of not just separate functions, which is what they had in England, but separate people which they didn't have in England and that was going to be a way of checking power. And the basic -- the simplest way of putting this, Mark is that government doesn't get to act on the individual, us, the people. We are the bosses, we are the sovereigns. They don't get to act on us unless all three branches concur. If any one of those branches says no, by and large, it doesn't happen. If Congress says no, it never gets to the President or the judiciary. If the President says no, it only gets further if Congress has a supermajority, but that protects the minority because only a minority can stop it. And then only if those two concur do courts get a say, in whether it's within the constitutional powers of the government. All three must concur, and that's a three-part check. We call that redundancy. Like on an airplane, you've got four engines, because of any one of them fails, the airplane will still stay aloft.  Well, right now, constitutionally, Mark, we're kind of operating on one engine. We're still flying, but a lot of the redundancy that's been built into our Constitution has been eliminated, one after another.",

It happened during a meeting between U.S. Special Forces and local leaders in the eastern part of that country. No group has claimed responsibility yet, but officials are not ruling out ISIS. The two dead Americans now identified as Javier Gutierrez of Texas and Antonio Rodriguez of New Mexico.

All of those video clips that they listened to, there was no cross examination by the White House. There was some cross examination by House Republicans, but not by the White House, which is what the President was entitled to. I think, had this moved forward with additional hearings and additional witnesses, the President would have been entitled under due process to cross examine all the witnesses that had already testified in the House and which were part of the record so they could have recalled any one of those witnesses, so they'd be subject to cross examination which was lacking in the process of witnesses that the Senate did consider.",

They had some live witnesses, but those were all witnesses that had testified before. And then now would be subject to presidential cross examination. One of the things that was interesting to me is the extent to which everybody quotes Hamilton, because of his writings in the Federalist Papers. And one of the things they point about Hamilton, is you know, the importance of the impeachment process, and I thought about Hamilton. Hamilton and Jefferson were at loggerheads. He was the Treasury Secretary. Jefferson was the Secretary of State, but Hamilton in many respects thought he was the Secretary of State, and he went around President Washington to give information to the British. He was sympathetic to the British and the French who were at each other's necks. Jefferson was sympathetic to the French. Jefferson wound up resigning because Hamilton was interfering with foreign policy. And Hamilton was actually giving confidential information in discussions he had had with the President and Jefferson to the British, and I'm sitting there saying, look how little history these people actually know. They're waving around the Federalist Papers to quoting Hamilton. When Hamilton, if anything, shows interference one way or another, with foreign governments in our domestic affairs.

Now, if you came down from Mars and you looked at that sentence, you would say, well, that's a pretty important sentence, wouldn't you? But it turns out, the courts have ignored it. What is rights retained by the people? That's part of the problem. They don't know what they are. Rights retained by the people are rights that the people had before government is formed, that's retained. They retain them, and those are natural rights. The very same rights the Declaration refers to as unalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. You retain those rights. And the very fact that you put some rights in the constitution like freedom of speech, which was a natural right, and trial by jury, which was not a natural right, but which Madison said was as important to secure liberty as any natural right, as any pre-existing right was. The fact you put some in there doesn't mean that you don't have others and one of the dangers that The Federalist pointed out about adding a Bill of Rights to the Constitution was if you enumerate rights, later on, people are going to say, well, that's the only rights we have. So Madison said, well, I've got a solution, here is, what was the precursor of what became the Ninth Amendment. The problem is that in some sense, the Federalists were right. By enumerating some rights, it turns out, those are kind of the only rights we have. And his solution, which was the Ninth Amendment has basically been blown out of the water by the courts.",

We need to do a wrap up of what this nation was dragged through the last half year or so, impeachment and an impeachment trial. And I want to break this down in logical steps, because we still hear people saying, we're going to impeach again, and maybe again after that.

The impeachment process that took place in the House of Representatives, do you feel it met the standards that the framers had in mind?"

Due process is a basic fundamental concept, and the impeachment process in the House lacked all due process, which means that the result of that investigation, the result of that process gave no one any confidence that they had actually uncovered the truth and given the President his opportunity to give his side of the story in that phase of the trial -- of that phase of the proceeding.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARNETT",
      "utterance": "Right. The due process of law has two components. It's the due process of law and the due process part says there must be a reliable procedure that actually establishes that somebody actually committed the offense for which they're charged. And the of-law part says it must be -- nobody can be deprived of life, liberty or property without -- except by a valid law -- it actually has to be a valid law, and just because the legislature tells you something, it doesn't make it a valid law. So it's both guilt and innocence that must be assessed and a legal standard, an objective legal standard that you could have been on notice of in advance that also must have been violated. Those are the two aspects of the due process of law. And it's a general fundamental principle that precedes the Fifth Amendment, and it precedes the 14th Amendment. Those amendments make reference to a long standing preexisting principle."

As you know, Mark, as a lawyer, cross examination is one of the hallmarks of freedom. The ability to call your own witness, that's the right of confronting your accusers and also the right to call your own witnesses. Those were not done. The President was not accorded any opportunity to participate until the very last minute when it had gone from the Intelligence Committee where all the work was being done to the Judiciary Committee where no work was done. And then he was invited to sit in at that point -- his lawyers. But that is not due process and that is not a way you reach a conclusion that's going to satisfy someone who is not already convinced that the President is guilty of an impeachable offense."

Doesn't that do grave damage? We need this balance. Isn't it possible as you alluded to, that the legislature can be tyrannical?"

      "speaker": "BARNETT",

And the due process of law gives you the opportunity to go into court and have an independent judge decide whether who is right -- the individual citizen or Congress. Congress is not above the law. Nobody is above the law. In the case of impeachment, though, it's not justiciable. It's not something that the courts would get involved with other than to evaluate the merits of subpoenas let's say. But with respect to what's an impeachable offense, that is not who checks the House. The institution that checks the House is the Senate. That's where you get review. Its Senate review instead of judicial review of whether what has happened in the House meets the standard of due process. And that is exactly what I think persuaded a majority of the senators to vote the way they did, regardless of whether or not the President had misbehaved. Clearly, the House had misbehaved and to create an incentive or a future precedent in which the House, anybody, no matter which party controls, can continue to act politically and abuse their impeachment power is something the Senate was charged with stopping, and I think that's what they did."

The remedy for all of that Presidential misbehavior has been exposure and the political process. Impeachment is reserved for those situations in which the removal of the President is imperative. It's imperative. And so far in our history, that hasn't proven to actually been the case. It has never carried today, except for Nixon, where we didn't actually put it to the test. But it is -- other than Nixon, it has never carried the day that the President needed to be removed. And so this is just consistent with our history of presidential misconduct that is addressed politically and not addressed by removal. Because removal has the effect of in some sense disenfranchising the voters who have put that President in office. And that's the reason why partisan impeachments are so significant, because if the motive force for removing the President are all the people that voted against him, then the people who voted for them are not going to credit that. It's going to undermine the legitimacy of impeachment. And I'm afraid, Mark that that is really one of the big downsides, one of the big costs of this is another check on governmental power. Impeachment has now been politicized to the point where people don't care about impeachment. They should. It should be a weapon that you can threaten Presidents with and get them to conform, because it's such a heavy, serious matter. But if you're going to diminish its importance to this point, then a President is going to go, hey, impeach me. Go ahead. What do I care? Well, that's not a positive development, and all of the checks and balances that we have built in, when they get in the way of a progressive political agenda. They need to go. The Senate needs to go. The Electoral College needs to go. The impeachment power is going to be used in such a way, it will also be gone.

And it was not only James Madison, who said this, but Governor Morris, and Roger Sherman, and one framer after another at the Philadelphia convention said, the ills we face are due to an excess of democracy. Meaning, majority rule. And it didn't mean majority democracy in the sense of town halls or referenda. They were representative governments. So if you go to the dictionary and you look up Republic, they'll say representative democracy. That's not right, because they were that representative democracies, but they needed checks on the democratic process. In other words, majority rule is not the solution to the problem of legitimacy. It is the problem for which our constitution and republicanism is the solution, the checks on power. So the meaning of the word republicanism changed -- changed with the Constitution. And after that, all of the states copied it. And they put that kind of Republican form of government into action in each state."

And then he said, it wouldn't make any difference if it's 3,000 people, would the 1,000 be secure? That was the way he put the point. And democracy or republican -- republicanism at that point was the protection of individual rights. The next sentence of the Declaration is the one that we forget about. It says, to secure these rights -- to secure these preexisting individual rights, governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed. Not all powers, not unlimited powers, but only their just powers. Which powers? The powers necessary to secure the rights retained by the people. And that's what the Constitution was set up to do. And there are all these structural constraints. They all get in the way -- they get in the way of what? They get in the way of majority rule, when in this case, the progressives think they have the majority. And so they must be stripped away.

And they just go into resistance mode if the other party comes in. If their party comes in, then they're all -- everybody is happy. They all play well together.

The separation of powers?"

And the idea is you should put power in the hands of not just separate functions, which is what they had in England, but separate people which they didn't have in England and that was going to be a way of checking power. And the basic -- the simplest way of putting this, Mark is that government doesn't get to act on the individual, us, the people. We are the bosses, we are the sovereigns. They don't get to act on us unless all three branches concur. If any one of those branches says no, by and large, it doesn't happen. If Congress says no, it never gets to the President or the judiciary. If the President says no, it only gets further if Congress has a supermajority, but that protects the minority because only a minority can stop it. And then only if those two concur do courts get a say, in whether it's within the constitutional powers of the government. All three must concur, and that's a three-part check. We call that redundancy. Like on an airplane, you've got four engines, because of any one of them fails, the airplane will still stay aloft. Well, right now, constitutionally, Mark, we're kind of operating on one engine. We're still flying, but a lot of the redundancy that's been built into our Constitution has been eliminated, one after another."

It happened during a meeting between U.S. Special Forces and local leaders in the eastern part of that country. No group has claimed responsibility yet, but officials are not ruling out ISIS. The two dead Americans now identified as Javier Gutierrez of Texas and Antonio Rodriguez of New Mexico. Meantime, a suspect has been arrested in the attempted shooting murders of two New York City police officers.

It was a good move. All of that evidence was before the Senate. There was a record. There were witnesses. The debate in the Senate was over additional witnesses, more witnesses. Witnesses that the House didn't call, witnesses that they didn't subpoena. That's what the debate was over. And in fact, if it comes to due process, the problem with the Senate hearings, I think it didn't work out this way, but the real defect in the Senate proceedings is that the President did not have the opportunity to cross examine the witnesses that the Senate considered. All of those video clips that they listened to, there was no cross examination by the White House. There was some cross examination by House Republicans, but not by the White House, which is what the President was entitled to. I think, had this moved forward with additional hearings and additional witnesses, the President would have been entitled under due process to cross examine all the witnesses that had already testified in the House and which were part of the record so they could have recalled any one of those witnesses, so they'd be subject to cross examination which was lacking in the process of witnesses that the Senate did consider."

So House Republicans did what they could, I commend them for that. But it's not the same. You know, for one thing, you know, President's counsel is going to be privy to information that would actually animate their defense in a way that congressional you know, Republicans don't know about. And you saw that in the way that that the President's counsel presented their case in the Senate. You know, it was arguments that we hadn't necessarily heard before. That was the first time in fact, the country heard what the President's defense was to these charges."

I mean, the only way that the Senate would ever hear the evidence that had been presented in the House was to hear it for themselves. Technology has made that unnecessary or not less necessary, and in fact, during the Clinton impeachment process, video, transcripts were used there as well. They had some live witnesses, but those were all witnesses that had testified before. And then now would be subject to presidential cross examination. One of the things that was interesting to me is the extent to which everybody quotes Hamilton, because of his writings in the Federalist Papers. And one of the things they point about Hamilton, is you know, the importance of the impeachment process, and I thought about Hamilton. Hamilton and Jefferson were at loggerheads. He was the Treasury Secretary. Jefferson was the Secretary of State, but Hamilton in many respects thought he was the Secretary of State, and he went around President Washington to give information to the British. He was sympathetic to the British and the French who were at each other's necks. Jefferson was sympathetic to the French. Jefferson wound up resigning because Hamilton was interfering with foreign policy. And Hamilton was actually giving confidential information in discussions he had had with the President and Jefferson to the British, and I'm sitting there saying, look how little history these people actually know. They're waving around the Federalist Papers to quoting Hamilton. When Hamilton, if anything, shows interference one way or another, with foreign governments in our domestic affairs. Does it concern you as a constitutional expert when you listen to some of these people go on and on about the Constitution or history or with their platitudes that they just don't know enough about what they're talking about?"

So like everything else, you delegate this to especially selected representatives, who presumably are going to know more and they're going to go and they're going to figure out who do they vote for. So this is like what representative government is about. That's the original -- that's the main original purpose of it. We don't need it for that anymore.

The thing about localities, the Electoral College does create firewalls, and so that only individual states and you can run -- you can you can steal as many votes as you want from Chicago, and it's not going to give Illinois more electoral votes than they otherwise have to give. A fantastic firewall against voter fraud and allows us to have outcomes of elections known within a few days, at worst of the election being held, otherwise, it would be like the Iowa caucuses where you might never know who the winner of a particular election was, because they're just going to keep counting and recounting."

And if they're not represented, just because they're more rural states, more rural areas, then their interests aren't represented in Congress either or different kinds of industries, commercial fishing industries.

We have the Bill of Rights. We have the Ninth Amendment that's almost never discussed and I've argued that the Ninth Amendment really is the link back to the principles in the Declaration of Independence about the individual, unalienable rights, natural law, what's your take?"

Now, if you came down from Mars and you looked at that sentence, you would say, well, that's a pretty important sentence, wouldn't you? But it turns out, the courts have ignored it. What is rights retained by the people? That's part of the problem. They don't know what they are. Rights retained by the people are rights that the people had before government is formed, that's retained. They retain them, and those are natural rights. The very same rights the Declaration refers to as unalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. You retain those rights. And the very fact that you put some rights in the constitution like freedom of speech, which was a natural right, and trial by jury, which was not a natural right, but which Madison said was as important to secure liberty as any natural right, as any pre-existing right was. The fact you put some in there doesn't mean that you don't have others and one of the dangers that The Federalist pointed out about adding a Bill of Rights to the Constitution was if you enumerate rights, later on, people are going to say, well, that's the only rights we have. So Madison said, well, I've got a solution, here is, what was the precursor of what became the Ninth Amendment. The problem is that in some sense, the Federalists were right. By enumerating some rights, it turns out, those are kind of the only rights we have. And his solution, which was the Ninth Amendment has basically been blown out of the water by the courts."

But progressives did not settle for that and they have not settled for that. Any policy they like has to be implemented at the national level and the problem that means is that you can't vote with your feet and vote from a state that has bad policies to a state that has better.

So they wanted a balance. They wanted -- they wanted to a compromise between an unlimited national power and an enfeebled national power. And they thought they struck that balance with the enumerated powers that they've gave to the Federal government leaving all others powers to the states and the 10th Amendment is really kind of a truism that essentially points to the enumerated powers and says these are the powers of the national government, all the rest of the powers are in the states. But then as we know, that became qualified by the 14th, the 13th and 14th and 15th Amendments, where it was discovered that states could themselves be the agents of tyranny. Slavery was a state law and there needed to be some Federal constraints on state power. But we lack our more state constraints on Federal power. There ought to be -- both sides should be checking the other."

      "utterance": "Now, you've written a remarkable book, an accessible book with videos and so forth, \"An Introduction of Constitutional Law: 100 Supreme Court Cases everyone should know.\" I think this is crucially important. I've had you on my radio show. We've talked about it and so forth. So people who really want to get into the Constitution, want to get into what the Supreme Court says about the Constitution. Is that why you wrote it?"

      "speaker": "BARNETT",
      "utterance": "Yes. And what the Supreme Court says about the Constitution is not the same as the Constitution. My book, \"Restoring the Lost Constitution\" is about that. This is a book about what the Supreme Court has said, for better and worse and oftentimes for worse, and we basically identify the 100 Supreme Court cases that everyone should know. We discussed each one of them in very, very short chapters, something that's adoptable to the general public, to homeschoolers, to college students, and we have a video that's multimedia for all the hundred -- we have 63 videos and when you buy the book, you get a scratch off code on the inside cover that gives you access to the 63 videos that we spent two years making that illustrate all of these cases with multimedia. We have excerpts oral arguments, the audio. The justices do their own hand down statements. We have them reading their own opinions in their own words and pictures and graphs. This makes Constitutional Law, not the Constitution so much, its Constitutional Law come alive and now you'll understand what Constitution - - you take -- you read this book and you'll know more than what most lawyers who graduated from Law School know about the Constitution."

    {
      "speaker": "BARNETT",
      "utterance": "Originalism is the view that the meaning of the Constitution should remain the same until it's properly changed by amendment. That's all it is. And there's another sentence which says why originalism? And that is the Constitution is not the law that governs us, Mark. The Constitution is the law that governs those who govern us, and they shouldn't be able to change the meaning of the law that governs them without going through the amendment process any more than you and I can change the laws that they make to govern us without going to the legislative process."
