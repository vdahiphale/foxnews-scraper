She was showing the kid how to drive a stick. She's been fired although there's a school wide petition demanding she's still teach driver's ed. That's two. Katie Couric is getting called a misogynist and is for her new memoir in which he trashes other women and glosses over a connection to perverts like Matt Lauer and Jeffrey Epstein. Defenders say that's unfair and point out to her charity work for the Ted Bundy Foundation. When told she was being called a misogynist and this by other woman, she replied, tell those bitches to shut up and make me a sandwich. That's for your counting at home. Actress/Comedian/has been Sarah Silverman slams Hollywood for casting non-Jewish actors to play Jewish characters as an example of Jew face. Which is the kind of nuanced opinion you'd expect from a performer who's done this. Yes. Vice President Kamala Harris has finally sold her D.C. condo for 1.85 million. The bad news for Kamala according to a new Democratic bill, the new buyer owes her nothing because the condo will pay for itself. Meghan Trainor and her husband admitted to having two toilets next to each other so they can go to the bathroom at the same time. Where's the extra toilet in Brian Stelter's bathroom is a spare. And that's seven jokes. I give it four out of seven, maybe three. All right. So what happened to all those progressive women who once cared about women, especially women in power? Well, it all goes away. If you aren't there kind of woman. Suddenly oppression is necessary. Here's our favorite sack of spoiled potatoes. Joy Behar explaining that activists had to go into the bathroom to confront Senator Sinema.",

      "sentences": "Easy for her to say. No one's brave enough to follow Joy Behar into the can. Talk about a death wish, six feet of distance versus that blast radius? The only time I'd agree with Fauci about wearing multiple masks. So OK. Sinema being MIA makes it OK for her to be bullied in a bathroom? By Joy's logic, right-wing activists should be in a line at 15 deep in front of a stall when Kamala is dropping the kids off at the pool. And a little phrase, I mean, talk about someone being MIA, she's the first V.P. in history who can only be found with an amber alert. But my favorite hypocrite the shapeshifter Kirsten Powers who used to spend many lonely night lecturing us and how mean we are to women in politics and that a lack of grace was destroying the very fabric of America. But now that she's on CNN, her opinion suddenly changes. It's amazing with 300 bucks a week and free hair and makeup will do. I don't know if that's the case. She claims that she was flabbergasted. Flabbergasted that people were upset over bullies chasing Sinema into the stall. And her reasoning was if Sinema didn't want them to follow her into the bathroom, she shouldn't have gone into the bath. Damn. All that's missing is she was asking for it. Yes. How dare the senator use a bathroom and how dare she show off her well rounded moderate answers for the world to see? And why -- and why they need to use the toilet? Just do what other Democrats senators do and piss on her constituents. So it's a tale -- thank you. It's a tale of two Kerstin's one denied a safe space in a restroom and the other crapping on the idea of common decency. Sorry, Powers, there's a time and a place for people to make demand and it's not in the ladies room. Trust me. I've tried. More important here you have Power shaming a woman for needing the bathroom while excusing bullying tactics of the left. This is from a woman who once said, \"In our pugilistic take no prisoners era, preaching grace toward those on the other side of the political fence is decidedly counterculture.\" Yes, that's one of Bauer's quotes about grace. Turns out she's about as graceful as Biden on a stair climber. One thing is for certain she's got the mob behind her. The bullying of Sinema was cheered on on Twitter. But you think those who preach grace would challenge the mob, rather than handing them the pitch for us. That's hardly Christ like. But once politics poisons minds, you have idiots justifying all sorts of extremism. It's a spectrum from confronting people at dinner to physically attacking them. We call that Antifa but they call it an idea. Meanwhile, angry moms and dads are treated like they're placing IEDs in the faculty parking lot. The double standard is as palpable as the stench in a Capitol Hill men's room. Take Kelly Paul, wife of Rand Paul writing, \"A mob held us hostage for 10 minutes, spitting on us and threatening to kill us no charges. Fake anthrax and death threats sent to our home, no charges. Now just learned the person who called ran senate office threatening to shoot us will not be charged.\" I wonder Kirsten Powers thinks she had it coming. Hey, if you didn't want to be threatened with death, maybe just stay out of the limelight. You know, return to the kitchen, keep your mouth shut. It's so very Taliban. It's amazing how much the female left have in common with those lady aiders. And I'm not even talking about their sandals or beards. They both share that delight in coercion as a means to silence uppity women. The Taliban will stone a woman for showing an inch of ankle. The left will berate a politically moderate woman for showing an ounce of gumption. If there were any more Taliban, Biden would be sending them weapons.",

She was showing the kid how to drive a stick. She's been fired although there's a school wide petition demanding she's still teach driver's ed. That's two. Katie Couric is getting called a misogynist and is for her new memoir in which he trashes other women and glosses over a connection to perverts like Matt Lauer and Jeffrey Epstein. Defenders say that's unfair and point out to her charity work for the Ted Bundy Foundation. When told she was being called a misogynist and this by other woman, she replied, tell those bitches to shut up and make me a sandwich. That's for your counting at home. Actress/Comedian/has been Sarah Silverman slams Hollywood for casting non-Jewish actors to play Jewish characters as an example of Jew face. Which is the kind of nuanced opinion you'd expect from a performer who's done this. Yes. Vice President Kamala Harris has finally sold her D.C. condo for 1.85 million. The bad news for Kamala according to a new Democratic bill, the new buyer owes her nothing because the condo will pay for itself. Meghan Trainor and her husband admitted to having two toilets next to each other so they can go to the bathroom at the same time. Where's the extra toilet in Brian Stelter's bathroom is a spare. And that's seven jokes. I give it four out of seven, maybe three. All right. So what happened to all those progressive women who once cared about women, especially women in power? Well, it all goes away. If you aren't there kind of woman. Suddenly oppression is necessary. Here's our favorite sack of spoiled potatoes. Joy Behar explaining that activists had to go into the bathroom to confront Senator Sinema."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JOY BEHAR, ABC HOST",
      "utterance": "Sinema is MIA all over the place. She's not around. They call her to have a meeting. They tried to get her on the phone. She doesn't -- she's, you know, she's like a missing person. So this is the only alternative they have."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "Easy for her to say. No one's brave enough to follow Joy Behar into the can. Talk about a death wish, six feet of distance versus that blast radius? The only time I'd agree with Fauci about wearing multiple masks. So OK. Sinema being MIA makes it OK for her to be bullied in a bathroom? By Joy's logic, right-wing activists should be in a line at 15 deep in front of a stall when Kamala is dropping the kids off at the pool. And a little phrase, I mean, talk about someone being MIA, she's the first V.P. in history who can only be found with an amber alert. But my favorite hypocrite the shapeshifter Kirsten Powers who used to spend many lonely night lecturing us and how mean we are to women in politics and that a lack of grace was destroying the very fabric of America. But now that she's on CNN, her opinion suddenly changes. It's amazing with 300 bucks a week and free hair and makeup will do. I don't know if that's the case. She claims that she was flabbergasted. Flabbergasted that people were upset over bullies chasing Sinema into the stall. And her reasoning was if Sinema didn't want them to follow her into the bathroom, she shouldn't have gone into the bath. Damn. All that's missing is she was asking for it. Yes. How dare the senator use a bathroom and how dare she show off her well rounded moderate answers for the world to see? And why -- and why they need to use the toilet? Just do what other Democrats senators do and piss on her constituents. So it's a tale -- thank you. It's a tale of two Kerstin's one denied a safe space in a restroom and the other crapping on the idea of common decency. Sorry, Powers, there's a time and a place for people to make demand and it's not in the ladies room. Trust me. I've tried. More important here you have Power shaming a woman for needing the bathroom while excusing bullying tactics of the left. This is from a woman who once said, \"In our pugilistic take no prisoners era, preaching grace toward those on the other side of the political fence is decidedly counterculture.\" Yes, that's one of Bauer's quotes about grace. Turns out she's about as graceful as Biden on a stair climber. One thing is for certain she's got the mob behind her. The bullying of Sinema was cheered on on Twitter. But you think those who preach grace would challenge the mob, rather than handing them the pitch for us. That's hardly Christ like. But once politics poisons minds, you have idiots justifying all sorts of extremism. It's a spectrum from confronting people at dinner to physically attacking them. We call that Antifa but they call it an idea. Meanwhile, angry moms and dads are treated like they're placing IEDs in the faculty parking lot. The double standard is as palpable as the stench in a Capitol Hill men's room. Take Kelly Paul, wife of Rand Paul writing, \"A mob held us hostage for 10 minutes, spitting on us and threatening to kill us no charges. Fake anthrax and death threats sent to our home, no charges. Now just learned the person who called ran senate office threatening to shoot us will not be charged.\" I wonder Kirsten Powers thinks she had it coming. Hey, if you didn't want to be threatened with death, maybe just stay out of the limelight. You know, return to the kitchen, keep your mouth shut. It's so very Taliban. It's amazing how much the female left have in common with those lady aiders. And I'm not even talking about their sandals or beards. They both share that delight in coercion as a means to silence uppity women. The Taliban will stone a woman for showing an inch of ankle. The left will berate a politically moderate woman for showing an ounce of gumption. If there were any more Taliban, Biden would be sending them weapons."

Meanwhile, the San Jose State anthropology professor's tweet pissed off the Bay Area woke. They weren't happy. She was smiling, and joking with an ancient skull. No, it wasn't this one. This one once had a brain in it. Here's the real picture. The mob said she didn't take into account the feelings of the descendants of the cradled cranium. They're going to flip when they find out about weekend at Bernie's. Even a top administrator collects his pearls saying this picture evoked, \"Shock and disgust.\" But she's not backing down telling the local paper -- I love local papers.

So, they're very inspirational when they take on the dean and the whole faculty. At Hoover, we're in a process of transition everywhere in academia is but what really, I think is inspiring, I've got colleagues so Neil Ferguson or Scott Atlas, and we're so -- you have kind of a cadre where we're saying we're not going to give an inch but this, I think the woke thing is sort of peaking we're at peak woke now. Because if this continues, it's not sustainable. You can't have an open border; you can't have race dominating every conversation.
