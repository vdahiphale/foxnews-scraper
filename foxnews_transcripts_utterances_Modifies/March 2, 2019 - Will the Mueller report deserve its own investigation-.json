Plus, a very special exclusive look at my speech to the crowd at CPAC just a few short hours ago, but first, it was the longest speech of his Presidency to date and President Trump didn't disappoint.

We tried McCain, the Republicans tried to nominate McCain, then Mitt Romney. None of that was going to get anything done. And then we had that primary in 2016.

As my good friend Chris Plante says, \"If the left didn't have double standards, they wouldn't have any standards at all.\" The idea that this President -- did you just -- I mean, that two-hour speech today, he went from policy to policy to policy. He was extemporaneous. He didn't use notes. This man has everything at the ends of his fingertips. Not only that, I know a friend of mine runs the Asia Directorate in the NSC, one of the best people in the National Security Council speaks the languages of the region, knows the threat that North Korea poses and has the ear of the President.

Yes, I mean, let's not -- obviously, he would have preferred an agreement. I mean, that goes without saying. But Sebastian is right, Judge. Trump understands, I think from his time in business, what a lot of career politicians don't. He understands the concept of leverage. Judge, listen, the country is starving. The North Korean -- the country is starving to death. He doesn't care about his people. But he does care about keeping us military happy, and Trump understands that. And keep in mind, now he has a big cudgel and a weapon in North Korea -- Kim. Kim has this nuclear weapons. But unlike the Soviets who we defeated in the Cold War, Judge we had mutually assured destruction, we would have destroyed each other. Kim only has Kim-assured destruction. He doesn't have the nuclear arsenal that the Soviets did. He's going to have to come around, the President understands leverage.

China is bleeding out from all its veins right now. They're losing massive amounts of value on their stock market. They are worried that this trade war could escalate. The President has fired a shot across the bow. This was a message to China that Kim has to start behaving, and guess what? Kim's regime, more than 90% of what they need to survive comes from China.

What matters to people on their kitchen table and in their backyard, they will always vote on and partisanship goes out the window. What does this have to do with the EO? Judge, do you have any idea how many thousands, hundreds of thousands of conservatives across college campuses in America right now are personally experiencing this? And maybe it's not de jure, maybe it's not some kind of legal speech suppression, but it is certainly de facto.

And there's a very simple reason. Only that's key, only capitalism creates wealth. No other economic way of life system philosophy has ever created wealth. Socialism spends the money that capitalism creates. No one can deny that, even leftists can't deny that. They will say it's the moral thing to do then to spend what capitalism creates because there's inequality and all of the things that they object to, but they cannot deny that itself makes no money.

      "utterance": "Pelosi doesn't really have a choice. AOC is stealing the spotlight. And so Democrats are in this weird situation where if they go against what she's saying, then they're villainized by the media and all of her base that goes after that. Remember, she has the loud minority on her side right now. And like you mentioned, this was a threat to the Democrats and she does think she's the boss, she's in charge. She said it herself and I don't have a problem with political parties sticking together, right, to move forward a legislation. You're not always going to get what you want. But what she was attacking moderate Democrats over was the amendment. It was a common sense amendment where it was going after gun retailers, asking them to report illegal immigrants who are buying guns. It is illegal for illegal immigrants to attempt to purchase a firearm. That is not unreasonable. Ten years ago, Democrats would have supported that."

This Green New Deal is a green scam, the green new scam and the only thing missing out of her bill is a rather short bill. When I looked at it, I actually laughed out loud. I read it a few times because I just couldn't really digest what was in there because it was just so ridiculous. It's like her and Bill Nye, the fake science guy and a third grader got together and just wrote it. It's that bad. I just couldn't -- I mean, did you read the bill, Jonathan?"

Joining me now with reaction, Turning Point USA Director of Urban Engagement, Brandon Tatum. All right, Brandon, the problem that I'm seeing is whether or not Americans, students, anyone wearing a MAGA -- Make America Great -- cap are safe because from the 81- year-old guy in the supermarket to the 23-year-old at a restaurant in Massachusetts and then this kid on campus and in addition, you can multiply it by a thousand, people are being attacked for expressing their First Amendment right. It's a free speech in a cap. What -- are you in Turning Point and Hayden Williams -- are you going to go after UC Berkeley?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BRANDON TATUM, DIRECTOR OF URBAN ENGAGEMENT, TURNING POINT USA",
      "utterance": "So this is what I will say. President Trump has done a wonderful job by promising that he's going to stand up for Americans, you know, freedom of speech on campus and Turning Point has been on the front lines, boots on the ground, fighting for the students year in a year out for them to have the freedom to speak their mind and have access to the American dream. And these things are what we prioritize and we're going to continue to fight for students especially on that campus."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "But you know what bothers me, as you look at that video, no one on that campus helped Hayden, the victim here. There are people who saw it and the problem with UC Berkeley is that if a kid in a MAGA hat attacked a student, they would have SWAT teams, helicopters, the college will be on lock down, and this kid would have been arrested in a minute. It's like this -- they don't want to get involved, and prosecutors are going to have to prosecute and UC Berkeley has got to be sued."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TATUM",
      "utterance": "Right. I agree. And I think that this is a great example of how the left has been arranged on campus. We can see it with our own eyes. This is not a fairy tale. This young man got punched in the face for no reason. And because of this, I think it just shine a light on it. And we're going to be able to have a leg to stand on when it comes to defending these young people on campus. It's a shame that people didn't step in and intervene, but I don't blame them because you don't want to get in the middle of certain things and get yourself knocked out over something you had no involvement in. But I do believe that they should take a stronger stance on campus and they should take it seriously. And this kid if he was a student on campus, he should be expelled indefinitely."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Yes. He worked at UC Berkeley. You worked there. Why did it take them eight days to figure out who he was? His face was as clear as day and then an 81-year-old guy in a supermarket, he gets deck by wearing a hat in New Jersey and then my favorite is this woman named Rosie who attacks a kid wearing a MAGA hat in a restaurant in Falmouth and she overstayed her visa; now, she's facing deportation. Karma is a tough one, ain't she?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TATUM",

But that just shows that they're cowards and they're picking on people that think are weak, but we, as Americans, we have to stand up, stand our ground and support one another. If I see a person deciding to attack another individual with a MAGA hat, I will intervene and I will protect that person because we are together and united as one and I support people who support the President."

Judicial Watch President, Tom Fitton joins me now to explain. All right, Tom, you appeared at CPAC with Congressman Devin Nunes. One of the things that you said that got my attention was that this Justice Department has no business writing a report on the President's conduct. Explain that."

      "speaker": "TOM FITTON, PRESIDENT, JUDICIAL WATCH",
      "utterance": "Well, the President is the President. He has a right to fire people like James Comey. He has a right to communicate with the Russian Ambassador and otherwise run the government.

      "speaker": "FITTON",
      "utterance": "And Attorney General Barr should be asking that. We understand, Mr. Mueller that you've indicted all these people or prosecuted them. That's on the public record. But your opinion about the President's conduct as President, it's about as worthy as anyone else's opinion and the Justice Department isn't paying you to give us another dossier on President Trump. We already have one corrupted dossier and the idea that his activist attorneys working for Mr. Mueller, all -- most of whom are anti- Trumpers, will be writing some dossier on President Trump that is something that needs to be rejected."

We found an e-mail to Sally Yates, the anti-Trump Obama hold over that the President had, you know, saying I'm in awe of you, after she did something outside the law and preventing the President's travel ban from being defended. And they went to Hillary Clinton's election night party. This man is going to be writing a report on President Trump. No, thank you."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "All right, let's talk about - there's still so many documents from this investigation that we haven't seen. Where are the efforts now by Judicial Watch to get that stuff out? And we're going to get any information from Congress and, you know, what do we need to see that we aren't seeing?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FITTON",
      "utterance": "Well, Congress has asked, like Devin Nunes has asked for certain material to be declassified from his investigation, including witness testimony. They've been sitting on that over at the deep state, the FISA warrant application still hasn't been fully declassified."

      "utterance": "Why do you think he's holding back on that?"
    },

      "utterance": "Why?"
    },

    {
      "speaker": "FITTON",

      "speaker": "FITTON",
      "utterance": "But when you look at the documents, Judge, you wonder what anything else Ohr was able to do but communicate with Steele, it was unbelievable the number of communications and it was desperation on the part of Steele to get his information to the DOJ."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Okay, so now we've got Bill Barr, the new Attorney General. Anybody with half a brain knows that the investigation should be of the Clintons and buying the uranium and resetting and all that other hogwash, what is Bill Barr about and what is he going to do?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FITTON",

      "speaker": "FITTON",
      "utterance": "Well, you know, he's not going to investigate Hillary Clinton. You know, we're talking about a Mueller report. Where is the Justice Department in terms of investigating the coup attempt against President Trump? The abuse of the FISA process? The illicit spying on President Trump and right now, Mueller is still being allowed to go around and abuse the process, the rule of law and to target people who are affiliated with President Trump."
