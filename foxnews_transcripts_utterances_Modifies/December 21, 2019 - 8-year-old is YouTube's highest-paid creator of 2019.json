[LAUGHTER] They're right, but for the wrong reasons. This is historical in that it's the first impeachment designed for future crimes. It's not what Trump has done, but what he might do later. Really, if we could punish people for stuff they didn't do, then we'd have to impeach the entire Congress. That's why they're putting off the vote, so they could find actual dirt, but if their case was so strong, why stall? Why demand more witnesses? To use a hockey phrase, isn't this a slam dunk? [LAUGHTER]The reality: The impeachment has been cheapened. It's now on par with an angry review on Yelp. Right, Adam?"

He goes, \"I'm going to help the American people, and that's that.\" We were doing -- we had a great meeting about mental health in America, a really -- just a tremendous group, and he came in and spoke a little bit and was very, very inspiring. That's what always kills me. Whatever is going on in that White House never gets out. It never gets out. The press just never lets that out, which is always extraordinary to see. Every time I go in there, I think, \"If people only knew what was going on, the quality of the staff\" --"

It's just because no one cares, and this impeachment really -- for the last three years, it's reminded me of the Austin Powers scene with the steamroller that, you know, they're screaming for, what, a full minute, and everyone sees what's coming. And then it comes, and it's not a shock, and you just go, \"Oh, we were expecting that.\" So, that's all it is, and all it's done -- that steamroller has picked up soundbites and video clips that are all going toward Trump's 2020 campaign, and that's going to secure that reelection. He doesn't have a reason to be worried."

They bat stuff around; they, you know, lay on top -- they nap on each other. Maybe, like, get, like, a DJ playing the greatest hits of the ‘90s in the background. I'd watch that -- five stars -- try to steal all the cats; go to jail. Perfect afternoon."
