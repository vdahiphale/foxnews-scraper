For the hour, we'll reveal how America's left obsessively pushes anti-Trump conspiracy theories, all while covering up clear and unbridled misconduct at some of the highest levels of our federal bureaucracy. This week, Democrats and the media mob teamed up for another round of fake moral outrage, this time over a statement from President Trump about foreign opposition research.  The president emphasized he would pass off nefarious material to the FBI, but that didn't matter to the far left mob who manufactured yet another phony scandal. So after more than 24 hours of constant hysteria, President Trump clarified his comments yet again. Take a look.",

You look at what happened.

And as we've been hearing from the Department of Justice, that John Durham has basically amassed his own group of people to look at the very beginnings and the origins of the investigation into President Trump and the alleged Russian collusion.   I think that's going to be very significant because what we know now is that stands far beyond the FBI, Jason. I mean, they are looking right now at CIA officers, and, of course, John Brennan is connected to this. We have got Clapper as well, the former director of national intelligence, and James Comey. But I think what is really important is what you said a moment ago and what you talked about, Andrew McCabe. Think about what Andrew McCabe is saying they are. He is actually saying, look, you know, we have these people talking to people in the United States. They should be reporting this to the FBI. We've got foreign actors.  Yet, they went ahead and took all of this information which I believe the investigation is definitely going to focus on Fusion GPS. That is a nongovernmental entity. That is the embattled research firm that hired Christopher Steele to basically collect all the information on the dossier which was paid for by the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee.  They're going to be looking very closely at that, but they took all of this information from a foreign, even if it was an ally, he's a foreign MI-6 -- MI-6 agent, and then they take from him and he takes the information from the Russians.

But that's one thing I think got lost, Jason, in the entire conversation, Jason. The president brought it back to it, hey, I was meeting with the majesty, the queen. You should not call up the director of the FBI to report on conversations with her or with President Macron. It is ridiculous on its face.

You would be good with that.  Of course, they would not. And I would also like to ask them, how they came to change their view so quickly in particular civil liberty. For a long time, remember the outrage that we had from Democrats when President Bush was trying to do the Patriot Act and other things got constantly told we could not use these surveillance tools, even metadata which is nothing compared to FISA warrants, by the way. But not even metadata because of the risk that it might invade America's privacy in some way or form or allow the government to surveil.

It was because people had been coming forward and saying there is something seriously wrong with weaponization of our intelligence community.  I don't think what we realize is that it was this vast, that it was happening at such a pervasive level.

So, I think to be honest, I would not respect John Dean's judgment and I think the Republicans on the committee did a very fine job of saying, hey let's look at your background and not just what you did at the Nixon White House, you paid your debt to society, but what you have done since that time which really raises very serious credibility questions. So, I don't think it was a serious exercise, bad call on their part. But they are trying to keep the ball in play as I see it, right? Keep the stories going.

Tonight, liberal lawlessness is continuing to plague our major cities, rampant homelessness, needles on the streets and massive trash pileups are leading to an all-out public health crisis, especially in Los Angeles, where city officials are now accusing neighboring suburbs of dumping their own homeless on L.A. streets, escalating the already out of control crisis and unfortunately, California's soft on crime policies don't stop there, because Democrats in the Golden State are now pushing to actually let convicted felons serve on juries. And remember this, Far Left radicalism extends to every corner of the new extreme Democratic Party, including on the issue of abortion, where New York is leading the charge as city leaders are backing new efforts to provide abortion funding assistance for women who travel in from out-of- state to have the procedure. They are literally taking your taxpayer dollars and using them for abortions in New York. You can't get it done in your own state. Come to New York and the taxpayers in New York will pay for you to help get through that process. U.S. Senate candidate for Michigan John James is joining us along with Fox News Contributor Rachel Campos-Duffy. Rachel, I want to start with you.

You can raise $250,000 in a New York minute among rich liberal Democrats in New York City. Why are they doing it? The reason is they're doing it purposefully, it's their way of getting revenge against some of the pro-life legislation and the sentiment in the country and in the science community that is favoring the pro-life movement. And it's a trend that you're not just seeing in New York. I have a daughter in college, she attends University of Chicago, they just voted in their student government to use the tuition money that my husband and I paid towards my daughter's school towards an emergency fund that will now also pay for abortions from college students. So, this is a liberal trend. It's a revenge to force people who oppose abortions to actually be complicit in it.",

For the hour, we'll reveal how America's left obsessively pushes anti-Trump conspiracy theories, all while covering up clear and unbridled misconduct at some of the highest levels of our federal bureaucracy. This week, Democrats and the media mob teamed up for another round of fake moral outrage, this time over a statement from President Trump about foreign opposition research. The president emphasized he would pass off nefarious material to the FBI, but that didn't matter to the far left mob who manufactured yet another phony scandal. So after more than 24 hours of constant hysteria, President Trump clarified his comments yet again. Take a look."

Campaigns are allowed to hire individuals, foreign individuals and to pay those individuals for the services that they provide.

But wouldn't you love to hear somebody -- ask Hillary Clinton, do you really think it is appropriate that you had hired a researcher from a foreign country who was giving information from Russians, disinformation? Because we know it's not true. And I think Andrew McCabe's entire sentiment there sums up why we are in the mess we are in, because that was clearly the thought process that was guiding them as they went on justifying this.

And as we've been hearing from the Department of Justice, that John Durham has basically amassed his own group of people to look at the very beginnings and the origins of the investigation into President Trump and the alleged Russian collusion. I think that's going to be very significant because what we know now is that stands far beyond the FBI, Jason. I mean, they are looking right now at CIA officers, and, of course, John Brennan is connected to this. We have got Clapper as well, the former director of national intelligence, and James Comey. But I think what is really important is what you said a moment ago and what you talked about, Andrew McCabe. Think about what Andrew McCabe is saying they are. He is actually saying, look, you know, we have these people talking to people in the United States. They should be reporting this to the FBI. We've got foreign actors. Yet, they went ahead and took all of this information which I believe the investigation is definitely going to focus on Fusion GPS. That is a nongovernmental entity. That is the embattled research firm that hired Christopher Steele to basically collect all the information on the dossier which was paid for by the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee. They're going to be looking very closely at that, but they took all of this information from a foreign, even if it was an ally, he's a foreign MI-6 -- MI-6 agent, and then they take from him and he takes the information from the Russians. So think about that. They are actually, I mean, the hypocrisy is stunning there."

He is the nation's chief executive. And he -- I think it is clarified that if he got something from a hostile power, he would use his discretion to report it. But that's one thing I think got lost, Jason, in the entire conversation, Jason. The president brought it back to it, hey, I was meeting with the majesty, the queen. You should not call up the director of the FBI to report on conversations with her or with President Macron. It is ridiculous on its face. Now, these are important principles that we don't want the United States of America's political campaigns to be infective, especially with hostile powers.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "STRASSEL",
      "utterance": "Well, what I really want to ask them is, OK, let's move ahead a year. And on the basis of what you are saying at the moment, what you are justifying, apparently, you would be okay if the Trump FBI started an counterintelligence investigation into one of the leading 2020 candidates or the 2020 nominees, on the basis of some sort of opposition research that had been provided to the Trump campaign from a conservative operative. You would be good with that. Of course, they would not. And I would also like to ask them, how they came to change their view so quickly in particular civil liberty. For a long time, remember the outrage that we had from Democrats when President Bush was trying to do the Patriot Act and other things got constantly told we could not use these surveillance tools, even metadata which is nothing compared to FISA warrants, by the way. But not even metadata because of the risk that it might invade America's privacy in some way or form or allow the government to surveil. So, I'm not quite sure where that has all disappeared other than into the yaw of politics because it's more convenient for them to now not hold that position."

      "speaker": "CARTER",
      "utterance": "It absolutely is more pervasive than what has been reported. And I think this is the reason why, Jason, so many have reached out to reporters, especially to me over the last few years. I remember early on when we were first breaking the stories on, you know, the unmaskings and warrantless surveillance in issues like that. It was because people had been coming forward and saying there is something seriously wrong with weaponization of our intelligence community. I don't think what we realize is that it was this vast, that it was happening at such a pervasive level. I think this is what Devin Nunes and others are trying to bring forward and why the investigation right now is so vitally important, because we really need to clean up these agencies, find out what was going on in an effort to move forward so that it never happens again."

Now, he's paid his debt to society and so forth, but he's made a cottage industry if not lucrative career out of assailing Republican presidents. And it's always worse than Watergate. So, I think to be honest, I would not respect John Dean's judgment and I think the Republicans on the committee did a very fine job of saying, hey let's look at your background and not just what you did at the Nixon White House, you paid your debt to society, but what you have done since that time which really raises very serious credibility questions. So, I don't think it was a serious exercise, bad call on their part. But they are trying to keep the ball in play as I see it, right? Keep the stories going.

And at some point, they need to ask themselves, I wonder why we're not trusted. I wonder why people think we are in the tank for the Democrats. And I think you will see a little bit of that this week."

One of the things that also happened this week is they wanted to hold and they did vote in the oversight committee, a committee you and I were both on, and both chaired, to hold Attorney General Barr and the Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross in contempt.

You and I were not chairman at the time, but there is tension between the branches over whether or not to produce documents and whether or not there's been an accommodation. There is actually litigation still ongoing with this. So it is kind of like holding Barr in contempt for not turning over the Mueller report. By law, he cannot turn over parts of it so you will hold him in contempt for following the law. In this instance, they are holding Wilbur and the attorney general in contempt for not turning over documents related to something that's currently part of litigation. But if you can do it and get away with it and never be questioned and never be challenged by your base or the media, why not?"

And this rush to try to hold them in contempt before the Supreme Court comes about and this decision. And yet, nobody -- but nobody is writing these stories because they don't ask the core questions. I have just a minute left but I want to get your take on Andrew McCabe calling for the impeachment of Donald J. Trump. What's your take?"

But let's think about who he would have gotten on the phone if he had called in the summer of 2016. Comey, who thinks impeachment is too good for you, McCabe who despite his own legal distractions wants to weigh in and say Trump ought to be impeached, or Brennan who wants to do when more than that and actually put them on trial for treason, a crime for which you can be put to death. So, that's who he is supposed to call in the summer of 2016. I wish McCabe would just go on and deal with his own legal issues. I really don't know anyone who gives a damn what Andy McCabe thinks about impeachment and Donald Trump. I really don't, other than the reporter that asked him. I don't know a single soul --"

This is \"The Atlantic\" and this is why you can't take this guy seriously. It starts off, he writes at the beginning, as the Judiciary Committee's only career prosecutor. That's just not true.

We are leading again and not on bended knee apologizing to the world. We are cracking down on the problems that the country faces. And, look, in America, we re-elect Presidents when we are not at war and when the economy is strong. And in Donald Trump's case, he has got a very strong hand.

They want to yell and scream about the President needing to be impeached, but the economy is so good and the economy and their places that de Blasio and Swalwell are coming from, they're not so good in the sense that you've got the homeless problem, you've got this terrible problem with the cities turning to be rundown, they look awful. People don't want to go there, and they want to leave. And that's because of Democrat policies. I think President Trump has really brought this country back domestically and internationally as well."

KAYLEIGH MCENANY, TRUMP 2020 CAMPAIGN NATIONAL PRESS SECRETARY: Well, I think I see what the American people see. They see an elitist pompous smug press that is entirely out of touch and contrast that with Sarah Sanders, a wonderful human being, honest, so much integrity when the American people watch her, they watch someone fighting for them, for the Trump agenda that they elected. And there is a reason why you got to pull out Sarah Sanders ranked the ninth most admired woman in this country.

And you know the clip on that you just showed from MSNBC, where the hostess was talking about how we were the first hour to ban her, whatever she said. It was a competition among all of these reporters to see who could be the nastiest and the most venomous towards her, much the way they've been towards President Trump prior to that.

Tonight, liberal lawlessness is continuing to plague our major cities, rampant homelessness, needles on the streets and massive trash pileups are leading to an all-out public health crisis, especially in Los Angeles, where city officials are now accusing neighboring suburbs of dumping their own homeless on L.A. streets, escalating the already out of control crisis and unfortunately, California's soft on crime policies don't stop there, because Democrats in the Golden State are now pushing to actually let convicted felons serve on juries. And remember this, Far Left radicalism extends to every corner of the new extreme Democratic Party, including on the issue of abortion, where New York is leading the charge as city leaders are backing new efforts to provide abortion funding assistance for women who travel in from out-of- state to have the procedure. They are literally taking your taxpayer dollars and using them for abortions in New York. You can't get it done in your own state. Come to New York and the taxpayers in New York will pay for you to help get through that process. U.S. Senate candidate for Michigan John James is joining us along with Fox News Contributor Rachel Campos-Duffy. Rachel, I want to start with you. It is a tough subject, when you start talking about abortion, the idea that we're going to use taxpayer funds to do that. How does that strike?"

It will not just pay for the abortion from out of state women. It will also help them pay for transportation costs and lodging. The question is why use public funds. You can raise $250,000 in a New York minute among rich liberal Democrats in New York City. Why are they doing it? The reason is they're doing it purposefully, it's their way of getting revenge against some of the pro-life legislation and the sentiment in the country and in the science community that is favoring the pro-life movement. And it's a trend that you're not just seeing in New York. I have a daughter in college, she attends University of Chicago, they just voted in their student government to use the tuition money that my husband and I paid towards my daughter's school towards an emergency fund that will now also pay for abortions from college students. So, this is a liberal trend. It's a revenge to force people who oppose abortions to actually be complicit in it."

John James, a candidate for the Senate in Michigan. Thank you for joining us. Rachel, thank you. We'll be right back with tonight's Villain of the Day as this special edition of Hannity continues."

      "utterance": "Welcome back to this special edition of Hannity, Trump versus the Left. Tonight's Villain of the Day is Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. We all recognize that President Trump has many opponents at home, but it appears that he may have true enemies gathering abroad. Recent reports suggest that Iran may be behind the alarming tanker attack. Trace Gallagher is with us to give us the latest. Trace."

      "utterance": "And Jason experts in foreign and Middle Eastern policy widely acknowledged that the video released by the Pentagon showing what appears to be an Iranian fast boat removing an unexploded mine from near one of the damaged tankers is very compelling evidence that Iran was in fact behind the attacks. And here's what the President said today on Fox and Friends. Watch."

      "speaker": "TRUMP",
      "utterance": "Well, Iran did do it and you know they did it because you saw the vote. I guess one of the mines didn't explode and it's probably got essentially Iran written all over it."

      "speaker": "GALLAGHER",
      "utterance": "The President would not say how or if he plans to respond to Iran's latest provocation. But the White House confirms that Mr. Trump did speak to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe today to thank him for \"facilitating communication with Iran\", an indication that the President is still willing to negotiate. Prime Minister Abe was in Tehran when the tankers were attacked and one of them is owned by Japan. The U.S. has also talked about possible military escorts for vessels transporting oil through the very vital Strait of Hormuz waterway. Jason."

      "utterance": "Thanks, Trace. And thanks so much for joining us tonight ahead of this Father's Day weekend. Also, a birthday shouts out to the President of the United States Donald J. Trump who turns 73 today. And if that isn't enough to make you feel patriotic, it's also the Army's birthday today. It was founded 244 years ago in 1775. And to top it all off, it's officially Flag Day. So, be sure to fly old glory high and proud. We hope you enjoyed this great American weekend.
