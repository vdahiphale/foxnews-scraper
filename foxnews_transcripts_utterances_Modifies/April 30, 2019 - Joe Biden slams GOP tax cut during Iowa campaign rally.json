We will talk to Florida Republican Senator Rick Scott, who says maybe it's time for the U.S. military to get involved. We will talk to others who say, not so fast.  Welcome, everyone.

I'm hopeful that we will have a change in leadership today, Juan Guaido will be recognized inside Venezuela as the leader, like he is worldwide right now. I hope Russia and China understand they are supporting a murderer, a thug, somebody that's committing genocide against poor little children. That's exactly what -- that's what -- when President Putin and President Xi, what they're doing right now is they're supporting somebody that is killing little children.

Let me tell you a couple of facts. Fact one, in January of this year, Putin deployed 400 members of a private military firm called the Wagner Group, same organization that we killed 200 of in Syria, and they have been involved in Crimea and also in Eastern Ukraine. For what purpose? To provide personal security to Maduro. Last month, 100 of his advisers -- now, these are officers and technicians -- came into Venezuela. For what purpose? To provide advice for the security of the regime.  That means Putin has a direct link into what is happening every single day in Venezuela, and likely pulling leverages himself. And, of course, we all know there are 20,000 to 25,000 Cuban goons here who are the paramilitary force that are opposing the people, not the military. I think we have got to let this play out. I think the administration clearly doesn't know all the facts in a volatile situation like this. But, clearly, also, Neil, the strategic stakes are high here. We have made a decision to push back on the authoritarian and communist regimes of Venezuela, socialist regime, Nicaragua, communist, Cuba, communist, change their strategic framework. Russia, China and Iran are supporting them. Russia has intervened to prop up the Maduro regime, similar to the way they did to prop up the Assad regime. If this regime doesn't fall, Russia comes out with leverage. And the fact is, the United States' influence in a region would likely be diminished, as it was in Syria when we didn't take the proper action to do something about the regime there. But we have more time here before we rush in with military force. And those who want to use military force, you have to remember one thing. It never usually ends the way it starts. There are some rare exceptions to that. And these things have a tendency to seek its own level.  So we have to act in concert with our allies in the region, and where they are in all of this. And I'm confident the administration is talking to them.  One day...",

Real quickly, what's at heart here is the generals and the high-ranking military leaders are so far with Maduro. Lower-ranking soldiers, who don't have the same access to the food and then some of the other benefits that these generals enjoy, they have sworn that they wouldn't shoot protesters or shoot their own people. The generals have not made such a commitment. Be that as it may, this is a test of wills here on the part of the military itself, divided among the top ranks still loyal, maybe out of fear, maybe out of a host of other monetary reasons, to stay with Maduro, and the lower-ranking soldiers who are saying, we are sick of this.

Just in case you're tracking, the Dow, the Nasdaq S&P 500 finishing with strong gains, the S&P 500 up about 4 percent on the month, the Nasdaq leading the way with a surge of about 5 percent. Earnings, by the way, have been driving a lot of this. They have been coming in better than expected, 77 percent beating estimates, only 18 percent missing, about 5 percent matching. More than half have beaten the revenue estimates, the forward guidance that shows momentum, and that's something we follow very, very closely.

They didn't break from Maduro, though, and that has complicated this protest that has oftentimes turned violent today, with soldiers turning tear gas and sometimes shooting at those protesters. Now, the soldiers are apparently in a bit of a conundrum of their own, because they don't want to shoot on their fellow Venezuelans. And that divides the high-ranking generals and top colonels with the rest of the so- called rank and file in the military, who don't enjoy the same benefits and economic securities and access to food and medicines that their high- ranking officers do. So that is the problem there. And that could complicate things for Juan Guaido, who has asked for international support. And even though he has overwhelming international sympathetic support, and even though he has Governor Rick Scott of Florida among those advocating a U.S. military role here to help him out and to help him seize that presidential palace to which he was, according to Senator Scott, duly elected, but right now it goes on and on and on.

I have been talking about that since I first ran for Congress in 1992. We can put together an infrastructure bank that will allow us to pay for these big-ticket items, amortize them over a period of 10, 15, 20 years, and do it the same way we do it for our mortgages when we buy homes.

It was stunning in his revelation and the fact that he was talking publicly to high government Venezuelan officials, who after weeks and months of coordination, had determined that, on this day, they were going to step up and turn against the Maduro regime, none other than the defense minister, chief justice of the Supreme Court, and the guy in charge of the regime guard force.

      "utterance": "Well, you heard Ambassador Bolton say it's likely out of fear that they didn't, or they are fundamentally prohibited from doing it. Now, why would they be prohibited? Let me tell you a couple of facts. Fact one, in January of this year, Putin deployed 400 members of a private military firm called the Wagner Group, same organization that we killed 200 of in Syria, and they have been involved in Crimea and also in Eastern Ukraine. For what purpose? To provide personal security to Maduro. Last month, 100 of his advisers -- now, these are officers and technicians -- came into Venezuela. For what purpose? To provide advice for the security of the regime. That means Putin has a direct link into what is happening every single day in Venezuela, and likely pulling leverages himself. And, of course, we all know there are 20,000 to 25,000 Cuban goons here who are the paramilitary force that are opposing the people, not the military. I think we have got to let this play out. I think the administration clearly doesn't know all the facts in a volatile situation like this. But, clearly, also, Neil, the strategic stakes are high here. We have made a decision to push back on the authoritarian and communist regimes of Venezuela, socialist regime, Nicaragua, communist, Cuba, communist, change their strategic framework. Russia, China and Iran are supporting them. Russia has intervened to prop up the Maduro regime, similar to the way they did to prop up the Assad regime. If this regime doesn't fall, Russia comes out with leverage. And the fact is, the United States' influence in a region would likely be diminished, as it was in Syria when we didn't take the proper action to do something about the regime there. But we have more time here before we rush in with military force. And those who want to use military force, you have to remember one thing. It never usually ends the way it starts. There are some rare exceptions to that. And these things have a tendency to seek its own level. So we have to act in concert with our allies in the region, and where they are in all of this. And I'm confident the administration is talking to them. One day..."

Real quickly, what's at heart here is the generals and the high-ranking military leaders are so far with Maduro. Lower-ranking soldiers, who don't have the same access to the food and then some of the other benefits that these generals enjoy, they have sworn that they wouldn't shoot protesters or shoot their own people. The generals have not made such a commitment. Be that as it may, this is a test of wills here on the part of the military itself, divided among the top ranks still loyal, maybe out of fear, maybe out of a host of other monetary reasons, to stay with Maduro, and the lower-ranking soldiers who are saying, we are sick of this. We shall see. If this was rattling the markets, it had a funny way of showing it in Latin America and an even funnier way of showing it at the corner of Wall and Broad that capped another good month for the major markets, the Dow finishing higher today, the S&P 500 closing at an all-time high. Just in case you're tracking, the Dow, the Nasdaq S&P 500 finishing with strong gains, the S&P 500 up about 4 percent on the month, the Nasdaq leading the way with a surge of about 5 percent. Earnings, by the way, have been driving a lot of this. They have been coming in better than expected, 77 percent beating estimates, only 18 percent missing, about 5 percent matching. More than half have beaten the revenue estimates, the forward guidance that shows momentum, and that's something we follow very, very closely. In other words, what these guys are saying is, the good times should continue. We shall see. Meanwhile, forget Thursday's hearing, a fierce clash already erupting between the House Judiciary chairman, Jerry Nadler, and the attorney general of the United States over the format of a hearing, if it ever comes to happen -- after this."

So the way that you show impeachment without really doing impeachment is, you have staff ask questions. Now, I'm not sure why the Democrats believe the staff can ask better questions than their members. The chairman doesn't seem to have a lot of confidence in his membership. But I believe that their members are fully capable of answering (sic) questions. But what they want is the visual. They want the visual of a staff attorney asking the attorney general questions, like they did in the Clinton impeachment and the Nixon impeachment hearings. And they say there's precedent for this.

All they have an agenda is, is trying to defeat the president next year. And this is just the sad game of this. Tomorrow, the Senate is going to have Bill Barr appear and answer any questions they ask. Unfortunately, our side in the House, the Democrats have decided to make a game show of it.

I think those are the questions that need to be asked. Real oversight always needs to happen. But when you're overreaching, and you're going past the things that you don't already have or already will know, then that's a problem that needs to be addressed. And I think the president is simply fighting back. And we will see where it goes with that.

They didn't break from Maduro, though, and that has complicated this protest that has oftentimes turned violent today, with soldiers turning tear gas and sometimes shooting at those protesters. Now, the soldiers are apparently in a bit of a conundrum of their own, because they don't want to shoot on their fellow Venezuelans. And that divides the high-ranking generals and top colonels with the rest of the so- called rank and file in the military, who don't enjoy the same benefits and economic securities and access to food and medicines that their high- ranking officers do. So that is the problem there. And that could complicate things for Juan Guaido, who has asked for international support. And even though he has overwhelming international sympathetic support, and even though he has Governor Rick Scott of Florida among those advocating a U.S. military role here to help him out and to help him seize that presidential palace to which he was, according to Senator Scott, duly elected, but right now it goes on and on and on.

We ought to start spending that money to deepen these harbors and repair the ports around the country. Then I think we got to look at broadband deployment.

Every time I look around, we're talking about we're going to have an infrastructure bill, we are going to have a transportation bill, we are going to raise the gasoline tax to do so. Then we put together this big public transit stuff and spend all the money on subways. I don't know what my farming community down in Jasper County or Hampton County paying for people to ride subways. If they are going to pay for infrastructure that will bring broadband to their schools and their hospitals and their homes, then they may not mind paying a gasoline tax. But we got to see whether or not these communities are going to benefit from the pay-for, or we ought not do it at all. I'm a big proponent of an infrastructure bank. I have been talking about that since I first ran for Congress in 1992. We can put together an infrastructure bank that will allow us to pay for these big-ticket items, amortize them over a period of 10, 15, 20 years, and do it the same way we do it for our mortgages when we buy homes. So I think this can be done. And I would hope that we won't just rush to crushing low-income people, rural communities, in order to make things comfortable for those of us who live elsewhere."

So, all of those things together show the American people that President Trump's policies have worked. Deregulation, better trade deals and cutting taxes have created a much better economy. And we get to contrast that with the Biden-Obama economy, where wages were stagnant, where our GDP was minuscule, and jobs were fleeing our country.

    },

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "When is that going to happen? Because I don't see it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCDANIEL",
      "utterance": "I'm not a policy-maker, but I will say this. We want to make sure that the doctor-patient relationship is restored. We do not want bureaucrats in Washington making medical decisions for families across this country."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "No, Ronna, I understand it. Those are meritorious goals. But if you're going to criticize your predecessor and say that his plan sucked or whatever you're saying, and you don't have a plan, and you don't have a plan to..."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "But you don't have a plan to substitute it, and you're always slapping him around."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCDANIEL",
      "utterance": "No. Let me take -- let's go back. We had Graham-Cassidy. Democrats didn't vote it, where you block-grant the money back to the states. You have the states craft plans specific to their uninsured. It restores the doctor-patient relationship. And it's much better for the health care system and provides better care for the patient. Absolutely we put a plan forward. Democrats at every step have rejected Republicans' plan. So, you can't put that on us."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "So, when the president was saying that we're going to have a health care plan put forward and Republicans are looking forward, and Republicans were surprised that he was talking that up at a time that's an issue that could be very vulnerable on, are you saying that we're going to have a health care plan out like really, really soon? Because you don't right now."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCDANIEL",
      "utterance": "I'm not -- I'm not crafting the plan. But I will say, we're going to contrast with the Democrats what Medicare for all means, which sounds great, great, Medicare for all. What does it mean? A total government takeover. It means bureaucrats in Washington are going to be making your Medicare decisions. And the cost will be astronomical. And it will destroy the absolute -- the underlying health care in this country."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCDANIEL",
      "utterance": "So, yes, we're going to contrast that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Finally, last question then on deficits. The president keeps mentioning them and that President Obama kept building up debt and all the like. He is running it up at a faster pace. I'm not saying he exclusively, obviously, but does he feel bad about that or that he's not been able, and that is, Republicans, when they had the run of the table, have not been able to deal with that? Because Republicans are attacking Democrats for being spendthrifts, when, in fact, at the rate we're going, this president's going to top that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCDANIEL",
      "utterance": "Well, let's remember the Democrats control the House, and we never had a full majority in the Senate and 60 votes to pass budgets. So we had to work with Democrats. And that's the way that this government has functioned. But, absolutely, the president is fiscally conscious. And he's recognized that we need to grow this economy if we're going to pay off our debt."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "He was furious at a budget that the House foisted on him that had -- was over a trillion dollars, that would later contribute to trillion- dollar deficits, but he signed off on it, right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCDANIEL",
      "utterance": "Because the president recognizes we have to pay for our defense, and we have other things we have to get done. And the only way he can do that is with Democrat votes. So I think Democrats need to be more fiscally responsible as well."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "And what about Republicans?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCDANIEL",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCDANIEL",
      "utterance": "Yes, we have, because we have grown this economy, Neil, and that's taking care of it too. By growing up economy, by growing the GDP, we are dealing with deficit and debt problems."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, because I just see trillion-dollar deficits for years to come, but maybe you're looking at different numbers, right? OK, Ronna, thank you very, very much. Apple is soaring after the bell, maybe to Ronna's point, with better-than- expected earnings and revenues. We will have more after this."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, the debt is a problem. I'm obsessed with it because I think, under Republicans and Democrats, it just gets bigger and bigger. I'm not the only one. The former Microsoft CEO, the current L.A. Clippers owner and the founder of USAFacts, Steve Ballmer, with us. Steve, it doesn't come close to getting solved, no matter who's in charge. And it worries me a lot. What about you?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STEVE BALLMER, USAFACTS FOUNDER",
      "utterance": "It worries me a lot too. When we set out to build this USAFacts product, we wanted to present the numbers, but I will cop to the fact that, as a former businessmen, a current businessmen, it just doesn't make sense to me how, long term, expenses can exceed revenue. And this year, last reported year, last year, we were up to almost $750 billion of debt -- deficit, rather, per year. That's a big number, Neil. That's a big number, even by government standards. CAVUTO: And it's not sustainable, right? I mean, for companies, of course, you keep going that route, well, you're not around very long. But I know you just try to put it in English and in terms people can understand of where the money's going and where it's not going. But all I do know is that the red gets deeper and deeper and deeper, and I don't see willingness on the part of either party to address that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BALLMER",
      "utterance": "No, I agree with that. No matter whatever your politics, if this is the issue for you, both the D's and the R's have found ways to increase deficit. And I think it -- to me, it's a very important issue. There are other also very important issues. But the way this one will get solved will take real deep collaboration both on how to improve taxes and revenue and how to manage expenses. I don't see any other way there. But, again, our organization, USAFacts, we don't make forecasts."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BALLMER",
      "utterance": "But if you look at the historical data, it is alarming. And if you look at where we spend money as a country, 86 percent of government money goes into just eight areas, just eight areas. Education, most people don't want to cut. Crime in and disaster, most people don't want to cut. The military, we have cut the number of active war fighters by about 35 percent in the last 15 years, which some people may want to cut further. We spend on Social Security. We spend on Medicare, where there's generally been resistance. We spend on Medicaid and aid to the disadvantaged, and we spend on government pensions and debt. That's 86 percent. You throw in transportation, you're at 90 percent. And you say, where do people have the will to make cuts? And where do people have the will to increase taxes? We also run through in our report just how much of the tax burden is borne by the top 1 percent, by income, the top 20 and so on down to the bottom 20 percent. You just have to look and say, where are we going to get any more money and where are we going to cut expenses? And it will take a set of hard decisions. If you ground the discussion in the numbers, which we try to give you the basis for that with our USAFacts offerings -- today, we're releasing our annual report, trying to make it simple to understand spend in America. For people who are more business-oriented, we got this big old fat 10K, like businesses produce?"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, the violence continuing, although I must say contained violence. The worst suspicions have not materialized yet, but it is still a mess down there, two men competing for the honor of being recognized as the country's president. The guy holed up in the president's palace right now, Nicolas Maduro, he isn't going anywhere. Juan Guaido, the guy that says he's the duly elected, and recognized by most of the world as the duly elected constitutional president, he's nowhere closer to seeing that dream fulfilled. Former Assistant Secretary of State Robert Charles on all of this. Secretary, We Had Senator Rick Scott here earlier saying American military needs to come to the rescue here. How do you feel about that?"

This is not a coup. This is not a putsch. This is the result of people being absolutely distressed by the fact that they can't make a living, they can't feed themselves or their children. In terms of who's down there and what to do next, you have foreign actors down there. We have Russian advisers down there. That's very problematic. We have Chinese in there. And we also have Iranians in there, all of which says that others are trying to get a foothold here to create essentially Cuba version two. And we're not going to let that happen. To the point of military, what we know is that our allies are well aware that we are prepared to support them and they are prepared to support us. We know, I think -- the foreign actors down there and Maduro need to know that our intelligence is very good. We have -- I have no doubt that we know exactly where the senior generals are and where he is. And if this thing were to get out of control, and there would be a massacre of some kind, I think we would respond as a humanitarian act, even if that involved military personnel."

We have contingency plans, I am sure, for the lowest-level engagement to the highest-level engagement. And my guess is, we have had very close conversations with our allies. One thing that just to remember is, this is economy -- an economy in freefall, 1,300,000 percent inflation."
