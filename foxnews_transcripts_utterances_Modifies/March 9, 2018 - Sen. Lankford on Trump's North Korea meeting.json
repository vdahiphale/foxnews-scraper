The difficult thing is what you just laid out for the North Korean people. And that's been the big issue for a long time, is not only the North Korean regime's threats towards their neighbors, including us, but it's also been their oppression of their own people. Their own people have suffered greatly from the sanctions, and so has the regime itself. So, the grief here is for the people of North Korea, who are extremely limited in information, extremely poor, very little electricity, very little access to the outside world at all.   That changes if Kim Jong-un decides he's going to back away from his nuclear ambition. So, the best thing for the people for North Korea is for their leadership to stop trying to threaten the rest of the world, but to be able to get in step. They could have better food. They could have more electricity. They could have better medicine. They could have all of those things if they actually engaged with the rest of the world, rather than threatening the rest of the world.",
