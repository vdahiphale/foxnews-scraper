And this is “The Five.” Democrats could be setting themselves up for a serious case of impeachment buyer's remorse. Remember, they promised us a bombshell testimony from their star witnesses yesterday, but Adam Schiff's spectacle failed to deliver. That dud could now prove to be a very costly mistake for Nancy Pelosi and her Democratic pals.  Of course, the liberal media is coming to the rescue. Check them out trying to reset the narrative by spinning what happened at the hearing.",

They have the divide is not about not liking Donald Trump.

You wanted us to do it.  And you know, I read a ton of news this morning, a run from the farthest left to the all the way into the middle to the middle to the farthest right.

Is he going to continue down this road inevitably of wanting to bring articles of impeachment on the floor for a vote? Because at this point, you kind of has to. He's made all these claims about how serious this is, how it's a threat to the country. Of course, that's what they would have to do to maintain his own credibility and his own ego, because he is leading the charge on this. Or, are they going to now shift the goal post and make different accusations? So, with Russia was there's all this collusion. And then when they couldn't prove collusion they move to obstruction.

Everyone is like, yes, Joe. Sure. But Deval Patrick, look, you know, there's always more room in the stage at this point. His time to file. He's an interesting candidate. His background is different than other people on the stage. He's a capitalist. He is a minority. He allegedly and reportedly has the blessing of Barack Obama, which will help him only I think behind the scenes with some fund-raising numbers, but also going into the primary process and if he wins the general -- or the primary. So, look, I read the comments on the Twitter announcement that he made through the video and they were not good. People were really mad about it's too late. Everyone else has done all of the work. There is not enough room for you. Get out. You are an evil hedge fund guy, financial guy. But I think, you know, he has good proximity with New Hampshire. He has a lot of work to make up in terms of going to Iowa, as Andrew Yang was saying, knocking on doors, getting people to vote for him. But maybe he's not banking on Iowa just like Joe Biden."

I mean it's just unbelievable. Of course, if you look at like Westerns you know you look at some of our westerns, American, Native Americans, they're savages, there to be slaughtered.
