And you just heard President Trump express his concern over that Ninth Circuit Court ruling against his asylum ban. Maybe we will hear more on that. When it happens, we are there.  The closing bell ringing just moments ago, closing out another brutal session for Wall Street, the Dow plunging more than 600 points, finishing down 553 points.  Tech stocks remain under pressure, Apple taking another big hit. The Dow is now in the red for 2018.  Welcome, everyone. I'm Charles Payne, in for Neil Cavuto, and this is \"Your World.\" FBN's Susan Li on what's got this market all riled up, or riled down -- Susan.",

      "sentences": "Good to see you, Charles.   Yes, so markets wiping up their gains for 2018. Oil prices saw their biggest single-day loss in three years. And this is on the back of trade concerns, but also exacerbated by the president's statements on Saudi Arabia today. Energy stocks plunging as a result. Every single oil stock that trades on the S&P 500 down in the session. And that's also, by the way, good news for drivers that are filling up their gas tanks for the Thanksgiving holiday. The national average at the pumps, $2.61. That's more than 20 cents cheaper than they were just about two months ago. Meantime, as you mentioned, the tech drag continues. And we call them the FAANGs in the trading world, Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google, parent company Alphabet, all in bear market territory.   So that's 20 percent down from their recent peaks. Now, these names have run up so much this year, that the markets are concerned future sales and profits may not actually justify these expensive valuations. That's also the case for retailers, who have had a fantastic year so far. Kohl's and Target reporting better-than-expected earnings this morning, but their stocks got hammered in a session today, and this as we head into Black Friday, which is supposed to be the biggest shopping day of the year. And Americans are expected to spend more this year than they did last year. So the concerns on the markets are threefold at this point. They're concerned about higher interest rates, ongoing trade tensions, namely with China, and slowing corporate earnings. And that's why Wall Street giant Goldman Sachs is only forecasting 1.75 percent GDP growth next year. That's down a long way from the 3.5 percent that they forecast for this year, 2018, which would be the best year of economic growth since 2005.  Now, also, as we head into the Thanksgiving holiday, I should point out to you, Charles, that traders, they typically don't want to hold stocks in a falling market when they can't trade out of them, since we do have markets closed for the holiday.   That, along with computer-driven trading environments, the algorithmic world that we live in, means that we're expecting it and we should get used to these big moves up and down -- back to you.",

These kind of markets, selling begets selling, emotions run wild, and nothing mattered. Great earnings, I don't care, stocks going down. Great guidance, I don't care, stocks going down.

But if you look at the price action, it's all about the Fed, who, while risk assets are falling, while global concerns run apace, they are continuing on a tightening path. And that has spooked markets. Look at the action today, Charles. Fed fund futures, if this was truly recessionary, yields would be down. They were actually up there. And we would see outperformance in the belly of the curve. That didn't occur. What happened today was Fed fund futures actually -- the yields actually went up ever so slightly, and we saw a small outperformance the long end of the curve. To me, it's all about the Fed, and we will see a lot more of that next week with regard to FOMC minutes and Powell speaking to see if we can calm this market down.",

Just a small travel concern, as we look at a pretty major system that's going to be running into the West Coast, causing a couple of delays, but across most of the country, still looking at very clear conditions. Unfortunately, though, there is going to be some cold air, especially in parts of the Midwest, the Upper Midwest, and then stretching over towards New England, getting down at freezing, but some spots falling down to zero degrees. We're going to be talking about record-breaking low temperature. So these are Wednesday highs. And you see some of that cold air lingering back across the Upper Midwest as temperatures get down close to freezing. That is all going to be funneling here towards New England, 42 degrees for tomorrow in New York City. But look how those numbers drop for Thursday on Thanksgiving. Spots -- these are daytime highs, 27 degrees in New York City, getting upstate, spots getting down into closer to 20 degrees. With the windchill, it will feel even colder than that. It does begin to rebound a little bit for us on Friday. But it is going to be cold, cold, cold for folks across these regions on Thursday, on Thanksgiving. This is looking at Central Park. These are record-breaking lows. The coldest we have ever seen, 27 degrees for a daytime high on Thanksgiving. That is the forecast for folks on Thursday. So it is going to me right near there. If you wanted to watch the parade or be out at the parade, folks who wanted to do that, temperatures looking at 23 degrees at 10:00 a.m., and then with the windchill feeling like 10 to 20 degrees. And then notice the northwest winds, 20 to 35 miles an hour. Charles, you get wind gusts up to 30 miles an hour, and they might not take out those balloons.

And this is on the back of trade concerns, but also exacerbated by the president's statements on Saudi Arabia today. Energy stocks plunging as a result. Every single oil stock that trades on the S&P 500 down in the session. And that's also, by the way, good news for drivers that are filling up their gas tanks for the Thanksgiving holiday. The national average at the pumps, $2.61. That's more than 20 cents cheaper than they were just about two months ago. Meantime, as you mentioned, the tech drag continues. And we call them the FAANGs in the trading world, Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google, parent company Alphabet, all in bear market territory. So that's 20 percent down from their recent peaks. Now, these names have run up so much this year, that the markets are concerned future sales and profits may not actually justify these expensive valuations. That's also the case for retailers, who have had a fantastic year so far. Kohl's and Target reporting better-than-expected earnings this morning, but their stocks got hammered in a session today, and this as we head into Black Friday, which is supposed to be the biggest shopping day of the year. And Americans are expected to spend more this year than they did last year. So the concerns on the markets are threefold at this point. They're concerned about higher interest rates, ongoing trade tensions, namely with China, and slowing corporate earnings. And that's why Wall Street giant Goldman Sachs is only forecasting 1.75 percent GDP growth next year. That's down a long way from the 3.5 percent that they forecast for this year, 2018, which would be the best year of economic growth since 2005. Now, also, as we head into the Thanksgiving holiday, I should point out to you, Charles, that traders, they typically don't want to hold stocks in a falling market when they can't trade out of them, since we do have markets closed for the holiday.

And that has spooked markets. Look at the action today, Charles. Fed fund futures, if this was truly recessionary, yields would be down. They were actually up there. And we would see outperformance in the belly of the curve. That didn't occur. What happened today was Fed fund futures actually -- the yields actually went up ever so slightly, and we saw a small outperformance the long end of the curve.

They are creating havoc in people. People are saying, get out now, or you will regret it. And, honestly, when I look at the market, we are still holding an uptrend. And there are some people out there saying we're in a bearish trend. That's not true. The market, technically speaking, is still holding the uptrend. And unless the Dow gets down in the pre-market and opens under 23000, and breaks it and falls off the cliff, we are holding the uptrend.

What we have is 1,750 people a day crossing our border illegally, huge numbers of families, unaccompanied children, many of whom are claiming asylum. That's not a victimless crime. They're paying smugglers. They're putting themselves at risk. They're putting our Border Patrol agents at risk that have to apprehend them. So what the president's trying to do is take away that opportunity to claim asylum after an illegal entry and force them to go to a port of entry and go through a lawful process."

This is the gap in those people that initially make a fear claim who are found, almost 85 to 90 percent of the time, to pass that initial bar, which is a very low bar, but then ultimately, when they see an immigration judge, at the end of the process, only about 10 to 20 percent are actually getting asylum. So we have got a situation where thousands of people are coming across the border each month and going to be here for years on end before they wait to see an immigration judge. And that's the gap that the president is trying to close down with his declaration."

I mean, we have made recommendations to Congress throughout this administration to tighten these -- these laws, so that people would present at ports of entry and would have a much more realistic sense of whether their asylum claim would be granted at the end of the process. We need help from Congress to do that. But we're not laying back here. We're pushing forward. We're deploying all available resources to secure that border between ports of entry. We're ready for the arrival, which is now present here in Tijuana, just south of San Diego, over 6,000 members of the so-called caravans heading to our border.

I was just down in McAllen, Texas, last Thursday with a group of Army personnel deployed, engineers, doctors, military police, professionals that are helping us harden the border, protect our ports of entry, and be prepared for really any contingencies that we might face. On Friday, I was in San Diego with U.S. Marines out of Camp Pendleton. They're doing the same thing at the largest port of entry in North America, San Ysidro, which is just north of Tijuana, where this group of caravan members are waiting. So, we really appreciate their assistance. Definitely mindful of being away from families over the holidays. Their service is just incredibly valued, right alongside the men and women of the CBP, our U.S. Border Patrol agents and CBP officers. We surged over 1,000 to the border to be ready for this situation, on top of the 20,000 men and women that protect our southern border every day."

And we have seen them cross two international borders by force already. They have assaulted law enforcement professionals both in Guatemala and Mexico. And so we have seen them be willing to use very aggressive tactics. And so we have got to be prepared for that. So the worst-case contingency would be thousands of people trying to force their way through vehicle lanes at a port of entry unlawfully into the U.S. And that's what we're prepared to stop."

But what the military is going to do is help us harden that border, to put barriers in place in the case of a large group heading toward the line at any given time, and also potentially be there to protect infrastructure and personnel in the case of an emergency."

Because, right now, it's sort of, hey, just come, get in and, many people believe, to your point, abuse the system.

And you're looking at green lights across the country for folks who are traveling here on Tuesday. Some may be taking off on Wednesday. Just a small travel concern, as we look at a pretty major system that's going to be running into the West Coast, causing a couple of delays, but across most of the country, still looking at very clear conditions. Unfortunately, though, there is going to be some cold air, especially in parts of the Midwest, the Upper Midwest, and then stretching over towards New England, getting down at freezing, but some spots falling down to zero degrees. We're going to be talking about record-breaking low temperature. So these are Wednesday highs. And you see some of that cold air lingering back across the Upper Midwest as temperatures get down close to freezing. That is all going to be funneling here towards New England, 42 degrees for tomorrow in New York City. But look how those numbers drop for Thursday on Thanksgiving. Spots -- these are daytime highs, 27 degrees in New York City, getting upstate, spots getting down into closer to 20 degrees. With the windchill, it will feel even colder than that. It does begin to rebound a little bit for us on Friday. But it is going to be cold, cold, cold for folks across these regions on Thursday, on Thanksgiving. This is looking at Central Park. These are record-breaking lows. The coldest we have ever seen, 27 degrees for a daytime high on Thanksgiving. That is the forecast for folks on Thursday. So it is going to me right near there. If you wanted to watch the parade or be out at the parade, folks who wanted to do that, temperatures looking at 23 degrees at 10:00 a.m., and then with the windchill feeling like 10 to 20 degrees. And then notice the northwest winds, 20 to 35 miles an hour. Charles, you get wind gusts up to 30 miles an hour, and they might not take out those balloons.

Should these stores be open on Thanksgiving or should the employees be with their families, even those shoppers too? But retailers say that this is what the shoppers want.

With more that, we have got Democratic strategist Antjuan Seawright, Trump 2020 advisory board member Harlan Hill, and The Daily Caller's Vince Coglianese. Vince, let me start with you on this thing. Listen, the market now down, the Dow Jones industrial average down over four points -- 4 percent, rather, since the midterms. And the day after, it was OK. It was up. But since then, it feels like the Dems are going to war.

We saw during the Kavanaugh hearing the idea of the politics of personal destruction, where the American public kind of recoiled and it energized Republicans.

I think Democrats have a responsibility to put forth a policy agenda or policy prescription that will not only get them to the majority, like they have in House, but also maintaining the majority.

And as we understood both from the intelligence community and the president, it's still a process. We don't have a determinant -- determined element in it. But, on the other hand, we have a political assessment. And the political assessment is what the president has just said. This alliance, strategic alliance, between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia is not just bilateral. It has to be with Iran. Our entire sanction system is based on it."

He says, at the very least, Saudi Arabia shouldn't be rewarded with sophisticated armaments that they in turn use the bomb civilians. Rand Paul acknowledging that he has a very good relationship with President Trump, but goes on to say he thinks that this statement that was released from the White House should read Saudi Arabia first and that he's pretty sure John Bolton wrote it.

I want to bring in Ifrah Law partner, former Department of Justice prosecutor Jim Trusty. Jim, this is sort of the moment we have all been waiting for, and it feels like maybe this could sort of expedite us to some sort of resolution here. What do you make of the fact that President Trump has finally submitted these answers? It didn't take long. He said he would do it. Where does this take us?"

And it's really, I think, a victory for the White House, in that he's been called a subject, not a target. That's a very important distinction that his lawyers have talked to him about ad nauseum. And to have a situation where you have a take-home test, where the homework comes to you and you sit down and you fill it out with some level of assistance from your attorneys, that's a good moment for him. And I also think the probe probably doesn't expect that there's going to be heart-ringing confessions coming back on the paper that they get from the president. So it smells a little bit more like checking a box before we get to the conclusion of the probe."

This is a from Rudy Giuliani, also a counsel to President Trump. \"It has been our position from the outset that much of what has been asked raised serious constitutional issues and was beyond the scope of legitimate inquiry. This remains our position today. The president has nevertheless, nonetheless provided unprecedented cooperation. The special counsel has been provided with more than 30 witnesses, 1.4 million pages of material, and now the president's written response to questions. It is time to bring this inquiry to a conclusion\" -- Rudy Giuliani, counsel to the president. Your thoughts?"

      "speaker": "TRUSTY",
      "utterance": "Well, that's the right approach for the president's attorney to take, which is to say, essentially, enough's enough, let's end this thing. I think it's probably heading that way, partly because of these questions, partly because of some other things that have been happening, like announcing that they're ready for Flynn's sentencing in the fairly near future. There's still some litigation going on behind closed doors, it sounds like. But I think we're talking end of the year, as opposed to end of next year. And, again, the president has every right to basically announce that he's done with his homework assignment and he's tired of seeing this thing go on. But it's probably got a little bit of a shelf life left before it finishes up."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "TRUSTY",
      "utterance": "Well, he can always try. But I have to think that it's either already been negotiated away by the president's team or that even in the most aggressive of moments that the Mueller team would realize that's just going to be a dead end. And that's really part of the win for the president here on this issue, because he can answer questions with kind of platitudes or very broad comments and know that there's not going to be any form of cross- examination or even a detailed follow-up. That's a pretty easy homework assignment in most instances."

      "speaker": "PAYNE",
      "utterance": "There have been arrests. There have been trials. There have been some indictments, but there's -- there really, from what I can see, hasn't been anything that connects sort of obstruction of justice or the White House themselves, President Trump, dealing with the Russians. You have got some Russian folks that Mueller and company are looking for that probably will never come to this country to face that justice, and some other peripheral players, if you will. So what does this tell you, if we are near this and it could happen before the -- before the end of the year?"

      "speaker": "TRUSTY",

As you pointed out earlier, before the break, the president has submitted those questions in writing to the Mueller team. Credit to our colleague John Roberts. He has been on this story with a vengeance, checking in with Rudy Giuliani throughout the process. And, as you pointed out, some very interesting responses, at least from Giuliani's perspective, about what the special counsel is actually looking for, and the lengths which they have gone to question this president of the United States. Now, as you also pointed out, though, this is a holiday week, which means it's back here to South Florida for the commander in chief. But he heads here to this beauty have a weather, but not before pardoning a couple of our fine feathered friends, as is the White House tradition. You saw it there earlier today. A lot of fun. And, quite frankly, it's good for everyone to get ready for the Thanksgiving holiday.
