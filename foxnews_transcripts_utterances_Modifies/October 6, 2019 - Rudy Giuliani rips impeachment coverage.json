But where is the media outrage over Adam Schiff lying to MSNBC about him and his team not having spoken to the whistleblower in advance when The New York Times revealed his staff did just that?   I'm Howard Kurtz and this is \"Media Buzz.\" President Trump has been denouncing the impeachment probe as a hoax, insisting he never pressured Ukraine's leader to help investigate Joe Biden in that now famous call. But talking to reporters on the White House lawn, he openly urged Ukraine to investigate the former vice president and his son, and made a similar appeal to another country.",

Are the media justified in calling Trump out of control or is he entitled to be angry with a relentlessly negative coverage surrounding the impeachment probe? How do they handle his very public declaration that Ukraine and China should investigate the Bidens? The pundits unload on Mike Pompeo as he admits he was on Trump's call with the leader of Ukraine despite what he said in an ABC interview. But where is the media outrage over Adam Schiff lying to MSNBC about him and his team not having spoken to the whistleblower in advance when The New York Times revealed his staff did just that? I'm Howard Kurtz and this is \"Media Buzz.\" President Trump has been denouncing the impeachment probe as a hoax, insisting he never pressured Ukraine's leader to help investigate Joe Biden in that now famous call. But talking to reporters on the White House lawn, he openly urged Ukraine to investigate the former vice president and his son, and made a similar appeal to another country."

Remember, we are talking now almost a year ago when I first got this. The Mueller investigation was hot and heavy. They were still going after. I still needed all the material I could get to defend my client, which by the way I should be praised for because that is what a good lawyer does. I was still worried that they were going to do some kind of collusion, nonsense, because I know how corrupt some of those people of Mueller are like Andrew Weissmann. So I had to defend my client. Ukrainians came to me. I didn't go after Joe Biden. They handed it to me. They said there is a lot of evidence of collusion in Ukraine. And by the way, one of the guys involved in getting that evidence cut off is Joe Biden. Do you know what he did? I said no, I don't know what he did. And then they showed me. They showed me the tape of the 2018 confession that he made in front of the Council on Foreign Relations, which by the way, for a Republican, the Washington press corps including you, Howie, would have gone crazy. We would have had three months of investigation to that."

CNN put out a report that the allegations against Biden are not supported by anything. Yes, they are. They are supported by three affidavits. That is a lot better than whistleblower's. Three affidavits from Ukrainian prosecutors who say Joe Biden bribed the president of the Ukraine, that he put pressure on them, that the president of Ukraine dismissed the case solely because of Biden's pressure. Now, they could be lying."

So, whether they are telling the truth or not, when CNN says there is no evidence to support it, it is a corrupt, lie. It is the same reason they have been covering it up for 10 years.

The statement is clearly from the texts their idea, not my idea. They asked me of my advice about the texts. I didn't tell them, he must, he should, he has to, he must. I said -- I gave them my advice about what would give everybody comfort, that the corrupt Ukrainian government that has been corrupt for a long time was on the right road, that it was willing to root out corruption no matter who it hurt, without fear of favor, the way our agency should be able to do but don't."

They say, how could the most corrupt oligarch in Ukraine be paying the vice president's son when the vice president has been tasked by Obama to give out money in the Ukraine?

It is about the fact that Lutsenko is now -- ran away from the Ukraine and probably paid money to the president of Ukraine in order to fix this case. The witness I am relying on, if you paid any attention to what I did last week, is someone named Viktor Shokin. That is the affidavit I put out, plus two others, Hulyok and Kaleniuk (ph). Those three all say that Joe Biden pressured the president to fire Shokin because Shokin had just come upon a laundered $3 million transaction to Hunter Biden. He was told by the by (INAUDIBLE) government that the United States government would not allow them to give that information out. That is the reason they say they were fired.

First it was this didn't happen, then it was it happened and it was perfect. Then it was the other guy did it and the other guy was worse than we were. I mean, they keep changing their argument.

These are U.S. diplomats going back and forth after the phone call. This is in September, and if we got that up on the screen. Bill Taylor, who is a veteran diplomat who has a -- previous ambassador to Ukraine and appointed by Bush says \"I think it's crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.\" Gordon Sondland, who is a political appointee donated a million dollars to the Trump inauguration says, \"Bill, I believe you are incorrect about President Trump's intentions. The president has been crystal clear no quid pro quos of any kind.\" The quid pro quo being talked about there, although Sondland says it's not happening is whether or not Ukraine would make a public statement that would include the Bidens committing to an investigation and then get a meeting with President Trump."

I think it's playing right into the president's strategy which is to allow there to be this complete consumption in one of the -- in the news cycle of the Biden Ukraine story. Which, there's been a lot of reporting and coverage on and there's a significant amount of focus on that right now. And so, I think by not coming out and facing that stuff head on and saying head on, you know, going with this line about the president attacking his family in a one on one, you know, 60 minutes or something."

But is this of Biden calculation of that of his aides that -- and by the way there has been criticism of the DNC for not being more aggressive defending Biden, that if he gets out there he is going to have to go through a whole long list of Hunter Biden and his family and Ukraine, that he doesn't want to be answering those, and that it tells the conversation toward him having to play defense?"

      "speaker": "ELLEITHEE",
      "utterance": "A lot of us get asked all the time. Is this not hurting Joe Biden? The polling so far is not bearing that out. The polling so far just in the past couple of weeks or the past week has shown that Democratic primary voters in some key states are actually rallying behind him because of how unfair the attack is. We'll see if that's sustainable but that's where we are right now."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "My point is, if Biden is on TV, he makes the story about Donald Trump and Joe Biden and that takes oxygen away from the others. So, after the break, where the impeachment looming President Trump brands the media corrupt and talks about a coup. How that war of words is unfolding, next."
    },

      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "He was talking to Jeff Mason of Reuters; the president was particularly steamed over a New York Times report based on a book by two of its journalists that Trump had privately pushed for moat at the border filled with alligators or snakes and an electrified fence with spiky tops that can sear human flesh. The president mistakenly thought that story was in the Washington Post."
    },

      "speaker": "TRUMP",
      "utterance": "Obviously, it's fake because almost everything the Washington Post does is fake. It's a fake newspaper. It's owned by a rich guy for the purpose of giving him power in Washington. I'm tough on the border but I'm not that tough. OK. It was a lie."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "So, he is denying the story, Emily, that was in the New York Times, he's calling corrupt media, he's chewing out Jeff Mason maybe the most mild-mannered reporter in Washington, a good reporter. What do you make of the ratcheting up?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JASHINSKY",
      "utterance": "Well, I think it's actually proportional to the ratcheting that the media has been doing. So, I think in that respect it's fair. I think you know, he referring to the media as corrupt. I think, sadly, if the objective of the media is cover the news of the day fairly and accurately, I think it's perfectly fair to say that they have been corrupted by other motivations especially when it comes to this president. And those motivations are political, they're ideological, they are ratings based. And so, I mean, I don't think the label is entirely unfair. I think it's sad to see another institution label is corrupt but I think in this case the bill kind of fits."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "OK. So, you endorse the corrupt language. When journalists then see, you know, that news conference, so actually two news conferences that day and they say well, he is angry, he is out of control and he's unhinged, you know, with some commentators on the right say of course he is angry, the media cranked up the Russia story for two years to 11, now doing the same with Ukraine. It's not impeachable they say. Is the coverage kind of getting one-sided?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ELLEITHEE",
      "utterance": "I think we are in extraordinary times. And I think the last time we have seen times this extraordinary in our politics was Watergate when the then sitting president came out and called the media fake every day. They weren't. They were tough, they were investigative and they were calling out abuses of power. You now have an active investigation going on."

    },

      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Let me turn to the vice president, because Mike Pence said to reporters that he knew nothing about the president's attempt to pressure Ukraine, although he deny, perhaps using the word pressure. Pence was yanked from the inaugural delegation that was sent in Ukraine for Zelensky's swearing-in, but the reason may not have been apparent and his aide was on that July 25th phone call. CNN's Brianna Keilar went on the air right after that and said this. BRIANNA KEILAR, CNN ANCHOR & CORRESPONDENT: And we all know for having covered Pence for so long that Pence is lying and that he knows that he is."

      "speaker": "JASHINSKY",
      "utterance": "Right. That's a good example to the fact that you can't -- you can't just lay out what happened. You have to make a judgment call. And that's how the media believes is their job to cover the Trump presidency when in fact they cover every other presidency well, unless it's a Republican --"

      "speaker": "JASHINSKY",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Right. It's one thing if commentators say because, you know, we're all used to that, right? On the left, he is lying, now he's lying, now Adam Schiff is lying which we'll get to. How did the media, Mo, handle the president's language. He says it's a coup. Impeachment is in the Constitution. He tweets that the Democrats are peddling B.S., he uses the whole word. He throws around treason. How can journalists be fair to this president? And he also points out coups in the Constitution and his worst detractors are not committing treason?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ELLEITHEE",
      "utterance": "Right. I mean, and this is where I think the challenge of the media covering the Trump presidency where this is very different from Nixon, this president uses rhetoric and language that is far beyond the pale and sometimes I think it is fair."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "And also, some Democrats like Beto O'Rourke."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ELLEITHEE",
      "utterance": "No, no. Sure. Now I think that sometimes it is, the role of the media to actually call it out. Right. I think back to when this president before he was president, launched his sort of political career on the back of the hoax of birtherism, Right. It was important for people to that isn't true. The facts do not bear that out."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JASHINSKY",
      "utterance": "I think you stick to your mission of being objective and you trust the American public enough to make the judgment call you don't do it yourself."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "And on that note, still to come, Adam Schiff and Mike Pompeo caught withholding the truth in TV interviews. Guess which one the press treated as a scandal."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Adam Schiff, the Democratic House chairman now leading the impeachment inquiry claimed last month on MSNBC that he and his people had no previous contact with the whistleblower in this case. The Daily Beast Sam Stein asked him the question on Morning Joe."
    },

      "speaker": "SAM STEIN, MSNBC CONTRIBUTOR",

      "speaker": "REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D-CA)",
      "utterance": "We not spoken directly with whistleblower. We would like to."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "But the New York Times reported that Schiff knew about the whistleblower days before he filed the complaint against President Trump, that one of Schiff's Democratic staffer said spoken to the CIA officer and advised him to hire a lawyer and go to the inspector general. President Trump ripped Schiff but this was barely mentioned on most cable news networks other than Fox."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST",
      "utterance": "Schiff had to now admitting that would undermine the story and hands impeachment itself."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "But wait, what about Sam Stein who ask the question, Schiff called him to say he should have been clearer. Here's what Stein tweeted. \"Schiff did appear to lie here in previously saying that his office had not spoken directly to with whistleblower. But if you care more about this stuff than the actual substance of the whistleblower complaint than you are being a hack.\" Mo, CBC, ABC didn't even cover this on the evening newscast and as for Sam Stein's tweet, I say if you only care about one side slice then you're being a hack."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ELLEITHEE",
      "utterance": "I think this is evidence of just how careful Democrats have to be. Right? Schiff said and he came back and he said yes, we spoke -- or my staff did speak with him. And the rest of that story is he -- the -- Schiff never knew who the whistleblower was, only knew the allegations generally and they followed procedure, they laid out procedure that House and Senate Democrats and Republicans use. But Schiff has to be careful, democrats have to be careful that they don't give an inch. Because as we see the president will jump all over it if there's even the slightest perception of --"

      "utterance": "-- doing anything that's not true."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "But I would argue that when the House chairman utter a falsehood on television that the media should also jump all over it. But interestingly, Emily, the New York Times broke the story prompting these rare words of praise from the president."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TRUMP",
      "utterance": "I hate to say it's the New York Times, I can't believe they wrote it, I give a lot of respect for the New York Times for putting it out."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "JASHINSKY",
      "utterance": "Yes, in this instance, although I would love to see more reporting on what Adam Schiff knew exactly. Because he says he doesn't know -- he didn't know at the time that this was the same whistleblower and all those details. I think there are a lot of questions to be asked about who told him what at that time? And I would love to see the New York Times, for instance, do some more reporting on that."

      "speaker": "KURTZ",

    {
      "speaker": "MIKE POMPEO, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE",
      "utterance": "So, you just gave me a report about a whistleblower complaint. None of which I've seen. As for was I on the phone call? I was on the phone call."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "So, Pompeo was on the phone call, he kind of fanned ignorance with a question from Martha Raddatz and this was a huge story, and much of the media branded Pompeo a liar. A little contrast there to the way that Schiff matters then."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ELLEITHEE",
      "utterance": "I mean, Pompeo flat out said, and remember, this is about being on the actual call. I think Schiff needs to be more careful on how he goes at it. But this is pretty brazen as well. And with all the hysteria you see from the right about Adam Schiff they're completely ignoring this. Pompeo was on the call and pretended not to recall it. That should get as much scrutiny from the media on the right."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "He didn't -- he wasn't asked directly were you on the call. But so, I say, you know, cover top officials in both parties when they lie, dissemble, mislead, is there a double standard here as evidenced here by these episodes?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JASHINSKY",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. You can put this in a textbook. I think this is a very, very instructive parallel here because it's exactly -- they were just doing this commonplace partisan evasion. And if you are going to spent weeks hammering Pompeo when Schiff, and I would argue there are greater implications to Schiff's evasion, the cover -- the disparity in the coverage was glaring. Glaring. I mean, really you could put this in a textbook about the double standard. It is that bad."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "And that's the accusation against the press here, which is that there is a double standard that, look, impeachment is a big story, 225 House Democrats have come out for the inquiry. It's more than the majority, it need to impeach, it's a huge story and the allegations are serious but there is a perception -- I got half a minute here -- that the media have been waiting for this and waiting for this and now they're piling on a president they don't like."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ELLEITHEE",
      "utterance": "I think when you've got an impeachment inquiry where the president has publicly admitted to doing the things the whistleblower said he did, that's a legitimate story and that's a story that the press needs to jump on."

      "speaker": "JASHINSKY",
