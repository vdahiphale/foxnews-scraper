So, they rejected their Syrian nationalism which has failed and has now - continues to prove to be one of the worst tyrannies in the world, to come to embrace an Islam that was their own making, their own practice. So Sharia is the Islamic jurisprudence that is the laws that have evolved from 7th Century Islam.   So, I would be deceptive or lying to you if I said Sharia was compatible with American law. My Sharia is the Islam of American patriots that I know that are Muslims that reject political Islam is, but the Sharia of Saudi Arabia, of the Pakistani Islamic law, of Egyptian law, of the Muslim brotherhood, of Hamas, those Sharia theocracies are incompatible with American law. So ultimately, now, as we are finishing up the holiest month of Ramadan, we just finished, it it's our holiday this weekend. My personal Sharia tells me how to pray, how to fast, how to follow my personal pietistic laws, but then there is Sharia that gets involved in criminal law, that gets involved in prohibiting siege.",

Islam is in that time in its history right now. We're basically in the 16th, 17th Century of what Christendom was in at that time. And right now, as it is quiet, as you said, the Muslim world is not quiet, the Iranian people are revolting in the streets in the thousands against their theocracy. My family in Damascus and Aleppo are dodging chemical weapons and helicopter gunships and a genocide from the Syrians from Hezbollah, from Iran, from Russia.  The Muslim Brotherhood is growing. ISIS may have been decimated in Syria, but Jihadism, global Salafi Jihadism, which is this ideology of anti- westernism, of theocracy, is growing faster than it ever has.",

I think we've seen like our organization and our Muslim Reform Movement leaders have shifting the needle, where after 9/11, no one would talk about Islamism and Islamists and now, we are starting to see a conversation where we recognize that it's not just terrorism. I mean, I am a doctor, as you said, and I treat disease, I don't treat symptoms, and the disease of what we're facing is not just terrorism. That's a symptom. That's a whack-a-mole program.  The disease is political Islam - Sharia states. The concept that our identity as Muslims is wedded to a national identity of Islamic governance. There may be many Muslims in America that are here that reject sort of secular society.   So the American media, and I think especially on the left now, if you get away from their 95% Trump derangement syndrome where they are focused too much on completely ignoring the global issues that are continuing to evolve. The rest, because of the influence of foreign governments, Islamic states and their funding of think tanks, especially on the left, the Clinton Foundation and their money from Qatar and the Saudis and others and we see also this problem on the right, we are unable to have an honest conversation about the influence of Islamics' movements and Sharia-type movements in our country and the influence on changing the narratives.

John Locke, the enlightenment, religions most have gone through this reformation period, so there isn't this, a conflict between the enlightenment and people of faith and religion.  You're saying not so with a lot of the Muslim world. In the United States, we have this First Amendment. It's really quite brilliant. The free exercise of religion, but no establishment of religion. And it was based on like much of the Constitution, Judeo-Christian concepts, but not just that.  Aristotle. Cicero - Cicero wasn't a Christian, per se, I mean, it was the Romans who killed Christ. And yet, so basically our First Amendment says, \"Look, if you're not out to destroy the Constitution. If you're not ideologically driven to eviscerate the society, then have at it. You could be an atheist, you can be a Buddhist, Muslim, Jewish, Christian - whatever you want. Isn't that the genius of the First Amendment?",

      "sentences": "Absolutely, and I have to tell you, this is why America and American-Muslims especially have the responsibility by being blessed. If I had grown up in Syria or Saudi Arabia, I would not be the man who sits before you today respecting and learning from authors like yourself and having the opportunity to be on \"Life, Liberty & Levin\" and talk about freedom, right? I would be a different consciousness because I would be fighting for my freedom in Syria, I probably wouldn't be alive today or if I lived in Saudi Arabia, I would have been influenced by more anti-western conspiracy theories, et cetera. So, America needs to get out, especially the left, needs to get out of its ethnocentrism and obsession with what's happening in Washington and Hollywood and start look at the world and saying, \"You know what? A quarter of the world's population is Muslim. It's a 1400- plus year-old religion that now is going through a time in history which it's beginning to move against dictatorships and against theocracy.  We can take sides in that or we can continue to work with just the strong horse and pretend that somehow through a bigotry of low expectations that Arabs and Persians and Muslims in general want to be run by dictators and theocrats and that could not be further from the truth. Every human being wants to be free, and people say, \"Well, Islam needs a Martin Luther.\"  You hit the nail on the head. It's too early for a Martin Luther here. We need John Locke, James Madison. We need Jeffersonian religious freedom papers to begin to start to teach our youth. I mean, one of the things I teach my three young children is the only thing I would ever want to die for, and this is the reason I joined the Navy, is America and our Constitution. I was taught by my parents that while we love and pray to God and we read our scripture in the Arabic Koran, I never want to die for that because God doesn't need me to die for him. And my scripture is between me and God. I don't need the state to have that as a Constitution. What the state needs to do is protect my individual rights to speak, to practice or reject any parts of the faith that the men in beards and long robes want to ram down my throat.   So, that's the beauty of the American experiment. We have a responsibility in this country, living in blessed freedom to give back to the world and start to put forth a form of Islam and that is what our Muslim Reform Movement is about is, it is using the free market of ideas that exist here to begin to have critical thinking and pushing back against - right now there's only four schools of Sharia in Islam, of Sunni Islam and only a couple in Shia Islam.  Back at the beginning of Islam, there were thousands of schools of thought. How do people expect Islam to do away with ISIS and its Muslim brotherhoods if there is no critical thinking and in the laboratory where we can do it, the left wants us with the red green axis of the left and the Islamist to not have critical thinking and say anyone that looks critically Islam is a bigot, is an Islamophobe in this victim grievance narrative that dominates who I am as a Muslim, when, in fact, we need tough love to say, \"You know what, if you know Muslims that are your neighbors and your friends, ask them what they think about theocracy and what they are doing to change the consciousness for their children and what their legacy will be?\"",

We will talk about and use folks like Keith Ellison. You remember the Pelosi incident where she's whispering behind the microphone, \"Tell them you're Muslim. Tell them you're Muslim.\" That's all that matters to them. It's an identity politics. They exploit identity politics in order to use us as a hammer against the right, so that they can obsess into saying they are the answer to bigotry and et cetera on the right, which could not be further from the truth. It is part of the left's demagoguery where they actually in a bigoted sense use race, they racialize Islam - Islam is an idea, it is not a race, but yet, they racialize it. So they prevent critical thinking within communities, individual thought as they've done with the African-American community, the Hispanic community, and they have no interest in looking globally at how Muslim women are treated in Iran, how they're treated in Afghanistan, in Saudi Arabia because feminism to them is really also a tool for how to get to the right, rather than actually being about principles.",

But now, all of a sudden they're doing it because to them, the axis of their ideas is all about how to get the right and how to demonize everyone who is against their party, when in fact, it's not about principles.   So, I hope ultimately as we've proven in the last election, the American people are not stupid.

And that evolved into some major organizations, like the Islamic Society of North America, the Council on American Islamic Relations, your alphabet soup of basically Muslim Brotherhood legacy groups and in '91, this is part of the FBI Holy Land Foundation Trial in 2007, documents that were shown to be real documents from '91, they had an authoritative memorandum that said that they had certain organizations that are part of the evangelical movement of the Islamist movement to try to shape western opinion, shape western policy so that it favors Islamist interests and CAIR is one of the groups.

I was being brought in by a number of the freedom based associations, college Republicans and others, and they simply pushed back and said, \"Oh, because the title of my talk was American-Muslim identity, patriots or insurgents?\" They said, \"Oh, that's demonization, there's no binary,\" and the Muslim students protested.

But then, after I gave my speech about how much I love my faith and how much it is patriotic to push back against Islamists, the coverage from the student newspaper was actually pretty positive, even though it was horrifically negative before I got in there.

We then also handed them money that we lied to the Iranian people where Obama in videos was telling the Iranian people that this money will help their economy, and this year, in January 1st, when the revolution started again, this green revolution, this time, it's not just in Tehran, the revolution was happening in front of the theocratic teaching centers in Qom and other cities of Iran where the clerics are taught. That's what's amazing about the latest revolution in 2018. That started way before we pulled out. So, the Iranian people in that revolution were holding signs saying that, \"Stop sending money to Syria to kill Syrians, we need it here in this country.\"  So, we handed them money to spend more on short and mid-range missiles to fund Hezbollah, to spread global terror. We abandoned many operations globally to try to get to Hezbollah at the altar of the nuclear deal. We then allowed companies to come into Tehran to open up shop like Boeing and other European companies which never works to bring down a regime, actually helps to strengthen them and as the sanctions ended, the Khameneists were becoming even more belligerent. So, at the end of the day, we got nothing in return, not even an assurance of their nuclear disarmamentation. At the end of the day, we were more insecure and now, within months of us pulling out of the deal, the Iranian people are starting to see their economy weaken, which is actually helping them destabilize their government and they actually see a light at the end of the tunnel, they're extremely thankful. The people of Iran who we would share our values with are thankful of what President Trump, John Bolton and others have done now, and I think there is no - I don't know what planet the left is living on in thinking that somehow that was wise.

So, they rejected their Syrian nationalism which has failed and has now - continues to prove to be one of the worst tyrannies in the world, to come to embrace an Islam that was their own making, their own practice. So Sharia is the Islamic jurisprudence that is the laws that have evolved from 7th Century Islam. So, I would be deceptive or lying to you if I said Sharia was compatible with American law. My Sharia is the Islam of American patriots that I know that are Muslims that reject political Islam is, but the Sharia of Saudi Arabia, of the Pakistani Islamic law, of Egyptian law, of the Muslim brotherhood, of Hamas, those Sharia theocracies are incompatible with American law. So ultimately, now, as we are finishing up the holiest month of Ramadan, we just finished, it it's our holiday this weekend.

Islam is in that time in its history right now. We're basically in the 16th, 17th Century of what Christendom was in at that time. And right now, as it is quiet, as you said, the Muslim world is not quiet, the Iranian people are revolting in the streets in the thousands against their theocracy. My family in Damascus and Aleppo are dodging chemical weapons and helicopter gunships and a genocide from the Syrians from Hezbollah, from Iran, from Russia. The Muslim Brotherhood is growing.

I think we've seen like our organization and our Muslim Reform Movement leaders have shifting the needle, where after 9/11, no one would talk about Islamism and Islamists and now, we are starting to see a conversation where we recognize that it's not just terrorism. I mean, I am a doctor, as you said, and I treat disease, I don't treat symptoms, and the disease of what we're facing is not just terrorism. That's a symptom. That's a whack-a-mole program. The disease is political Islam - Sharia states. The concept that our identity as Muslims is wedded to a national identity of Islamic governance. There may be many Muslims in America that are here that reject sort of secular society. So the American media, and I think especially on the left now, if you get away from their 95% Trump derangement syndrome where they are focused too much on completely ignoring the global issues that are continuing to evolve. The rest, because of the influence of foreign governments, Islamic states and their funding of think tanks, especially on the left, the Clinton Foundation and their money from Qatar and the Saudis and others and we see also this problem on the right, we are unable to have an honest conversation about the influence of Islamics' movements and Sharia-type movements in our country and the influence on changing the narratives. And until we look at that problem and fix it, we're never going to treat the disease."

John Locke, the enlightenment, religions most have gone through this reformation period, so there isn't this, a conflict between the enlightenment and people of faith and religion. You're saying not so with a lot of the Muslim world. In the United States, we have this First Amendment. It's really quite brilliant. The free exercise of religion, but no establishment of religion. And it was based on like much of the Constitution, Judeo-Christian concepts, but not just that. Aristotle. Cicero - Cicero wasn't a Christian, per se, I mean, it was the Romans who killed Christ. And yet, so basically our First Amendment says, \"Look, if you're not out to destroy the Constitution. If you're not ideologically driven to eviscerate the society, then have at it. You could be an atheist, you can be a Buddhist, Muslim, Jewish, Christian - whatever you want. Isn't that the genius of the First Amendment?"

      "utterance": "Absolutely, and I have to tell you, this is why America and American-Muslims especially have the responsibility by being blessed. If I had grown up in Syria or Saudi Arabia, I would not be the man who sits before you today respecting and learning from authors like yourself and having the opportunity to be on \"Life, Liberty & Levin\" and talk about freedom, right? I would be a different consciousness because I would be fighting for my freedom in Syria, I probably wouldn't be alive today or if I lived in Saudi Arabia, I would have been influenced by more anti-western conspiracy theories, et cetera. So, America needs to get out, especially the left, needs to get out of its ethnocentrism and obsession with what's happening in Washington and Hollywood and start look at the world and saying, \"You know what? A quarter of the world's population is Muslim. It's a 1400- plus year-old religion that now is going through a time in history which it's beginning to move against dictatorships and against theocracy. We can take sides in that or we can continue to work with just the strong horse and pretend that somehow through a bigotry of low expectations that Arabs and Persians and Muslims in general want to be run by dictators and theocrats and that could not be further from the truth. Every human being wants to be free, and people say, \"Well, Islam needs a Martin Luther.\" You hit the nail on the head. It's too early for a Martin Luther here. We need John Locke, James Madison. We need Jeffersonian religious freedom papers to begin to start to teach our youth. I mean, one of the things I teach my three young children is the only thing I would ever want to die for, and this is the reason I joined the Navy, is America and our Constitution. I was taught by my parents that while we love and pray to God and we read our scripture in the Arabic Koran, I never want to die for that because God doesn't need me to die for him. And my scripture is between me and God. I don't need the state to have that as a Constitution. What the state needs to do is protect my individual rights to speak, to practice or reject any parts of the faith that the men in beards and long robes want to ram down my throat. So, that's the beauty of the American experiment. We have a responsibility in this country, living in blessed freedom to give back to the world and start to put forth a form of Islam and that is what our Muslim Reform Movement is about is, it is using the free market of ideas that exist here to begin to have critical thinking and pushing back against - right now there's only four schools of Sharia in Islam, of Sunni Islam and only a couple in Shia Islam. Back at the beginning of Islam, there were thousands of schools of thought. How do people expect Islam to do away with ISIS and its Muslim brotherhoods if there is no critical thinking and in the laboratory where we can do it, the left wants us with the red green axis of the left and the Islamist to not have critical thinking and say anyone that looks critically Islam is a bigot, is an Islamophobe in this victim grievance narrative that dominates who I am as a Muslim, when, in fact, we need tough love to say, \"You know what, if you know Muslims that are your neighbors and your friends, ask them what they think about theocracy and what they are doing to change the consciousness for their children and what their legacy will be?\""

They would say, \"Well, you know what, we can check the box that we protect Muslim minority rights. We will call it a Muslim ban,\" even though it is not. We will talk about and use folks like Keith Ellison. You remember the Pelosi incident where she's whispering behind the microphone, \"Tell them you're Muslim. Tell them you're Muslim.\" That's all that matters to them. It's an identity politics. They exploit identity politics in order to use us as a hammer against the right, so that they can obsess into saying they are the answer to bigotry and et cetera on the right, which could not be further from the truth. It is part of the left's demagoguery where they actually in a bigoted sense use race, they racialize Islam - Islam is an idea, it is not a race, but yet, they racialize it. So they prevent critical thinking within communities, individual thought as they've done with the African-American community, the Hispanic community, and they have no interest in looking globally at how Muslim women are treated in Iran, how they're treated in Afghanistan, in Saudi Arabia because feminism to them is really also a tool for how to get to the right, rather than actually being about principles."

But now, all of a sudden they're doing it because to them, the axis of their ideas is all about how to get the right and how to demonize everyone who is against their party, when in fact, it's not about principles. So, I hope ultimately as we've proven in the last election, the American people are not stupid. They understand what the realities are, who to trust and who not to, and the left is going to continue to wither on the vine of false narratives because a candidate who is elected by fighting the establishment, which is, I know what we're going to talk about with CAIR, the establishment in the Muslim community is evil, it is theocratic and are not friends of America."

And that evolved into some major organizations, like the Islamic Society of North America, the Council on American Islamic Relations, your alphabet soup of basically Muslim Brotherhood legacy groups and in '91, this is part of the FBI Holy Land Foundation Trial in 2007, documents that were shown to be real documents from '91, they had an authoritative memorandum that said that they had certain organizations that are part of the evangelical movement of the Islamist movement to try to shape western opinion, shape western policy so that it favors Islamist interests and CAIR is one of the groups.

I mean, from when you and I started talking after 9/11, today I just spoke at Duke a couple of months ago, and for days the students association were protesting me coming in. I was being brought in by a number of the freedom based associations, college Republicans and others, and they simply pushed back and said, \"Oh, because the title of my talk was American-Muslim identity, patriots or insurgents?\" They said, \"Oh, that's demonization, there's no binary,\" and the Muslim students protested. They had a sit-in, et cetera. But then, after I gave my speech about how much I love my faith and how much it is patriotic to push back against Islamists, the coverage from the student newspaper was actually pretty positive, even though it was horrifically negative before I got in there. So, all I can tell you is that when we're given a platform, they can't, at the end of the day, honestly call me an Islamophobe after they listen to what I say and the narrative of what I really believe in as a god-fearing, patriotic, American-Muslim who feels that our community has globally been hijacked by these political Islamist movements. And the universities, I think is ground zero of the speech debate. As so many have seen, the Islamists and the left suppress free speech and create this climate where we can't even have an ability to disagree with one another because they call you a hater, a bigot, et cetera, and they shut down any type of critical thinking."

That's what's amazing about the latest revolution in 2018. That started way before we pulled out. So, the Iranian people in that revolution were holding signs saying that, \"Stop sending money to Syria to kill Syrians, we need it here in this country.\" So, we handed them money to spend more on short and mid-range missiles to fund Hezbollah, to spread global terror. We abandoned many operations globally to try to get to Hezbollah at the altar of the nuclear deal. We then allowed companies to come into Tehran to open up shop like Boeing and other European companies which never works to bring down a regime, actually helps to strengthen them and as the sanctions ended, the Khameneists were becoming even more belligerent. So, at the end of the day, we got nothing in return, not even an assurance of their nuclear disarmamentation. At the end of the day, we were more insecure and now, within months of us pulling out of the deal, the Iranian people are starting to see their economy weaken, which is actually helping them destabilize their government and they actually see a light at the end of the tunnel, they're extremely thankful. The people of Iran who we would share our values with are thankful of what President Trump, John Bolton and others have done now, and I think there is no - I don't know what planet the left is living on in thinking that somehow that was wise.

Sign up with our wonderful conservative community over there. We'll be right back. The President has been trashed early on, when he wanted to put in place immigration rules that limited at least for a period of time, individuals coming to this country, refugees, from certain countries, and even Federal judges, many of whom were appointed by Barack Obama accused him essentially of being anti-Muslim. Do you see it that way?"

      "speaker": "JASSER",
      "utterance": "Absolutely not. I mean, to hold a President not accountable to words he may have said in his campaign. I might have disagreed with his word choice, of how he expressed things. Bottom line is his policy today, it is absurd to say, I mean, I am the fruit of Muslim immigrants that came here to practice their faith, so I believe that at the core of Americanism is a pro-immigration sense, but it is un-American to say that we should have lotteries or that we should have chain migration. I don't understand that. Americans who want to be, you know, people who want to be Americans should be welcome based on ideology. Communists, Islamists, collectivists who don't believe in our American Constitutional law, should not be allowed in. So, an Islamist ban is very appropriate and the previous administration, not only Obama but the Bush administration also have never really articulated how we vet refugees."

    {
      "speaker": "JASSER",
      "utterance": "No. While all Islamists are Muslim, certainly not all Muslims are Islamists. And if anyone should be able to get this is, Mark, it's Americans, we were founded by Christians who did not want to be theocrats or Christianists, so Islamists are certainly a large plurality among the Muslim population, but they are certainly not a majority. And if they're Islamists, then let them go to Saudi Arabia, let them go to other countries. They don't need to come to America and destabilize who we are as a country, because we're just going to welcome people willy-nilly regardless of their ideology."

    {
      "speaker": "LEVIN",
      "utterance": "And those six countries, they don't even come close to making up the majority of Muslims in the world. The largest Muslim countries weren't even included?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JASSER",
      "utterance": "Yes, 56 countries have Muslim majorities. To say that that's a Muslim ban is just absurd and it is insulting to Muslims. It's insulting to the Muslims in prisons in those countries. Many of the folks who get out are actually sent by their regimes to infiltrate as the Turks do and their policies, if you will. So, I think there's nothing more pro-Muslim than saying. \"You know what? If you believe in the western narrative of freedom and liberty, welcome to the west. If you don't believe in our way of secular liberal democracy, then you're not welcome here.\""

      "utterance": "I think look at how President Trump came to where he is today. He's a disruptor who fought against the establishment. Now, he is taking the offense and destroying ISIS and back against the Khomeinist and others, so I would ask the American people and President Trump to take the offense, to embrace disruption, embrace some chaos in the Middle East as bad as that might sound, revolutions are good, not the ones with Islamists winning, but the ones with those who share our values. The President talked about a commission on radical Islam in his campaign, it's time to convene that. It's time to no longer just have Iftar dinners that bring in ambassadors or that bring in Islamists which thankfully, he did not do this year, but bring in almost a freedom-form into the White House of Muslim dissidents, of our Muslim Reform Movement to say, \"These are the Muslim side who we want to take.\" There is nothing more pro- diversity, pro-American than embracing Muslims that reject theocracy, and we are going to let them stand on their shoulders as Americans and show that we are pro-Muslim, but anti- Islamist."
