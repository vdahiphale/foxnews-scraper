That's the sexist commentary Hillary's promise invites. And it's disgusting Dana. Here we are on the verge of a historical moment, the first female president and she is saying, don't fret America; my hubby is going to handle the hard stuff. Because all those numbers are so confusing, math is so hard; dividends, remainders -- I just round up. Isn't it strange? Gender has been the crux of her sales pitch all this time, until now when her campaign is struggling. Suddenly competence, which breeds peace of mind, matters. The lesson Hillary seems to be imparting: Vote for me, but you get the dude instead. In business terms, that's called a bait and switch, one that most Americans frankly wouldn't mind.",
