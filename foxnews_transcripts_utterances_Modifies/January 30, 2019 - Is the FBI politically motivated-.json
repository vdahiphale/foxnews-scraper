      "sentences": "Good evening and welcome to “Tucker Carlson Tonight.” It's pretty clear that both of the country's political parties are have changed radically over the past few years, and they are changing still. We cover that every night on the show. Donald Trump, of course has transformed the GOP, you may have read about it. On the Democratic side, there have been profound changes, too. Ones that don't get as much quite as much attention. A party that for a hundred years stood with America's middle class now represents the nation's richest and its poorest.  And so not surprisingly, the party's position on policy have changed accordingly - a lot. So just about 20 years ago, Democrats championed free speech. They worried about illegal immigration - loudly. They criticized voluntary foreign wars and they argued that unrestricted trade hurt American workers. And by the way, quite a few of them, Democrats were pro- life, too.  Senator Harry Reid among them. And that's not surprising, if you think about it. Democrats said they cared most about the vulnerable in our society. Even Bill Clinton who vetoed two partial birth abortion bans, felt the need to say he wanted to keep abortion rare. He said that a lot.  Try that in today's Democratic Party - lots of luck. Modern Democratic activists celebrate abortion as a positive good. \"Shout your abortion\" they proclaim. They put it on T-shirts. Abortion isn't bad, we need more of it. Earlier this month, Governor Andrew Cuomo signed a bill making that possible. It's called the Reproductive Health Act, and the law legalizes abortion right to the moment of birth for virtually any reason.  Now, to most people, aborting a child moments before delivery might seem uncomfortably like killing. A lot of pro-choice people feel that way. It's a concern. Well, Cuomo's law addresses that concern. The law declares that children who have not been yet born are not in fact human, so don't worry about it. Cuomo illuminated the new World Trade Center in lower Manhattan with pink lights to celebrate the bill signing. He described it is a profound moral victory.  Now, the national press didn't spend a lot of time covering this. No matter how much you might like Roe v. Wade, maybe you love it, there's still something pretty ghoulish about celebrating third-term abortion.   Maybe that's why only tiny of percentage American voters support it, around 13%, a small percentage. Nobody really wants to hear the details about any of this, so nobody asks. And that's why the video we're about to show you - - which is not gory, don't worry -- but it is remarkable. In it, a Virginia Democratic lawmaker called Kathy Tran explains in detail a bill she's introduced that will remove all restriction on late-term abortion. She was asked, \"Well, what would that mean exactly?\" And Tran tells the truth. Watch this.",

In other words, the Governor of Virginia has just told us in public on camera that it's okay to kill a child after the child has been born. That used to be call infanticide, not rhetorically, but literally infanticide - taking the life of a child who is breathing.  The Governor seem to just say that. Did he misspeak? Well, you'd hope. But no, he didn't. Ralph Northam is a physician. He is a pediatric neurologist in fact. He is not some clueless layman who mangled a neural talking point. This is really what he thinks. This is what his party thinks. Though no one ever says it, but it's true. This is the new moderate pro-choice position. You should know that.

And now you have people like Governor Ralph Northam who is supposed to be a moderate, openly advocating for infanticide.  And what we've seen with this trend is Democrats embracing abortion up until the moment of birth. And what I think is - so interesting about this is Democrats are now embracing this position that is wildly out of touch with the majority of Americans. You look at Marist poll done in January and 75% of Americans only supported abortion for three months and below, including 61% of people who were pro- choice only supported that, and the reason being is because you look at abortions at the third trimester, it's barbaric.   You're talking about injecting a baby that is viable at this point outside of the mother's womb in the head, torso or heart and forcing with digoxin and forcing this child into a full lethal cardiac arrest. The mother is then going to carry this dead child in her womb for two to three days and then have a still-born baby. So that is why you have the majority of Americans that oppose this kind of thing.",

And I really think that Democrats need to check themselves, Tucker, because they are so wildly out of sync with the American people. And remember, Hillary Clinton had even supported repealing the Hyde Act which is decades- old law that majority of Americans support as well, which would allow for the funding - for taxpayer funding of abortion.   So Democrats are now becoming way out of sync with Americans, and I think Republicans should raise the alarm on this, get loud and so should President Trump, because Democrats are out sync with Americans on this.",

That's plenty - a fatal dose to wipe out the entire populations of Texas, Arizona and New York State combined. They found this under the floor of the trailer. They found 114 kilograms of fentanyl. According to the DEA, just two milligrams is considered a lethal dose. They also grabbed 179 kilograms of methamphetamine and one kilogram of fentanyl in pill form. The street value for the fentanyl alone, over $102 million. The CBP officers arrested the smuggler, a Mexican national who attempted to drive the drugs across the border. The suspect was a part of the DHS's trusted traveler program called FAST. That stands for Free and Secure Trade for Commercial vehicles. The program started after 9/11. It's kind of like TSA pre-check, but for truck drivers crossing the border. They complete background checks and meet other requirements to get expedited screening.

Five years for blacks, eight years for whites. Within 20 years, we closed that gap within six months because we established schools. Five thousand Rosenwald Schools, in fact, Rosenwald, the CEO of Sears, partnered with a Booker T. Washington. He invested $4 million. The black community matched that and build 5,000 Rosenwald Schools. And so that's why we did it. There were five high schools in every major city -- Baltimore, New York and Atlanta -- where the class sizes were 50 and plus. We had tattered school books. The buildings were torn down, but the test scores of those blacks in those high schools exceeded all of the test scores of whites in those same cities even though we were spending less. So the issue, Tucker, that we ought to be talking about is why -- we ought to be talking about black resilience and that is how did we achieve in the face of over oppression, legal segregation and why are we failing now post- Civil Rights in cities run - education systems run by their own people?",

Senator Marco Rubio of Florida was at that hearing and says he has a plan to combat Chinese spying on the United States. Senator Rubio joins us tonight. Senator, thanks a lot for coming on.",

They steel our research from universities and they do that by either packing in and stealing it. Sometimes, they just hire the researcher and have them bring their research with them. Sometimes, they embed students in our system and these students become research assistants and they take that information and steal it back with them. They steal of course, our military secrets and they also are in the supply chains, so they are embedded in commercial - and parts of our communication system, so for example, they may a router or a surveillance camera and can embed themselves into our systems that way.

They are a developing country. Once they become like us - once they become as rich as we are, then they will become just like us.\" Well, it hasn't worked out that way. So at least people have woken up. But you already see things happening. The Justice Department going after Huawei. The extradition of the leader of Huawei in Canada. So every day you see more and more of this happening and now you're starting to see other countries doing it. Poland, numerous countries who are now taking this threat seriously as well, because Huawei is an example is already embedded there, but there's just so much more to do. We still struggle, for example, with academia. I can't tell you how many universities in Florida that I've talked to and said, You have these Confucius Institutes and they're used as agents of influence to shape the narrative and potentially to identify Americans who 20 years from now could be a mayor, could be a congressman, could be a leader of a major corporation and start to sort of recruit them to the Chinese view of things. And how many schools fought us on that. Now, we've gotten them kicked out of almost every school, but one in Florida, and more universities are coming - waking up to that threat, but it is still an enormous challenge to convince academics that this is a threat.",

      "utterance": "Good evening and welcome to “Tucker Carlson Tonight.” It's pretty clear that both of the country's political parties are have changed radically over the past few years, and they are changing still. We cover that every night on the show. Donald Trump, of course has transformed the GOP, you may have read about it. On the Democratic side, there have been profound changes, too. Ones that don't get as much quite as much attention. A party that for a hundred years stood with America's middle class now represents the nation's richest and its poorest. And so not surprisingly, the party's position on policy have changed accordingly - a lot. So just about 20 years ago, Democrats championed free speech. They worried about illegal immigration - loudly. They criticized voluntary foreign wars and they argued that unrestricted trade hurt American workers. And by the way, quite a few of them, Democrats were pro- life, too. Senator Harry Reid among them. And that's not surprising, if you think about it. Democrats said they cared most about the vulnerable in our society. Even Bill Clinton who vetoed two partial birth abortion bans, felt the need to say he wanted to keep abortion rare. He said that a lot. Try that in today's Democratic Party - lots of luck. Modern Democratic activists celebrate abortion as a positive good. \"Shout your abortion\" they proclaim. They put it on T-shirts. Abortion isn't bad, we need more of it. Earlier this month, Governor Andrew Cuomo signed a bill making that possible. It's called the Reproductive Health Act, and the law legalizes abortion right to the moment of birth for virtually any reason. Now, to most people, aborting a child moments before delivery might seem uncomfortably like killing. A lot of pro-choice people feel that way. It's a concern. Well, Cuomo's law addresses that concern. The law declares that children who have not been yet born are not in fact human, so don't worry about it. Cuomo illuminated the new World Trade Center in lower Manhattan with pink lights to celebrate the bill signing. He described it is a profound moral victory. Now, the national press didn't spend a lot of time covering this. No matter how much you might like Roe v. Wade, maybe you love it, there's still something pretty ghoulish about celebrating third-term abortion. Maybe that's why only tiny of percentage American voters support it, around 13%, a small percentage. Nobody really wants to hear the details about any of this, so nobody asks. And that's why the video we're about to show you - - which is not gory, don't worry -- but it is remarkable. In it, a Virginia Democratic lawmaker called Kathy Tran explains in detail a bill she's introduced that will remove all restriction on late-term abortion. She was asked, \"Well, what would that mean exactly?\" And Tran tells the truth. Watch this."

There's a lot going on, obviously, but just think about that for one second. You maybe pro-choice, are you okay with that? Virginia's Governor is okay with that. He's thought about it. Ralph Northam is his name. He has been in office a little over a year. He's often described; in fact, always described as moderate. And that's pretty amazing given his reaction to Kathy Tran's late-term abortion bill. This is from today. Watch this."

He's direct enough to call the infant is what the infant is, but again, \"The infant would be delivered and resuscitated if that's what the mother desires, \"quote. In other words, the Governor of Virginia has just told us in public on camera that it's okay to kill a child after the child has been born. That used to be call infanticide, not rhetorically, but literally infanticide - taking the life of a child who is breathing. The Governor seem to just say that. Did he misspeak? Well, you'd hope. But no, he didn't. Ralph Northam is a physician. He is a pediatric neurologist in fact. He is not some clueless layman who mangled a neural talking point. This is really what he thinks. This is what his party thinks. Though no one ever says it, but it's true. This is the new moderate pro-choice position. You should know that.

      "speaker": "BOOTHE",

And now you have people like Governor Ralph Northam who is supposed to be a moderate, openly advocating for infanticide. And what we've seen with this trend is Democrats embracing abortion up until the moment of birth. And what I think is - so interesting about this is Democrats are now embracing this position that is wildly out of touch with the majority of Americans. You look at Marist poll done in January and 75% of Americans only supported abortion for three months and below, including 61% of people who were pro- choice only supported that, and the reason being is because you look at abortions at the third trimester, it's barbaric. You're talking about injecting a baby that is viable at this point outside of the mother's womb in the head, torso or heart and forcing with digoxin and forcing this child into a full lethal cardiac arrest. The mother is then going to carry this dead child in her womb for two to three days and then have a still-born baby. So that is why you have the majority of Americans that oppose this kind of thing."

    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",

But it's happening in exactly the same moment that the party is working itself into frenzy of moral concern about people who are in our country illegally, about climate change. The message is, this is a party that really cares, and yet here you have a sitting Democratic Governor saying, \"Yes, you get to kill the kid - the child, if you want.\" Has anybody said anything about this on the Democratic side?"

And I really think that Democrats need to check themselves, Tucker, because they are so wildly out of sync with the American people. And remember, Hillary Clinton had even supported repealing the Hyde Act which is decades- old law that majority of Americans support as well, which would allow for the funding - for taxpayer funding of abortion. So Democrats are now becoming way out of sync with Americans, and I think Republicans should raise the alarm on this, get loud and so should President Trump, because Democrats are out sync with Americans on this."

If a woman is dilated and about to give birth, we will in this case, we will make sure and I don't think you brought this part out, but it was unbelievable to me, we're going to make sure first of all that -- he doesn't say the word \"baby\" -- is comfortable, right? And then we will resuscitate the baby if the mother wants us to. Okay. But first we're going to make it comfortable. Then we will resuscitate it if the mother wants us to and then we will enter into discussion about what to do next. I mean, it is absolutely -- and this is not a crazy activist group.

Most evangelicals, most Christians, non-Catholic Christians would say, \"What is even excommunication? Like ex-communal, right?

You know, Tucker, I think one really important thing that nobody has been talking about in the New York State bill is that what they've also done is they've got rid of, in all other state laws, the idea that there's personhood of the unborn. Okay, let me just say that again, they have said that we're going to get rid of the status of person of the unborn.

Traditionally, the welfare state was for a country's own citizens. Today's Democrats are fighting hard to expand it -- for those who are in this country illegally, for non-citizens who shouldn't even be here. For example, in New York, lawmakers just passed a bill to provide taxpayer finance tuition to illegal immigrants. Nicole Malliotakis is a New York State Assemblywoman and she joins us tonight. Nicole, thanks very much for coming on. So in a state like yours, where there's a lot of poverty and a lot of homelessness and a lot of broken infrastructure, your subways for example are appalling.

People want to leave this state because they can't afford to live here. It's a high tech state. And you know what, we're not benefiting from salt because of the city and state high taxation. I mean, that's the reality of it. So what do they do? They continue to tax us more.

      "utterance": "Tucker, this evening, Chicago police tell Fox News, they have pulled hundreds of hours of surveillance video from more than 12 different cameras in the area where this alleged attack happened. And so far, nothing shows the alleged assault and no assailants had been seen on video. What Chicago Police do say is that tonight, they have identified two persons of interest on this surveillance video, and they plan on releasing photos of those persons sometime soon. Chicago Police tonight also addressing media reports that Smollett, the actor suffered a fractured rib during this alleged assault. Police tell Fox News so far, they do not have documentation of the actor suffering a fractured rib. Police say the fractured rip could have happened, they just can't confirm the injury. Police say what they do have confirmed so far is that based on the actor's digital footprint, he did apparently visit a Subway restaurant around 2:00 a.m. and when investigators interviewed Smollett in his residence, he did have a small white rope around his neck, which the actor claims he's attackers tied around him. The alleged attack that could amount to a hate crime sparked a lot of support and response of entertainers and politicians. California senator and 2020 presidential hopeful Kamala Harris tweeted out in part quote, \"This was an intended modern day lynching. No one should have to fear for their life because of their sexuality or color their skin. We must confront this hate.\" New Jersey senator Cory Booker also called this alleged incident, a modern day lynching and tweeted in part quote, \"To those in Congress who don't feel the urgency to pass our anti-lynching bill designating lynching as a Federal hate crime, I urge you to pay attention.\" And Democratic Congresswoman from Chicago, Bobby Rush released a statement writing in part quote, \"This is a hate crime, plain and simple. I'm even more disturbed by the manner in which the crime was carried out, particularly at the media reports of the attempted lynching which harkens back to some of the darkest days in our history.\" This actor is also a musician. He has a scheduled performance in West Hollywood this weekend, which he apparently is going to carry on with, Tucker."

Well up next, and exclusively on this program, the Border Patrol has made one of the largest drug busts in history, enough fentanyl to kill 50 million people. But there's no crisis on our border. Just remember that. We have the facts after the break."

      "utterance": "Well, the U.S. Border Patrol has made the biggest fentanyl bust in history, an enormous amount. Enough fentanyl to kill they estimate, 57 million people. That's more than the combined populations of the states of Illinois, New York and Pennsylvania. It's a lot. Fox correspondent Hillary Vaughn has the latest on the story -- Hillary."

      "utterance": "Hey Tucker. Well, we got our hands on an internal memo from U.S. Customs and Border Patrol that details this bust, the biggest fentanyl seizer in U.S. history. According to the memo, four days ago in Nogales, Arizona, at the port of entry, CBP officers stopped a tractor trailer crossing the U.S.-Mexico border into the U.S. with enough fentanyl to kill 57 million people. That's plenty - a fatal dose to wipe out the entire populations of Texas, Arizona and New York State combined. They found this under the floor of the trailer. They found 114 kilograms of fentanyl. According to the DEA, just two milligrams is considered a lethal dose. They also grabbed 179 kilograms of methamphetamine and one kilogram of fentanyl in pill form. The street value for the fentanyl alone, over $102 million. The CBP officers arrested the smuggler, a Mexican national who attempted to drive the drugs across the border. The suspect was a part of the DHS's trusted traveler program called FAST. That stands for Free and Secure Trade for Commercial vehicles. The program started after 9/11. It's kind of like TSA pre-check, but for truck drivers crossing the border. They complete background checks and meet other requirements to get expedited screening. Now, the driver's FAST pass has been revoked and the CBP plans to announce all of this in a press conference tomorrow and we'll also have a photo op with the historic call -- Tucker."

      "utterance": "Amazing story. Hillary Vaughn for us. Thank you very much for that report. Well, there's an awful lot of outrage in this country all of a sudden, and we like to keep track of it just because it's interesting and that tells you a lot about where we're going. People are outraged about virtually everything. Sometimes they get pretty creative about getting outraged. Here's one interesting example. A restaurant patron in Phoenix, Arizona recently complained to management about a photograph that was hanging in the restaurant of coal miners drinking after work. The patron argued that because some people might think the coal miners who are covered in coal dust, you can see the picture on the screen - were posted in black face, it was offensive and it should be taken down. What to make of this? Well, we decided to ask Robert Woodson. He is the President of the Woodson Center and he joins us now. Now, Mr. Woodson, thanks very much for coming on."

      "utterance": "So what does this story tell us?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WOODSON",
      "utterance": "It tell us tells us that race grievance is just triumphing throughout the country, that I'm upset as a Civil Rights person that we would spend so much time being concerned about a picture hanging a white man in coal dust, and somehow that's offensive. It deflects attention away from more critical issues facing black America."

      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Exactly."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WOODSON",
      "utterance": "We have more blacks killing other blacks in one year than we did in the 70 years of lynching. We have in other words, a 9/11 every six months of blacks killing blacks and you're going to tell me our problem is a picture hanging."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "So is it possible that let's say you were in charge of the society or a big city and your policies weren't helping at all and people were still dying young and shooting each other for example, maybe you would encourage people to be mad about irrelevant things like coal dust pictures so they wouldn't be mad at you for mismanaging their lives."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WOODSON",
      "utterance": "That's true because many of those killings are occurring in cities run by black Democrats over the past 40 years, so if politics and race were the issue, the question is, why are not blacks succeeding? If we look - in other words, at a time when whites were at their worst, blacks were at their best. Between 1920 and 1940, during segregation, the education gap in the South was three years. Five years for blacks, eight years for whites. Within 20 years, we closed that gap within six months because we established schools. Five thousand Rosenwald Schools, in fact, Rosenwald, the CEO of Sears, partnered with a Booker T. Washington. He invested $4 million. The black community matched that and build 5,000 Rosenwald Schools. And so that's why we did it. There were five high schools in every major city -- Baltimore, New York and Atlanta -- where the class sizes were 50 and plus. We had tattered school books. The buildings were torn down, but the test scores of those blacks in those high schools exceeded all of the test scores of whites in those same cities even though we were spending less. So the issue, Tucker, that we ought to be talking about is why -- we ought to be talking about black resilience and that is how did we achieve in the face of over oppression, legal segregation and why are we failing now post- Civil Rights in cities run - education systems run by their own people?"

      "utterance": "Officials in Washington has spent more than two years in utter hysteria over the threat that Macedonian Facebook users might pose to American democracy. But take a deep breath, and ask yourself, is Macedonia really the top cyber threat to the United States? Is Russia? No, of course not. When actual experts on the subject testified, they always say the same thing. China is the top cyber threat to the United States. The Director of National Intelligence, Dan Coats, testified as much to Congress this week. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida was at that hearing and says he has a plan to combat Chinese spying on the United States. Senator Rubio joins us tonight. Senator, thanks a lot for coming on."

    {
      "speaker": "RUBIO",
      "utterance": "Well, they all agreed that China is the most comprehensive intelligence threat the United States has ever faced and because it's a commercial threat, they steal our products and reverse engineer them and then sell them at lower prices, subsidized by their government so they can put our businesses out. They steel our research from universities and they do that by either packing in and stealing it. Sometimes, they just hire the researcher and have them bring their research with them. Sometimes, they embed students in our system and these students become research assistants and they take that information and steal it back with them. They steal of course, our military secrets and they also are in the supply chains, so they are embedded in commercial - and parts of our communication system, so for example, they may a router or a surveillance camera and can embed themselves into our systems that way. Especially things that have to do with defense, but even with commerce. So they steal business and in defense and it's an enormous threat."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "It's terrifying. What do we do about it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RUBIO",
      "utterance": "Well, first of all, we have to admit it exists, and for a long time, China was kind of viewed as a benign threat, in essence, a country - the conventional wisdom of Washington was, \"Don't worry about China. They are a developing country. Once they become like us - once they become as rich as we are, then they will become just like us.\" Well, it hasn't worked out that way. So at least people have woken up. But you already see things happening. The Justice Department going after Huawei. The extradition of the leader of Huawei in Canada. So every day you see more and more of this happening and now you're starting to see other countries doing it. Poland, numerous countries who are now taking this threat seriously as well, because Huawei is an example is already embedded there, but there's just so much more to do. We still struggle, for example, with academia. I can't tell you how many universities in Florida that I've talked to and said, You have these Confucius Institutes and they're used as agents of influence to shape the narrative and potentially to identify Americans who 20 years from now could be a mayor, could be a congressman, could be a leader of a major corporation and start to sort of recruit them to the Chinese view of things. And how many schools fought us on that. Now, we've gotten them kicked out of almost every school, but one in Florida, and more universities are coming - waking up to that threat, but it is still an enormous challenge to convince academics that this is a threat."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Well, considering that these schools, almost every last one of them rely on tax dollars either through guaranteed student loans or directly through grants to operate, doesn't the Congress have some leverage on this question?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RUBIO",
      "utterance": "We do, and eventually it may get to that point, what we're hoping to do is through these defensive briefings, we and other members of the Intelligence Committee have been hosting these closed meetings with leaders of business, academia, even the press, and sort of walking them through the threat that China poses. And I can tell you two or three years ago, it was a huge challenge because the business community, they just saw China as this huge market they wanted to sell things and make things cheap, and now I think people are starting to wake up to this threat, but we have a long ways to go."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Is it - and my last question, is it a partisan question? I mean, are there senators on the other side, Democrats who understand the threat and are willing to address it in the straightforward way that you are?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RUBIO",
      "utterance": "Yes, absolutely. So Mark Warner is the Vice Chairman of Intelligence and he's one of the leaders and I think this is not - we haven't turned this one into a partisan issue yet."

      "utterance": "Good."

    {
      "speaker": "RUBIO",
      "utterance": "And that's a good thing. I think the challenge really becomes from the pro corporatists, pro-business -- I'm pro-business, but not to the expense of National Security and some idea that ultimately, open trade, more commerce and engagement is -- selling things over there or making things over there is more important than our national security. That's where I think the challenge is more embedded. That's changing a little bit, as I said, but we still have some challenges there."
