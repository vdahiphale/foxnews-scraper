It's a great question, Chris, because it has always been policy of the DOJ and the FBI, when you are doing these things, if there is an individual, an American individual, who is not under scrutiny, to refer to them as U.S. person one, U.S. person two.

Raise the age to buy all guns to 21, ban sale of bump stocks, pass a \"red flag law\", that let families or authorities go to court to take guns away from mentally ill or violent people, $450 million to harden schools and putting law enforcement in every school, $50 million for mental health.

One, we have to make sure our schools are safe -- law enforcement. Harden the schools. We've got to make sure we deal with the fact that there are people out there that have mental illness issues, they shouldn't have access to a gun. If you threaten people or yourself -- you shouldn't have access to a gun. So, everything I'm doing is how do you solve the problem? I'm a business person.

I'm going to work every day, between now and the end of session, on one purpose -- get this passed. Make sure we get the $500 million funding. Make sure we have the law enforcement, the mental health issues, make sure we're not -- people are not going to have access to a gun.

Back in 2011, you signed something called the Docs versus Glocks law, which prohibited doctors from asking any of their patients whether or not they had guns. In 2016, after the terrible mass shooting at the Orlando Pulse nightclub, you said the Second Amendment doesn't kill people, evil kills people. And just this last April, here's you in talking to the NRA. Here you are."

But you also have to make sure you protect your, you know, your citizens, your kids. And so, you've got weigh each of these things. What I did here is say -- I'm going to do what I can to make sure guns are not in the hands of the wrong people. If you have a mental illness, you shouldn't have a gun. If you've threatened others or you threaten yourself, you shouldn't have a gun. So I'm going to do everything I can to do that, at the same time, harden our schools, significant law enforcement presence and also make sure we share information. That's one of the issues that we deal with. We've got to share information when we know somebody has mental problems, you've got to be -- all the agencies, whether it's law or, you know, state agencies have to share information."

We've got to focus on solutions that work -- banning the people that are going to potentially cause the problems. So it's all these things together. But I'm against people that are going to potentially cause the harm and we know they are. There are so many -- I mean, look at what's common. These people are talking about what they're doing. They're threatening others. This individual -- look at all the problems he had and it wasn't stopped."

      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "Yes, I'm going to pick up on the lapses and that's certainly a big part of the problem, at least in this particular case. But I want to focus on the guns just one more time. Look at these mass shootings in just a little over the last two years. December 2015, San Bernardino, 14 dead. June 2016, Orlando, 49 dead. October 2017, Las Vegas, 58 dead. November 2017, Sutherland Springs, Texas, 26 dead. And now Parkland, 17 dead. I understand, it's the person who fires the weapon. As you say, it's evil. But don't these assault weapons allow an evil person to kill more people, more quickly?"

You know, we had the airport shooting a little over a year ago and now, we have this -- I mean, your heart goes out to everybody that's been impacted. So, you've got to weigh. You've got to weigh our constitutional rights, which I believe in, against public safety. So, and that's what I'm trying to do with this. And that's why it's not just one thing. It's everything. I listened, I listened to law enforcement. I brought them up. I listened to educators. I listened to mental health people. I listened to students. I've talked to parents. And I believe what we're doing will -- I believe it will stop this from happening. That's my goal. I want to do everything I can in my job right now to make sure this doesn't happen again."

Hold people accountable. The local sheriff's department, they've got to be completely transparent. We have to do a thorough investigation and whoever didn't do their job has to be held accountable.

Andrew, when you were at the White House, at that very raw, emotional moment, you said after 9/11 we fixed the situation. We made it a lot harder for people to get onto planes with guns.

I just had to listen to you and Governor Scott talk about gun control. Gun control is a big issue. No one in America is going to gun together on gun control, Chris. We're here -- you didn't say one thing about fixing it. The American people, we could get together on school safety, but when you polarize it, this event and every other media, we don't care about gun control right now. That's a big issue in the country and you are not going to get everyone together on it. But we are going to get everyone together on fixing our schools and I just listen to you. So, I just listen to you. You didn't talk -- you didn't mention one question to Governor Scott about what are we going to do about the security of our children? How are we going to do that? But you are just talking about gun control, which is going to just give you more ratings and every other media or event. My daughter is dead, I want to know our kids are going to school in Kentucky on Monday, how are those kids safe? How about bringing that up to the media? How about bringing that up to Governor Scott? Not about guns. It's not about guns now. Today, it's not about guns. It's about the safety in our schools. And that's what you ask Governor Scott about and I got to listen to that at my house. My kid is not here because the schools weren't safe, that's the main thing. If you go into a courthouse, the judge is safe. The stenographer is not worried someone is coming in with a gun because they can't get in with a gun. The American people, we just want our school safe. We don't want to talk about guns right now."

Like right now, Governor Scott, Governor Scott is doing what he had to do, but he also had to go visit the parents of dead kids for two weeks. I'm on right now today because I want to tell every governor in every other state -- they need to be proactive right now.

She was the -- she was the one charged with -- after the shooting in Sutherland Springs, Texas, with -- with fixing the problem of the federal government having 7,000 Air Force personnel, I believe the number was, who should not have had weapons who were not in the database that would have kept them from getting weapons. So -- but I think Mr. Pollack has hit it. This is about looking at our schools. I had breakfast yesterday morning with my goddaughter, who's in high school in Frisco, Texas.

And then finally he put a number around it. He said, if you're under 21, you shouldn't have a gun. Well, I don't see that flying through Congress. I mean the right are not happy about that. And, you know, I've been getting text messages this morning, even just pointing to his interview last night with Jeanine Pirro, Judge Jeanine, he kept pushing that point. I don't see that getting anywhere in Congress. The Cornyn bill, people talk about it like it's a fait accompli, you know, fixing this national instant background check. That's even going to be like, you know, not the easiest thing in the world. I think they can get it through. But the problem is, people will want to turn this into a Christmas tree. They'll want to attach every little thing that they've been wanting in terms of gun control. And that's the way you kill these bills.

If they want to be more protected in the classroom, should we tell them no? I think that's a debate that needs to happen out there.

In the memo, the Democratic memo, you say that's not true. Explain."

And -- and if we have time, we'll cover the question of whether the Steele information has been -- the Steele dossier has been in any way discredited because it largely hasn't. But, nonetheless, the point is that the -- as memo makes clear, Carter Page was of interest for his connections to the Russians for years before 2016. October of 2016. He had had all sorts of contact. He had been with the Russians. He'd been interviewed by the FBI.

Andrew McCabe did not say that the FISA warrant would not have been sought. What he did say was that the warrant as -- the application itself, which, of course, went through all sorts of scrutiny at DOJ and then was scrutinized by a Republican federal judge, that all of its pieces were important.

One of the Republicans' main complaints is that the government never informed the court -- when it sought the warrant to monitor Carter Page -- never informed them that the dossier had been paid for by the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee. You -- in writing the memo -- I say you collectively -- quote this from the application for the warrant. The FBI speculates that the identified U.S. person -- and you identify him as Glenn Simpson of Fusion GPS -- was likely looking for information that could have been used to discredit candidate number one's -- that's Donald Trump's -- campaign speculates likely. Shouldn't the FBI have been a lot clearer to the court that the Steele dossier was bought and paid for by the Clinton campaign?"

In other words, he's been hired by Fusion GPS, which has been hired by a law firm, which has been hired by the DNC and the Clinton campaign. But to answer your question directly, Chris, you can read, and the American public can read, what was actually shown to the judge. It says that the individual who did this work was acting in a way that was designed to find dirt, not the exact word, but designed to find dirt on Donald Trump, was being paid, so why didn't the FBI, in the FISA, application name Clinton, DNC and Fusion GPS? It's a great question, Chris, because it has always been policy of the DOJ and the FBI, when you are doing these things, if there is an individual, an American individual, who is not under scrutiny, to refer to them as U.S. person one, U.S. person two. And I remind you that the last fall scandal that Devin Nunes generated was around whether there had been improper unmasking of U.S. person information by Susan Rice, by Sam Power. We went through a whole investigation around that. And so now the Republicans are saying, well, they didn't specifically name Clinton and DNC.

Again, we know that Devin -- Devin of the midnight run where he goes to the White House to get information to suggest that there had been wiretapping of Donald Trump. We know that that's not true. I referred to the unmasking scandal, which turns out not to be true. Now it turns out that the FBI used, as part of a much larger FISA application, some information that it received from Christopher Steele, a highly trusted source with a long history with the FBI --"

    {

      "utterance": "Well, remember, unverified does not mean unreliable. Unverified means that the FBI has not been able to do all of their work to determine what is true and what is not true. That's the nature of raw intelligence. But, Chris, I'm glad you bring up Jim Comey, because the whole premise of Devin's campaign here is that the FBI and the DOJ were biased against Donald Trump. Chris, let's take a big step back here. In the campaign itself, while -- and now we know because you can read about it in the Democratic memo -- while there was an FBI investigation of the Trump campaign and of multiple individuals in the Trump campaign, you do not hear a word from the FBI about that very serious investigation about the possibility of Russian collusion with the campaign, but you hear Jim Comey, time and again out there, saying, we are investigating Hillary Clinton, now we're not investigating Hillary Clinton, now we're back to investigating Hillary Clinton. A lot of people believe that Jim Comey's actions may have prevented Hillary Clinton from becoming president of the United States. But Devin's contention is that, oh, well, the FBI and the DOJ are actually biased against Donald Trump. I've got to tell you, if there was any bias within the FBI and the DOJ, they should -- they had a very, very weird way of showing it during the campaign itself."

      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "Well, here you're getting to -- to the bottom line because all -- for all the talk about dueling memos, which I think are confusing a lot of people, and the surveillance of Carter Page, most people want to know one thing, is there hard evidence that Donald Trump and/or his campaign colluded with the Russians to interfere with the 2016 election? As you sit here today as the number two Democrat on the House Intel Committee, do you have any evidence of that or not?"

And the national security advisor for Donald Trump has pled guilty to lying about contacts with Russia. We know that those contacts exist. We know that George Papadopoulos had conversations with Russia. Carter Page --"

    {
      "speaker": "HIMES",
      "utterance": "Well, it depends on how you define collusion. When George Papadopoulos hears from somebody associated with the Russians that they're about to release a whole bunch of information and then they do, when Donald Trump Jr. invites Russians into his office in order to get dirt on the Clinton campaign. Chris, you tell me if that crosses your threshold for collusion. But that is hardly really (INAUDIBLE) innocent (ph)."

      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "Well, frankly, sir, as long as you asked, no, it doesn't. I mean -- I mean you can say that they were conversations, but that certainly doesn't indicate there was a conspiracy by the Trump campaign and the Russian -- and the Kremlin to -- to interfere. I mean that indicates that there were -- there were contacts, but it certainly doesn't -- are you basing it on -- on that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HIMES",
      "utterance": "Well, again, I'm not jumping to conclusions as to what the investigations that are not finished yet are going to show. I'm just going to tell you that if nothing else, if the president of the United States' son says, boy, do I want to get dirt on Hillary Clinton and I can't wait to release it during the summer when it will do the maximum damage, and he knows that the individuals concerned are Russian -- and, by the way, this is not the investigation, this is Donald Trump Jr. admitting to this meeting when, you know, you have 20 indictments, some of which are -- most of which are Russian related, let's just say, without trying to prejudice where this investigation is going to go, it's like -- it's -- you can't say that there is absolutely no there there.
