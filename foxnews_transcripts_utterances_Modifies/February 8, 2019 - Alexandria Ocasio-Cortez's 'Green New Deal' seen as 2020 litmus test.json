Let's lead off tonight with the new allegations against the lieutenant governor of Virginia, Justin Fairfax. A woman named Meredith Watson claims that Fairfax raped her at Duke University back in 2000, that she has emails, Facebook posts, and friends who will back this up. A statement from a law firm representing her out of Montclair, New Jersey, says \"At this time Ms. Watson is reluctantly coming forward out of a strong sense of civic duty in her belief that those seeking or serving in public office should be of the highest character. She has no interest in becoming a media personality or reliving the trauma that has greatly affected her life. Similarly, she is not seeking any financial damages. On behalf of our client we have notified Justin Fairfax through his attorneys that Ms. Watson hopes he will resign from public office.\"  Ellison, what is your read on the ground there in Richmond tonight about all of this?",

We had this situation where so far there have just been so many names, so many different scandals that at times it is just overwhelming. Yesterday there were new names, new scandals, peripheral scandals coming out related to all of this, and really the mood at times has been just how on earth do you follow along with all of this.  But by today, some of the pressure, particularly on the elected officials, particularly on Lieutenant Governor Justin Fairfax to resign seemed to be subsiding. You had a lot of Democrats saying that the governor needed to step down, but they were holding off on calling for that when it comes to the lieutenant governor. Instead, they were saying we think these allegations from the first woman, Dr. Vanessa Tyson, we think those are credible, they should be looked into. We need an investigation to gather the facts. Now, in the last hour and a half with this latest accuser, you have a complete reversal where tons of people from outside are now saying, he's got to go, he's got to go now. He's buckling down, but that just changed everything with the second accuser.",

What should happen here, Charles? CHARLES LANE, OPINION WRITER, \"WASHINGTON POST\": He may try to ride this out. As desperate as his situation appears, he does have a strong base of support in the state. He looks terrible now because he's in the middle of this storm, but we are forgetting it was just a few days ago when it looked like Ralph Northam might be forced to step down, Justin Fairfax is being hailed as this sort of this shining, young star in Virginia politics. He has a strong support in the black community. He is the top African- American public official in the state. And I wouldn't underestimate his ability to mount a counterattack.   What this shows, generally though, is something that I felt was true from the very beginning of the Me Too movement. It is going to be very, very hard for any political party to be consistent about applying these principles, because at a certain point, your party interests will clash with the consistent holding to account of your officials.

Let's lead off tonight with the new allegations against the lieutenant governor of Virginia, Justin Fairfax. A woman named Meredith Watson claims that Fairfax raped her at Duke University back in 2000, that she has emails, Facebook posts, and friends who will back this up. A statement from a law firm representing her out of Montclair, New Jersey, says \"At this time Ms. Watson is reluctantly coming forward out of a strong sense of civic duty in her belief that those seeking or serving in public office should be of the highest character. She has no interest in becoming a media personality or reliving the trauma that has greatly affected her life. Similarly, she is not seeking any financial damages. On behalf of our client we have notified Justin Fairfax through his attorneys that Ms. Watson hopes he will resign from public office.\" Ellison, what is your read on the ground there in Richmond tonight about all of this?"

We had this situation where so far there have just been so many names, so many different scandals that at times it is just overwhelming. Yesterday there were new names, new scandals, peripheral scandals coming out related to all of this, and really the mood at times has been just how on earth do you follow along with all of this. But by today, some of the pressure, particularly on the elected officials, particularly on Lieutenant Governor Justin Fairfax to resign seemed to be subsiding. You had a lot of Democrats saying that the governor needed to step down, but they were holding off on calling for that when it comes to the lieutenant governor. Instead, they were saying we think these allegations from the first woman, Dr. Vanessa Tyson, we think those are credible, they should be looked into. We need an investigation to gather the facts. Now, in the last hour and a half with this latest accuser, you have a complete reversal where tons of people from outside are now saying, he's got to go, he's got to go now. He's buckling down, but that just changed everything with the second accuser."

      "utterance": "Well, don't rush to judgment. My God, the Democrats unleashed this monster of character assassination against Brett Kavanaugh and all of a sudden they're calling for due process? It's ridiculous. The monster that they unleashed is coming back to devour them. They said in the Kavanaugh case accusations along are enough, and now they can't turn around and call for due process. On the other --"

This new Dr. Tyson who accused him, the first accuser, she knew where it happened, when it happened. If you read through the details of what happened to her, it's searing. And she's a respected professor. This is a person who commands some respect. And the Democrats --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROBERTS",
      "utterance": "But Christine Blasey Ford was a respected professor as well, and yet, Republicans said don't believe a thing that she says. Fairfax says in a statement \"I deny this latest unsubstantiated allegation. It is demonstrably false. I have never forced myself on anyone.\" He's demanding a full investigation. What should happen here, Charles? CHARLES LANE, OPINION WRITER, \"WASHINGTON POST\": He may try to ride this out. As desperate as his situation appears, he does have a strong base of support in the state. He looks terrible now because he's in the middle of this storm, but we are forgetting it was just a few days ago when it looked like Ralph Northam might be forced to step down, Justin Fairfax is being hailed as this sort of this shining, young star in Virginia politics. He has a strong support in the black community. He is the top African- American public official in the state. And I wouldn't underestimate his ability to mount a counterattack. What this shows, generally though, is something that I felt was true from the very beginning of the Me Too movement. It is going to be very, very hard for any political party to be consistent about applying these principles, because at a certain point, your party interests will clash with the consistent holding to account of your officials. And I think that is part of what is happening with the Virginia Democrats."

Republicans rallied to Brett Kavanaugh, they believed his story, and there were political ramifications of that belief --"

What 2020 Democrat is going to want to appear at a rally with the governor, the lieutenant governor, or the attorney general? This is a big problem not just for the Virginia Democratic Party but the national Democratic Party."
    },

      "speaker": "THIESSEN",
      "utterance": "I disagree there is a parallel. Brett Kavanaugh denied that he was even at the event. Fairfax admits there was sexual contact with the victims. They have in details that details Christine Blasey Ford couldn't remember where it happened, when it happened, how she got home. There's detailed allegations. So this whole concept of the accusation is enough, the Democrats are not being consistent, and they need to be."

The other one is going to be, do more women come out? The statement that we have tonight from the law firm representing Meredith Watson very clearly says, and I'm going to read it to you with, \"Ms. Watson was upset to learn Mr. Fairfax raped at least one other woman after he attacked her.\" The lieutenant governor of course is denying this entire statement, but that implies that there could be more women coming forward. Moving forward, that is going to be the question, is how many more Democrats speak out, and do other women come forward as well?"

She is going to make the Democrats unelectable in 2020 by going down this path. The Democrats want to take your car, they want to take your house, they want to take your health insurance, they want to take away your air travel, and they even want to take your hamburgers. That is the platform on which they are going to be running in 2020. Republicans are going to wrap this around the Democrats necks like an albatross and ride it into the next election."

It's a GOP dream.\" Is it, Charles?"

It is true by putting all of these specifics out there at least in the form of this resolution, they have hung their hats on something pretty controversial. But the reason they fastened on this phrase, \"Green New Deal,\" is that those two phrases, \"Green,\" and \"New Deal,\" poll pretty well. If they had managed to stick to the vague generality of, you know what, we're going to have a big environmental program, they might have done better out of it. But they now going to have to defend a lot of hard to defend things."

    {
      "speaker": "CONTINETTI",
      "utterance": "Popular in the abstract and unpopular in the specifics. I was struck by two things. One is, I think it's intellectually dishonest, because you have these grand plans but you forswear nuclear power. There is no way we can even begin to make a huge dent in our carbon missions without embracing nuclear. And the second thing, John, was there's a sentence in Ocasio-Cortez's document where she writes we're going to guarantee economic security to people unable or unwilling to work. That would overturn the entirety of the American welfare state, beginning with the New Deal. We have always provided for people who are incapable of working. She wants to say, no, it doesn't matter whether you are capable or not. If you don't want to work, we'll take care of you anyway. This is a radical plan."

So in the State of the Union address he was extremely conciliatory, he asked Democrats to reject the politics of revenge, resistance, and retribution, and embrace the boundless potential of cooperation, compromise, and common good. Today, 47 million Americans watched that. Today millions of Americans watched this appalling partisan display and embrace of revenge, resistance, and retribution."
