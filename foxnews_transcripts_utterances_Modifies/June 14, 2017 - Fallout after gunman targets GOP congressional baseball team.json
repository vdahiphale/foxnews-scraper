Hello everyone, I'm Kimberly Guilfoyle and this is \"The Five.\" Just after 7 a.m. this morning, an active heinous political violence broke out in the suburbs outside of Washington, D.C. A gunman named James Thomas Hodgkinson, a 66-year-old from Illinois who belong to a Facebook group called terminate the Republican Party, open fire with a rifle at a group of Republican members of Congress. The GOP lawmakers were practicing for the annual Congressional baseball game, which will still take place tomorrow night.  Five people were wounded in the shooting, including Steve Scalise, the number three House Republican leader. He is recovering from surgery now in the hospital, and President Trump just made a surprise visit. More on that in a moment. Police shot the gunman dead, and a witness captured this dramatic footage of the shooting.",

That he suffered critical injuries and is in critical condition, but information from this hospital has been a very, very sparse. Unusually so. I've never seen anything like this in fact when you're dealing with a high level public figure who has been the victim of a gunshot wound. There have been a grand total of two communications from this hospital, one about ten hours ago, it was a tweet, and another about five hours ago. Just over five hours ago. Another tweet, and that has been the sum total. We know right now that Mr. Scalise is being visited by the President and First Lady, a visit which has done very quiet and a sort of spontaneous visit. We didn't see helicopters overhead as par for the course when you have a presidential motorcade going through town. We even understood from the pool that some of the traffic lights in town were obeyed by the presidential motorcade. But they came here in an entrance not where we are.  This is a huge complex encompassing not just the MedStar Washington Hospital here, but also a VA hospital and the Children's National Medical Center. So, they came through some entrance that we have not seen bearing flowers which they have now delivered to the House Majority Whip. It is safe to say, and we are not hearing this from the hospital, but it is safe to say that given the fact that he was shot in the hip with a high-powered rifle, that it would not be beyond the realm of possibility that he will be facing numerous surgeries ahead.   So, devastating is a bullet wound of that sort. Oftentimes, we don't know this to be the case, but often times in this kind of injuries, you are looking at a team of doctors trying to repair and stem the blood flow, and then come back at a later date to do reconstructive surgery because these kinds of bullets can absolutely wreak havoc on human tissue and human bone. And so, it would be safe to say that Mr. Scalise is looking at a long term recovery indeed. There is another patient here at the hospital. It is the Capitol police officer Crystal Griner who was shot in the foot. We also believe that the second Capitol police officer, Mr. Bailey was brought here, but his wounds were not from the gunshot. They may have been inflicted from just the chaos, and was brought here. He did not need treatment and was released. The head of the Capitol police office paid a visit here early in the afternoon and praised his officers here.  We also know that a couple of the other victims, Zach Barth for example, a staffer for Congressman Roger Williams, is being treated at an undisclosed hospital. We only know that because he tweeted that he had been injured in the shooting but that he was okay. And we later heard from a family spokesperson that he was wounded in the calf muscle. But the President and First Lady are still here, as best we know. Hope to have more information later on. Back to you.",

But then I started hearing everyone talking about how one needs to calm your rhetoric, and we need to start re-examine how we deal with each other. I don't know if that's right. Because I do feel that we should be angry, and we should be angry at the angry people. The people who have been waging a campaign of rage for decades, since the beginning of the Bill Ayers movement to the anti-fa, who romanticized violence and romanticized revolution.  This is not new. This is radicalism and its purest sense, and this is not senseless violence. People call this stuff says, no, there is a purpose to this. There was a reason why I did this. A story came out today about Betsy DeVos, right? Remember her? She has needed $8 million worth of security since she got the job for the last eight months or so since she became known or if she's going to get the job. Eight million dollars from the security. Why is it?  Because the tax on her were explicitly sanctioned by the media and by liberals because they felt that her beliefs on school choice and her beliefs on education were harmful. So it wasn't that she was wrong, it was that she was evil. And so, if you look at all of the arguments that are directed at Trump, or directed at Republicans, it's not that their policies are wrong, it's that they are immoral and that they are evil. And that sanctions the violent behavior, and that is not a new idea. That is an idea that has been around since the late 60s and the early 70s. This is a culmination of a toxic doctrine. And we cannot be surprised by this. This guy is a leftist radical.",

Because he attacked these men because they were Republican in order to advance his own political ideas. Terrorism is the definition of it.  Is that you attack innocent people to advance your ideology or your political idea, and that's what I think that we should be calling it, and be very open about that.

And that question remains to be answered. I think Dana is right. This is political terrorism. This was democracy being shot today. When you attack a congressman, you are attacking the constitution. So, the neighbor suggested that the Democratic rhetoric might have contributed to this. The brother suggested that this guy was very disturbed by Trump's election. And just looking at his social media account, his letter sent to the editor, sadly, this is par for the course for a hard-core anti-Trump Democrat. And there's millions of people's Facebook pages and social media accounts that look exactly like these guys here, and that is scary. To say, you know, you are part of the resistance, he's an occupy Wall Street guy.   He calls Donald Trump a traitor and an a-hole, and he is a Putin colluder. And, you know, this stuff builds up when you call Republicans greedy racist and you kind of mix into this toxic stew. You know, political hysteria, potentially, has consequences. And people on Twitter were accelerating this, which is also very alarming.

Remember, Alan Dershowitz, a liberal expert said there was not a case here when the president allegedly told call Comey I hope you let the case against Michael Flynn go. What is new is that, tonight the Washington Post claims, special counsel Robert Mueller has his investigators interviewing top officials like the DNI Dan Coats and Mike Rogers the head of the NSA. We did not know that previously. What he is trying to find out is whether the president tries to get them to shut down any aspect of the Russia probe. Remember, Rogers at the NSA has testified the president never told him to do anything illegal or immoral,\" and Coat said he did not feel pressure to intervene. The FBI leak information regarding the president is outrageous, inexcusable and illegal. This is not the kind of pres the president wanted tonight. It's his 71st birthday.

Hello everyone, I'm Kimberly Guilfoyle and this is \"The Five.\" Just after 7 a.m. this morning, an active heinous political violence broke out in the suburbs outside of Washington, D.C. A gunman named James Thomas Hodgkinson, a 66-year-old from Illinois who belong to a Facebook group called terminate the Republican Party, open fire with a rifle at a group of Republican members of Congress. The GOP lawmakers were practicing for the annual Congressional baseball game, which will still take place tomorrow night. Five people were wounded in the shooting, including Steve Scalise, the number three House Republican leader. He is recovering from surgery now in the hospital, and President Trump just made a surprise visit. More on that in a moment. Police shot the gunman dead, and a witness captured this dramatic footage of the shooting."

      "utterance": "Well, the last report we have from the hospital is that he is in critical condition. That he suffered critical injuries and is in critical condition, but information from this hospital has been a very, very sparse. Unusually so. I've never seen anything like this in fact when you're dealing with a high level public figure who has been the victim of a gunshot wound. There have been a grand total of two communications from this hospital, one about ten hours ago, it was a tweet, and another about five hours ago. Just over five hours ago. Another tweet, and that has been the sum total. We know right now that Mr. Scalise is being visited by the President and First Lady, a visit which has done very quiet and a sort of spontaneous visit. We didn't see helicopters overhead as par for the course when you have a presidential motorcade going through town. We even understood from the pool that some of the traffic lights in town were obeyed by the presidential motorcade. But they came here in an entrance not where we are. This is a huge complex encompassing not just the MedStar Washington Hospital here, but also a VA hospital and the Children's National Medical Center. So, they came through some entrance that we have not seen bearing flowers which they have now delivered to the House Majority Whip. It is safe to say, and we are not hearing this from the hospital, but it is safe to say that given the fact that he was shot in the hip with a high-powered rifle, that it would not be beyond the realm of possibility that he will be facing numerous surgeries ahead. So, devastating is a bullet wound of that sort. Oftentimes, we don't know this to be the case, but often times in this kind of injuries, you are looking at a team of doctors trying to repair and stem the blood flow, and then come back at a later date to do reconstructive surgery because these kinds of bullets can absolutely wreak havoc on human tissue and human bone. And so, it would be safe to say that Mr. Scalise is looking at a long term recovery indeed. There is another patient here at the hospital. It is the Capitol police officer Crystal Griner who was shot in the foot. We also believe that the second Capitol police officer, Mr. Bailey was brought here, but his wounds were not from the gunshot. They may have been inflicted from just the chaos, and was brought here. He did not need treatment and was released. The head of the Capitol police office paid a visit here early in the afternoon and praised his officers here. We also know that a couple of the other victims, Zach Barth for example, a staffer for Congressman Roger Williams, is being treated at an undisclosed hospital. We only know that because he tweeted that he had been injured in the shooting but that he was okay. And we later heard from a family spokesperson that he was wounded in the calf muscle. But the President and First Lady are still here, as best we know. Hope to have more information later on. Back to you."

But then I started hearing everyone talking about how one needs to calm your rhetoric, and we need to start re-examine how we deal with each other. I don't know if that's right. Because I do feel that we should be angry, and we should be angry at the angry people. The people who have been waging a campaign of rage for decades, since the beginning of the Bill Ayers movement to the anti-fa, who romanticized violence and romanticized revolution. This is not new. This is radicalism and its purest sense, and this is not senseless violence. People call this stuff says, no, there is a purpose to this. There was a reason why I did this. A story came out today about Betsy DeVos, right? Remember her? She has needed $8 million worth of security since she got the job for the last eight months or so since she became known or if she's going to get the job. Eight million dollars from the security. Why is it? Because the tax on her were explicitly sanctioned by the media and by liberals because they felt that her beliefs on school choice and her beliefs on education were harmful. So it wasn't that she was wrong, it was that she was evil. And so, if you look at all of the arguments that are directed at Trump, or directed at Republicans, it's not that their policies are wrong, it's that they are immoral and that they are evil. And that sanctions the violent behavior, and that is not a new idea. That is an idea that has been around since the late 60s and the early 70s. This is a culmination of a toxic doctrine. And we cannot be surprised by this. This guy is a leftist radical."

Because he attacked these men because they were Republican in order to advance his own political ideas. Terrorism is the definition of it. Is that you attack innocent people to advance your ideology or your political idea, and that's what I think that we should be calling it, and be very open about that. Because, if we sweep it under the rug, a year from now, if the newspaper writes, well, there was a shooting and they just talk about the gun violence part, and not the actual, the ideological reasons for why they were targeted, that would be a huge mistake and a problem for us and trying to solve this overall."

And that question remains to be answered. I think Dana is right. This is political terrorism. This was democracy being shot today. When you attack a congressman, you are attacking the constitution. So, the neighbor suggested that the Democratic rhetoric might have contributed to this. The brother suggested that this guy was very disturbed by Trump's election. And just looking at his social media account, his letter sent to the editor, sadly, this is par for the course for a hard-core anti-Trump Democrat. And there's millions of people's Facebook pages and social media accounts that look exactly like these guys here, and that is scary. To say, you know, you are part of the resistance, he's an occupy Wall Street guy. He calls Donald Trump a traitor and an a-hole, and he is a Putin colluder. And, you know, this stuff builds up when you call Republicans greedy racist and you kind of mix into this toxic stew. You know, political hysteria, potentially, has consequences. And people on Twitter were accelerating this, which is also very alarming. And I think the resistance needs to start resisting committing acts of violence, and you just have to wonder has this hatred permeated the culture so much where people need to really take a step back and reflect, and say what kind of responsibility do I bear for contributing to this stuff?"

People who were there and said it felt like longer. You couldn't even move, and try to attend to the body of congressmen Scalise because he was on the ground for 10 minutes before they could get them out of there, because 50 rounds were being fired, unbelievable.

Ever since the president fired James call me as FBI Director. Lawmakers in both parties have been openly speculating about whether there could be obstruction charges. Remember, Alan Dershowitz, a liberal expert said there was not a case here when the president allegedly told call Comey I hope you let the case against Michael Flynn go. What is new is that, tonight the Washington Post claims, special counsel Robert Mueller has his investigators interviewing top officials like the DNI Dan Coats and Mike Rogers the head of the NSA. We did not know that previously. What he is trying to find out is whether the president tries to get them to shut down any aspect of the Russia probe. Remember, Rogers at the NSA has testified the president never told him to do anything illegal or immoral,\" and Coat said he did not feel pressure to intervene. The FBI leak information regarding the president is outrageous, inexcusable and illegal. This is not the kind of pres the president wanted tonight. It's his 71st birthday. He has his family here so writing that. And also just a moment ago returned to the White House with family members after going to the hospital where congressman Scalise is.
