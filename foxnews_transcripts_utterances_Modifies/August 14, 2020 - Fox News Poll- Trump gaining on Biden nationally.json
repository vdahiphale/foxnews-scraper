You have the virus, then the devastation of the lockdown, and now the looting and destruction and a 37 percent increase in homicide in 20 major cities in America that comes along with that.  And now the language of those who are destroying and stealing is escalating into, not one of shame, but one of purpose. It is a punishment, they say, watch and listen as they explain in this purported video of a Black Lives Matter demonstration that was taken by Concrete Reporting in Seattle the other night.

And that's caused a lot of tension between Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx and the Mayor of Chicago Lori Lightfoot. Although, Lightfoot is not pushing the point publicly. Publicly, they're showing themselves as united against violence. But really the dynamics are tearing Chicago apart.

I mean, obviously, Tom Friedman is not a big fan of President Trump, but he acknowledged in a very big way that this was a huge accomplishment.

Prior to Giuliani coming in in 1994, that's what people did. People left. Nobody wants to live, visit work, go to school in a place where they're not safe. And what did they do when New York City had 2,200 homicides a year? They left. They got out of town, they moved. And then Giuliani came in and cleaned it up. And as we cleaned it up, and violent crime and murder dropped, the people started coming back. Economic values increased. The real estate value increased, tourism increased. But Mr. Kass is right. The taxpayer, the everyday taxpayer, they're not going to take this. They're going to take off and they're going to get out of town."

There are many, many people in Chicago, in Cook County - hundreds of people accused of arrested for murder, sexual assault, and they are put on either - let go on low bonds or put on electronic home monitoring, which is a joke. And that's caused a lot of tension between Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx and the Mayor of Chicago Lori Lightfoot. Although, Lightfoot is not pushing the point publicly. Publicly, they're showing themselves as united against violence. But really the dynamics are tearing Chicago apart. And nationally, Martha, what we're seeing with this Black Lives Matter thing, we've never seen activists actually endorsing looting before or endorsing violence. But now you're seeing like, what was Al Gore's movie \"An Inconvenient Truth.\" This is the inconvenient truth right now in 2020. That the hard Left - the hard, hard Left, Black Lives Matter, Antifa were the shock troops of the Democratic Party. They want and they know that violence can produce results for them, they think."

Joined now by Ambassador Robert O'Brien, the US National Security Advisor. Ambassador Good to have you with us tonight. I mean, obviously, Tom Friedman is not a big fan of President Trump, but he acknowledged in a very big way that this was a huge accomplishment.

And it was really quite an accomplishment not just for the president of United States, but also for Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed and Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu. It took a lot of courage for those men to come together and, and bring peace to their countries. It's only the third time it's happened with Israel and Arab countries. It happened with Egypt and it happened with Jordan. And now we're going to have Netanyahu's name associated with - with Rabin (ph) and with our President and Rabin. And we're going to have Mohammed bin Zayed's name associated with King Hussein and Anwar Sadat. So it was a historic event and I was glad to see that Tom Friedman recognize it as such. As far as your question goes, we've got diplomats fanning out across the region. The president has already been on calls to leaders. I've been on calls with leaders. Jared Kushner has, Secretary of State Pompeo is working on this on his road trip through Eastern Europe.

Now, all of this, obviously, makes Iran very nervous and isolated. And I think it also has an impact on China, which has been trying to build its relationship with Iran and with Saudi Arabia.

The UAE, many people don't realize, is a very capable - small, but very capable military. Israel has the premier military in the region. Of course, the United States is - remains a major player in the Middle East. So there's security cooperation, there can be economic cooperation, and I think other countries are going to be rushing to follow the path that was trod by President Trump and Mohammed bin Zayed and MBZ and Bibi Netanyahu."

I think even Vice President Biden and Senator Harris realize that this is a huge deal as Tom Friedman suggested. I'm sure everybody wants to get on the bandwagon. But this was 100 percent President Trump and his team, Secretary Pompeo, Jared Kushner, Avi Berkowitz, our team at the NSC. Folks really worked hard on this over the past year and a half. And, look, the reason we were able to do this deal and others weren't, is because President Trump built up credibility and confidence in the region. He destroyed the caliphate. He brought justice to Al Baghdadi. He stood up to the Iranians were the past administration gave them $150 billion that they spent on terrorism. We stood up and put maximum pressure on the Iranians. So I think the part - both parties, the Arab parties and the Israeli parties realized that they could trust President Trump. They had confidence in him. He had a lot of credibility. And he used that political capital to help broker this deal. So it was really an outstanding accomplishment for the president, a remarkable accomplishment and the other two who was involved as well."

And these countries all need to build their economies in other ways now and find a way out of the violence that has plagued the region for so long. And it looks like they're looking for some other options, which is obviously a very good sign. With regard to the Iran deal that was voted down at the United Nations, to extend the embargo against their ability to purchase arms, which is now going to run out in October. Obviously, China and Russia were against extending it. But there was also abstentions by France, Britain and Germany, who are all still ancillary in the agreement with Iran.

The idea that Iran would start buying those products from Russia and China within five years, it's just hard to believe. But for the countries that are still committed to the JCPOA, this was just part of the deal that they signed up for. So it's disappointing, but not surprising. We're going to - we have other tools in our toolkit. We're going to take some severe measures up at the UN. And I think you can expect snapback sanctions to come into play. And this isn't over yet. We lost today, but it's not over yet. But this was something that was baked into the cake by the Obama-Biden administration back when they signed this flawed deal."

Sarah, you answered a lot of questions about this and your time at the White House. It does seem unlikely that that it stops hear that.

The real problem for Democrats is the scandal that they tried to push was never the big problem.

They had -- they had a lot of disaffection among traditional Republican voters so this could be a sign of party unity because here's the deal. They are facing down the potential, lose the Senate, smaller House minority, a lot of bad news shaping up for them.

Our company commander broke open the beer and we celebrated with great honor that happiness of having the Japanese surrender and we did not have to go and die in Japan. RONALD \"RONDO\" SCHARFE, IWO JIMA SURVIVOR: Your mind takes the memories, which is, which are the same ways, some are good, some are bad. Some are happy, some are sad. But the thing is I'm here above ground and I really miss all my brothers that I left over there, I wish they were here with me getting the chance to live the kind of life that I have."

      "utterance": "They put the lights on and they said the Japanese have surrender, the war is over. All the people in radio city went wild, we went down there to Times Square, a million people, and the bartender put all the glasses up on the bar and he's pouring the booze and whatever he poured, you drank. So, what comes down into Times Square, the war is over and boy, I have to tell you, Times Square was wild. And I had quite a few drinks in me and I saw the nurse. If that girl did not have a nurse's uniform on, I never would've done that. And what I remembered out there. And that's what fit it."
