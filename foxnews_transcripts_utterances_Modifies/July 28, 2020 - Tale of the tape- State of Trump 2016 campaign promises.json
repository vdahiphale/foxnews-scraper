Some of the biggest news out of the White House today is the fact that the Department of Homeland Security is going to undertake a thorough review of the so-called DACA program, the dreamers' Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals to determine whether that program should continue and if it shouldn't continue, how to wind it down.  In the meantime, the Department of Homeland Security will not be taking any new initial applications for new DACA recipients. The renewal for the DACA program will be done on a case by case basis. And the period of renewal would be reduced from two years to one year. And unless it's extraordinary circumstances, current DACA recipients will not be able to leave the country. Now, when the president first heard about the Supreme Court decision regarding DACA, he suggested that he was going to implement a fix that may include a path to citizenship for current DACA recipients. I asked him about that at the briefing a short time ago. Listen here.",

First, Beyond Our Borders tonight. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un says his country's hard-won nuclear weapons are a solid security guarantee.

Two bases in the Middle East housing U.S. troops and aircraft went on high alert when Iranian missiles appeared to be headed for them. The U.S. Central Command says American service members at bases in the United Arab Emirates and in Qatar were told to quickly find shelter when several missiles were fired from Iran. Ultimately, the missiles landed well shorts and out to sea. The launches were part of an Iranian military exercise in the Persian Gulf.

BRYON YORK, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, \"WASHINGTON EXAMINER\": This has been a Democratic talking point in recent days. It was a Democratic talking point in 2016, by the way, when Donald Trump was a private citizen running for president, there was talk about him somehow not accepting the results had he lost. But he won. But we're hearing a lot about this. And the issue is that the parties seem to have just divided over this issue of voting by mail, and Attorney General Barr was really pretty skeptical about that and believed that it does have the potential for fraud. And also a bigger thing -- even if there were absolutely zero fraud, we've got a few congressional elections in New York that are still undecided because they have been having massive problems with counting and seeing which mail-in ballots are legitimate. This is an enormous problem, and these are in congressional districts in New York state. Put that in a national context, in a presidential election where there's far, far more voting by mail than there ever has been before, and there could be enormous problems. We might not find out who actually won for weeks afterwards. Meanwhile, there is just terrible partisan wrangling going on ala Bush v Gore. So there are some really bad scenarios for voting by mail, and the attorney general simply recognized some of those.",

In the meantime, the Department of Homeland Security will not be taking any new initial applications for new DACA recipients. The renewal for the DACA program will be done on a case by case basis. And the period of renewal would be reduced from two years to one year. And unless it's extraordinary circumstances, current DACA recipients will not be able to leave the country. Now, when the president first heard about the Supreme Court decision regarding DACA, he suggested that he was going to implement a fix that may include a path to citizenship for current DACA recipients.

We wanted to make sure the American people saw what is really happening in these cities. Portland has been under siege. The federal building in Portland as Bill Barr testified today, under siege for almost nine weeks, 61 straight days. And Bill Barr did a great job today. He's doing a great job as attorney general but he asked a fundamental question, why won't the Democrats condemn the mob? Why won't they condemn the rioters? Why won't they condemn what's happening to the federal building in Portland? And when we ask him would that federal building be standing today but for federal officers defending it, he said, no it would not. Would St. John Church be standing today but for actions by the federal government? No, it would not. That's the fundamental issue that Americans see it.

They want to try to blame the administration for that, they're just flat out wrong. How about the -- how about the police chief in Seattle who sent a letter to the residents and the business owners in Seattle and said, the City Council just passed something that doesn't allow our officers to protect you from violent crowds. I'm putting you on notice. We will have to do a quote, adjusted deployment, which was a nice way of telling those business owners and residents, we're not going to be there. We would love to be -- Carmen Best, the police chief, she was doing what you're supposed to as a leader. She was -- she was trying to serve the constituents, serve her -- the people in her city. But she had to tell them, look, they're tying our hands. I would like to help you but the Democrat controlled nine -- excuse me, eight Democrats and one socialist on the Seattle City Council are making it tough for us to do our job, we're warning you. That's what Bill Barr is criticizing. That's what's wrong. And all we -- all we did is point out what is happening in so many of our major -- in the United States of America. This kind of stuff is going on. That is -- this idea -- and Bill Barr talked about this, this idea of defunding the police, it is dangerous.

The Democrats wouldn't let the attorney general answer questions and then they tried to stop him from taking a restroom break for goodness sake. That's the treatment the Democrats give the attorney general of the United States. It is -- it is wrong. American people saw it for what it was.

Two bases in the Middle East housing U.S. troops and aircraft went on high alert when Iranian missiles appeared to be headed for them.

What the American people saw was Democrats relentlessly attacking the character and the credibility of the attorney general while he sat there and tried to answer, and they would cut him off and stop him from answering. You quoted one of the congressmen saying he doesn't -- questioning his credibility. How would he know? He didn't let him answer a question. They didn't even give him a lunch break. It was just awful. But the truth is that we did learn some things, and it was useful for him to sit through that because the chairman of that committee said just the other day that what's happening in Portland is at mid spread in Washington, and at a bare minimum the American people saw a video of what was happening in Portland actually happening, and they saw the attorney general describing how they're using sling shots with ball bearings that have injured officers to the bone, using kerosene filled balloons to set fires to draw them outside so that they can attack them.

From the point of view of Barr, and I thought he laid out his case extremely forcefully, is that a federal building is under attack. So you've got this extremely polarized view. It's the same thing with the view of the Justice Department itself. From the Democrats' point of view Barr is doing favors for Trump and Trump's friends.

BRYON YORK, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, \"WASHINGTON EXAMINER\": This has been a Democratic talking point in recent days. It was a Democratic talking point in 2016, by the way, when Donald Trump was a private citizen running for president, there was talk about him somehow not accepting the results had he lost. But he won. But we're hearing a lot about this. And the issue is that the parties seem to have just divided over this issue of voting by mail, and Attorney General Barr was really pretty skeptical about that and believed that it does have the potential for fraud. And also a bigger thing -- even if there were absolutely zero fraud, we've got a few congressional elections in New York that are still undecided because they have been having massive problems with counting and seeing which mail-in ballots are legitimate. This is an enormous problem, and these are in congressional districts in New York state. Put that in a national context, in a presidential election where there's far, far more voting by mail than there ever has been before, and there could be enormous problems. We might not find out who actually won for weeks afterwards. Meanwhile, there is just terrible partisan wrangling going on ala Bush v Gore. So there are some really bad scenarios for voting by mail, and the attorney general simply recognized some of those."

He's got this high approval ratings. They're highly thought of, but nobody likes me. It can only be my personality. That's all."

    {
      "speaker": "BREAM",
      "utterance": "Well, a little bit of levity from the president there today. We're back with our panel, and Mara, I want to start with you. There has been so much about trying to pit Dr. Fauci against President Trump, and yet when confronted face-to-face they each will say we get along fine. We discuss things. We meet. Everything is great. I think so much of him and it's wonderful. And yet there is this constant attempt at driving a wedge between the two. What do you make of it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LIASSON",
      "utterance": "Yes, I think that it's in neither of their interests to have a wedge driven between the two of them. Dr. Fauci is the good housekeeping seal of approval on this pandemic, and he has been all along. There have been times when the president was more interested in opening the economy, that he wasn't meeting with Fauci enough, as much as he had been, or he wasn't having him to the briefings. But what I don't understand, and it's mystifying to me, is why does President Trump continue to retweet disparaging comments about Dr. Fauci? That I just don't understand. I don't think it's in his interests to undermine the credibility of Dr. Fauci."

There's a fight over these plus-up for unemployment benefits. Today the two sides don't seem much closer together. Byron, here is what former senator Phil Gramm, who is known for crunching the numbers, here is what he had to say."

    {
      "speaker": "YORK",
      "utterance": "Well, that's Phil Gramm's view, and certainly people who need more unemployment aid would certainly disagree with that. On the other hand, when the two sides are trillions of dollars apart, that's a real problem. And Republicans are not united on this. I want to say one thing, though, about this news conference. The president did announce, began by announcing a $765 million loan to Kodak, the photography company, to start making pharmaceuticals, actually the building blocks of generic drugs, in part to address our scandalous reliance on China. I think in the last year or two, because of the trade negotiations people learned how dependent the United States is on China for pharmaceuticals -- 97 percent of our antibiotics come from China. And so any move to try to improve that, and the president started his news conference off by announcing that, would be a good thing."

    {
      "speaker": "BREAM",
      "utterance": "The president was pressed today, too, on what his plans are for the RNC, what he'll do, where he is going to deliver his acceptance speech. He used one of these conferences last week to say that it wasn't going to play out the way we've seen conventions play out in the past with the big events in Florida. And now tonight we are just getting word that there are more than 100 police agencies who say they are not going to enter into or live up to these agreements with the DNC because they have now been told the local directives there are that they cannot use pepper spray or teargas or other crowd control things that they've used in the past. So now more than 100 of these police agencies saying they're not going to send agents in or officers in to assist with this. They don't think they can do so safely. Marc?"

      "speaker": "THIESSEN",
      "utterance": "They might as well move it to Chicago and repeat 1968. Exactly, this is what happens when you defund the police. The police don't come. And so I'm not surprised that police agencies are upset and are saying they're not going to support the conventions. We don't know how these conventions are going to play out, still. We don't know what Trump is going to do because we don't how the pandemic is doing. And when he announced that he was going to move it to Jacksonville, Florida looked like it was doing great. Then all of a sudden Florida wasn't doing so great. So he was smart today to keep his powder dry and say we'll let you know soon what the plan is for my convention speech."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BREAM",
      "utterance": "Mara, do you think the DNC can proceed if they've lost 100 plus law enforcement agencies who were planning to help them manage it? We have all been to conventions, you know, even though these are probably going to be scaled down, it is a logistical and security -- very tight puzzle that's got to work exactly right because of all the people that are there, and high profile, to protect."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LIASSON",
      "utterance": "What I'm really unclear on is how many high-profile people will be there. The DNC has been scaling back, scaling back, a couple hundred people, we know that Joe Biden was planning to accept the nomination in Milwaukee. But I'm wondering what are the protesters going to be protesting if this thing is almost completely virtual? So that is unclear to me. But the fact that these conventions are supposed to start on August 17th for the Democrats and August 24th for the Republicans, that's not very far away. And they still don't know exactly what they're going to be like."

That continues tonight here in Washington. His funeral will be on Thursday. Finally tonight, confusion on Capitol Hill. During a virtual Senate committee hearing on coronavirus relief, Republicans and Democrats finally found some common ground, but might not be what you'd expect."
