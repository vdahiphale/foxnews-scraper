There's not a single optimistic photo of Joe Biden that we can find. It's all like he's got a migraine. So do we. Let's assess the mess. Right now we see plunging enrollment in public schools. Even the ones where hot teachers bang the male students. People are leaving the hell is prisons faster than felons leaving actual prisons in California. Gas is climbing to 10 bucks a gallon. They're talking about rationing. If Biden were any farther back into the 1970s he'd be peeing down the leg of his bell bottoms. The only formula for babies that the Dems can find is abortion. Yes.

So, as our education system implodes, teachers are sent to sex fetish conferences. I can just see a math teacher teaching kids how to count to 20 while he sucks on his life partners toes to do so. It's real. This as kids experienced the highest rates of mental illness on record. Only to be taught by their teachers. Funny how being masked and locked down will do that to a young person. Just ask the Jehovah Witness tied up in my basement. Meanwhile, panic Dems demand investigations into domestic terror as their disinformation board implodes faster than a Chris Wallace talk show. As this goes on Netflix scraps all its woke programming. The world's richest man wants a die-hard Democrat now says he's voting Republican. Hell at this point, George Soros must be having second thoughts. Interestingly, the public seems immune to the Democrats getting up anti Republican rage, and poor Antifa. Fuel prices are so high instead of Molotov cocktails, rioters have to throw Shirley Temples. So what's going on here? Are we realizing that (BLEEP) isn't right anymore? Are we waking up? And is this the true definition of being woke? Make sense. We let the lunatics take over the asylum. And now the streets look like mental hospitals minus the indoor plumbing, smash and grabs continue unabated. Drugstores shut down as the street drug trade ramps up. That includes fentanyl and the Pepcid they stole from Walgreens. I'm surprised they're not honoring coupons. Gang crime turns sections of major cities into no go territories and the street poopers they go anywhere they want to go. Just ask Shillue.",

      "sentences": "So, assuming one group thinks a certain way. What a bunch of racists. Anyway, I list all this stuff because something's happening. I call it the Great Awakening. The public's waking up because unlike the media, you exist in the real world. You make a living in the real world and face challenges every day in the real world. So, when the public looks at a problem, it's with a mental dashboard and we see the red engine light flashing. It tells us that more criminals and fewer cops equal a crime wave. That math so simple, only a socialist could (BLEEP) up. We see the wokeism, the indoctrination, the moves against free -- the moves against free speech. We could see it because we have the tools to see it. The Dems can't see it because they have only one filter and of course that's race. So when crime goes up, they blame racism. Kids get lousy educations. They blame racism. When a billionaire buys Twitter, hell, he must be racist. When their bread goes stale, racism. When they get a flat, racism. How did this happen? Well, when you decide that patriotism is oppression, you got to replace it with something. And that's identity politics. That's their replacement theory. But it's like trying to replace sugar with sweet and low. The people who love sugar could tell how horrible it is right away. But if your country can't be forgiven based on the original sin of slavery, then you can't be patriotic. You can't love this country. All you can do is destroy it. And it's much easier to burn buildings than it is to make them. We see this clearly now. In America, we understand our faults, our blessings, our need for cooperation, unity and love. We understand that identity politics offers none of that. If you don't believe that, look at our competitors ratings. That's called empirical evidence. Thankfully, we're in this together and we're going to pull this country out of this malaise like a fireman or cop pulls a drowning dog out of a frozen lake and we'll do it whether the idiot in charge likes it or not.

This is according to an NPR memo obtained by the New York Post owned by our parent company Crisco. The memo reads \"If you notice someone who has forgotten their mask, you might tell them, hey, you forgot your mask.\" Now in a sane world, you might respond. Hey, you forgot to shut the hell up. But this is crazy times. The memo added that employees could let a superior know so they can remind that person or get H.R. involved. And repeat offenders could be fired. Just following orders, folks. Now all this is doubly nuts considering D.C. where NPR is headquartered dropped indoor mask mandates for stores and restaurants back in March. But if NPR did what people liked, they wouldn't have to beg for donations. And the memo -- yes. Screw them. The memo also claims that employees caught unmasked should say thank you for the reminder that they're violating the rule. And then you bend over.

Although, this explains why my wife keeps asking me to go antiquing. But now, he is a she and an ugly one. Alex who has pleaded not guilty was back in court this week sporting a new look and revealing a transition to female. That's more convenient than those students that become rollerskates. I love those. The six-foot tall, 190-pound inmate is being housed in Rikers Island Center for female detainees. Well, we know who's getting picked first for basketball in the exercise yard. Of course, this is happening after two women inmates got impregnated by a transgendered inmate at a New Jersey women's prison. Then, there's Hannah Tubbs the child molester who also transitioned after the crime. She gained sympathy and an early release for being trans after molesting a child and a bathroom. Tubbs gloated over the slap on the wrist he got. The release was defended by the Office of LADA, George Gascon, who now faces a recall and he should be recalled now that Tubbs has been charged with murder for a crime committed after the molestation charge. I know, I know, I know, what's the world coming to when you can't even trust the pedophiles? You know, Kat, I'm going to go to you first because this is -- we went back to that woman that says all you got to do is identify as a woman to be a woman. In this case, all you got to do is grow your hair out. You don't even have to remove your junk. This guy has grown his hair out, and he's a woman.

But the rest, that's 47 percent, Kat, didn't feel like an adult until they hit 29 -- lots of numbers. Meaning, meanwhile, I'm still waiting to hit puberty. Until then, I'm the guy with the gray hair buying clothes in the boys department. Why am I reading jokes that insult me? So, aside from being tried as an adult, what were the top five milestones that made respondents feel grown up? Well, 30 percent said living on their own for the first-time 28 percent said buying a house 27 percent said getting married and another 27 percent said having their own bank account. And 26 percent said having kids and all those numbers add up to more than 100 percent. So, I guess being able to do math doesn't count as being an adult. Katie, do you feel like an adult?",

It's real. This as kids experienced the highest rates of mental illness on record. Only to be taught by their teachers. Funny how being masked and locked down will do that to a young person. Just ask the Jehovah Witness tied up in my basement. Meanwhile, panic Dems demand investigations into domestic terror as their disinformation board implodes faster than a Chris Wallace talk show. As this goes on Netflix scraps all its woke programming. The world's richest man wants a die-hard Democrat now says he's voting Republican. Hell at this point, George Soros must be having second thoughts. Interestingly, the public seems immune to the Democrats getting up anti Republican rage, and poor Antifa. Fuel prices are so high instead of Molotov cocktails, rioters have to throw Shirley Temples. So what's going on here? Are we realizing that (BLEEP) isn't right anymore? Are we waking up? And is this the true definition of being woke? Make sense. We let the lunatics take over the asylum. And now the streets look like mental hospitals minus the indoor plumbing, smash and grabs continue unabated. Drugstores shut down as the street drug trade ramps up. That includes fentanyl and the Pepcid they stole from Walgreens. I'm surprised they're not honoring coupons.

The public's waking up because unlike the media, you exist in the real world. You make a living in the real world and face challenges every day in the real world. So, when the public looks at a problem, it's with a mental dashboard and we see the red engine light flashing. It tells us that more criminals and fewer cops equal a crime wave. That math so simple, only a socialist could (BLEEP) up. We see the wokeism, the indoctrination, the moves against free -- the moves against free speech. We could see it because we have the tools to see it. The Dems can't see it because they have only one filter and of course that's race. So when crime goes up, they blame racism. Kids get lousy educations. They blame racism. When a billionaire buys Twitter, hell, he must be racist. When their bread goes stale, racism. When they get a flat, racism. How did this happen? Well, when you decide that patriotism is oppression, you got to replace it with something. And that's identity politics. That's their replacement theory. But it's like trying to replace sugar with sweet and low. The people who love sugar could tell how horrible it is right away. But if your country can't be forgiven based on the original sin of slavery, then you can't be patriotic. You can't love this country. All you can do is destroy it. And it's much easier to burn buildings than it is to make them. We see this clearly now. In America, we understand our faults, our blessings, our need for cooperation, unity and love. We understand that identity politics offers none of that. If you don't believe that, look at our competitors ratings. That's called empirical evidence. Thankfully, we're in this together and we're going to pull this country out of this malaise like a fireman or cop pulls a drowning dog out of a frozen lake and we'll do it whether the idiot in charge likes it or not.

Yes, public radio loves snitches, like their tote bags love stitches. NPR is encouraging employees to rat each other out if they don't comply with a company's mass policy in the office. This is according to an NPR memo obtained by the New York Post owned by our parent company Crisco. The memo reads \"If you notice someone who has forgotten their mask, you might tell them, hey, you forgot your mask.\" Now in a sane world, you might respond. Hey, you forgot to shut the hell up. But this is crazy times. The memo added that employees could let a superior know so they can remind that person or get H.R. involved. And repeat offenders could be fired. Just following orders, folks. Now all this is doubly nuts considering D.C. where NPR is headquartered dropped indoor mask mandates for stores and restaurants back in March. But if NPR did what people liked, they wouldn't have to beg for donations. And the memo -- yes. Screw them. The memo also claims that employees caught unmasked should say thank you for the reminder that they're violating the rule. And then you bend over. There's even a system where employees can anonymously snitch on each other. You got to hand it to NPR though. They're not asking employees to do something they wouldn't expect their listeners to do."

In 2020, 26-year-old, Alex Ray Scott, allegedly murdered an antiques dealer he met on a dating app, as they all do. Prosecutor said, he stabbed the man in the face and slit his throat. Terrible. Although, this explains why my wife keeps asking me to go antiquing. But now, he is a she and an ugly one. Alex who has pleaded not guilty was back in court this week sporting a new look and revealing a transition to female. That's more convenient than those students that become rollerskates. I love those. The six-foot tall, 190-pound inmate is being housed in Rikers Island Center for female detainees. Well, we know who's getting picked first for basketball in the exercise yard. Of course, this is happening after two women inmates got impregnated by a transgendered inmate at a New Jersey women's prison. Then, there's Hannah Tubbs the child molester who also transitioned after the crime. She gained sympathy and an early release for being trans after molesting a child and a bathroom. Tubbs gloated over the slap on the wrist he got. The release was defended by the Office of LADA, George Gascon, who now faces a recall and he should be recalled now that Tubbs has been charged with murder for a crime committed after the molestation charge. I know, I know, I know, what's the world coming to when you can't even trust the pedophiles? You know, Kat, I'm going to go to you first because this is -- we went back to that woman that says all you got to do is identify as a woman to be a woman. In this case, all you got to do is grow your hair out. You don't even have to remove your junk. This guy has grown his hair out, and he's a woman. So, basically, the left is saying it doesn't take anything to be a woman other than that. Doesn't that upset you?"

But the rest, that's 47 percent, Kat, didn't feel like an adult until they hit 29 -- lots of numbers. Meaning, meanwhile, I'm still waiting to hit puberty. Until then, I'm the guy with the gray hair buying clothes in the boys department. Why am I reading jokes that insult me? So, aside from being tried as an adult, what were the top five milestones that made respondents feel grown up? Well, 30 percent said living on their own for the first-time 28 percent said buying a house 27 percent said getting married and another 27 percent said having their own bank account. And 26 percent said having kids and all those numbers add up to more than 100 percent. So, I guess being able to do math doesn't count as being an adult. Katie, do you feel like an adult?"
