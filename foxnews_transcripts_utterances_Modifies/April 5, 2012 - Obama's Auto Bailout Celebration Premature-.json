Bush did it as well does not mean it doesn't care those same negative connotations, I think. And look, we should also be very clear about the government having recouped all of its money. That is simply not what happened. There is $24 billion the government will likely never see again and even the money that has supposedly repaid, $6 billion of it that went to a loan came from a $13 billion fund that was an escrow fund that the government set up. So GM took that money from the $13 billion escrow fund, put it towards the $6 billion loan -- it is like paying off, it's basically like transferring the balance on a credit card and giving your wife a high five and saying we paid off our debt."

I think they have a chance of making it, but not if they are run according to the dictates of ideologues in the White House. I make one distinction -- taking over health care, regulating financial reform and cap-and-trade, are acts of a socialist if you like, because it is unforced, it's an ideological desire. Acting in an emergency to nationalize an auto company I think is a different category."

And today the winner is the fallout over the ruling of the Arizona immigration law. Let's bring back the pane. And specifically, Steve Hayes, I want to talk about the story today that was first in The Washington Times and that we also reported about this memo that was leaked from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services that seemed to indicate that there might be an effort at a backdoor amnesty plan. It's just a memo. How big a deal?"

      "utterance": "Well, it was a memo and it was a draft memo. And if we were to catalog all the stupid things that have appeared in government draft memos, it would be a long list. Having said that, it is truly frightening to see federal employees seeking ways to allow illegals to remain here, to circumvent federal law. And I think we ought to see whether the memo was ordered and what came of it."

These are people who are appointed people in the administration deciding because Congress hasn't enacted a law it wants enacted, it will do it by creating or finding loopholes in existing law. It is like the administration, which was not able to get approval by Congress for cap-and-trade or a carbon tax and having the EPA do it by itself. That's not the way the constitution says our government runs. The laws are done by Congress. The administration is supposed to administer."

One is we found out that the House subcommittee that was investigating him, that they had recommend a reprimand which is one form of punishment, but down from a censure and certainly down from expulsion, and that is apparently what Rangel and the lawyers wouldn't agree to. And in addition, when President Obama has just done an interview or has run on CBS News in which he says \"I think Charlie Rangel served a long time and served constituents very well but these allegations are troubling. And he's somebody who is at the end of his career, 80-years-old. Sure he wants to help the career with dignity. I hope -- my hope is that it happens.\" What do you make of both of those things?"

This has been a two-year investigation and the charges and allegations have been known for a long time, and it is likely now that he is just going to get a reprimand because members of Congress don't like to kick out members of Congress. It seems silly to me."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BILLINGS",
      "utterance": "I think that a reprimand is probable. I think at the far end a censure, I do not think he will be expelled. What surprises me though is he did not agree to a reprimand, which says to me he is really digging in or his lawyers are really digging in, and he thinks he has a decent case. What's interesting to me and what I'm going to be watching in the next few weeks is how hard the Democrats push from the outside to try to get him to step down because he is obviously, you know, he's pretty stubborn. He did not want to give up his gavel as the Ways and Means chairman, so I don't think he's going to step down without a fight."

I'm really surprised if he was offered a reprimand he turned it down. That is the least of the punishments. With all the pressure from the outside I can't believe this is not going to end with a deal before a trial in September in which he accepts a reprimand, it is such a light punishment."

And let's put on the screen what it is he said: \"I became a villain for doing the right thing, but I understand people find it easier to vilify an individual more than a company.\" He basically says he and BP did everything they could, Steve, and that his resignation was mostly PR. The other news, and this is just breaking, is that the House has approved a bill to boost safety standards for offshore drilling and to remove the $75 million cap for liability for spills. Steve, your reaction to both?"
