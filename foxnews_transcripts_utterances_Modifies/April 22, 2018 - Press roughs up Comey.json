So he said he is telling him about this because CNN is about to do this and that they're going to keep it very close to the chest.

Well, the fact that there was nothing in these memos is actually the most important thing, because they were selectively leaked to launch a special counsel so that there was nothing in there to justify a special counsel is huge news actually. But even the first memo where he explains why he briefed him only on the salacious part of the dossier and said this, because CNN was looking for a hook to justify writing about it. The hook, if you remember, that story that got everything going, was that Comey had briefed Donald Trump. So he said he is telling him about this because CNN is about to do this and that they're going to keep it very close to the chest. Instead this meeting became the hook to justify putting the dossier into the bloodstream and also he was not telling the truth about how closely held this information was which makes all this other information about Trump asking for loyalty look totally different when you realize -- Trump realized pretty early on that his intelligence chiefs were leaking against him."

Comey briefed Donald Trump at the end of a long briefing about Russian interference in the election, so all the intel chiefs went up to tell Donald Trump what their assessment had been. At tend, I think Jim Comey felt like the president had a right to know that reporters had a dossier.

Trump replied -- let's put up on the screen, that we need to go after the reporters and referred to the fact that 10 or 15 years ago we put them in jail to find out what they know, and it worked. He mentioned Judy Miller at Fox by name. They spend a couple days in jail, make a new friend, and they are ready to talk. Does that concern you?"

The New York Times and a third-grade reporter named Maggie Haberman, known as a crooked H flunky who I don't speak to and have nothing to do with, then he goes on to criticize the story. Well, Maggie has interviewed Trump many times including several times as president. One of her colleagues at the Times tweeted this picture of the two of them in the Oval Office. So apparently, he does have something to do with Maggie Haberman, who by the way shared a Pulitzer prize this week. When we come back, the flop over Nikki Haley and Russian sanctions.

I think he was poorly served, by the way, people reported on it. But it absolutely is true that the policy obviously changed at some point. She did announce something that didn't happen.

Joining us now from New York is Shelby Holliday, senior video reporter for The Wall Street Journal. You heard Hannity say he wasn't a client, but a long-time friend of Michael Cohen, had occasionally legal conversations, didn't pay him, and therefore no need to disclose that to his viewers.

So, legally, you know, you can have a discussion about civil liberties and debate whether or not Sean Hannity's name should have been revealed but the reason this was a huge media story is number one, there was the drama of Michael Cohen's third mystery client Sean Hannity being revealed in open court, that automatically created some buzz. Number two, there are political reasons. This gave Hannity political foes, easy opportunity to go out and throw some punches. Number three, the big reason and this is something that applies to the viewers, the ethical and legal questions surrounding why Hannity didn't reveal his attorney-client relationship with Michael Cohen."

      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Right. Well, whether it's attorney-client or not, on that point, I wrote in my Fox News column that Hannity should have disclosed it especially because he was highly critical of what the FBI did to Cohen in raiding his home and his office and his hotel room. Last year, Michael Cohen was a guest on Hannity's radio show and Hannity said for disclosure, we're longtime friends. That would have in my view at least solved the problem."

However, I would also note that Hannity may have fueled some of this himself because instead of going on his program the night that this was all disclosed and saying to viewers, should I reveal this or I'm sorry, he went out and attacked the media for covering the story, calling the media fake news, partisan hacks with zero credibility. And as one Hannity viewer pointed out to me, that was an interesting way of addressing an issue in which a self-proclaimed partisan talk show host had essentially undermined his own credibility on the Cohen issue."

If you were in the White House, would you advise him to use that kind of language?"

    {
      "speaker": "SPICER",
      "utterance": "Look, I think the President in the last couple of years, effectively branding people and he's a marketing genius when it comes to a lot of this stuff. So I don't know that he will take a ton of my advice. His style has not always been my style, but he's been fairly effective using his style."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Marketing genius, that is diplomatic answer. So on another subject, the President proclaimed that the media aren't giving him enough credit for the way he deals with Russia because he says it doesn't fit the media narrative. And he also said in a press conference no one has been tougher on Russia than I have been. I don't think even you would say that from the podium."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SPICER",
      "utterance": "Well, I think if he's talking about the number of diplomats that's been expelled and the sanctions that have brought to Russia, it's been very tough. I think that's it's a sharp contrast to the narrative that exists, that he's somehow trying to benefit from Russia, that there's this behind the scenes back channel. The President has been very clear from the beginning that whether it's Russia or any other country where we have economic or national security interest in. It's in the country's best interest to have a healthy relationship with those countries. But he's not going to do it to forsake either our national or economic security."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Right. If you look at the administration's record, there have been some of the actions."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SPICER",
      "utterance": "Sure, but remember it was also Obama who was on stage with the prime minister at the time that says I will get that, I will convey that to Vladimir and we will have a better working relationship."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SPICER",
      "utterance": "-- Hillary Clinton. I mean to the degree towards those prior leaders on the Democratic Party had actually tried to reset relations with Russia, had try to back-channel things to Russia. In fact, there's no evidence that that actually has occurred on this side with President Trump, and yet he's getting much more criticism than they ever did."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "That communication screw up with Nikki Haley going on a Sunday show, and announcing there will be more sanctions on Moscow the next day, a lot of finger-pointing over the fact that they were no sanctions announced. Does that remind you of the kind of problems that you or any press secretary faced in terms of getting everyone on the same page with the President's message?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SPICER",
      "utterance": "Well, sure. I mean I think when you have a big decision coming down. There are a lot of parties involved. In this case, you have got probably Ambassador Haley, you've got the folks at the State Department, national security, Defense Department, Treasury, all of entities and there are a lot of discussions going back and forth. Sometimes there are decisions that are made at the staff level that haven't been signed off by the President. And again, there's a miscommunication at some point, someone got ahead of a decision or a decision was made that was changed."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "She didn't get ahead of it. She was operating on the information that she had."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SPICER",
      "utterance": "Right. And it's very possible that at that time, the senior staff, by that I mean at the cabinet-secretary level, made a decision and they either thought that the President had signed or he didn't. There's a variety of things that could have happened. But I don't think that this is the end of the world. It happens a lot. You look at the Clinton administration, they sent people out on a Sunday show to talk about a video causing Benghazi, when in fact, that was patently false."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "But that was a huge story."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SPICER",
      "utterance": "It was but it's also it's probably in comparison, and yet this was merely just a question of timing that was coming out. There were no lives lost."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Just briefly, I know indeed. Just briefly, enormous media attention, speculation of a case against Michael Cohen, the Stormy Daniels lawsuit, whether Cohen is going to flip, what do you make of just the sheer volume of the coverage of those subjects?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SPICER",
      "utterance": "I think it's unprecedented. And what I find fascinating when I watch news these days, which I try to watch less, it seems to be more speculative. If he does this, if they do that, we hear that this might happen."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SPICER",
      "utterance": "Yeah, and again, none of it is based on fact. It's just a lot of speculation. For now, we haven't seen anything. If someone did something outside the scope of the relationship to Donald Trump in some way, that doesn't make the President complicit in anything."

He has got very talented staff that is performing the very same functions. They just may not have the same titles and sit in the same offices, but they are very, very talented women over there running the shop."

      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "We just heard from Sean Spicer. Joining us now with another perspective is Philippe Reines, a former State Department official and long-time adviser to Hillary Clinton. Let's start with Jim Comey, the press loved this guy when he got fired and turned against Donald Trump. Now he's getting scuffed up quite a bit. Is the media criticism more in line with how Hillary people view Comey?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PHILIPPE REINES, FORMER HILLARY CLINTON ADVISER",
      "utterance": "Well, I think Comey is a difficult character. He's showing a weird combination of someone with very bad judgment but with a very good memory. And I think people are using him for what they want to use him for and he has a certain sanctimonious, aw shucks air about him."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "So you're saying that the press is cherry picking. If he goes after Trump, the new liberals like it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REINES",
      "utterance": "I think frankly he's being dissected left and right. I think a lot of his non-answers are being dissected. Frankly he's not being pressed hard enough on some of his non-answers like why he didn't trust Sally Yates, that kind of thing."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Right. We talked to you earlier in the show about how the press has made a very big story out of Nikki Haley going on CBS last Sunday morning, announcing, pretty much announcing new Russian sanctions that the President had not decided on. Did that deserve to be a big story, because didn't the snafus happen in the Clinton -- Obama administration?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REINES",
      "utterance": "I think my opinion is secondary to Nikki Haley's opinion. I mean Nikki Haley clearly thought it was a big story when she was told that she was confused, and had to make it very clear to the White House."

      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "I would like your opinion."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REINES",
      "utterance": "Well, so I don't think it was overdone because I remember vividly what you were talking to Sean about when Susan Rice went on the Sunday shows, and it was all hell broke loose. And I understand that people believe that she was being misleading. She was doing this and that. But as a pure factual matter, the world blew up at her and she was called out for, and it makes sense if the world does the same thing to a Republican member of the administration when they go on a Sunday show."
    },

      "speaker": "KURTZ",

      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "What do you make of this endless, sometimes 24/7 media speculation about whether Trump will fire Bob Mueller or fire Rod Rosenstein or the chatter about Michael Cohen. I mean as a Democrat you must be enjoying it but."

      "speaker": "REINES",

    },

      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Is it over the top?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REINES",
      "utterance": "No, because he's tweeting 24/7 about Mueller, and Rod Rosenstein, and Jeff Sessions. I mean I would love this as an experiment for Donald Trump to go say a week without tweeting at all just to see how everyone else would react. I mean he is driving the conversation. It is not me and other Democrats waking up and saying, OK, today there was an airplane crash but we are going to talk about whether or not Rod Rosenstein is going to be fired."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "I would certainly agree that when the President tweets, we all cover it. Sometimes we over cover it. But if the President didn't tweet, I mean if you turn on CNN and MSNBC in prime time, you know Fox is focusing more on the problems in the Mueller probe and questionable (Inaudible) that the FBI, you will see a lot of this. It almost has become like the staple of the programming."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "REINES",
      "utterance": "In general with the book. But the investigations are in the news because of Michael Cohen and because you have Republicans trying to cut off the Mueller investigation and you have Republicans calling for him to be fired. So I don't think there's any more of an exaggeration as compared to reality as, say, when Sean Hannity shows a chart saying the Mueller crime family kind of thing."

She quotes you as taunting her on the trail, saying I don't care what you write because no one takes you seriously, making a crude remark that I won't repeat. You and others perhaps saying, are there any other times reporters we can deal with, maybe males. So what is your response to being accused of being overly aggressive?"

I think Amy needs to -- I think Amy is disappointed for the same reason I am disappointed. I wanted Hillary Clinton to win for my own future. I think she did too for different reasons. I believed in Hillary Clinton. I think Amy needs to look at how her behavior and her paper's behavior contributed to tearing down Hillary Clinton and."

It's good for gossip, sure, but how is that Kellyanne's problem? Aren't spouses allowed to have different political views? Stormy Daniels is back in the news. Is she really out of the news, first by showing up at that court hearing for Michael Cohen and then continuing her perpetual media tour on the view.

Daniels and her lawyer released a sketch of what she says the man looked like, prompting a Presidential rebuttal on Twitter. A sketch, years later about a nonexistent man a total con job, playing the fake news media for fools but they know it. That is the first time the President has directly addressed Stormy Daniels' allegations. It's not clear how he knows the story is a total con job, but if Stormy's lawyer, who has now had at least 55 TV appearances, was trying to draw Trump into responding, he succeeded. Another Trump accuser, Karen McDougal, has reached a settlement with the publisher of the National Inquirer. The former Playboy model had sued American Media to overturn a contract in which the tabloid bought the rights to her story for $150,000 but never published it. The settlement includes a cover appearance on Men's Journal and the publication of a few of her columns. So McDougal is now free to talk about Donald Trump, except she already talked about Donald Trump in that long CNN interview, and now she doesn't have to pay a dime for having apparently violated the contract by doing that. Still to come, what I'll always remember about Barbara Bush's is her bluntness, which often made headlines."

When her husband was running for reelection as Vice President in 1984, his wife told AP reporter (Inaudible) what she thought of his opponent Geraldine Ferraro, it rhymes with rich. George H.W. Bush later told news that was the most embarrassing episode of her life, but then we all kind of laughed at her feistiness.
