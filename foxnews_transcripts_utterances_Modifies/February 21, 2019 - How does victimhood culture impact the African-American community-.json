Another jam packed news, day and night for us, we'll be on every angle we have every element of this Jussie Smollett saga covered for you. Chicago PD lighting into him earlier this morning. Former Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy and current President of the Chicago Police Union Kevin Graham are both here to react, you don't want to miss that.  Plus could any lawyer on earth develop a successful defense for Smollett. Alan Dershowitz is here with the sauce on that. Plus who are the media and the political arsonists who fanned the smaller flames. We're going to name names. Oh yes, later in the show but first, the false allure of victimology, that's the focus of tonight's Angle.  After seeing your really strong reactions to last night's show about how universities are breeding grounds for victim hood and manufactured anger, we thought it was important to expand on this theme tonight. And given today's developments on a number of stories, this conversation we're going to have on “The Ingraham Angle” tonight is more important than ever.  The Superintendent of the Chicago police was visibly, understandably outraged by what his department and the community has endured because of Jussie Smollett's fabricated hate crime.",

And it should not surprise any of us that today's Democrats cling to this victimhood narrative with a political death grip.  After all, what do they have to do without it and with their lame track record, how can they possibly convince African-Americans that they're going to do better, be better off and they're going to have their wages lifted up better or they're going to have their neighborhoods safer or cartels are going to be kept out of their neighborhoods. Gang members, MS-13 are going to be out of their communities, the Democrats are somehow going to be better than Trump at creating jobs. The answer is they can't argue any of that because they have no substantive arguments. But they can and they do sell victimhood.  And for that, they have a lot of buyers. This is how Kanye West put it about a year ago in a pair of tweets. He said, there was a time when slavery was the trend and apparently that time it's still upon us. But now it's a mentality. Then he wrote, self-victimization is a disease.  Well you bet it is because when any of us cling to victim hood, we give away our power, our power to solve problems and to better ourselves the old fashioned way. It's through something called hard work. And it's important to understand the left strategy here. They'll use fabricated tales of victimization to divert attention from other inconvenient truths. Now remember, it was Smollett who crashed in and took the focus off of Virginia governor Ralph Blackface Northam.  Of course and his lieutenant Governor Justin Fairfax who's accused by at least two women of sexual abuse. Boy, that Virginia story faded fast, didn't it? And now that Smollett anti-Trump drama has blown out, the media has jumped on a story of that whack job Coast Guard Lieutenant who wanted to murder Democrat politicians.",

Victims or victim groups high on intersectionality points are supposed to be coveted and believed unreservedly.\" But there's something more nefarious happening, do you think, on college campuses. Back in March of 2016, hen candidate Donald Trump had to cancel a rally at the University of Illinois because of violent protests and other threats. And in March, 2017, conservative Charles Murray and his group were literally attacked at Middlebury College. Glad I didn't go there. A professor was injured in that melee. And just this week at the University of California, Berkeley, a Turning Point USA recruiter was brutally attacked. We don't know what happened before this video but it doesn't look good.",

Blasey Ford made out like Batman, raking in over $800,000 via a GoFundMe account, was all for her security.

So suddenly it was like 1955 in Birmingham all over again kind of like a really bad, Spike Lee film or something. And then when the fantasy came crashing down and police began to discover the lies, the real truth. Well, the pair of brothers buying supplies, those Nigerian brothers on the coordinated phone calls.

And it should not surprise any of us that today's Democrats cling to this victimhood narrative with a political death grip. After all, what do they have to do without it and with their lame track record, how can they possibly convince African-Americans that they're going to do better, be better off and they're going to have their wages lifted up better or they're going to have their neighborhoods safer or cartels are going to be kept out of their neighborhoods. Gang members, MS-13 are going to be out of their communities, the Democrats are somehow going to be better than Trump at creating jobs. The answer is they can't argue any of that because they have no substantive arguments. But they can and they do sell victimhood. And for that, they have a lot of buyers. This is how Kanye West put it about a year ago in a pair of tweets. He said, there was a time when slavery was the trend and apparently that time it's still upon us. But now it's a mentality. Then he wrote, self-victimization is a disease. Well you bet it is because when any of us cling to victim hood, we give away our power, our power to solve problems and to better ourselves the old fashioned way. It's through something called hard work. And it's important to understand the left strategy here. They'll use fabricated tales of victimization to divert attention from other inconvenient truths. Now remember, it was Smollett who crashed in and took the focus off of Virginia governor Ralph Blackface Northam. Of course and his lieutenant Governor Justin Fairfax who's accused by at least two women of sexual abuse. Boy, that Virginia story faded fast, didn't it? And now that Smollett anti-Trump drama has blown out, the media has jumped on a story of that whack job Coast Guard Lieutenant who wanted to murder Democrat politicians."

You put that together with the Laquan McDonald incident coming out of it, the Jason Van Dike conviction, we have serious racial problems here and this is akin to pouring gasoline on some burnt coals and hoping that they don't go on fire.

Well, no luck so far from the media firefighters. Well, the most powerful politician the Democratic Party, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, she wrote in a since deleted tweet, \"The racist, homophobic attack on Smollett it is an affront to our humanity.\" Well, the only affront to our humanity is the media apparatus that will circle the wagons to protect you from ever having to explain this away, Nancy.

And do some community service but I do think, I agree with you. I think people will make false reports or to go to jail. I think you know, in the Bible if you falsely accuse somebody, you get the penalty that the person would have gotten had the accusation been true so if in fact, these people had attacked him in this racist way and put a noose around his neck, they would have gotten some years in jail. If you're going to follow the Bible, this guy would get the same penalty that he falsely accused other people of getting.

Victims or victim groups high on intersectionality points are supposed to be coveted and believed unreservedly.\" But there's something more nefarious happening, do you think, on college campuses. Back in March of 2016, hen candidate Donald Trump had to cancel a rally at the University of Illinois because of violent protests and other threats. And in March, 2017, conservative Charles Murray and his group were literally attacked at Middlebury College. Glad I didn't go there. A professor was injured in that melee. And just this week at the University of California, Berkeley, a Turning Point USA recruiter was brutally attacked. We don't know what happened before this video but it doesn't look good."

This is a student that was assaulted in the public square because he was tabling and recruiting for conservative values for our Turning Point USA chapter at U.C.

Anyone knows this guy, call the authorities, because the university, the provost, I believe, the chancellor put out a statement saying this is unacceptable. We do not allow this. Angelo, this is what Donald Trump Jr., he weighed in on this. He said when a liberal like Jussie cries wolf and fakes an attack he receives unmatched coverage, sympathy, and support, creating a tsunami of attention.

But any hate crime is a problem, and I agree with you. We don't want any hate crimes. But we are talking about the disparate coverage. And American University, George Washington University, Catholic University, Georgetown, all great schools right in this area. A conservative wearing a \"Make America Great Again\" hat on those campuses would be kind of risking it. That's a fact, would be risking it. And I know a lot of great kids who go to Georgetown.

It will eat up much more parkland than we were first led to believe. Roads will be eliminated and rerouted at a cost and inconvenience that will be unclear. Mayor Rahm Emanuel, the Obama Center's biggest cheerleader, has done his best to lock in Park District support for years to come long after he leaves office in May.\" It sounds like a sweetheart inside Rahm to Obama deal.
