      "sentences": "I'm Laura Ingraham. This is \"The Ingraham Angle\" from Washington tonight. We have another packed show. The Iran debate simmers as the media, Sean and I were talking about, continue to deny that this is a positive outcome for you, for America, for our security. And Democrats look to strip President Trump of his war powers. Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy is here just a few minutes with an insider account of what went down today on Capitol Hill. Also, remember when the media slobber all over Nancy Pelosi's pathetic move to withhold impeachment articles from the Senate? Well now even her own party is beginning to have second thoughts. Plus, Devin Nunes is here with a huge announcement that could reveal more about that whistleblower who started this whole Ukraine deal.  And Congresswoman Ilhan Omar with another absolutely pathetic and disgusting display. Then there was a royal falling out. An Eco alarmist flame outs. Arroyo has it all in Seen and Unseen. But first, two attacks, two failures. That's the focus of tonight's Angle. President Trump's enemies at home and abroad are really frustrated right now, and I can't really blame them. They keep launching attacks, but the President just keeps getting stronger and the Republicans more unified. And through it all, our economy, our markets, they just shrug it off. And they keep going higher.  Well, last night, Iran of course fired their show missiles into Iraq where our troops are stationed doing some damage, but without casualties. Thank goodness. But that's not the only assault on this President. That's fizzled.  At home, we see the same with the impeachment fiasco. With the articles of impeachment, I kind of picture Nancy Pelosi playing a game of San Francisco Hold'em, she has her cards close to the vest, but it really means she just doesn't want a Senate trial after all, because she won zero concessions from Mitch McConnell and now members of her own party are turning against her.",

But she's not going to do that. The bluster and the posturing will continue.  Indeed, I predict, she will try to claim victory here. Well, someone else was claiming victory today, following a different failed attack on the Trump administration. Iran's President Hassan Rouhani pledged to kick all American forces out of the Middle East.  But like Nancy, at the 11th hour, when push came to shove, he blinked. Iran's cruise missiles by his own admission were just a slap in the face. They weren't a lethal strike, before yesterday, Democrats, they were predicting this was all going to end up essentially as World War III.",

He and his team not only managed to turn impeachment into a positive, but they may have, by droning a top terrorist, forced Iran back to the negotiating table.  Given Trump's uncanny resilience in the face of their repeated attacks, both the Democrats and Iran would do well to think twice before launching any new assaults. And that's The Angle.

And as Chris knows, he may not, I'm not sure how much reading he did on Wikipedia before the show.

I'm sure the Iranians are going to let us and give us permission into inspecting facilities where they may be producing nuclear weapons, they're not supposed to be producing. I mean, it was a nonsensical deal.  But secondly, Chris's point was - it really was so silly, I don't know why he even said it. He said, well, President Trump, yes, we've got to give him credit for not getting in a war that he tried to start. What are you even talking about?

The Iran debate simmers as the media, Sean and I were talking about, continue to deny that this is a positive outcome for you, for America, for our security. And Democrats look to strip President Trump of his war powers. Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy is here just a few minutes with an insider account of what went down today on Capitol Hill. Also, remember when the media slobber all over Nancy Pelosi's pathetic move to withhold impeachment articles from the Senate? Well now even her own party is beginning to have second thoughts. Plus, Devin Nunes is here with a huge announcement that could reveal more about that whistleblower who started this whole Ukraine deal. And Congresswoman Ilhan Omar with another absolutely pathetic and disgusting display. Then there was a royal falling out. An Eco alarmist flame outs. Arroyo has it all in Seen and Unseen. But first, two attacks, two failures. That's the focus of tonight's Angle. President Trump's enemies at home and abroad are really frustrated right now, and I can't really blame them. They keep launching attacks, but the President just keeps getting stronger and the Republicans more unified. And through it all, our economy, our markets, they just shrug it off. And they keep going higher. Well, last night, Iran of course fired their show missiles into Iraq where our troops are stationed doing some damage, but without casualties. Thank goodness. But that's not the only assault on this President. That's fizzled. At home, we see the same with the impeachment fiasco. With the articles of impeachment, I kind of picture Nancy Pelosi playing a game of San Francisco Hold'em, she has her cards close to the vest, but it really means she just doesn't want a Senate trial after all, because she won zero concessions from Mitch McConnell and now members of her own party are turning against her."

But she's not going to do that. The bluster and the posturing will continue. Indeed, I predict, she will try to claim victory here. Well, someone else was claiming victory today, following a different failed attack on the Trump administration. Iran's President Hassan Rouhani pledged to kick all American forces out of the Middle East. But like Nancy, at the 11th hour, when push came to shove, he blinked.

What President Trump's foes do not understand, or they forget is that he himself is the master of asymmetrical fighting. He and his team not only managed to turn impeachment into a positive, but they may have, by droning a top terrorist, forced Iran back to the negotiating table. Given Trump's uncanny resilience in the face of their repeated attacks, both the Democrats and Iran would do well to think twice before launching any new assaults. And that's The Angle.

I'd even give the President credit if he did. However, we did have an agreement and we weren't at this posture with Iran under that agreement.

And as Chris knows, he may not, I'm not sure how much reading he did on Wikipedia before the show. But the Iran deal had a provision where we had to get the Iranians permission to inspect military facilities. I'm sure the Iranians are going to let us and give us permission into inspecting facilities where they may be producing nuclear weapons, they're not supposed to be producing. I mean, it was a nonsensical deal. But secondly, Chris's point was - it really was so silly, I don't know why he even said it. He said, well, President Trump, yes, we've got to give him credit for not getting in a war that he tried to start. What are you even talking about? President Trump ran and made up a point of getting us out of unnecessary wars. He said, he wanted to deescalate the situation. He did in turn deescalate the situation. Why take a cheap shot?

There are no rules for what happens when the House impeaches the President, which they have, and they don't bring anything over and exhibit the articles of impeachment. So, in my opinion, what are called the impeachment rules in the Senate don't cover the situation we're in.

Speaker Pelosi said the articles passed, she banged her gavel, so he's been impeached. We don't have to wait for them. It's not like an indictment. We don't have to wait for them to send it over.

These were all things. Then we had to hear from the whistle- blower, then we didn't have to hear from the whistle-blower. And what the media and the Democrats are hoping that we forgot about, which it's kind of funny that this is now news, but we said at the time, we sent a letter, I have the letters right here in my hand, we sent a letter, September 30th, to the ICIG. He responded in an inadequate way on October 8th. And we said, look, right now, we have to focus on this impeachment and going through all this, But Mr. I.G., we're going to come back to this. He's had since then, he knew we weren't happy with the response, so we will be sending him a new letter this week, give him another week to respond.

And I think every time I hear about -- I hear of conversations around war, I find myself being stricken with PTSD. Since he got into office, the president of the United States has been goading Iran into war. This is a man who is both an arsonist and a fireman. He starts a crisis, then he wants to create the appearance of wanting to solve it."

She gets PTSD about a strike on a terrorist mastermind, but today at the press conference, when discussion turned to American casualties in Iraq, here she is giggling and gossiping. Look at her. Laughing her head off with her little pals. Worst of all, in a tweet last night, she seemed to offer Iran suggestions on targets they might consider striking. She wrote \"Trump needs to immediately divest with his businesses and comply with the emoluments clause. Iran could threaten Trump hotels worldwide, and he could provoke war over the loss of revenue from skittish. His business interests should not be driving our military decisions.\" I don't see how in any way his business decisions are driving anything, but to signal out, to point out a private enterprise, is really outrageous, and to side with a regime like Iran. and speaking of switching alliances, Laura, it appears that Harry and Meghan Markle -- Prince Harry -- they dropped a blistering announcement on Instagram today, stating that they intend to step back as senior members of the royal family --"

The Queen was totally blindsided by this announcement. In a statement Buckingham Palace responded with \"Discussions with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are at an early stage. We understand their desire to take a different approach. But these are complicated issues that will take time to work through.\" I'll bet. You can imagine the reaction in the U.K. was not warm.

Now, how that helps the media stay away from you, I don't understand, but that is their argument here. My guess, this is going to look like season 4 of \"The Crown,\" Hollywood days.

The president is preparing to say something along the lines of all the experts say that I should deal from a position of weakness, that I should appease our enemies and not offend anybody. And the president will say, I stood up for America. I took this action because we had a bad actor that we had a chance to take out. He's killed hundreds of Americans, and many of our allies.

Even though a majority of folks supported the strike against Soleimani, Republicans overwhelmingly, independents by a double-digit margin, 68 percent, so two out of three Democrats, disapproved of it, including half of Democrats strongly disapproved of it. So here is Bernie saying what most Democrats are thinking, and he has the benefit of being authentic, authentically anti- war. And so that's resonating with Democratic voters. But to Scott's point, I'm not sure how well that will play in the general election if Bernie is the nominee."

So instead of using his statement today to lay out a coherent strategy on Iran, Donald Trump used it to mislead the country on the Obama-Biden record. He's been president for three years. It's time he stopped blaming President Obama for his failures.\" Scott, Biden is the frontrunner. I'd have to bet on him right now for getting the nomination. But was that good for him?"

No. President Trump is going to sit down with me for a wide-ranging interview on Iran, impeachment, China, immigration, a whole lot more. That's all the time we have tonight.
