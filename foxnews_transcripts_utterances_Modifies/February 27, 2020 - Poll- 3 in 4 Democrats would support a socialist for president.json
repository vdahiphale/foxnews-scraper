With today's drubbing, the sixth in a row, by the way, the closely watched S&P 500 is officially in correction territory. So too the Dow and Nasdaq. That means they are down 10 percent or more from highs, in some averages' cases, happened a little more than a week ago.  We have not seen that quick a correction since 1933. And, by the way, many of the stocks within the Dow, within the Nasdaq, within the S&P 500, many of those stocks are off a heck of a lot more than that.  So, what happens now?  Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto. And to hear traders tell it, it is not about the virus, it is not knowing what is next for this virus, because it is spreading so fast, from just China, where it all started, to some 14 countries today, including the United States.  State officials in California trying to track down anyone who may have come in contact with this person who tested positive for the virus from, all we know, unknown origins. Now word from U.C. Davis Medical Center that there may have been a delay in testing that person, this as the number of new cases reported outside China are now exceeding the number of new cases in China. That is the first time that has ever happened. Countries the world over suddenly pondering canceling big crowd events, from soccer games in Europe, to possibly the Summer Olympics itself in Japan.  So many countries, so many fears, but relax. We have got you covered with the very, very latest with FOX Business' Jackie DeAngelis on investors trying to shake off those fears -- good luck -- Susan Li with Apple CEO Tim Cook trying to calm those fears, for its stock, at least -- good luck -- and Jonathan Hunt in Los Angeles, where they're suddenly dealing with their own contagion fears, and they're not finding much luck.   We begin with Jackie. Hey, Jackie.",

That is correction territory, more than that, as a matter of fact, when it came to the Dow closing down more than 1,000 points. This is all on coronavirus. Now, even more troubling is the yield on the 10-year note. That's the treasury, all-time lows, under 1.3 percent. Remember, the bond market is where investors go when they seek safety. The money pours in, the yield goes down. That is what you're seeing now. It has been a bumpy ride for airlines hotels, casinos, health care, technology, just to name a few groups that have been hit really hard. But there are some bright spots in this market, if you can actually believe it. The surgical mask makers. People have already been stocking up.  You can see Alpha Pro Tech, Lakeland, 3M, those stocks seeing little bumps today. Well, 3M is the smallest, but the other two big bombs. Then, of course, you have got the companies that are working on vaccines for the virus, and then Clorox. Disinfectant wipes, people are buying them.   Less directly related to the virus, Zoom Video Communications. With concerns about coming to the office to work, the expectation is that there will be a surge in working from home and also videoconferencing. So, of course, that one is up 7 percent. Even still, since Monday, Neil, more than 3,000 points have come off the Dow Jones industrial average.",

Now, I spoke to Tim Cook, and I asked him, do you think you will move some of your supply chains outside of China with this inflection point, especially with coronavirus policy squeezing some of these supply chains and production factories? He says that's something that they will assess. I has asked him, will you see these disruptions past the second quarter of this year? He says, we will have to see.   But, right now, what you get from Tim Cook and really from Apple, and I would probably guess the rest of the entire corporate world, is that it is a fluid situation.

This new case is potentially one of the most significant and worrying yet, because the infected woman has not traveled outside the United States recently, and has not been in contact with anyone known to have been infected.  So that means she likely contracted it via an undiagnosed carrier who is still out there somewhere, potentially still infecting others. The Centers for Disease Control said in a statement -- quote -- \"At this time, the patient's exposure is unknown. It's possible this could be an instance of community spread of COVID-19, which would be the first time this has happened in the United States.\" The woman is from Solano County in Northern California. She's been treated at U.C. Davis Medical Center in Sacramento. The infection was picked up through the public health system, according to the CDC, by what they called it astute clinicians, although doctors at U.C. Davis say the CDC testing guidelines are too narrow, and cases like hers and others may be slipping through, a fear echoed today by California Governor Gavin Newsom.",

In Japan, the school system has been shut down completely to try to protect children. There are suggestions, Neil, the Tokyo Olympics set for this summer may have to be canceled.

So this is very important, because, once we understand the exposure, we can actually trace the exposure to the other patients and try to quarantine the other patients and protect the community. The second concern is that, if this has nothing to do with patient exposure, and this is a virus that actually mutated, and we are seeing this virus just kind of starting from scratch, it is a concern as well. So these two situations are going to have to be very in-depth study by the CDC to understand where this virus is coming from. But these are situations where -- need some time and need a lot of very aggressive approach from the public health perspective. At this point, it's only speculation, but I think, in practice, to answer your question, is that once we have a patient in the community that we don't know the exposure, it is likely that we have other patients infected. And so the public health of that municipality and that state has to be pretty progressive trying to look for all the possible situations.",

Again, a quick peek at the corner of Wall and Broad and the big sell-off today. Markets just abhor uncertainty, and especially uncertainty over something like this. So, the better part of valor is to just bail out. Forget about all the money leaving, though. When we come back, we're going to tell you where a lot of that money is going.  Corrections happen, of course. In fact, some say they're actually healthy things to have. What's weird and scary this time is how fast this one happened, in the case of the S&P 500, the quickest descent since 1933, for the Nasdaq, the fastest fall since 1971. And this week ain't done, yet it's already the worst week for stocks since the financial meltdown back in 2008. Is all that a bit much? Are the markets overreacting here? Are people getting a little ahead of themselves and just freaking out? Let's ask our market pros, Stephen \"the Sarge\" Guilfoyle, Bob Iaccino and Jonas Max Ferris. Steve, what do you think? Is this a bit overdone or justified? STEPHEN GUILFOYLE, FOUNDER, SARGE986: Well, technically, we're oversold, but it probably is justified.  I mean, I want to tell the folks at home who maybe are not in our industry just what's going on here. Stocks are priced on forward earnings, on forward guidance, all right? MasterCard, Microsoft, Apple, United Airlines, they have all told us they're not going to meet those expectations for this quarter. Goldman Sachs has come out and told you that there may not be earnings growth for the entire year. What happens then is, there are fund redemptions. All right, people pull their money out of equity indices. This creates cash. It puts money into treasuries and it forces money back overseas. Overseas investors don't have any obligations, so they have to pull their money out of the U.S. markets. And that's why you saw the euro higher and the U.S. dollar lower. What you saw late today with this with this flash crash to the downside was technical. All right, 3046 was the 200-day moving average, simple moving average. What happens on Wall Street is, portfolio managers control this money, while their risk managers watch these technical levels. At these levels, when they break, they are then forced by their risk managers to act upon that. And they were forced to act upon that late in the day today, which forced a much greater reaction to the downside. There is a little bit of hope. All right, so tomorrow is the last day of the month. All right, we are going to be up against some kind of pension rebalancing. I don't know the numbers yet. But there will be a forced selling of the bond market in order to rebalance. And that money will have to go into equities. It may not be that large in comparison to what we have just seen, but maybe it'll at least slow the flow.",

But the reality is, we don't know how the consumer is going to behave, how long they're going to not travel, how long they're going to stop spending. Or, on the plus side, are they going to buy more stuff because interest rates just got very low, lower than we have had in recessions, when the Fed low -- like, these are really deals in mortgages now. But if the consumer is scared for real reasons, or imagined or just fear reasons, then it doesn't matter if rates go to zero percent. They're not going to take out mortgages and buy homes or travel or borrow money or buy cars or lease things. So, we don't really know. Stocks got very expensive, particularly tech stocks, over the last year or so. It doesn't take a lot to cause sharp corrections, whether it was '87, 2000. Those are all from high levels, even '07.

Everyone else is below the state's viability threshold. A number of polls this week have shown a much tighter race between Sanders and Biden. This one, though, is something that the Biden campaign certainly can and probably are cheering about. Biden did pick up a significant endorsement from representative Jim Clyburn yesterday. The Monmouth poll was conducted before that. A lot of endorsements don't do a whole lot to change things on the ground. Clyburn's endorsement, though, is a bigger deal than most and actually could move the needle in this state. Black voters make up about 60 percent of the Democratic electorate in the state of South Carolina. Biden has a lot of support within the African- American community, but we have also seen that support drop some in national polls post-Iowa, as candidates like Bernie Sanders and Mike Bloomberg makes gains. All of them, though, are still on the ground here. We just left a Buttigieg event where he focused at a roundtable talking about health care issues with local leaders.

We saw one seller charging about $150 for shipping, others increasing the price of masks by almost five times compared to December, according to the price tracking Web site Keepa.com. We went to a Walgreens and a CVS here in Chicago as well. No masks at either of those stores. The particular CVS we went to is even limiting customers to one box because of high demand, which could explain why shoppers are turning to Amazon. In a statement to FOX Business, Amazon says: \"Sellers set their own product prices, and we have policies to help ensure sellers are pricing products competitively. We actively monitor our store and remove offers that violate our policies.\" Of course, stocks tanking across the board today, but some companies are seeing a boost, like the ones that make these medical face masks, particularly Alpha Pro Tech, closing up more than 100 percent today.

      "utterance": "Here we don't go. Forget the virus. You should see the selling that has now gone viral, so much and so fast. With today's drubbing, the sixth in a row, by the way, the closely watched S&P 500 is officially in correction territory. So too the Dow and Nasdaq. That means they are down 10 percent or more from highs, in some averages' cases, happened a little more than a week ago. We have not seen that quick a correction since 1933. And, by the way, many of the stocks within the Dow, within the Nasdaq, within the S&P 500, many of those stocks are off a heck of a lot more than that. So, what happens now? Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto. And to hear traders tell it, it is not about the virus, it is not knowing what is next for this virus, because it is spreading so fast, from just China, where it all started, to some 14 countries today, including the United States. State officials in California trying to track down anyone who may have come in contact with this person who tested positive for the virus from, all we know, unknown origins. Now word from U.C. Davis Medical Center that there may have been a delay in testing that person, this as the number of new cases reported outside China are now exceeding the number of new cases in China. That is the first time that has ever happened. Countries the world over suddenly pondering canceling big crowd events, from soccer games in Europe, to possibly the Summer Olympics itself in Japan. So many countries, so many fears, but relax. We have got you covered with the very, very latest with FOX Business' Jackie DeAngelis on investors trying to shake off those fears -- good luck -- Susan Li with Apple CEO Tim Cook trying to calm those fears, for its stock, at least -- good luck -- and Jonathan Hunt in Los Angeles, where they're suddenly dealing with their own contagion fears, and they're not finding much luck. We begin with Jackie. Hey, Jackie."

That is correction territory, more than that, as a matter of fact, when it came to the Dow closing down more than 1,000 points. This is all on coronavirus. Now, even more troubling is the yield on the 10-year note. That's the treasury, all-time lows, under 1.3 percent. Remember, the bond market is where investors go when they seek safety. The money pours in, the yield goes down. That is what you're seeing now. It has been a bumpy ride for airlines hotels, casinos, health care, technology, just to name a few groups that have been hit really hard. But there are some bright spots in this market, if you can actually believe it. The surgical mask makers. People have already been stocking up. You can see Alpha Pro Tech, Lakeland, 3M, those stocks seeing little bumps today. Well, 3M is the smallest, but the other two big bombs. Then, of course, you have got the companies that are working on vaccines for the virus, and then Clorox. Disinfectant wipes, people are buying them. Less directly related to the virus, Zoom Video Communications. With concerns about coming to the office to work, the expectation is that there will be a surge in working from home and also videoconferencing. So, of course, that one is up 7 percent. Even still, since Monday, Neil, more than 3,000 points have come off the Dow Jones industrial average."

Now, that has been happening, but, so far, it has not really benefited stocks or a point at which you could put on floor on all of this. We will be monitoring it.

On the supplier side, we have suppliers. You know, iPhone is built everywhere in the world. We have key components coming from the United States. We have key parts that are in China and so on and so forth. When you look at the parts that are done in China, we have reopened factories. So the factories were able to work through the conditions to reopen. They're reopening. They're also in ramp. And so I think as this as sort of the third phase of getting back to normal.

They also get 20 percent of their sales in China as well. One of the first major companies to warn about sales being impacted by the coronavirus. Now, I spoke to Tim Cook, and I asked him, do you think you will move some of your supply chains outside of China with this inflection point, especially with coronavirus policy squeezing some of these supply chains and production factories? He says that's something that they will assess. I has asked him, will you see these disruptions past the second quarter of this year? He says, we will have to see. But, right now, what you get from Tim Cook and really from Apple, and I would probably guess the rest of the entire corporate world, is that it is a fluid situation. There are a lot of unknowns at this point, but they're trying to do the best that they can. Neil, I will get you more of this exclusive interview all day tomorrow on FOX News and FOX Business with Apple CEO Tim Cook -- back to you."

This new case is potentially one of the most significant and worrying yet, because the infected woman has not traveled outside the United States recently, and has not been in contact with anyone known to have been infected. So that means she likely contracted it via an undiagnosed carrier who is still out there somewhere, potentially still infecting others. The Centers for Disease Control said in a statement -- quote -- \"At this time, the patient's exposure is unknown. It's possible this could be an instance of community spread of COVID-19, which would be the first time this has happened in the United States.\" The woman is from Solano County in Northern California. She's been treated at U.C. Davis Medical Center in Sacramento. The infection was picked up through the public health system, according to the CDC, by what they called it astute clinicians, although doctors at U.C. Davis say the CDC testing guidelines are too narrow, and cases like hers and others may be slipping through, a fear echoed today by California Governor Gavin Newsom."

In Japan, the school system has been shut down completely to try to protect children. There are suggestions, Neil, the Tokyo Olympics set for this summer may have to be canceled. And the remainder of Japan's baseball season, 72 games, will be played in empty stadiums to reduce the risk of the virus spreading among crowds.

So the right thing is to actually detect to the patients that are getting infected, quarantine, and try to prevent the spread of the disease.

      "speaker": "KALIL",

And if that's true, we're going to know probably in the next few days the trend of the numbers of people getting infected or not. But if that's true, that means that this will happen as well outside China. So we're going to have a time where the cases are going to come down as well. I think what the question that we cannot answer at this point is, how long is it going to take? But I think by the -- as you just reported and what we are seeing today and the last few days, some other countries and other places having new cases, still going to have an increase of cases outside China for a while, before we have a decrease."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "KALIL",
      "utterance": "Right. So, I think the concerns are -- and I'm sure that the CDC is looking for that -- I think there are two concerns. One is, where is the exposure of this patient? So this is very important, because, once we understand the exposure, we can actually trace the exposure to the other patients and try to quarantine the other patients and protect the community. The second concern is that, if this has nothing to do with patient exposure, and this is a virus that actually mutated, and we are seeing this virus just kind of starting from scratch, it is a concern as well. So these two situations are going to have to be very in-depth study by the CDC to understand where this virus is coming from. But these are situations where -- need some time and need a lot of very aggressive approach from the public health perspective. At this point, it's only speculation, but I think, in practice, to answer your question, is that once we have a patient in the community that we don't know the exposure, it is likely that we have other patients infected. And so the public health of that municipality and that state has to be pretty progressive trying to look for all the possible situations."

Again, a quick peek at the corner of Wall and Broad and the big sell-off today. Markets just abhor uncertainty, and especially uncertainty over something like this. So, the better part of valor is to just bail out. Forget about all the money leaving, though. When we come back, we're going to tell you where a lot of that money is going. Corrections happen, of course. In fact, some say they're actually healthy things to have. What's weird and scary this time is how fast this one happened, in the case of the S&P 500, the quickest descent since 1933, for the Nasdaq, the fastest fall since 1971. And this week ain't done, yet it's already the worst week for stocks since the financial meltdown back in 2008. Is all that a bit much? Are the markets overreacting here? Are people getting a little ahead of themselves and just freaking out? Let's ask our market pros, Stephen \"the Sarge\" Guilfoyle, Bob Iaccino and Jonas Max Ferris. Steve, what do you think? Is this a bit overdone or justified? STEPHEN GUILFOYLE, FOUNDER, SARGE986: Well, technically, we're oversold, but it probably is justified. I mean, I want to tell the folks at home who maybe are not in our industry just what's going on here. Stocks are priced on forward earnings, on forward guidance, all right? MasterCard, Microsoft, Apple, United Airlines, they have all told us they're not going to meet those expectations for this quarter. Goldman Sachs has come out and told you that there may not be earnings growth for the entire year. What happens then is, there are fund redemptions. All right, people pull their money out of equity indices. This creates cash. It puts money into treasuries and it forces money back overseas. Overseas investors don't have any obligations, so they have to pull their money out of the U.S. markets. And that's why you saw the euro higher and the U.S. dollar lower. What you saw late today with this with this flash crash to the downside was technical. All right, 3046 was the 200-day moving average, simple moving average. What happens on Wall Street is, portfolio managers control this money, while their risk managers watch these technical levels. At these levels, when they break, they are then forced by their risk managers to act upon that. And they were forced to act upon that late in the day today, which forced a much greater reaction to the downside. There is a little bit of hope. All right, so tomorrow is the last day of the month. All right, we are going to be up against some kind of pension rebalancing. I don't know the numbers yet. But there will be a forced selling of the bond market in order to rebalance. And that money will have to go into equities. It may not be that large in comparison to what we have just seen, but maybe it'll at least slow the flow."

I'm just curious, Bob, when you look at it, what do you tell investors? I mean, because the one offset here is, interest rates are a lot lower. We're seeing gas prices a lot lower. That should provide a good floor and a good cash savings to just average folks and you would think for the market. What's happening?"

It was also one of the quickest rallies. The Nasdaq today got to the area that we were in December, not 10 years ago, not five years ago, just in December."

Number two, the coronavirus death rate is what's concerning, 3.3 percent. If China could actually get declining rates of infection in about two months or so -- first case was, in hindsight, about December 27 or so -- if they can get declining rates in two months, the U.S. is going to get declining rates quicker than that. I'm going to probably start buying on Monday, unless this thing explodes over the weekend."

And neither does the stock market or the bond market, which is why, in the short run, it's actually just a lot of chaos and scariness that we're trying to like analyze with technical levels. But the reality is, we don't know how the consumer is going to behave, how long they're going to not travel, how long they're going to stop spending. Or, on the plus side, are they going to buy more stuff because interest rates just got very low, lower than we have had in recessions, when the Fed low -- like, these are really deals in mortgages now. But if the consumer is scared for real reasons, or imagined or just fear reasons, then it doesn't matter if rates go to zero percent. They're not going to take out mortgages and buy homes or travel or borrow money or buy cars or lease things. So, we don't really know. Stocks got very expensive, particularly tech stocks, over the last year or so. It doesn't take a lot to cause sharp corrections, whether it was '87, 2000. Those are all from high levels, even '07. So that's what I'm concerned about, is that the pricing was high relative to this new fear."

It's about 2 or 3 percent of our defense budget. Let's fund the CDC. Let's fund the states. Let's find the NIH. And, three, let's make sure that our front-line workers, our doctors, our nurses, have the equipment they need. And I'm willing to work with the administration. I think we're all Americans.

And we need to get the investment in the CDC and the NIH, and let the experts lead. Let the scientists read -- lead on this. Frankly, politicians should say less, and let's get people who actually understand the science telling us what we need to do. One final point, Neil, to make is, this shows why we need actually a global economy, and why a trade war would be devastating for America. I mean, look what has happened to the markets just in a few weeks. Apple is in my district, and their profits are being hurt.

Well, the vice president followed up today by adding four people at the senior-most level to the task force. That includes two from the economic side, the treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, and the chair of the National Economic Council, Larry Kudlow, along with two medical professionals, the surgeon general, Dr. Jerome Adams, and the government's top official in charge of combating HIV/AIDS, Ambassador Debbie Birx.

Start designating those hospitals. Start designating special equipment. We don't need to open 50 hospitals in each state to deal with it. We need to have regional hospitals deal with that can isolate patients, start getting the supplies there, and start talking through to doctors and ensuring protocols, as they are developed, with lessons from the Chinese and other nations that have started to contain. The problem is, we haven't contained yet and the numbers continue to grow. So there's a lot to be learned and a lot to share. America has a very short fuse on disasters.

Everyone else is below the state's viability threshold. A number of polls this week have shown a much tighter race between Sanders and Biden. This one, though, is something that the Biden campaign certainly can and probably are cheering about. Biden did pick up a significant endorsement from representative Jim Clyburn yesterday. The Monmouth poll was conducted before that. A lot of endorsements don't do a whole lot to change things on the ground. Clyburn's endorsement, though, is a bigger deal than most and actually could move the needle in this state. Black voters make up about 60 percent of the Democratic electorate in the state of South Carolina. Biden has a lot of support within the African- American community, but we have also seen that support drop some in national polls post-Iowa, as candidates like Bernie Sanders and Mike Bloomberg makes gains. All of them, though, are still on the ground here. We just left a Buttigieg event where he focused at a roundtable talking about health care issues with local leaders.

And the clear answer there is that Senator Sanders would correct for the worst abuses of the Trump administration. He would fill those national security roles that have gone unfilled or that are filled by unqualified people, things that are really leaving us at risk.

      "utterance": "Yes, because under a -- the national health emergency that the president has declared, it gives really extraordinary powers to the federal government. And there's literally only one case on point on this. And that's the Siegel case from decades ago, which essentially says that the government can quarantine citizens for public health purposes. So, as I look at this, I think the not in my backyard is -- it's a -- this is a moment where communities need to come together, citizens need to be informed and practice good hygiene. But we can't -- nobody should panic or be worried, because, unlike China, where you can't trust the information coming out of the government, in the United States, we have the -- the government is communicating very clearly the situation on a daily basis. And, again, I think we all need to practice not only individual good hygiene, but also be -- practice being good citizens and doing our part."

      "utterance": "Hey, Neil. Amazon is working to make sure third-party vendors are not trying to make money off of coronavirus fears. Some of those vendors have been accused of jacking up prices of those medical face masks that you see. We went on Amazon today, and we found a box of face masks for as much as $350. We saw one seller charging about $150 for shipping, others increasing the price of masks by almost five times compared to December, according to the price tracking Web site Keepa.com. We went to a Walgreens and a CVS here in Chicago as well. No masks at either of those stores. The particular CVS we went to is even limiting customers to one box because of high demand, which could explain why shoppers are turning to Amazon."

      "speaker": "In a statement to FOX Business, Amazon says",
      "utterance": "\"Sellers set their own product prices, and we have policies to help ensure sellers are pricing products competitively. We actively monitor our store and remove offers that violate our policies.\" Of course, stocks tanking across the board today, but some companies are seeing a boost, like the ones that make these medical face masks, particularly Alpha Pro Tech, closing up more than 100 percent today. We should note, though, Neil, the CDC is not recommending the general public where these face masks right now."

      "utterance": "All right, Grady, thank you very, very much. I don't know how you folks feel about that, but, I mean, there's got to be a special corner in hell for people who are gouging and taking advantage of a worldwide crisis and trying to make a quick buck on it. There are laws against that with gas stations and others that do the same during hurricanes or natural disaster events. But, man, oh, man, with everything that's going on, forget about losing your shirt in the market. You should lose a lot more when you pull that stunt in the middle of a crisis.
