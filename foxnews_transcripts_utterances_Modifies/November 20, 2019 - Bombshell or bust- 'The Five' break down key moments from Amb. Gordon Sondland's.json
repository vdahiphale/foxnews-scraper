The whistleblower said this, and that wasn't the conversation, because we have the transcribed conversation.” And also, shifty Schiff -- he's a dishonest -- he's a corrupt politician. When he imitated or tried to copy my conversation, he didn't copy it. He made up a conversation, went before Congress, and made up a phony conversation, just like he does every time he talks. He's a phony. He's a very dishonest, very corrupt politician. So, instead of -- and, look, the big upset, as you folks know, was when I released the transcript, because I don't like doing that, because you have to keep this very, very classified and confidential when you're speaking to heads of state.

No problem. This guy was a total joke.” So, I think both sides will try to tell their story, and we can get into all of that. I felt like during the hearing that the Democrats were excited to have him, and then they were like, “Wait, no, we're not so excited.” And then it was like the Republicans and the Democrats got so frustrated with him, and he was just there saying, “I just was trying to do my best.” He's not a note taker, and his memory is, as human memories can be, faulty. He's like, “I'm not exactly sure of the dates and the times and the calls,” plus the State Department won't allow him to access his records, so he can't actually go back and look at it. So, the members of Congress are so frustrated, and then you get to this question from Representative Turner. “Did -- no one on this planet told you Trump was trying to aid -- tying aid to investigators, yes or no?” and he says, “Yes, no one ever told me that.” And I think the Republicans will try to say, “There we go.” Now, we saw -- I talked about polls earlier today. Like, the polls on impeachment are not going in the Democrats' favor at all. Well, maybe I shouldn't say “at all.” On the ones that we've seen so far, especially, like, in Wisconsin, an important battleground state; eight percentage points more than before. Did people say, “We don't think impeachment a thing?” That doesn't mean he's going to win, although he's up against all the other possible opponents, but I think that if you have a persuade, you don't have many persuadable Democrats are going to say he's guilty. The Republicans are going to say he's not. For the people that are in the middle, I don't think it's going to be very effective for Republicans to go out and say perfect call. No problem here. I think they need some sort of an off ramp so they can say the aid got to the Ukrainians. We support the Ukrainians. We are for this for our national security. We want to continue to do this. This does not rise to an impeachable offense. And I think that's where the Republicans will probably be most successful after this test.",

And it's because I ran stuff for a living. Right? If you manage things. We talked about this earlier, Dana, in your office. We talked about how anybody who's involved in management, which means hiring or firing or dealing with budgets, dealing with human resources. We look at this and we're going like, wow, this is just how the world works. And you understand how so many people in the media, they don't have a talent stack. Right? They have a singular vertical experience from journalism and high school journalism and college being promoted through the ranks as a journalist. They don't have a collection of versatile skills. So, they don't you understand. It's like why journalists are so bad with writing about businesses and writing about the economy is they have no financial backgrounds. They're pathetic right? And the people whose hairs are on fire on Twitter or the media reporters generally have almost no experience whatsoever in the outside world. They don't go to an office and have to deal with the like people asking for raises or having to cut staff. So, when it comes to issues about business or employment or human interaction, there are abject failures. So, I use this example. There is a period in your life as a businessman where your personal goals and your professional goals coincide. Right? Joe Biden is a political rival. You investigate him. He benefits the country and it benefits the leader. That is where a professional and a personal goal coincides. Likewise, we have a great hair and makeup staff at The Five. Personally, it makes me look great. Professionally, it helps the show because if I look good, the show does better. If I look like a slob, it doesn't. In this case, the personal and professional goals coincide. When you're the President of the United States and you're dealing with a person who may be dealing with a corrupt country, a known corrupt country in the past, possibly in the future, it may benefit you to investigate him, but it benefits the country as well.

It was dramatic in terms of that damning opening statement. It was clear that he was saying, was there a quid pro quo as you played in the soundbite, Jesse? He said yes. And if he had not said that there was a quid pro quo, it would have been absolutely deflating for the Democrats.

But that being said, I don't think Adam Schiff really cares about any of the facts or whether they're good or bad for Republicans. He is moving this thing forward no matter what happens. He ran to the cameras during that break to talk about articles of impeachment that he wants to put forward.

He has it on quid pro quo.” He starts answering questions; no quid pro quo at all with the military aid. In fact, Trump never mentioned, quote unquote, “security assistance.” “I don't want anything from Ukraine.” The only quid pro quo he assumed was they wanted a White House meeting in exchange for an announcement of an investigation. Not even an investigation, an announcement. So, PR for PR, and what that's about is this. It's a corrupt country. Trump doesn't trust it because they colluded with the Democrats.

No problem. This guy was a total joke.” So, I think both sides will try to tell their story, and we can get into all of that. I felt like during the hearing that the Democrats were excited to have him, and then they were like, “Wait, no, we're not so excited.” And then it was like the Republicans and the Democrats got so frustrated with him, and he was just there saying, “I just was trying to do my best.” He's not a note taker, and his memory is, as human memories can be, faulty. He's like, “I'm not exactly sure of the dates and the times and the calls,” plus the State Department won't allow him to access his records, so he can't actually go back and look at it. So, the members of Congress are so frustrated, and then you get to this question from Representative Turner. “Did -- no one on this planet told you Trump was trying to aid -- tying aid to investigators, yes or no?” and he says, “Yes, no one ever told me that.” And I think the Republicans will try to say, “There we go.” Now, we saw -- I talked about polls earlier today. Like, the polls on impeachment are not going in the Democrats' favor at all. Well, maybe I shouldn't say “at all.” On the ones that we've seen so far, especially, like, in Wisconsin, an important battleground state; eight percentage points more than before. Did people say, “We don't think impeachment a thing?” That doesn't mean he's going to win, although he's up against all the other possible opponents, but I think that if you have a persuade, you don't have many persuadable Democrats are going to say he's guilty. The Republicans are going to say he's not. For the people that are in the middle, I don't think it's going to be very effective for Republicans to go out and say perfect call. No problem here. I think they need some sort of an off ramp so they can say the aid got to the Ukrainians. We support the Ukrainians. We are for this for our national security. We want to continue to do this. This does not rise to an impeachable offense. And I think that's where the Republicans will probably be most successful after this test."

And it's because I ran stuff for a living. Right? If you manage things. We talked about this earlier, Dana, in your office. We talked about how anybody who's involved in management, which means hiring or firing or dealing with budgets, dealing with human resources. We look at this and we're going like, wow, this is just how the world works. And you understand how so many people in the media, they don't have a talent stack. Right? They have a singular vertical experience from journalism and high school journalism and college being promoted through the ranks as a journalist. They don't have a collection of versatile skills. So, they don't you understand. It's like why journalists are so bad with writing about businesses and writing about the economy is they have no financial backgrounds. They're pathetic right? And the people whose hairs are on fire on Twitter or the media reporters generally have almost no experience whatsoever in the outside world. They don't go to an office and have to deal with the like people asking for raises or having to cut staff. So, when it comes to issues about business or employment or human interaction, there are abject failures. So, I use this example. There is a period in your life as a businessman where your personal goals and your professional goals coincide. Right? Joe Biden is a political rival. You investigate him. He benefits the country and it benefits the leader. That is where a professional and a personal goal coincides. Likewise, we have a great hair and makeup staff at The Five. Personally, it makes me look great. Professionally, it helps the show because if I look good, the show does better. If I look like a slob, it doesn't. In this case, the personal and professional goals coincide. When you're the President of the United States and you're dealing with a person who may be dealing with a corrupt country, a known corrupt country in the past, possibly in the future, it may benefit you to investigate him, but it benefits the country as well. Ain't no crime. Just a fun time."

We were doing the coverage and I noticed that Ken Starr and Andy McCarthy both thought Trump had a bad day, especially after that first the morning session when you heard directly from Ambassador Sondland. It was dramatic in terms of that damning opening statement. It was clear that he was saying, was there a quid pro quo as you played in the soundbite, Jesse? He said yes. And if he had not said that there was a quid pro quo, it would have been absolutely deflating for the Democrats. This was what the Democrats had advertised, this is going to be our John, and this is going to be a key moment. Afterwards, Adam Schiff said this was a seminal moment today.

He admitted this was something that he was presuming to be happening and he was saying that it was with people working for Trump. Later in the afternoon, he then said directly, the president has never told me to engage in a quid pro quo. He hasn't asked me for that directly. He's never said those things. So while he inferred from people he was working with overseas that maybe that's what was being asked for. He didn't implicate the president directly as an order coming directly from the White House. But that being said, I don't think Adam Schiff really cares about any of the facts or whether they're good or bad for Republicans. He is moving this thing forward no matter what happens. He ran to the cameras during that break to talk about articles of impeachment that he wants to put forward. I guarantee you he's going to write one up on bribery and the other one up on obstruction of Congress because he talked about it today, whether they're valid or not.

I think it's going to be very difficult for him to do so. I think that because -- I think he has to wonder tonight, does he still have the confidence of the president? Remember Yovanovitch? She was fired because the president lost confidence in her. And how can he continue to do his job when every world leader is going to be very suspect about his ability to do his job and his -- I'm not questioning his credibility. I just think the appearance of the problem of him not being able to get the president on the phone and have the confidence of Mike Pomepeo is going to be a problem."

So, for me, I was thinking, you know, the idea that, oh, a lot of these people are Never Trumpers -- I don't think he's a Never Trumper. I think that he gave a lot of money to President Trump; he's been -- he was selected by Mike Pompeo and the president. He said people asked him, “Do you speak to the president often?” He said, “Well, do you consider 20 times?” I think that's a lot. And then secondly, I think that you can't say this is the deep state. Again, he is a Trump guy. And finally, I would say this really struck me, that he said that, you know, his properties -- I think it's in Oregon, Jesse -- are being surrounded, picketed, threats to his family."

    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "So, the final point on this is, you know, you can lie to reporters, but you can't lie to Congress, as, you know, people like Roger Stone have found out. You can go to jail. So, what we have seen, though, is no documents being released, no Pompeo, no Giuliani -- and I think that's getting hot. You know, where is Rudy Giuliani? No Bolton, and I think Bolton must be sitting there thinking, “I know a lot about this.” No Mick Mulvaney, except they're playing tapes of Mulvaney saying, “Oh, yeah, get over it. So what? There was a quid pro quo.” No Mike Pence. And where is Donald Trump?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "Well, Juan, let me -- Jesse, we started off talking about the media. We have to remind everybody that this narrative has been pushed from the very beginning. They tried out the same faces, the same names, and the same accusations. We can't -- how can we trust these people who pushed obstruction and Kavanaugh and collusion now? How can we trust them now?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "We can't. And the media has no self-awareness. I mean, they cooked up a hoax for three years; that fell apart. The same week that falls apart, where Muller's thing blows up, they cook up this new whistleblower scandal, and then they have to expect the American people to go along for another year of this. The American people are busy. The American people are tired. What Sondland thought about the interagency process with regards to a military aid package to Ukraine is just not seeping into the consciousness of the American public. Trump's Gallup numbers are up two points since. Independents are against impeachment, up 10 points since. In Wisconsin -- Dana just mentioned -- support against impeachment; it's going the other way. So, I just don't think these are really breaking through. In the morning, I thought, “Wow, this guy has the goods. He has it on quid pro quo.” He starts answering questions; no quid pro quo at all with the military aid. In fact, Trump never mentioned, quote unquote, “security assistance.” “I don't want anything from Ukraine.” The only quid pro quo he assumed was they wanted a White House meeting in exchange for an announcement of an investigation. Not even an investigation, an announcement. So, PR for PR, and what that's about is this. It's a corrupt country. Trump doesn't trust it because they colluded with the Democrats. A new president; they're supposed to throw all this money out there without checking in to see if this guy's legit? Send us a signal, Zelensky, if you to corruption seriously. We're looking for a signal. Do we have a signal? Hey, the money got out anyway. It doesn't even matter at this point."

But I want to pick up on what Dana said about it being difficult for him to go back and do his job, because the State Department now is releasing a number of pushbacks, saying that his suggestions -- Secretary Pompeo was aware of, you know, investigations for political reasons, that any claims of that in his testimony are completely false. They're also saying that he had access, like any current employee, to all of the documents that he wants when it comes to this investigation. So, they're pushing back on that hard. The Pence office also released a statement today pushing back on some of the things he said."

Department of Energy, like, but they're refusing to cooperate, and this guy has to get a lawyer, go in front of Congress. He is under threat of having to go to jail if he's caught a lie because he doesn't remember something from before. I mean, he's got a lot more on the line than -- and if the State Department is saying that he had access to all the information, then Sondland ought to maybe get a different lawyer, because that's not what he said."

She's had a lot more pressure in the last month since the previous debate about her policy. She rolled out her Medicare For All, which requires a number of steps, including immigration reform, to actually get to it. And then she wants to eliminate everybody's private health insurance. So I think Joe Biden will probably go after her on that."

I think some of the other candidates, maybe Biden or Bernie or Warren, are going to go after Mayor Pete. So this is the first debate where you'll see if Mayor Pete can kind of stand in the center of the ring and volley with the punches. Who knows? We're not going to know until we see. Biden has not raised a lot of money. He had a goal, hasn't even reached it. And he's got more damaging information about how he conducted himself and how his son conducted himself in Ukraine. Warren needs a good night because she's lost momentum. And Bernie is going to be Bernie. And I just expect some of the other lower caliber candidates to kind of throw a haymaker or do something wild to kind of rejuvenate their campaigns, because in the next month or so, you could see some more dropouts."

You have white, liberal, college educated women for Elizabeth Warren. Pete Buttigieg has got sort of like the cocktail circuit, the Amtrak wine circle or whatever they call it. Can anybody pull together all of these groups? And I should have mentioned Biden as well. He's got, of course, the older voters."

You hear from Republicans the idea, oh, this is going to drag on, it's going to detract. Even tonight, people say, hey, are you watching the hearings or you're going to watch the debate?

And now you have in today's hearing, Ambassador Sondland saying, oh, you know, we played the hand we were dealt. We didn't want to work with Rudy Giuliani, but that's what we had to do. And then you had Secretary Perry, Vice President Pence and now Pompeo there are putting out statements. They're adding to the fire.
