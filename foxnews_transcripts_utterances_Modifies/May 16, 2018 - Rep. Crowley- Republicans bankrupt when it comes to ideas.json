I can`t put ever a number on it, but certainly many criminals, we were not able to apprehend because they were given a heads-up. And it certainly put my officers at an extreme risk.

And employers are not giving illegal aliens a job out of the kindness of their heart. They`re paying them less wages. They`re taking advantage of them. It gives an unfair competition to other competitors who want to follow the law and follow the rules. So we`re taking this seriously, and we`re hoping to remove a magnet that entices further illegal entry. If they can get a job here, that`s another reason why they will come.

It`s unfortunate. That`s just enforcing the law. But for those who come to a port of entry and claim fear, if they get a credible fear finding from Citizenship and Immigration Services, which happens about 85 percent of the time, then they have got to wait to see a judge. So, we will hold them, except, if they`re a family unit, then we have limitations through the Ninth Circuit. We can only hold them for a certain period of time. But let`s be clear. Now, even though they may get 80 to 85 percent approval from their initial interview, when they go in front of an immigration judge, if they show up in front of an immigration judge, less than 20 percent actually get a credible fear finding, which, again, it`s a loophole in the system. It`s an issue we have asked Congress to address. If they want things like this to stop happening, Congress needs to take this seriously and address the loopholes that we have brought to their attention.",
