      "sentences": "Good evening welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. All of a sudden, it's pretty easy for people to move around the world, and all of a sudden they are. Poor people moving from poor countries across the globe into rich countries. Why wouldn't they? And again that's what's happening. Back in 2015, more than a million illegal migrants flooded into Europe, and many of them came to Hungary where we are right now. It was a crisis for the continent, but alone in Europe, Hungary figured out how to solve that problem in a way that we have not figured out here in the United States. How did Hungary do that? How did it preserve its borders and its society? What can we learn from that? Today, we took a trip to find out. We'll show you what we found in just a minute. Also, the woes for the country's creepiest governor -- that would be Governor Andrew Cuomo of New York -- are compounded today, getting even more painful, and yet at the same time more amusing. He is even being stabbed in the front by his allies at CNN. We've got that tape for you. But first tonight, good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. On New Year's Day of this year, Rochelle Walensky was just a college professor in Massachusetts. You've almost certainly never heard of her. You definitely didn't vote for her at any point because Walensky had never run for office. As of January 1st, her political power was precisely the same as yours, and everyone else's in this supposedly self-governing Republic. Rochelle Walensky had one vote out of a nation of 320 million people, and then just a few weeks later, everything changed for her and for the rest of us. Joe Biden appointed Walensky to run the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. At the time, it did not seem like a huge deal. The C.D.C. is not a legislative body, it's a public health bureau. It was originally designed to fight malaria, and it did a good job. The C.D.C. now gathers information about diseases and then releases guidance about those diseases to the public. That's what it does. The C.D.C. does not make laws in this country, it's not allowed to. Under the U.S. Constitution, making laws is the exclusive role of the Congress. You vote for your senators and your congressmen, and they decide what the rules are. That's known as Representative Democracy. It's been our system for nearly 250 years, but apparently it's now over. Rochelle Walensky now makes our laws. Walensky announced today that she has decided to nationalize America's rental properties, millions and millions of them from Maine to California. Tenants are no longer required to pay their rent. Property owners cannot evict them under any circumstances. Making someone pay to live on your property is now a Federal crime. Try it and you can wind up in prison with hundreds of thousands of dollars in fines. At the same time, you should know, property owners will still be required to pay the banks that hold their mortgages. There is no moratorium on mortgages. Why? The banks are huge Democratic donors and they are getting the treatment that they paid for. Sandy Cortez and the squad are not calling for the banks to do their part, so they're not. It is property owners who will suffer. Many of them members of the rapidly disappearing American Middle Class. It's hard to overstate what a momentous change this is. It means among other things that private property no longer exists in the United States. You thought you owned your home, not anymore. Rochelle Walensky does. She'll decide who can live there, under what circumstances, and for how long. Is this a good idea? Of course not. It's totalitarian. But there's an even more pressing question at the center of this -- a principle. A principle that defines what kind of country this is and what kind of country it will be going forward, and the question is this: Where did Rochelle Walensky get the power to do this? To suspend private property rights in America? And the answer is: She simply asserted the power. Walensky claimed she had the authority and no one stopped her from exercising it. This morning, she signed an official looking order declaring that her opinion is now the law and so it is the law, but wait, you say. That doesn't seem very American. Shouldn't somebody vote on this? If we are going to continue to pretend this is a democracy -- and you hear that on television constantly -- then shouldn't our elected lawmakers make the laws? No, and they're not going to. Nancy Pelosi has refused to call a vote on the matter and she runs the Congress, she decides. Meanwhile, most Republicans haven't said a word about it and that means that an unelected college professor you had never heard of six months ago is now in charge of your country. If you're wondering how all of this can possibly be legal, rest assured that it's not legal. It is not even arguably legal. We know that for a fact. The Supreme Court has just ruled on this specific question. The Court found that the C.D.C. does not have the right to institute a nationwide eviction moratorium. Period. Only Congress can do that. Now, the Court didn't make its guess on their view of this, the Court put this in writing in the clearest possible language. There is no debate about that. The Biden administration just ignored what the Court said. How can they do that? Well, Congresswoman Maxine Waters of Los Angeles understands exactly how they did it. Waters is hardly a genius. It is likely she has never read an entire book, but one thing Maxine Waters knows very well is how third world regimes operate. When you want something, you simply take it. You've got the guns, who is going to stop you? Might makes right, the Fidel Castro method. Waters explained that out loud today as she pushed Rochelle Walensky to suspend private property, quote: \"I don't buy that the C.D.C. can't extend the eviction moratorium,\" Waters wrote on Twitter, perfectly aware, as she did that, the Supreme Court has already prohibited this. Who is going to stop them? Who is going to penalize them? Well, good question. Nobody. And Nancy Pelosi knows that, too. Pelosi knows that what Rochelle Walensky just did is illegal by definition. She also understands that openly ignoring a Supreme Court ruling will mean the end of our current system, and that's fine with Nancy Pelosi, quote: \"The C.D.C. has the power to extend the eviction moratorium,\" Pelosi said. Pelosi didn't explain where that power might come from, she simply declared that it exists, as dictators do.",

And by the way, this is far more than although the attack -- the assault on private property is probably the most appalling and disgusting part of all this, but this is more than just that. This is also an attack on the concept of contracts. And contracts and private property, which of course we inherited from Western Civilization, it is why America is the richest and most powerful country on Earth. It is why everyone in the world wants to come here, it is because private property and contracts are tantamount for us. And this is an assault on that because these people, these Democrats who control everything want to turn us into China because in China, you don't have private property and anybody who has ever tried to do business -- you know ask any textile worker, ask any furniture maker what it is like to try to enforce a contract in China and they'll start laughing, because contracts don't exist in China.

      "sentences": "Welcome back from Budapest. Huge waves of human migration really are the biggest story of the age we're living in and they will certainly define the future. They've accelerated for a couple of reasons. One, it is very easy to travel from one end of the globe to another, easier than it's ever been in human history and cheaper. But for another, a lot of the world is getting less stable, and in part that's the fault of the West. Ideologues in this country, some of whom now work at the Biden State Department decided to overthrow the government of Iraq, that caused a domino effect of instability throughout the region and massive waves of human migration. Hillary Clinton decided that for some reason, we had to kill the leader of Libya that started a civil war in that country and again more migration. And then for the last 15 years, again ideologues in Washington have pushed more war in Syria. So, all of that had effects. One of those effects back in 2015, was the movement of more than a million people from the Middle East and North Africa, and in some cases, Sub Saharan Africa into Europe. Now Europe is controlled by the E.U., which is effectively controlled by Germany. No one says it out loud, but really, it's the German Empire, and at the time it was run by the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, and she decided to keep the doors open. She said that accepting more than a million migrants in her country was not a big deal at all, quote: \"Germany is a strong country. We will manage.\" Well, of course, she was completely wrong. That decision changed the nature of Germany forever. It caused a massive crime spike -- yes, that's true and proven -- and in general, disrupted the entire region. It's not clear who exactly benefited from that, even the migrants themselves, certainly the countries they came from were weaker as a result. But there was one country in Europe that decided not to play along with this disaster. It's not coincidental that that country is hated by the same ideologues in Washington who pushed the Iraq War, the same people who helped cause this problem are angry at a man called Viktor Orban who is the democratically elected Prime Minister of Hungary. And back in 2015, he decided, no, we're not going to allow our nation of 10 million people to be changed forever by people we didn't invite in and who are coming here illegally. And so, he put a stop to it. In the face of great international pressure, they called him all kinds of names. The E.U. called what he was doing illegal, but he did it anyway. He built a wall, and today we went to see it. We took a military helicopter down to the southern border of Hungary right where it borders Serbia and we looked at this Hungarian wall that has effectively ended illegal migration into the country. And we found a couple of things. For one, it is not actually a wall, it's a chain-link fence. It's very simple and if you sat for the last five years and listened to American experts debate how it is impossible to stop immigration with a wall, no matter how high tech, you learned that that's a complete lie. All you need is the will to do it. So, we went down there and we watched that wall and we noticed a couple of things. For one thing, unlike every border we've ever visited around the world, it was perfectly clean and orderly. There weren't piles of trash. There weren't scenes of human suffering because it was under control. Chaos creates humanitarian disasters. That's true everywhere around the world, and it's true particularly on borders and particularly in our southern border where there are people suffering and dying because the Biden ministration has abetted, in fact, welcomed chaos. But we didn't see that today. We saw order and clarity. You are not allowed to come to Hungary illegally. While we were on the border today, the Serbian border in Hungary, we saw two people who attempted to come illegally. Both of them turned out to be from Syria, and we watched what happened when they were apprehended. It was a very straightforward process, so straightforward that it was a little confusing to watch. They came over the border, they were immediately picked up by Border Patrol. They were brought to a detainment area. They were treated politely. We were there the whole time. They were photographed. They were searched for weapons on the outside of their clothing and then they were escorted through a door, and we followed them. We thought they were going to further processing or to meet with their attorneys or some Soros-funded NGO, and then moved into some other part of Hungary to stay there forever, at least a few years. But that's not what it was. That door was the border, and as we followed them through, they were escorted back where they came from, into Serbia and they can apply for asylum somewhere else. That is straight forward immigration policy. No, you're not allowed to come here illegally. I'm sorry. This is a real country. We have laws. It works. And it doesn't require a GDP the size of the United States' GDP. It doesn't require high tech walls or guns or surveillance equipment, all it requires is the will to do it and as we watched this happen, we said to a Hungarian Minister who was standing there, it's hard to believe that's your policy, when you come here illegally, you're just escorted out politely? And he said quote: \"We're a serious country.\" How embarrassing to be an American in a conversation like that, to realize the greatest country on Earth is not on some level a serious country because it allows the chaos that inevitably occurs, the human suffering that inevitably occurs when you open your borders. By the way, we couldn't help but notice that on the Serbian side of the border where the migrants are massing, trash and filth everywhere. Boy, does that tell you a lot. So, it was a deeply revealing moment and we're going to have more -- we've had a number of them here in Hungary, the small country with a lot of lessons for the rest of us. And one last thing, because the example of Hungary is so powerful, not just in Europe, but to the world, to the entire world, not simply the West, what you can do with a relatively small economy and not many people if you're just serious about keeping your nation from being destroyed, because the lessons are so obvious and there is such a clear refutation to the policies we currently have, and the people who instituted those policies, Hungary and its government have been ruthlessly attacked and unfairly attacked. \"It is authoritarian. They are fascists.\" That is -- there are many lies being told right now, that may be the greatest of all. The last Hungarian Revolution was less contested than our last revolution, and probably more transparent. That's true. It's not an endorsement of anybody, but that's true. So, ignore the lawyers, the liars rather and the lawyers and judge for yourself -- is it working in Hungary or not? We think that it is. Well, it turns out -- and we learned this yesterday that it's always the people you most suspect, Andrew Cuomo, was every bit as creepy as you thought he was. According to \"The New York Times\" -- to New York's, rather, Attorney General, Andrew Cuomo will grope anything -- his staff, State Troopers, Al Gore. He even ogled his own Emmy statue. So after the A.G. report came out, virtually every Democrat in the country called on Andrew Cuomo to resign because they had no idea he was a creep. It was a big story, but it didn't get any of the coverage on television, at least on the show anchored by his brother on CNN. Instead Chris Cuomo attacked Ron DeSantis -- right? There's a Governor we can hate. And then Don Lemon took over. After telling his friend, Chris that he loved him, he unsheathed the knife.",

And then it turns out that he made some women on his staff uncomfortable and now, we have to draw the line. Now, look, we could say it's -- they are both bad, right? It's bad to kill elderly people, it's bad to flirt with women who aren't consenting to it. That's true, but one is so much worse. I mean, it's like saying that John Wayne Gacy, you know, yes he killed 30 young men, but he also -- he also abandoned his shopping carts in parking lots without putting them away. They're both bad. I mean, yes, they're both bad, but the fact that this is the thing that takes him down I think says a whole lot about the media and our society.",

You don't need like a shrine to your existence. And what happened was, it was born of good motives. Franklin Roosevelt knew he had gone through all these historically momentous events like The Great Depression and World War II and he said, you know these papers of mine don't belong to me, they belong to the public and historians. Let's just kind of create a library where historians can go study for it. And over the years, it became bigger and bigger and bigger and what Obama is doing is unprecedented, not only is it so grandiose in size, so much bigger than anyone else's. It has four different buildings and 235-foot museum tower in his honor. It's like not even a Roman Emperor would do that. But he has also removed it from the record keeping system, which has always been administered by the National Archives that ensures that these papers belong to the public, the idea in the first place, they now belong to him.

      "utterance": "Good evening welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. All of a sudden, it's pretty easy for people to move around the world, and all of a sudden they are. Poor people moving from poor countries across the globe into rich countries. Why wouldn't they? And again that's what's happening. Back in 2015, more than a million illegal migrants flooded into Europe, and many of them came to Hungary where we are right now. It was a crisis for the continent, but alone in Europe, Hungary figured out how to solve that problem in a way that we have not figured out here in the United States. How did Hungary do that? How did it preserve its borders and its society? What can we learn from that? Today, we took a trip to find out. We'll show you what we found in just a minute. Also, the woes for the country's creepiest governor -- that would be Governor Andrew Cuomo of New York -- are compounded today, getting even more painful, and yet at the same time more amusing. He is even being stabbed in the front by his allies at CNN. We've got that tape for you. But first tonight, good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. On New Year's Day of this year, Rochelle Walensky was just a college professor in Massachusetts. You've almost certainly never heard of her. You definitely didn't vote for her at any point because Walensky had never run for office. As of January 1st, her political power was precisely the same as yours, and everyone else's in this supposedly self-governing Republic. Rochelle Walensky had one vote out of a nation of 320 million people, and then just a few weeks later, everything changed for her and for the rest of us. Joe Biden appointed Walensky to run the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. At the time, it did not seem like a huge deal. The C.D.C. is not a legislative body, it's a public health bureau. It was originally designed to fight malaria, and it did a good job. The C.D.C. now gathers information about diseases and then releases guidance about those diseases to the public. That's what it does. The C.D.C. does not make laws in this country, it's not allowed to. Under the U.S. Constitution, making laws is the exclusive role of the Congress. You vote for your senators and your congressmen, and they decide what the rules are. That's known as Representative Democracy. It's been our system for nearly 250 years, but apparently it's now over. Rochelle Walensky now makes our laws. Walensky announced today that she has decided to nationalize America's rental properties, millions and millions of them from Maine to California. Tenants are no longer required to pay their rent. Property owners cannot evict them under any circumstances. Making someone pay to live on your property is now a Federal crime. Try it and you can wind up in prison with hundreds of thousands of dollars in fines. At the same time, you should know, property owners will still be required to pay the banks that hold their mortgages. There is no moratorium on mortgages. Why? The banks are huge Democratic donors and they are getting the treatment that they paid for. Sandy Cortez and the squad are not calling for the banks to do their part, so they're not. It is property owners who will suffer. Many of them members of the rapidly disappearing American Middle Class. It's hard to overstate what a momentous change this is. It means among other things that private property no longer exists in the United States. You thought you owned your home, not anymore. Rochelle Walensky does. She'll decide who can live there, under what circumstances, and for how long. Is this a good idea? Of course not. It's totalitarian."

      "speaker": "And the answer is",
      "utterance": "She simply asserted the power. Walensky claimed she had the authority and no one stopped her from exercising it. This morning, she signed an official looking order declaring that her opinion is now the law and so it is the law, but wait, you say. That doesn't seem very American. Shouldn't somebody vote on this? If we are going to continue to pretend this is a democracy -- and you hear that on television constantly -- then shouldn't our elected lawmakers make the laws? No, and they're not going to. Nancy Pelosi has refused to call a vote on the matter and she runs the Congress, she decides. Meanwhile, most Republicans haven't said a word about it and that means that an unelected college professor you had never heard of six months ago is now in charge of your country. If you're wondering how all of this can possibly be legal, rest assured that it's not legal. It is not even arguably legal. We know that for a fact. The Supreme Court has just ruled on this specific question. The Court found that the C.D.C. does not have the right to institute a nationwide eviction moratorium. Period. Only Congress can do that. Now, the Court didn't make its guess on their view of this, the Court put this in writing in the clearest possible language. There is no debate about that. The Biden administration just ignored what the Court said. How can they do that? Well, Congresswoman Maxine Waters of Los Angeles understands exactly how they did it. Waters is hardly a genius. It is likely she has never read an entire book, but one thing Maxine Waters knows very well is how third world regimes operate. When you want something, you simply take it. You've got the guns, who is going to stop you? Might makes right, the Fidel Castro method."

And by the way, this is far more than although the attack -- the assault on private property is probably the most appalling and disgusting part of all this, but this is more than just that. This is also an attack on the concept of contracts. And contracts and private property, which of course we inherited from Western Civilization, it is why America is the richest and most powerful country on Earth. It is why everyone in the world wants to come here, it is because private property and contracts are tantamount for us. And this is an assault on that because these people, these Democrats who control everything want to turn us into China because in China, you don't have private property and anybody who has ever tried to do business -- you know ask any textile worker, ask any furniture maker what it is like to try to enforce a contract in China and they'll start laughing, because contracts don't exist in China.

They've accelerated for a couple of reasons. One, it is very easy to travel from one end of the globe to another, easier than it's ever been in human history and cheaper. But for another, a lot of the world is getting less stable, and in part that's the fault of the West. Ideologues in this country, some of whom now work at the Biden State Department decided to overthrow the government of Iraq, that caused a domino effect of instability throughout the region and massive waves of human migration. Hillary Clinton decided that for some reason, we had to kill the leader of Libya that started a civil war in that country and again more migration. And then for the last 15 years, again ideologues in Washington have pushed more war in Syria. So, all of that had effects. One of those effects back in 2015, was the movement of more than a million people from the Middle East and North Africa, and in some cases, Sub Saharan Africa into Europe. Now Europe is controlled by the E.U., which is effectively controlled by Germany. No one says it out loud, but really, it's the German Empire, and at the time it was run by the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, and she decided to keep the doors open."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "She said that accepting more than a million migrants in her country was not a big deal at all, quote",
      "utterance": "\"Germany is a strong country. We will manage.\" Well, of course, she was completely wrong. That decision changed the nature of Germany forever. It caused a massive crime spike -- yes, that's true and proven -- and in general, disrupted the entire region. It's not clear who exactly benefited from that, even the migrants themselves, certainly the countries they came from were weaker as a result. But there was one country in Europe that decided not to play along with this disaster. It's not coincidental that that country is hated by the same ideologues in Washington who pushed the Iraq War, the same people who helped cause this problem are angry at a man called Viktor Orban who is the democratically elected Prime Minister of Hungary. And back in 2015, he decided, no, we're not going to allow our nation of 10 million people to be changed forever by people we didn't invite in and who are coming here illegally. And so, he put a stop to it. In the face of great international pressure, they called him all kinds of names. The E.U. called what he was doing illegal, but he did it anyway. He built a wall, and today we went to see it. We took a military helicopter down to the southern border of Hungary right where it borders Serbia and we looked at this Hungarian wall that has effectively ended illegal migration into the country. And we found a couple of things. For one, it is not actually a wall, it's a chain-link fence. It's very simple and if you sat for the last five years and listened to American experts debate how it is impossible to stop immigration with a wall, no matter how high tech, you learned that that's a complete lie. All you need is the will to do it. So, we went down there and we watched that wall and we noticed a couple of things. For one thing, unlike every border we've ever visited around the world, it was perfectly clean and orderly. There weren't piles of trash. There weren't scenes of human suffering because it was under control. Chaos creates humanitarian disasters. That's true everywhere around the world, and it's true particularly on borders and particularly in our southern border where there are people suffering and dying because the Biden ministration has abetted, in fact, welcomed chaos. But we didn't see that today. We saw order and clarity. You are not allowed to come to Hungary illegally. While we were on the border today, the Serbian border in Hungary, we saw two people who attempted to come illegally. Both of them turned out to be from Syria, and we watched what happened when they were apprehended. It was a very straightforward process, so straightforward that it was a little confusing to watch. They came over the border, they were immediately picked up by Border Patrol. They were brought to a detainment area. They were treated politely. We were there the whole time. They were photographed. They were searched for weapons on the outside of their clothing and then they were escorted through a door, and we followed them. We thought they were going to further processing or to meet with their attorneys or some Soros-funded NGO, and then moved into some other part of Hungary to stay there forever, at least a few years. But that's not what it was. That door was the border, and as we followed them through, they were escorted back where they came from, into Serbia and they can apply for asylum somewhere else. That is straight forward immigration policy. No, you're not allowed to come here illegally. I'm sorry. This is a real country. We have laws. It works. And it doesn't require a GDP the size of the United States' GDP. It doesn't require high tech walls or guns or surveillance equipment, all it requires is the will to do it and as we watched this happen, we said to a Hungarian Minister who was standing there, it's hard to believe that's your policy, when you come here illegally, you're just escorted out politely? And he said quote: \"We're a serious country.\" How embarrassing to be an American in a conversation like that, to realize the greatest country on Earth is not on some level a serious country because it allows the chaos that inevitably occurs, the human suffering that inevitably occurs when you open your borders. By the way, we couldn't help but notice that on the Serbian side of the border where the migrants are massing, trash and filth everywhere. Boy, does that tell you a lot. So, it was a deeply revealing moment and we're going to have more -- we've had a number of them here in Hungary, the small country with a lot of lessons for the rest of us. And one last thing, because the example of Hungary is so powerful, not just in Europe, but to the world, to the entire world, not simply the West, what you can do with a relatively small economy and not many people if you're just serious about keeping your nation from being destroyed, because the lessons are so obvious and there is such a clear refutation to the policies we currently have, and the people who instituted those policies, Hungary and its government have been ruthlessly attacked and unfairly attacked. \"It is authoritarian. They are fascists.\" That is -- there are many lies being told right now, that may be the greatest of all. The last Hungarian Revolution was less contested than our last revolution, and probably more transparent. That's true. It's not an endorsement of anybody, but that's true. So, ignore the lawyers, the liars rather and the lawyers and judge for yourself -- is it working in Hungary or not? We think that it is. Well, it turns out -- and we learned this yesterday that it's always the people you most suspect, Andrew Cuomo, was every bit as creepy as you thought he was. According to \"The New York Times\" -- to New York's, rather, Attorney General, Andrew Cuomo will grope anything -- his staff, State Troopers, Al Gore. He even ogled his own Emmy statue. So after the A.G. report came out, virtually every Democrat in the country called on Andrew Cuomo to resign because they had no idea he was a creep. It was a big story, but it didn't get any of the coverage on television, at least on the show anchored by his brother on CNN. Instead Chris Cuomo attacked Ron DeSantis -- right? There's a Governor we can hate. And then Don Lemon took over. After telling his friend, Chris that he loved him, he unsheathed the knife."

So, that's one reason I'm not surprised. The other reason is that, of course, this is the guy who killed thousands of elderly. He consigned -- he condemned the thousands of elderly to their deaths by locking them in rooms in buildings with people who are infected with the disease, that we know primarily kills elderly people in nursing homes. And you know, the thing is, I knew that, we all knew that, the media knew that way back when they were talking about how they were Cuomo-sexuals and they were going on and on and on about how great Andrew Cuomo is and he had his book tour and everything. They knew that and they knew that he killed elderly people, and they said, well, you know, what are you going to do? And then it turns out that he made some women on his staff uncomfortable and now, we have to draw the line. Now, look, we could say it's -- they are both bad, right? It's bad to kill elderly people, it's bad to flirt with women who aren't consenting to it. That's true, but one is so much worse. I mean, it's like saying that John Wayne Gacy, you know, yes he killed 30 young men, but he also -- he also abandoned his shopping carts in parking lots without putting them away. They're both bad.

      "utterance": "... once they leave power, which I think is a big problem in the democracy. But leaving that to the side, the idea of Presidential Libraries. Originally, that didn't exist for like 150 years because the idea was, you're just a private citizen, you go serve in public office and then you go back to private life. You don't need like a shrine to your existence. And what happened was, it was born of good motives. Franklin Roosevelt knew he had gone through all these historically momentous events like The Great Depression and World War II and he said, you know these papers of mine don't belong to me, they belong to the public and historians. Let's just kind of create a library where historians can go study for it. And over the years, it became bigger and bigger and bigger and what Obama is doing is unprecedented, not only is it so grandiose in size, so much bigger than anyone else's. It has four different buildings and 235-foot museum tower in his honor. It's like not even a Roman Emperor would do that. But he has also removed it from the record keeping system, which has always been administered by the National Archives that ensures that these papers belong to the public, the idea in the first place, they now belong to him. And so to keep control of it, he is raising money from people in the middle of a pandemic and a joblessness and eviction crisis right as he was planning a multi-million dollar birthday bash at his $12 million estate, which is his second weekend home on Martha's Vineyard. It is, as you say, the ethos of neoliberalism. Leaders get rich at the expense of everybody else."

      "utterance": "Yes, and I mean, you know, I think a good question as well is, traditionally the ruling class has been very reluctant to be so flamboyant about their abuse of power and their accumulation of wealth because that can create a lot of instability in the society when people know the extent to which they are being exploited and abused. They've generally been more humble about it or tried to hide it. But here is Obama throwing this enormous party. Steven Spielberg was coming. Pearl Jam was going to play, and then you have Valerie Jarrett, his lifelong aide, saying, hey, reach into your pocket and give us money to build a shrine to Obama. At some point, the question is, how long is the population going to tolerate that?"

His group called Hunter Nation, which is organizing hunters to stand up for their rights. We had a long talk and a really interesting talk with Ted Nugent, which you should watch.

A majority of the New York State Assembly supports impeachment proceedings against Governor Andrew Cuomo, that is if Cuomo does not resign over investigative findings that he sexually harassed at least 11 women. A simple majority of Assembly members is needed to authorize an impeachment trial. Cuomo denies the allegations against him and says the investigative findings don't reflect the facts. The White House is planning to require nearly all foreign visitors to the U.S. to be vaccinated for the coronavirus. The requirement comes as the Biden administration is looking to ease travel restrictions. There is no timeline yet, but studies are underway to determine when normal travel can resume. Right now, much of the world is barred from entering the United States. I'm Matt Finn. Now back to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. For all your headlines, log on to foxnews.com."

He has been sober the whole time and he is one of the country's most articulate defenders of our basic constitutional rights, in particular, the right to bear arms. He started a group called Hunter Nation that organizes people who hunt, sportsmen to stand up for those rights. For a brand new episode of \"Tucker Carlson Today,\" we spoke at great length to Ted Nugent and it was an amazing conversation. Here is part of it."

If you don't eat them, what are they here for? Carrying a gun, I would be attacked for carrying a gun. I go, so by the way, venison and self-defense are perfect and you're attacking me for carrying the gun and killing deer? What are you, nuts? And of course they were all stoned. So, I suppose the inclination would be uncomfortable when you're attacked, but I was so confident -- you may have noticed this -- I'm so confident that the weekend with my dad and brothers deer hunting was perfect, literally perfect."

I see John Belushi got high, John Belushi is dead. I went hunting, I'm still Ted. Bad behavior, ugly results. Cognizant conscientious behavior, happiness. So I -- and by the way, you know, don't confuse comfortably numb with ultra-relaxed. I'm a bow hunter. I spend more hours silent in a tree than all humans combined since Cochise.

And again, those are just documents. The freedom is already here. I was born with the right to keep and bear arms. I was born with the right to speak up. I was born with the right to privacy from my government intrusion without just cause. I was born with that. I could come here naked without any Constitution and I know I could say what I want to say. I don't have to get the King's permission. Kings, Emperors, tyrants -- kiss my [bleep]. We are a self-government. We are in charge.
