For the hour, we will highlight how President Trump is challenging the political status quo, calling out the abusively biased press, breaking down diplomatic walls and dismantling the deep state brick by brick.  And breaking tonight, the House Intel Committee just released a full length report on its Russia investigation. And, guess what? The committee found absolutely no evidence of Trump-Russia collusion.  Here's how President Trump reacted to this decisive report.",

There was no collusion with Russia, if you can believe this one. There was -- she probably can't believe it. Who can? But the report was very powerful, very strong. There was no collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian people. As I have said many times before, I have always said there was no collusion. But I have also said there has been noble tougher on Russia than me. With that all being said, if we can get along with Russia, that's a good thing, not a bad thing.  But there has been nobody tougher on Russia than me. I was very honored by the report. It was totally conclusive, strong, powerful. Many things said that nobody knew about and said in a very strong way.   They were very forceful in saying that the Clinton campaign actually did contribute to Russia. So, maybe somebody ought to look at that, but, what we really should do is get on with our lives.",

And I remember as a senior officer seeing the tunnels that the North Koreans had dug to try to infiltrate in South Korea. Today was a historical moment. But we must understand that we have to keep the pressure on and Kim Jong-un has proven to be a person that you cannot trust. So we have to have the systems and the sanctions in place. We have to be able to verify anything that he says he is going to do. Because history will teach us, Neville Chamberlain sat back down with Adolf Hitler and signed the Munich accord and then of course, later on, Adolf Hitler said it was just a piece of paper.",

The South Korean president went out of his way to say that the policies of the president has pursued is what has led towards today. I would say though that when you look at what the general just said. We view everything with skepticism when it comes to Kim Jong-un. But today we saw for the first time the South -- the North Korean leader step on the South Korean soil. We've never seen that before. It's not just the rhetoric. The rhetoric is important. It's the fact that there was a credible threat of force behind the rhetoric. And I would add, Judge, that the historic sanctions that Nikki Haley and the Trump administration pursued at the U.N. deserve a lot of the credit. Because what happened was that we caused pain in his pocket where it hurts the most. So clearly, one of the reasons he's come to -- he is coming to the table is because of this whole government approach. You have you an American president who the world believes will take action. You have you historic sanctions. And I would add, look at what's happening with the Chinese.

And when asked this he said no, but then there is a transcript of his saying before the committee House committee that his group didn't detect any deception on the part of Flynn. So he denied it twice. So you got him in the transcript and then now lying about it. You know, Jim Comey used to be the smart guy, the guy I knew.

I was calling for that, I know you were. But that typically had not happened. Usually that elite bureaucratic class lives under different rules. That's one of the big problems with how our system is operating right now. So I think Comey, I think he has a lot of issues. If we have an equal application of the law, you can't say that a submariner, a petty officer in the navy who takes a picture of a submarine, which he shouldn't have done, it's classified but didn't disclose it to anybody.

But, today, or yesterday, I believe it was Chairman Grassley of the Senate Judiciary who let a bill out of committee supported by a few Republicans like Lindsey Graham saying they are going to block the president from firing Mueller and disbanding the commission. I mean, on the one hand, we've got you saying one thing and then we've got Grassley saying another. Why is Grassley wasting his time with this kind of a bill?"

I wish the Senate would take up the 500 bills the House has sent over to advance the Trump agenda and to restore constitutional principles. Instead, they are wasting time on this triviality.

So, I think that we need to, you know, get off our duffs and actually get in gear and engage in the president's agenda and move it forward. The American people did not elect this president to sit idly by and rearrange the deck chairs on the Titanic. We want a disrupter, someone who's going to change the ways of Washington. And frankly, we've got too many swamp creatures in both parties who just want to keep everything the same.

You know, to me, Jim Comey looked like he didn't know what to say when Bret Baier pushed back and said, you know, this is a leak. You didn't have authority to leak it and he said, no, he says, it's my diary, as if FBI directors have a diary and they - you know, they're able to share it with other people when it's a report."

      "utterance": "Well, you're absolutely right, Judge Jeanine. And he was trying to explain, like, well, this is my personal memoirs which I started at the FBI and then I put a copy of in my home. Well, nobody can do that. You know, at the FBI, there are explicit instructions that they are given to all agents, including the director that you cannot take your work product home with you. At the CIA, it's the same way, and in any kind of intelligence apparatus. You cannot remove documents from the office and take them home, even if you want to call them your memoirs, if you want to call them your diary. He has been caught now in a number of inconsistencies and lies. And I think this is going to come back to haunt him, because another question that I have, Judge, and I'll say it really quick, is, you know, Dr. Richman, even if he was a special government employee with the FBI, he was working for the FBI not for Comey so he would be under the same rules and guidelines."

This guy Dan Richman who his friend from -- I think he's Columbia professor, Columbia Law School. All right. So, he gives special status SGEs, special government employee. I want to know, was the guy fingerprinted? Was he photographed? Was there any lie detector? Was there a background check?

And what I think Jim Comey had up his sleeve the whole time is Sarah is exactly right. When I left the White House, I couldn't take any paper with me because it belonged to the taxpayers. Jim Comey wrote these memos and then colluded with his law professor friend because they were written so that they could be given to The New York Times and The Washington Post and liberal media to prosecute the case against Donald Trump no matter what form, with a special counsel on the front pages of these newspapers. It was all done because Jim Comey was a never Trumper. He doesn't think he has the character to be president. And he wants to get him out of the office at all costs."

He basically says, the president says, you know, well, do the investigation. I want to know who is doing this and I don't need prostitutes and Comey is dumb enough to say, Clapper told me to get there and to tell him about it. What's your take on that?"

James Comey is in the 14th minute of his 15-minutes of fame and this book tour has done nothing except steal the prevailing view of James Comey that every answer is ultimately given to try to make him look like a hero. Sarah asked a great question. Here's one that I have. Who is going to be setting across from FBI agents under their own investigation first, Andrew McCabe or James Comey?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Right. And there is talk, Sara, that -- I mean, I could see this months ago when, you know, James Comey was tweeting things that when he was trying to make nice with McCabe or McCabe wasn't having any of it. Now, there is talk that they are going to end up, you know, McCabe saying Comey gave me right to leak, and Comey saying I didn't give him the right to leak. And yet, now, we've got the leaker, Dan Richman, who is now the lawyer, they are playing the Hillary Clinton game where Cheryl Mills is the suspect and she is a lawyer and that keeps everything on lockdown."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARTER",
      "utterance": "Yes. I think, you know, the collusion here, Judge Jeanine, there was collusion. If you look at the report, there was collusion. And it was between Clapper, Comey, McCabe, all of these players, colluding against the incoming president of the United States, President Trump. And we can see that how they've tried to massage this and manage this, they believed none of this would ever come out, because, first of all, they thought Hillary Clinton would win. And when she didn't win, they went one step further and they moved into plan B. And now, everything is being exposed. Now they are eating each other up. We see McCabe and Comey both saying that each other's stories don't match up. And I think what we're going to eventually find out is that a lot more people were leaking. A lot more people in the FBI are going to be in trouble and a lot more people in the intelligence community."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "And, you know, Matt, I mean, the whole idea of they are being hoisted on their own petard, in that we don't need them to fight with each other. Their inconsistencies are glaring, whether it's saying one thing in the book and another thing to Bret Baier or whether it's Clapper who says he didn't discuss the Steele dossier with the press. But his testimony before the committee as Trey Gowdy said was that he did discuss it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCHLAPP",
      "utterance": "So, it's all the same theme, which is each one of these men, whether it's Steele or McCabe or Comey, they have an intricate way of doing something that is illegal, inappropriate and against the -- their oath of office, which is they are releasing information that should not be given to the press. And it's not even accurate information. It's information that's used to try to go after political enemies. I tell you this, Judge. And I have been involved in politics too dang long. If there's no collusion with Russia and there is not one scintilla of evidence from anything, the American people are fair, and I think the Donald Trump has done a great service, at great cost and great pain to a lot of people. But he has exposed these liars and leakers in the -- that are entrenched in these powerful positions."

Andrew McCabe is gone from the FBI. Rybicki is gone from the FBI, chief of staff, as is Baker who was the counsel. So, you've got that whole ump echelon, Strzok and Page, in spite of their biases, they are still there, but there is evidence or information, I should say, that they are cooperating. I mean, the fact that that whole upper echelon is gone. What does it tell you?"

And if you talk to local agents, they want all of the upper management of the FBI cleaned out because it's making the entire bureau look bad. Most important thing the president said today was it's time to move on with our lives. Here's the unfortunate thing, Judge, and what's extremely important. The average special counsel investigation goes 1,154 days. This is -- this isn't about influencing the 2018 election.

And good for Kanye, he said, you know what, I'm going to double down. I'm going to tweet out a picture of me wearing a \"Make America Great Again\" hat. And he just doubles down and he triples down. And it's really triggered a national cultural conversation of, wait a second, why are black people voting for Democrats at a 95 percent clip? The Democrats and their policies are the very ones that have harmed the black community the most over the last 50 or 60 years. You saw Chance the rapper, he tweeted out and he said not all black people have to be Democrats. Correct.

And so that is some of the reasons why black voters will not come out and say that they agree with conservative principles.

Maximum pressure will continue until denuclearization occurs. Things have changed very radically from a few months ago. You know the name calling and a lot of other things. We get a kick every once in a while out of the fact that I will be watching people that fail so badly over the last 25 years explaining to me how to make a deal with North Korea. I get a big, big kick out of that. But, we are doing very well. I think that something very dramatic could happen."

Talking now about the historic summit that took place in South Korea between North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and his South Korean counterpart. The two leaders vowed to end war between the two countries and agreed to the complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. President Trump also said this about the situation."

Money going in and nobody knew what was happening. We will, I think come up with a solution. If we don't, we leave the room with great respect. We leave the room or we just keep it going. This isn't like past administration we don't play games."

All right. Allen, I am going to start with you. I understand that you were actually in the demilitarized zone for a period of time. What is your take on the fact that Kim Jong-un has actually met with the President Moon of South Korea and actually stepped over that demilitarized zone?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ALLEN WEST, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Well, it is good to be with you, Judge. In 1995, I was stationed there with the second infantry division. And I remember as a senior officer seeing the tunnels that the North Koreans had dug to try to infiltrate in South Korea. Today was a historical moment. But we must understand that we have to keep the pressure on and Kim Jong-un has proven to be a person that you cannot trust. So we have to have the systems and the sanctions in place. We have to be able to verify anything that he says he is going to do. Because history will teach us, Neville Chamberlain sat back down with Adolf Hitler and signed the Munich accord and then of course, later on, Adolf Hitler said it was just a piece of paper."

      "utterance": "And Morgan, there are those who say that we have reached a point now that is only due to President Trump. And he referenced it a few minutes ago. He said there was a lot of name-calling and a few other things several months back, you know, between rocket man and all the other back and forth. But that really did lead or create the foundation for this meeting between President Moon and Kim Jong-un. Would you agree?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MORGAN ORTAGUS, FOX NEWS NATIONALS SECURITY ANALYST",
      "utterance": "Absolutely, Judge. I think that the president deserves a ton of credit for what happened today. And you are even seeing some of his biggest critics give him credit as well. The South Korean president went out of his way to say that the policies of the president has pursued is what has led towards today. I would say though that when you look at what the general just said. We view everything with skepticism when it comes to Kim Jong-un. But today we saw for the first time the South -- the North Korean leader step on the South Korean soil. We've never seen that before. It's not just the rhetoric. The rhetoric is important. It's the fact that there was a credible threat of force behind the rhetoric. And I would add, Judge, that the historic sanctions that Nikki Haley and the Trump administration pursued at the U.N. deserve a lot of the credit. Because what happened was that we caused pain in his pocket where it hurts the most. So clearly, one of the reasons he's come to -- he is coming to the table is because of this whole government approach. You have you an American president who the world believes will take action. You have you historic sanctions. And I would add, look at what's happening with the Chinese. Look at the president is sending his top economic team next to China and the Chinese were a part of this because this is a comprehensive strategy in East Asia."

    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "General Tata, let's talk about the military component where the president has indicated that he has no reluctance whatsoever to use his military option and force to back up and he's also not afraid to walk away if he doesn't get what he wants from Kim Jong-un."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TONY TATA, RETIRED BRIGADIER GENERAL",
      "utterance": "Well, Judge, I think the military component here is, you know, peace through strength. Right? We have 28,000 troops on the Korean peninsula and we have got, you know, the air force in Guam and we've got, you know, we have had three carrier strike groups in the sea of Japan surrounding the Korean peninsula with all of the air power that comes along with that and Tomahawks and nuclear missiles that can be launched. So there is a credible threat from us to North Korea that has been behind the other elements of national power that the president has artfully synchronized here as we talked before on your show with diplomacy, information, economic, all those elements of power. And what you are seeing now is, you know, success has a thousand fathers and failures is an orphan. And so, you know, the media is looking for somebody to dilute the praise away from the president for doing all of these things and so, you know, they choose Kim Jong-un's sister who was at the Olympics and she may have gone back and talked to her brother and said hey, it's pretty nice down there, you know, they have food. You might -- you might want to go check it out. But you know, it's a credible threat of military force. And President Trump is synchronizing that in a very good way that has led to this point. And President Trump and his team deserve the credit. Mike Pompeo deserves a lot of credit."

      "utterance": "OK. And so, Allen, I'm going to go back to you. You know, looking at Kim Jong-un with President Moon, I mean, you have to -- this is a guy who was killing us six months ago. He was standing there with all of -- you know, his toys of war and, you know, did he have a lobotomy. I mean, what got to this guy that everything about him has changed. His body language has changed. Were the economic sanction that severe and is someone in his country telling him, hey, you better make this right or you're going?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WEST",
      "utterance": "Well, I think it is as General Tata just said when you have a credible military threat and a deterrent that backs up your foreign policy. Just remember, it was 2010 when the North Koreans sunk a South Korean navy vessel killing 46 of theirs sailors and wounding another 56. And then later on in that year November 2010 there was the North Korean artillery the bombardment of the South Korean island. And we said nothing we did, nothing as a matter of fact we continued to appease and negotiate. So for the first time we have an American president that has stood with resolve and resiliency but also let us remember that Kim Jong-un is responsible for the death of an American citizen Otto Warmbier--"

    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",

      "speaker": "TATA",
      "utterance": "Well, you know, Judge, I think that it's a holistic approach as we go to these negotiations to try to get, you know, as President Trump called it today, this is for the world. And so, we can scale from, you know, a very important microcosmic issue all the way up to what we have to do for the world in a denuclearize peninsula, Korean peninsula is so key to the world and I think the president and his team are going to achieve that. And I believe that they're going to achieve all the other goals, as well, one of which is what you mentioned."

      "speaker": "PIRRO",

    {
      "speaker": "ORTAGUS",
      "utterance": "It certainly is. But I would echo what the gentleman just said that we need to lay out specific steps for denuclearization. What does it look like? How do we verify it? We can't -- and this administration will do this, but we can't make the same mistakes the Obama administration did where they relieve sanctions on Iran for a bunch of empty promises that weren't fulfilled. I know that this administration won't do that and that's why we need to really verify that this going to happen."

      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "The president is also tweeting tonight saying the special counsel should never have been appointed. Joining me now with reaction, Florida Congressman Ron DeSantis. All right, good evening, congressman. I must tell you when I heard Trey Gowdy say our definition of leak is a felony as opposed to James Comey. James Comey seemed to be actually stunned when Bret Baier said to him when you leak this to Dan Richman, he was, no, no, no. It wasn't a leak. What is a leak?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REP. RON DESANTIS, R-FLORIDA",
      "utterance": "Well, look, if you believe Comey's explanation then you will believe that it's going to snow in Miami in August. It's just totally ridiculous. He even really admitted it was a leak when he testified originally because he said he wanted to create a special counsel. He went back to his files. These were -- some of them were classified but certainly they were government property because, remember, he was districting them to people like Andrew McCabe and Rybicki. So this was clearly a government document. Some of it was likely classified. And by him putting it out there, that is exactly what a leak is. He is a leaker. And I think he is in really trouble with the law not only for the classified potential but it can be a crime to leak defense information even if it's not actually classified. He's been referred to the I.G. I've read a letter that he should be referred criminally but I think this book tour has blown up in his face big time."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "Well, I think that the book tour, Congressman, has created a lot of controversy in the sense that what he has said before at some committees as opposed to what he said on television as opposed to what he said in the book can be three different versions of the truth or his truth anyway. But, I want to talk about one in particular. He was asked if there was any truth to the thinking that the FBI agents who interviewed Flynn actually didn't think he had intent to deceive. And when asked this he said no, but then there is a transcript of his saying before the committee House committee that his group didn't detect any deception on the part of Flynn. So he denied it twice. So you got him in the transcript and then now lying about it. You know, Jim Comey used to be the smart guy, the guy I knew. But is he so confident that our system is so weak and that if they slow walk DOJ and FBI reports that no one and certainly no one in the Justice Department will ever prosecute him that he is laughing all his way -- all the way to the bank?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DESANTIS",
      "utterance": "Well, he definitely is going to the bank. Because is he making a lot of the money on this book and I think he is really doing damage to the FBI as an institution. I think he does think that he is not going to be subjected to any type of accountability. Because, very few people have been. I mean, McCabe being referred was like a major deal. I was calling for that, I know you were. But that typically had not happened. Usually that elite bureaucratic class lives under different rules. That's one of the big problems with how our system is operating right now. So I think Comey, I think he has a lot of issues. If we have an equal application of the law, you can't say that a submariner, a petty officer in the navy who takes a picture of a submarine, which he shouldn't have done, it's classified but didn't disclose it to anybody. He gets a federal felony. But Comey can maliciously leak potentially classified information and we just act like nothing ever happened? That's wrong, Judge."
