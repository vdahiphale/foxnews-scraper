First of all, the Gulf States are angry as hell over the moratorium because it's destroying the one remaining industry, the oil support industry.   Second, Salazar's own experts that he called in on this have said publicly that they are opposed to a six-month moratorium, and it actually endangers safety, because if you cap a well, there is actually a period of danger, you might as well keep drilling. And lastly, now they have judicial cover. Now they have a judge. They could have walked away. The fact that Salazar is sticking with this and they will appeal and hang in there on this I think is a measure of how much this administration is in hock to its ecological left. The people are not going to let him go. They blame the Obama administration for the small opening on drilling, which it did before the Gulf oil disaster, and this is the price that they are exacting. It's a big mistake, not just from the engineering perspective or economic, I think it's a big political mistake.",

He wrote, \"The blanket moratorium with no parameters seems to assume that because one rig failed, and although no one yet knows why, all companies and rigs drilling new wells over 500 feet also universally present an imminent danger.\" He basically scoffed at the administration ruling in this moratorium.",

But the basic logic of what the administration is doing doesn't work. For 64 days we have been told that the spill was the result of reckless and irresponsible behavior by BP, which was a departure from standard operating procedures. Now on day 65, Ken Salazar and others in the administration say we don't have any idea what caused the spill so we can't possibly end the moratorium, because we have to find out. Which is it? Those two are self- contradicting and they have to get the story straight.  The question I have for Salazar, if you look at what Salazar is saying now, we'll provide the new information and tell you why we need the moratorium. Why are you hiding it? Why haven't you been telling us this all along?  This sounds like a scramble by the administration to do exactly with a Charles is saying, which is ingratiate itself with the political left and the environmentalists.",

So there are some mixed messages coming out.  But it's interesting to see the drilling wars reignite on the hill. You have Mary Landrieu, other Louisianans and a lot of Republicans saying look, this is reasonable, and the 33 rigs who want to drill, they should. Then you have Democrats, particularly, on the left saying absolutely not. This is a disaster. We can't have it. I think at the end of the day no one is going to be drilling because it's a politically toxic environment. Irrespective of the environmental disaster we're facing, the politics are so toxic that I think the companies will say let's ride it out.",

Now they said they will be able to put it back on.

We don't know exactly how much, but perhaps over 60,000 barrels a day, which is just unbelievable. So I think the president's prediction is really out the window.  It raises the issue, why are we drilling that deep? I repeat, one of the reasons why we are in the water that deep, that hard to fix is because the easy stuff, the shallow stuff in the Pacific and the Atlantic and the onshore stuff in the Arctic has been ruled out of bounds. That's why we're out there in deepwater and that's why it's so hazardous. The environmental left sees an opportunity here to shut down oil production as Three Mile Island did on nukes, and that's why it won't allow more drilling.",

      "speaker": "KEN SALAZAR, INTERIOR SECRETARY",
      "utterance": "With respect to the moratorium, I believe it was the correct decision, I believe it's the correct decision today, and with all due respect to the honorable court, we disagree with the court."

      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "Interior Secretary Ken Salazar making it clear today the Obama administration does not intend a court ruling to end its moratorium on drilling in the Gulf. We're back with our panel. Charles, what do you make of the judge blocking the six-month moratorium on deepwater drilling in the Gulf, and as you saw there, the Obama administration's determination to appeal the ruling or to issue a new moratorium?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KRAUTHAMMER",
      "utterance": "I'm surprised the administration is digging itself into this hole a lot deeper. It was just handed an out. First of all, the Gulf States are angry as hell over the moratorium because it's destroying the one remaining industry, the oil support industry. Second, Salazar's own experts that he called in on this have said publicly that they are opposed to a six-month moratorium, and it actually endangers safety, because if you cap a well, there is actually a period of danger, you might as well keep drilling. And lastly, now they have judicial cover. Now they have a judge. They could have walked away. The fact that Salazar is sticking with this and they will appeal and hang in there on this I think is a measure of how much this administration is in hock to its ecological left. The people are not going to let him go. They blame the Obama administration for the small opening on drilling, which it did before the Gulf oil disaster, and this is the price that they are exacting. It's a big mistake, not just from the engineering perspective or economic, I think it's a big political mistake."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "Steve, the ruling by the court was pretty strong and pretty critical of the Obama administration. The federal judge in the case, Martin Feldman, said the administration failed to prove the need for such sweeping action. He wrote, \"The blanket moratorium with no parameters seems to assume that because one rig failed, and although no one yet knows why, all companies and rigs drilling new wells over 500 feet also universally present an imminent danger.\" He basically scoffed at the administration ruling in this moratorium."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HAYES",
      "utterance": "He basically was taking issue with a matter of degree, saying you said this and you're doing this, and that's the problem with what you are doing. But the basic logic of what the administration is doing doesn't work. For 64 days we have been told that the spill was the result of reckless and irresponsible behavior by BP, which was a departure from standard operating procedures. Now on day 65, Ken Salazar and others in the administration say we don't have any idea what caused the spill so we can't possibly end the moratorium, because we have to find out. Which is it? Those two are self- contradicting and they have to get the story straight. The question I have for Salazar, if you look at what Salazar is saying now, we'll provide the new information and tell you why we need the moratorium. Why are you hiding it? Why haven't you been telling us this all along? This sounds like a scramble by the administration to do exactly with a Charles is saying, which is ingratiate itself with the political left and the environmentalists."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "On the other hand, Erin, the White House's argument is it is dangerous, foolhardy to continue deepwater drilling until you know what caused -- I guess really two things. One, what caused the explosion on April 20, and, two, how you can control it and prevent it from happening again."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BILLINGS",
      "utterance": "That's right. But at the same time we had Salazar saying when we issue this new moratorium we may move back or maybe we'll allow some drill. So there are some mixed messages coming out. But it's interesting to see the drilling wars reignite on the hill. You have Mary Landrieu, other Louisianans and a lot of Republicans saying look, this is reasonable, and the 33 rigs who want to drill, they should. Then you have Democrats, particularly, on the left saying absolutely not. This is a disaster. We can't have it. I think at the end of the day no one is going to be drilling because it's a politically toxic environment. Irrespective of the environmental disaster we're facing, the politics are so toxic that I think the companies will say let's ride it out."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "Charles, another interesting and sad development today, and that is one of the underwater submersibles knocked off the cap that was containing at least, capturing at least some of the oil spill. Now they said they will be able to put it back on. But having said that, the president in his Oval Office address said that they are going to by the end of the month be able to capture 90 percent of the flow. That's going to be a hard standard to meet."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KRAUTHAMMER",
      "utterance": "And remember, when they cut the pipe to enable this new technique of capping, it increased the flow. We don't know exactly how much, but perhaps over 60,000 barrels a day, which is just unbelievable. So I think the president's prediction is really out the window. It raises the issue, why are we drilling that deep? I repeat, one of the reasons why we are in the water that deep, that hard to fix is because the easy stuff, the shallow stuff in the Pacific and the Atlantic and the onshore stuff in the Arctic has been ruled out of bounds. That's why we're out there in deepwater and that's why it's so hazardous. The environmental left sees an opportunity here to shut down oil production as Three Mile Island did on nukes, and that's why it won't allow more drilling."
