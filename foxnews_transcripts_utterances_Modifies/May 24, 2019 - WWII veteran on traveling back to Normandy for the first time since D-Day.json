It should never ever happen to anybody else."

If we're -- if we're worried about foreign influence, for the very same reason, we should be worried about whether government officials abused their power and put their thumb on the scale. And so, I'm not saying that happened, but I'm saying that we have to look at that."

So, that means that people on this wall and these pictures in the government are likely to face some more questions in all of this about what as Attorney General Barr says, \"The government was doing.\" Here now, Byron York, chief political correspondent for the Washington Examiner and fox news contributor. Byron, good to see you tonight."

But why should the people whose pictures we just showed including Clapper, and Brennan, and everybody who signed those FISA applications be concerned about this?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "YORK",
      "utterance": "Well, because we don't know exactly what they did. We've been getting information lately in some dribs and drabs. For example, we learned that the government -- probably the FBI sent an undercover agent to London under the alias Azra Turk, to get information out of George Papadopoulos. We've learned other things that the -- that the government was doing on a secret basis. We heard from Trey Gowdy the other day that there were probably transcripts of conversations with George Papadopoulos, that he says, he -- Trey Gowdy, says are exculpatory. So, we're learning in dribs and drabs something that we need to have a bigger picture on it, and I think that's what the president and attorney general are trying to get at."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So, it's pretty clear that there are some that mostly former employees of these intelligence agencies who are going to be concerned about what might come out. And then, today there was a New York Time story -- late today that suggested that there was this operative that you know, is close to Putin, whose cover cannot be blown and that, that is one of the reasons to make sure that there is a lid on this, that sources and methods are not exposed in this declassification process, Byron."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "YORK",
      "utterance": "Yes, if you remember back when the so-called, Nunes memo was released in February of 2018, and it showed us that the FBI had used the dossier to get a wiretap warrant on Carter Page. I mean, there were people before the release of that who predicted that basically, the world was going to end. And it was released and it did not. If there are some things that are not released, that is the kind of judgment the attorney general is going to make. I mean, for example, if you talk to top Republicans and say, on the Carter Page FISA warrant, should every single word of that be released? Though they'll say no, no, there's a few things that need to stay secret but most of it can be released. These are judgments that the attorney general is going to make to give the public an idea of what happened."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "I mean, as long as some of it is kept out, though, there will be those who will say probably to their graves that the other stuff that you didn't see was the reason that we started the investigation, not the dossier."

But, in this, especially, since it's a matter of such public concern, one party has wanted to use this Trump-Russia affair to try to remove the president from office. I mean, there is the highest need for public knowledge about this. So, this is the president's way by delegating it to the attorney general to try to do it in a fairly, orderly, but pretty fast fashion."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yes. Just one quick last thought on Adam Schiff, who is very upset about this process. He says it's un-American to declassify the process towards these FISA applications which ended up surveilling American citizens who were never charged."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "YORK",
      "utterance": "Well, in some sense, it's the cat is out of the bag on this one. I mean, we know that Carter Page was wiretapped, and a number of people who have looked at all of this say that the FBI used unverified information to do so. And they did it to get a larger sense of information about the Trump campaign. By the way, the Carter Page FISA warrant mentioned George Papadopoulos what was that about. So, we need to find out more of what went on. And if there's any problem with the intelligence community, it's with over- classification of information."

Look, let's remember what they're really fighting about. What they're really fighting about is who's going to get blamed for the fact that for the next year for the next 16 months, nothing will get done on the city. Zero things will be accomplished that matter to the American people. We will be lucky. We saw it today in Washington, D.C. One member of Congress kill a disaster relief bill worth $19 billion for a lot of people who really need it because it didn't include wall funding. That's a stunt. That's something that you do, but it tells you that bill will be passed later and signed by the president. But it tells you how bad things are. That's what Pelosi and Trump are really fighting about."

I mean, that's just going to -- you know, people can just throw their hands up in disgust, they are so tired of this of nothing happening, and it's going to be very interesting to see which party wins in that debate. As you say, they're going to try to convince each other that it's -- they are pointing at the other person and it's their fault. I want to pull up the New Yorker cover that is coming out next. It shows President Trump sitting -- you know, probably somewhere in the halls of Congress, and he's got his shoes being shined by Lindsey Graham and Bill Barr and Mitch McConnell. They are probably not going to like that, but it's I guess in a great -- in the great history of political cartoons, we've seen things like this before."

And it's funny, Mitch McConnell has taken this long journey from being the goat, the guy that Steve Bannon said was the -- you know the poison to the conservatism, and must be removed. To now, the guy that Steve Bannon says, save the country. So, Mitch McConnell don't care."

The Mueller investigation, of course, has taken up a lot of the oxygen in the room. But look at this, a CBS News poll finds that 53 percent of adults want congressional Democrats to end their Russian investigations. 44 percent say no, they want to dig deeper into the Russia investigation. Joining me now are five Democratic voters, all with different views because they're human beings, and that's the way human beings work. So, it's great to have all of you with us. Thank you so much for being here. You know, one of the things that's been fascinating to watch this week is this battle between President Trump and Nancy Pelosi that has been playing out.

Polls on suffrage said women shouldn't get the right to vote. You know, sometimes there's principled so I think if the Democrats are going to stand on any type of principle.

This is a Washington Post Columnist Kathleen Kaufman who is a Republican woman who wants Republican women to join the fight for what she calls reproductive rights. \"I'm a Christian and a Republican who believes women in crisis should be met with compassion. For too long a critical perspective has been missing. Republican women who believe women have full reproductive and sexual health rights have been silent.\" Now there's a lot of buzzwords in there that people very much disagree with on both sides of this equation.

I think it comes down to the fundamental question of do you believe in the sanctity -- the sanctity of life or not. And science shows us that life begins at conception. So does the government sanction the ending of that life because we know that conception at fertilization, that is now a life.

A feat once too difficult to face following a 66-year battle with PTSD which he chronicles in his book \"One Veteran's Journey to Heal the Wounds of War.\" Joining me now is World War II Navy Corpsman Jack Gutman.

There were 4,500 landing craft. There were 11,000 planes of various sorts parachuting and so forth. And there was 150,000 men, English, the Canadians, and the Americans that were going to hit the shores. I was 18 years of age. I was with a unit that we had set up a hospital in England. And I was there for Normandy to assist the medical units in the army that the army already had there. But we were going to come in later, just to take care of any wounded and evacuate them. And we thought when we saw the bombing and the shelling and everything else like they showed on \"Saving Private Ryan,\" and when we heard the planes going over, they had to render those bunkers useless."

We call them medic or corpsman, it's very personal and you see men on the beach there when you up there taking care of them and they're crying momma, momma. And you hear guys pleading for you to help you to help them. This has a big effect on you. I was 18 years of age and when you see -- like when we came ashore, I thought we would just land and take care of it.

And you know, you -- but it took you all those years. You said that one of your family members finally got you to go get help.

It was so embarrassing. And then I realize I needed a help. So, she got me to stop drinking and from that with her grief recovery program she had. And then from that point I went and got help from the veterans.

There is help there and the veterans are ready to help you. There are people that are ready to help you. Do not commit suicides or do these crazy things. I plead with you to do that. Now I'm looking forward to when I go back to Normandy it's going to be mixed emotions with me. Because I, you know, I was 18 when I was there. And someone asked me, what are you going to do when you get there. And I said, well, I don't know. I think one thing I will do, I know I will cry because I will flashback to what happened."
