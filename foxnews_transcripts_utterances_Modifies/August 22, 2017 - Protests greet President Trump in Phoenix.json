It is 9:00 in New York City and this is \"The Five.\" It is 6:00 p.m. in Phoenix, Arizona. And that means we are just one hour away from President Trump's remarks at a rally there. His first political event since the violence in Charlottesville ten days ago. Vice President Mike Pence will introduce the President. He'll address the crowd soon and we will going to bring that to you live.  Thousands of protesters have descended on downtown Phoenix. And we're going to you that scene in just a moment. The President's remarks tonight followed last night's address to the nation on the new way forward in Afghanistan.  For more on what we might expect to her, let's go to Mike Emanuel, live at the Phoenix Convention Center. Mike?",

The President has clashed with both John McCain and Jeff Flake. He's fairly been upset with McCain for being the vote that killed health care reform in the Senate and Flake has been a vocal critic and the President has fired back saying that Flake is weak on borders and crime and called them a non-factor in the Senate. And there is clearly a lot of anxiety and Republican leadership. If the President attacks Jeff Flake tonight, with Flake expected to have a tough reelection bid next year. Vice President Mike Pence says, we should expect the President to lay out the agenda when Congress returns in September. Issues like tax reform or at least tax cuts, money for that border wall and of course, scrapping ObamaCare.

There are I would estimate several thousands of them directly outside the convention center right now. They are being kept behind police placed barriers.  A street with apart from the Trump supporters who have been filing into the Convention Center. Having waited outside for many hours. We've heard the usual chance that you've come to know from the anti-Trump supporters. And the approach from crowd going into the convention shouting back the slogans that we have heard many times before. Now there are something like 3,000 members of the Phoenix Police Department in total. Pretty much all of those are either on duty or on call tonight. From our experience Kimberly, covering all the protests that we saw during the presidential election campaign, the real flash point comes after the rally rather than before or during it. That's when the Trump supporters file out. They are met on the streets by the anti-trust protesters. And that tends to be -- if there is any trouble -- when it happens.  The Phoenix Police Department have appealed for everybody like the mayor did to be civil and respectful tonight. We will see if that happens. The rally not obviously under way in terms of Mr. Trump speaking as yet. When it does, then those supporters will file out and as I say, that is when there could be a flash point and the potential for trouble. But the Phoenix Police Department very much on the alert for any violence. They say they will crack down on it very quickly should it happen -- Kimberly.",

And you have them actually coming from very different perspectives. There is a protest in support of police scheduled for tonight in Phoenix. You also have the Jewish community rallying, they were saying, \"never again.\" And you have the anti-Trump people. And then you have the antifascist people coming in as well. So, there are all sorts of elements there.   And you don't know how they combine, Kimberly. That's what I'm trying to say. I do think one important aspect is you said this after ten days after what we saw in Charlottesville, and there was a potential for specific feuds that could ignite some of these crowds. And that was whether or not President Trump would pardon former Sheriff Joe Arpaio. But now Arpaio has said, he's not coming. And what we heard from the White House today was, there will be no action on a potential pardon of Arpaio for any time today. So, I guess that means, not at this event. The real tension comes with internal Republican politics. People like John McCain, people like Jeff Flake are not fans of the President. Flake has a best-selling book out. The President has attacked Flake. He's attacked McCain. There is an ongoing fight with Senate Majority Leader McConnell in specific about the idea that you are undermining a 2018 candidate for the Senate from the White House. But we will see how that goes. I don't think that's going to spark any protests.",

It's not the military. This will be a very excited crowd. He has a really high approval rating in Arizona.  So, I expect that he will enjoy the speech but I would be curious about what he thought about his own speech last night.

His first political event since the violence in Charlottesville ten days ago. Vice President Mike Pence will introduce the President. He'll address the crowd soon and we will going to bring that to you live. Thousands of protesters have descended on downtown Phoenix. And we're going to you that scene in just a moment. The President's remarks tonight followed last night's address to the nation on the new way forward in Afghanistan.

In fact, some gathered out on the sidewalk as early as 2:00 a.m. Local Time. And when temperatures hit 107 degrees by midafternoon, it has certainly turned out to be an endurance test but we're still seeing funniest smiles all throughout the convention center. I asked some folks late today what they are hoping to hear from President Trump tonight."

The President has clashed with both John McCain and Jeff Flake. He's fairly been upset with McCain for being the vote that killed health care reform in the Senate and Flake has been a vocal critic and the President has fired back saying that Flake is weak on borders and crime and called them a non-factor in the Senate. And there is clearly a lot of anxiety and Republican leadership. If the President attacks Jeff Flake tonight, with Flake expected to have a tough reelection bid next year. Vice President Mike Pence says, we should expect the President to lay out the agenda when Congress returns in September. Issues like tax reform or at least tax cuts, money for that border wall and of course, scrapping ObamaCare. In about an hour or so, we will get a sense of exactly what is on the President's mind -- Kimberly."

      "utterance": "Hey, Kimberly. It's a loud crowd. It's a raucous crowd outside the Convention Center. But it is so far a civil crowd as the mayor asked these protesters to be. There are I would estimate several thousands of them directly outside the convention center right now. They are being kept behind police placed barriers. A street with apart from the Trump supporters who have been filing into the Convention Center. Having waited outside for many hours. We've heard the usual chance that you've come to know from the anti-Trump supporters. And the approach from crowd going into the convention shouting back the slogans that we have heard many times before. Now there are something like 3,000 members of the Phoenix Police Department in total. Pretty much all of those are either on duty or on call tonight. From our experience Kimberly, covering all the protests that we saw during the presidential election campaign, the real flash point comes after the rally rather than before or during it. That's when the Trump supporters file out. They are met on the streets by the anti-trust protesters. And that tends to be -- if there is any trouble -- when it happens. The Phoenix Police Department have appealed for everybody like the mayor did to be civil and respectful tonight. We will see if that happens. The rally not obviously under way in terms of Mr. Trump speaking as yet. When it does, then those supporters will file out and as I say, that is when there could be a flash point and the potential for trouble. But the Phoenix Police Department very much on the alert for any violence. They say they will crack down on it very quickly should it happen -- Kimberly."

      "speaker": "GUILFOYLE",

In terms of the people outside, the mayor has really urged a sense of, you know, calm and caution for people to be there to peacefully express themselves. But not to escalate the violence that we have seen in some other situations. And really this coming on, really it's a tumultuous time for the country with Charlottesville. What do you expect tonight?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST",
      "utterance": "Well, I don't know what to expect, obviously. This is kind of a, you know, explosive situation because you have lots of protesters. Not just a few. And you have them actually coming from very different perspectives. There is a protest in support of police scheduled for tonight in Phoenix. You also have the Jewish community rallying, they were saying, \"never again.\" And you have the anti-Trump people. And then you have the antifascist people coming in as well. So, there are all sorts of elements there. And you don't know how they combine, Kimberly. That's what I'm trying to say. I do think one important aspect is you said this after ten days after what we saw in Charlottesville, and there was a potential for specific feuds that could ignite some of these crowds. And that was whether or not President Trump would pardon former Sheriff Joe Arpaio. But now Arpaio has said, he's not coming. And what we heard from the White House today was, there will be no action on a potential pardon of Arpaio for any time today. So, I guess that means, not at this event. The real tension comes with internal Republican politics. People like John McCain, people like Jeff Flake are not fans of the President. Flake has a best-selling book out. The President has attacked Flake. He's attacked McCain. There is an ongoing fight with Senate Majority Leader McConnell in specific about the idea that you are undermining a 2018 candidate for the Senate from the White House. But we will see how that goes. I don't think that's going to spark any protests."

What's the President's message be given, you know, he had a very successful National Security speech. It went over very well. And now he's coming into a situation where yes, he has supporters in Arizona but also, there is, you know, a hotbed in terms of, you know, immigration issues and things that he's criticized on."

      "speaker": "PERINO",

I do think that he will have some sort of reference to Charlottesville like he did on Monday night. Doesn't necessarily have to be too specific. It was a very different audience. It's not the military. This will be a very excited crowd. He has a really high approval rating in Arizona. So, I expect that he will enjoy the speech but I would be curious about what he thought about his own speech last night. Because it did get some pretty high marks except on substance it's been sort of picked apart. We'll talk about that in the b-block and I wonder how he actually feels about that? But he did not tweet today. So, I don't know."

Senator Flake is not going to be there tonight. But I know the Governor saw him at the airport. But I think that that's also fine. I think they agree on a lot more than they disagree on. And in fact, the President will want and can count on his vote, meaning Senator Flake, when it comes to tax reform this fall. If that's the most important issue. I would just like, drive forward on that."

Besides the Bannon situation going on.

The need for a tax reform and then he goes after McCaskill, Tester and Manchin, and said, you have to go and face the people in your state that I won and you're going to win reelection. And you know I have the agenda to turn this country around and still, you are marching along with Senator Schumer who has done nothing for you except destroy the party. Imagine if he does that?

I would like Donald Trump may be to come out there and be self-deprecating and funny because I've seen him be funny but not necessarily self-deprecating. To say that he is not perfect -- I'm a businessman, I am not a spoken word poet. You know, I'm a guy who does things. I build things. I don't really say things. I build things. I've said this before. He is the inverse Obama. Obama was amazing with words. Not so much with deeds. Trump is a guy who acted. He is a man of action. But his words are inartful. So, that is what we are dealing with the complete opposite. When it comes to something like this, your preconceived assumptions are going to drive your conclusions. No matter what he says. If you think he's a racist and Satan and Hitler all wrapped up into one, whatever he says, it is just going to drive you crazy.

Afghanistan is the place you park your van to stake out the place next door which is Pakistan. Which has nukes and sponsors the Taliban like it's a little league team. So, the van, our van, it's going to stay there. And the sad news is it's going to stay there forever because the strategy boils down to two things. Killing terrorists and preventing a nuclear holocaust. The only way to do that is you park your van outside of Pakistan to make sure Pakistan doesn't get any nukes. To the Taliban.

And withdrawing troops and not actually doing the job there and giving the support that the people that are already there down on the ground need, it's just, you know, it's a suicide mission.

So, if you are really about given the military might, it would have to take a much greater political risk. And that's what's missing. So, Rex Tillerson comes out today and says the quote that you heard at the top of this segment which is the Taliban might win some battles and we might win some battles but they won't win the war.

Maybe there team should try standing up and having a winning season for a change instead of dumping more politics into a dying game. Viewership is down. You wonder why?

So Al, you're right. Any match could lead to an explosion. That match is you and three quarters of today's media. We were going to talk about this story but this story was broken by Clay Travis. Right? This is such an unbelievable story that we don't believe it. It's true. According to fans -- MSNBC decided to pull -- excuse me sorry, what'd I say?

Just cops trying to protect themselves from getting killed. We were also dismissing any real concerns about crime.

If they are pro- illegal immigration, following the law, against sanctuary cities. If they are pro-building the wall, they are entranced on that side.

X and y section, but I do believe that we can use technology and other things to do the rest of it. The house has already passed the board of funding request for the wall. And other mechanisms. So Paul Ryan as a speaker has done that in the house. And now all the focus will be on the senate as they go to appropriation. He is figuring out a way to get the votes for what he wants."

And now you see him working his way onto the stage, first you are going to see the Vice President get onto the stage. And he is going to do the introduction. Actually, that is Franklin Grant. He is there. Right after Ben Carson. Guys, a lot of emotion in Phoenix, Arizona. The President's soon to step up to the microphone. Let's start with you Greg, what do you expect and hope to hear tonight?"

      "utterance": "I expect the President to come on stage and handout kittens and then juggle chainsaws. That is my prediction, America. I expect a lot of reporters to using heat metaphors. Its 106 degrees, the temperatures and the tempers may be rising. Attention might be boiling over. You mentioned this before. It's very calm right now. There will be a few networks that are disappointed."

If he wants to carry that through, he should do that tonight. Perhaps get a little more detail and think the military for their response which is very positive to the speech."

The president, you know reiterating that the Evangelical community has been there for them consistently like they were during the campaign, so that is fantastic. I am actually looking forward to reading the transcript on this. I want to hear what Alameda King has to say and also Dr. Ben Carson and Franklin Grant."

      "utterance": "I really believe the President got the message last night, because it went over so well and I think he wants it to keep going and look for some self-retroaction. I am thinking about the first seven months, how the repeal and replace go, everyone laughs and he moves on."
