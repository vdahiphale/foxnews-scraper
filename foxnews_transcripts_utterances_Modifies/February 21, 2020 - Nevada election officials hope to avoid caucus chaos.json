In order for the jury to find Weinstein guilty on predatory assault, press prosecutors had to prove that Weinstein committed not only the sexual crimes he's charged with but that he had also committed a prior sex crime. And for that prosecutors relied on the witness testimony of actress Annabella Sciorra. Sciorra testified that she was raped in the early 90s by Weinstein. The jury did come to a unanimous decision on three counts, including a criminal sexual act charge and two rape charges, stemming from accusations that Weinstein forced production assistant Mimi Haleyi to perform oral sex on him in 2006 and that he raped actress Jessica Mann in a New York hotel room in 2013.

The start time of the walkout will be announced next week. 3,700 members of the St. Paul Federation of Educators are striking over increased pay and benefits. WFXT in Boston, as thousands of people found guilty of driving drunk in Massachusetts may be able to get a new trial. It has to do with the reliability of Breathalyzer results. A letter of notification has been sent to more than 27,000 offenders across the state who pleaded guilty or were found guilty of driving under the influence of alcohol between June of 2011 and April of last year. And this is a live look at Phoenix from our affiliate Fox 10 out there. One of the big stories there tonight. Arizona Governor Doug Ducey and Republican lawmakers have pulled a contentious proposal to make the current ban on so-called sanctuary cities, part of the state's constitution. Republican lawmakers, say sanctuary cities will remain illegal in Arizona though. That is tonight's live look \"OUTSIDE THE BELTWAY\" from SPECIAL REPORT. We'll be right back.",

A 43-year-old German man fatally shot nine people with immigrant backgrounds in a Frankfurt suburb before apparently killing his 72-year-old mother and himself. Half of the victims were reported to be Turkish. Iranians voted for a new parliament today. The election has been rocked by the disqualification of more than 7,000 potential candidates, most of them reformists and moderates. Iran's leadership and state media urge people to show up and vote with some framing it as a religious duty. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, meantime, met today with the new ruler of Oman, a key Gulf Arab allied to both the U.S. and Iran.

That memo sent to candidates indicates the party will no longer use a Google form to report results and will instead relay totals through text messages and phone calls. It's the second time Nevada Democrats shifted gears since the bashed Iowa caucuses. First, ditching the app they planned to use which was developed by the same company as the Iowa app, and instead opting for a Google form, scrambling to distribute 2,000 secure iPads and train volunteers on the new method. But there were concerns about the security of the iPads themselves and the tech savviness of volunteers, and now this shift to a phone-based system is raising fears over delayed results. And the DNC is trying to manage expectations, not committing to release any results on the day of the vote, saying accuracy is more important than speed. But a new AP nationwide polls shows Democrats have little faith in their party's nominating process overall. Only 41 percent of Democratic voters reporting they have a great deal of confidence, and 25 percent say they have little to no confidence. Republicans polled better, with 61 percent saying they have high confidence in the system. Nevada Democrats say the measures they are taking are to ensure accuracy.",

It's taken a few days to get there, but that release came out today. But the big news right before the show first broken by \"The Washington Post,\" Bernie Sanders briefed by U.S. officials that Russia is trying to help his presidential campaign. Then the campaign put out a statement saying from Sanders, \"I don't care, frankly, who Putin wants to be president. My message to Putin is clear, stay out of American elections. And as president, I will make sure that you do. In 2016, Russia used Internet propaganda to sow division in our country and my understanding is they are doing it again in 2020. Some of the ugly stuff on the Internet attributed to our campaign may well not be coming from real supporters.\" He talk about that in the debate. Later, Senator Sanders said that he was briefed about a month ago from U.S. intelligence about what Russia was trying to do. OK, let's start there with our panel, Matthew Continetti, founding editor of the \"Washington Free Beacon,\" Susan Ferrechio, Chief Congressional Correspondent for the \"Washington Examiner,\" and Josh Kraushaar, politics editor for \"National Journal.\" Matthew, this obviously comes in the context of the stories last night about intelligence officials raising alarms about Russia and President Trump receiving all that pushback. MATTHEW CONTINETTI, EDITOR IN CHIEF, \"WASHINGTON FREE BEACON\": I guess at least this time they are giving the briefing before the election, unlike after 2016 when Comey tells Trump after he won that all this was going on. What's important to recognize, though, is that Russian Facebook ads did not determine the result of the election in 2016, and they are not going to determine the result of the election in 2020. I think this is part of the Russians attempt to undermine legitimacy in our electoral system, and it seems to be working because so many people get so agitated over these stories.",

I think I agree with Matthew in that the sense that this really did upend the election is hard to prove, and I know just from the briefings that members of Congress have been getting that our intelligence officials have been working really hard to make sure that the election is secure, like \"The New York Times\" article suggested that they are hacking into actual election results. There is no evidence that that happened in 2018 at all. We just had an election, everything went fairly smoothly, and the updates that I get from members of Congress who are briefed on this is that they are aware that there are efforts being made by outside influences, we assume its China, we assume its Russia, to disrupt this next election, but that they are putting the infrastructure in place to make sure that doesn't happen.",

The jury, saying that they could not reach a unanimous decision on counts of one and three, predatory sexual assault charges the most serious against Weinstein, punishable by a sentence of up to life in prison. In order for the jury to find Weinstein guilty on predatory assault, press prosecutors had to prove that Weinstein committed not only the sexual crimes he's charged with but that he had also committed a prior sex crime. And for that prosecutors relied on the witness testimony of actress Annabella Sciorra. Sciorra testified that she was raped in the early 90s by Weinstein. The jury did come to a unanimous decision on three counts, including a criminal sexual act charge and two rape charges, stemming from accusations that Weinstein forced production assistant Mimi Haleyi to perform oral sex on him in 2006 and that he raped actress Jessica Mann in a New York hotel room in 2013.

That memo sent to candidates indicates the party will no longer use a Google form to report results and will instead relay totals through text messages and phone calls. It's the second time Nevada Democrats shifted gears since the bashed Iowa caucuses. First, ditching the app they planned to use which was developed by the same company as the Iowa app, and instead opting for a Google form, scrambling to distribute 2,000 secure iPads and train volunteers on the new method. But there were concerns about the security of the iPads themselves and the tech savviness of volunteers, and now this shift to a phone-based system is raising fears over delayed results. And the DNC is trying to manage expectations, not committing to release any results on the day of the vote, saying accuracy is more important than speed. But a new AP nationwide polls shows Democrats have little faith in their party's nominating process overall. Only 41 percent of Democratic voters reporting they have a great deal of confidence, and 25 percent say they have little to no confidence. Republicans polled better, with 61 percent saying they have high confidence in the system. Nevada Democrats say the measures they are taking are to ensure accuracy."

It's taken a few days to get there, but that release came out today. But the big news right before the show first broken by \"The Washington Post,\" Bernie Sanders briefed by U.S. officials that Russia is trying to help his presidential campaign. Then the campaign put out a statement saying from Sanders, \"I don't care, frankly, who Putin wants to be president. My message to Putin is clear, stay out of American elections. And as president, I will make sure that you do. In 2016, Russia used Internet propaganda to sow division in our country and my understanding is they are doing it again in 2020. Some of the ugly stuff on the Internet attributed to our campaign may well not be coming from real supporters.\" He talk about that in the debate. Later, Senator Sanders said that he was briefed about a month ago from U.S. intelligence about what Russia was trying to do. OK, let's start there with our panel, Matthew Continetti, founding editor of the \"Washington Free Beacon,\" Susan Ferrechio, Chief Congressional Correspondent for the \"Washington Examiner,\" and Josh Kraushaar, politics editor for \"National Journal.\" Matthew, this obviously comes in the context of the stories last night about intelligence officials raising alarms about Russia and President Trump receiving all that pushback. MATTHEW CONTINETTI, EDITOR IN CHIEF, \"WASHINGTON FREE BEACON\": I guess at least this time they are giving the briefing before the election, unlike after 2016 when Comey tells Trump after he won that all this was going on. What's important to recognize, though, is that Russian Facebook ads did not determine the result of the election in 2016, and they are not going to determine the result of the election in 2020. I think this is part of the Russians attempt to undermine legitimacy in our electoral system, and it seems to be working because so many people get so agitated over these stories."

And now here we are, and this is happening again. They are really trying to sow discord and disrupt the election. I think I agree with Matthew in that the sense that this really did upend the election is hard to prove, and I know just from the briefings that members of Congress have been getting that our intelligence officials have been working really hard to make sure that the election is secure, like \"The New York Times\" article suggested that they are hacking into actual election results. There is no evidence that that happened in 2018 at all. We just had an election, everything went fairly smoothly, and the updates that I get from members of Congress who are briefed on this is that they are aware that there are efforts being made by outside influences, we assume its China, we assume its Russia, to disrupt this next election, but that they are putting the infrastructure in place to make sure that doesn't happen."

JOSH KRAUSHAAR, POLITICAL EDITOR, \"NATIONAL JOURNAL\": It seems like Russia is trying to hedge their bets with this presidential election. And Trump often isn't tough enough with his rhetoric on Russia, but his policies have generally been pretty tough on Russia. His administration has taken a tough line on some sanctions, on a whole lot of other issues. With Bernie you saw a tough statement saying don't interfere with the election, but what would he do as president? He probably would withdraw troops from the Middle East. There are a lot of policies --"

It's only a matter of time before she changes her mind or she will give us some rationalization for it. It doesn't add up.

That has been a common goal now in America, to just try to get us out of there, at least lower the numbers by 4,000 or 5,000 I think is what this would do. And everybody is just hoping for that.
