And that is, this does push the Democratic Party further away from Israel because Democrats are taking the side of Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar instead of a long-standing ally. And you could say, well, they are Americans, they are congresswomen, that is why we are doing it. But if you look at the record and why they were not allowed into the country, the group they are going with celebrate suicide bombers who not only kill Israelis but also Americans.   They glorify terrorists who kill children. So, that's one reason that they are left out. And during their press conference, and this is exactly what they are going for, they are talking about so much misinformation, right?  They are acting like this is about Benjamin Netanyahu when it's about BDS which is a movement that's been around for far longer than one political party either in the U.S. or in Israel. And it's about not allowing the country to exist. Rashida Tlaib talks about the walls in Israel not being effective. Actually, they are at keeping suicide bombers out of Israel. And so there's a lot of things that they're putting on the table that they don't want to talk about in terms of human rights that don't jive with the leftist narrative. Just today, the Palestinian authority banned all LGBTQ activity in the West Bank, while Israel has one of the largest gay rights parades in the world.   So they're going to have to figure out, Democrats, whether they actually support real human rights in the Middle East which come with Israel, including for Arab-Israelis, or whether they support two congresswomen who are associated with group who celebrate suicide bombings against American citizens.",

Whether the polls say that they think Trump is tearing the country apart is irrelevant because it's the media that is creating the narrative that people hear about. The fact is the curtain is now pulled back. We see this and we are surprised. The rest of the media smirks because it's been this way all along, the problem. So why are they doing this? It's because racism is a quantity where in the media, the demand exceeds the supply. So they're going to have to keep creating this. They're going to have to keep doing this. And to your point, that slave story, the slave article was probably -- I didn't read it, but I'm assuming it was probably well- researched. It was probably well done, but I didn't read it. But now, my assumptions are this is all part of a greater narrative to paint Donald Trump as racist. So I'm going to look at everything they do as somehow artificially constructed to demonize somebody, and it's not going to stop. It's going to get worse. And we have to admit, this country overtime gets less racist. Do you think we're more racist now than we were in the 60's or the 50's or the 1860's? It's getting better, but they don't like that story. Things are going so well that they need to demonize everybody. So, right now, the Gray Lady is - this is bigger than Watergate.

I learned that overtime I had to cut back on one or the other. So, out went the wine. And in came the vodka, but we're missing the good news. The study isn't about the destruction caused behind the wheel of a car. It's about the embarrassment caused in front of your smartphone screen. Wikipedia told me that between 1991 and 2017, the rate of drunk driving fatalities decreased 46 percent nationally and 68 percent under people 21, age 21. So, we find ourselves no longer steering into lampposts, instead we steer humiliating posts about our stupid thoughts, activities and selves into a ravenous public who happily seek another opportunity to dance on our shame, Pete O-Rourke once called booze liquid idiot. But our tweets are digital dumb, which is better because nobody ever drove a tweet into oncoming traffic and wiped out a family of five. So, consider it progress that more people are dying from embarrassment than internal injuries. If more high people are wrecking themselves online than on the road that's a win for all of us.

The White House firing back against House Democrats plans to punish the U.S. and Israeli ambassadors with legislative action.

You know, I remember when people were upset that Benjamin Netanyahu was invited by the Republicans to come to Congress and criticized President Obama. But, you know what, it went by. Now, this has been doubled down by Trump so that now everything is so political about Israel.

And that is, this does push the Democratic Party further away from Israel because Democrats are taking the side of Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar instead of a long-standing ally. And you could say, well, they are Americans, they are congresswomen, that is why we are doing it. But if you look at the record and why they were not allowed into the country, the group they are going with celebrate suicide bombers who not only kill Israelis but also Americans. They glorify terrorists who kill children. So, that's one reason that they are left out. And during their press conference, and this is exactly what they are going for, they are talking about so much misinformation, right? They are acting like this is about Benjamin Netanyahu when it's about BDS which is a movement that's been around for far longer than one political party either in the U.S. or in Israel. And it's about not allowing the country to exist. Rashida Tlaib talks about the walls in Israel not being effective. Actually, they are at keeping suicide bombers out of Israel. And so there's a lot of things that they're putting on the table that they don't want to talk about in terms of human rights that don't jive with the leftist narrative. Just today, the Palestinian authority banned all LGBTQ activity in the West Bank, while Israel has one of the largest gay rights parades in the world. So they're going to have to figure out, Democrats, whether they actually support real human rights in the Middle East which come with Israel, including for Arab-Israelis, or whether they support two congresswomen who are associated with group who celebrate suicide bombings against American citizens."

Aid to Israel is actually an investment because in return for that they give us technology, they give us counterterrorism operations. They stop dozens of terrorist attacks last year in 20 different countries. The Palestinians use our aid, our taxpayer money to pay terrorists and their families to kill Americans and Israelis.

And then on the eve of the event, she scrubbed the video where she released her DNA results from her campaign website. So, she's got terrible political instincts and she's a phony. And what she did to Native Americans was -- some people say a lot worse than what Trump has done to minorities. If you think about what she did, she stole their identity. Then she use that fake identity to suppress the minorities' access to higher education jobs. And then she profited from the fake identity. And then when she got busted on it, when President Trump mocked her, she said \"Oh, that's an ethnic slur, Pocahontas.\" That's about as an ethnic slur as Fredo. It doesn't even make any sense. What's happening now is she is up in the polls because she's getting some Bernie boroughs (ph) behind her. But she's got a very irritating demeanor. Black Americans don't really love her that much.

Like, I'm not sure. Because that amazing video that you mentioned scrubbed, vindicated her, right? She was 1/17000 Native American and she played that up, so. Is she apologizing for perpetuating the lie? Is she apologizing for the impersonation, the exaggeration or the exploitation? Remember, she used this to get ahead and the law school used her lie to get ahead by saying like, we have the first female minority lawyer. Was it Harvard, I believe? So, that's why I don't give anymore money to that school. But anyway, and the media, like Jesse said, will pay this as some kind of, like calling her fauxcahontas or whatever. It's like calling a dumb person Einstein, right? It's like -- so I just think that I'm confused, as you could tell. I don't know what she's apologizing for.

He goes after Sleepy Joe, who is Joe Biden, who's really on his mind and he's the most attacked by the president. But now, she's back in the picture and again because she is a strong candidate and a rising -- she has momentum. I mean, the fact that she went to this forum, that she was invited to this forum, indicates in the words of the man who hosted the forum, that this is a trivial issue for Native Americans. They don't think it's a big deal. But what you get is a situation where, you know what, she has big ideas, Dana, and she has ideas, policy ideas. So for the Native Americans, what they say is this Pocahontas thing is Trump's agenda. That's the way he puts people down. And it's trivial to us. What's important to us, her -- Elizabeth Warren's top issues; health care, education, helping young people get ahead, pay for that big tuition debt.

The paper's executive editor forced to hold a crisis town hall meeting last week after liberal backlash for changing a headline about recent shootings. From \"Trump Urges Unity Versus Racism\" To \"Assailing Hate But Not Guns.\" In the leaked transcript, the editor, Dean Baquet, is quoted as saying, \"We build our newsroom to cover one story. We did truly well.\" But after Russia collusion fell apart, the editor says his paper is focusing on a new narrative, race. Here's a quote -- \"Now, we have to regroup and shift resources and emphasis to take on a different story.\" So, Jesse, this transcript is revealing but it also I think solidified a lot of what we already knew."

And they admitted they are not journalists, that they are partisan activists. Because a real journalist would go back the last two years and look, how did this Russia hoax actually come into being? But they are spending no time looking back. They have turned a blind eye to it and then are now just looking at what else can take out Trump. Race, I don't believe will have the same type of effect against the president as the Russia thing did. You could see the rating for the cables that pushed that hoax, are not rebounding as they pivot to race. And approval for Donald Trump among Hispanics and Black Americans since January has actually gone up. So, it's also not a very inspiring message to say that the country is founded on racism, it's a racist nation, and we need to destroy it and institute socialism in order to heal it. That type of messaging to this country is racist and that Trump is racist that all Trump voters are racist are going to turn off the very voters that the Democrats are going to need to recapture those rust belt districts in order to win back the White House because race isn't going to work.

But to my mind, you know, it's like this is not a new topic for the \"Times.\" \"The Times\" have been covering it. I think yesterday they had a magazine dedicated to slavery. So, this is something that they need to do. And I think that what you hear from Dean Baquet is look, we put a lot of effort into covering Mueller and the conspiracy argument, Jesse, and I think they did a pretty good job.

Whether the polls say that they think Trump is tearing the country apart is irrelevant because it's the media that is creating the narrative that people hear about. The fact is the curtain is now pulled back. We see this and we are surprised. The rest of the media smirks because it's been this way all along, the problem. So why are they doing this? It's because racism is a quantity where in the media, the demand exceeds the supply. So they're going to have to keep creating this. They're going to have to keep doing this. And to your point, that slave story, the slave article was probably -- I didn't read it, but I'm assuming it was probably well- researched. It was probably well done, but I didn't read it. But now, my assumptions are this is all part of a greater narrative to paint Donald Trump as racist. So I'm going to look at everything they do as somehow artificially constructed to demonize somebody, and it's not going to stop. It's going to get worse. And we have to admit, this country overtime gets less racist. Do you think we're more racist now than we were in the 60's or the 50's or the 1860's? It's getting better, but they don't like that story. Things are going so well that they need to demonize everybody. So, right now, the Gray Lady is - this is bigger than Watergate.

So, like Dean Baquet, I don't think that he - I don't know exactly - I'm not going to try to put words in his mouth, but there is this generational change where now I think it's partly because of the way universities, trained journalists now that they're activists and just reporting the news.

There's this - you've got a treadmill; you've got a bike over there and he's exercising with it. Isn't that beautiful and wonderful?
