      "sentences": "Welcome to \"Hannity.\" We are witnessing in this country right now, right before your eyes, a total miscarriage of justice at the highest court in the land. There is no due process, no presumption of innocence, no burden of proof. And as we speak, you have the Democratic Party, the left in America, the median in America, all their friends are literally saying, guilt by accusation and trying to the character career reputation of Judge Brett Kavanaugh based on what is decades old uncorroborated allegations.  Now, ambiguous claims we have here. Kavanaugh himself is categorically refuting it under oath. And the so-called witnesses categorically deny.  Now, of course, it's a coordinated effort to take down Judge Kavanaugh, we're going to show you tonight that this is nothing new from the Democratic Party. There is good reason to be skeptical, as serious as these allegations are and we have said from the beginning to take them seriously. We're going to have tonight a Hannity history lesson how Democrats, the left in this country use identity politics every two years, every four years to gain electoral advantage, all while destroying the reputation of their opponents in the process.  The tactics of the left should disgust every rational thinking American who loves and cares about this country and our core values. This isn't about Republican, Democrat, liberal, conservative tonight. We'll also discuss the controversy surrounding the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. The president should under no circumstance fire this beleaguered bureaucrat. We're going to explain that and so much more.  This is a very important breaking news, opening monologue.",

After days of negotiations with the Senate Judiciary Committee, Professor Christine Ford has now agreed to testify about the allegations she made against Judge Kavanaugh. Let me be perfectly clear. These are serious allegations. I've said it many times. Professor Ford deserves to be heard, and those allegations and accusations should be taken seriously. And this coming Thursday, you the American people will be able to hear from both Professor Ford and Judge Kavanaugh in an open setting. Now, Chairman Grassley of the Senate Judiciary Committee, he was right to hold this hearing, and the Republicans have been and are being extremely fair and accommodating and they are taking these allegations seriously. But tonight, we need to a step back and we need to remember what we're talking about here. These are 35-year-old sexual misconduct allegations made by Professor Ford to congressional Democrats. Now, the claims date back to when Ford and Kavanaugh were in high school.   Senator Dianne Feinstein, she was aware of Professor Ford's allegations since July. She sat on them. She kept them a secret, until after Kavanaugh's public hearing and after lengthy meetings with Judge Kavanaugh. In fact, Dianne Feinstein refused to give Senate Republicans, her colleagues, the full unredacted letter where accusations were first made back in July until today. Now, Professor Ford cannot remember the date or location of the alleged incident. The four witnesses that Ford herself listed to corroborate her claims, they are all now on record denying what Ford is alleging. And just a short ago, Judge Kavanaugh sat down with our own Martha MacCallum and categorically refuted these claims once again. Let's take a look.",

      "sentences": "All right. Tonight, Kavanaugh is now facing one more allegation because over the weekend, The New Yorker, well, they brought up another decades-old claim against and Kavanaugh, in this case a woman named Deborah Ramirez. She is claiming that in the 1980s, again, when he was a freshman in college, that Kavanaugh exposed himself to her at a drunken college party at Yale University. Ramirez herself wasn't totally sure if Kavanaugh was a perpetrator. According to the New Yorker, she became, quote, quickly inebriated at the party, her words. She told \"The New Yorker\" that she was, quote, foggy and slurring her words. And she even acknowledges she has significant memory gap from that evening.  Now, The New York Times, well, they spent over a week trying to corroborate her story, talking to dozens of people. And The Times said this, quote, \"They have interviewed several dozen people over the past week in an attempt to corroborate her story. They could find no one with firsthand knowledge. Ms. Ramirez herself contacted former Yale classmates asking if they recall the incident and told some of them that she could not be certain that Mr. Kavanaugh was the one who exposed himself.   And those who Ramirez listed as witnesses in yet another case here, well, to the indecent charges, well, they are all flatly denying. And this is what they said: We can say with confidence that if the incident Debbie alleges ever occurred, we would have seen or heard about it. We did not. The behavior that she describes would be completely out of character for Brett. In addition, some of us knew Debbie long after Yale. She never describes this incident until Brett's Supreme Court nomination was pending. \"The New Yorker\" also interviewed Ramirez's best friend at the time of the alleged incident and she's also denying any knowledge of her claims. And she said, quote: This was a woman knows best friend with. We shared intimate details of our lives. I was never told the story by her or by anyone else. It never came up. I didn't see it. I never heard of it happening. Now, Judge Kavanaugh also denied emphatically these decades-old charges. In a statement, he wrote, quote: well, these are smears, pure and simple, and they debase our public discourse. But they are also a threat to any man or woman who wishes to serve our country. Such grotesque and obvious character assassinations, if allowed to succeed, will dissuade competent and good people of all political persuasions from service.  As I told the committee during the hearing, a federal judge must be independent, not swayed by public or political pressure. That is a kind of judge I will always be. I will not be intimidated into withdrawing from this process. The coordinated effort to destroy my good name will not drive me out. The vile threats of violence against my family will not drive them out. The last-minute character assassination will not succeed.  And tonight, Kavanaugh once again denied these charges in his interview with Martha. Let's take a look.",

Now, at the very same time, all the people you are watching here, we have a case not 36 or seven or five years ago, where Keith Ellison, the number two person, the number two guy at the DNC, has been accused of repeated physical and emotional abuse and the DNC has smeared and slandered and ignored the person making that allegation. That's back in August this year. So, what you are watching is a Democratic Party playing politics, sadly exploiting a sexual conduct allegation accusation, that's it, for political gain, jumping to conclusions, rushing to judgment. Now, these are serious allegations and as I've said, we should hear from the accuser.  But tonight, every American, Republican, Democrat, conservative and liberal. This is why you need a healthy dose of skepticism. Let me tell you why. The attorney representing Professor Ford, her name is Debra Katz, well, has views on sexual assault that have been extraordinary political and inconsistent at best. For example, she said this about Paula Jones. Nobody in the media reports it. Now, Paula Jones' suit is very, very weak and she alleged one incident that took place at a hotel room, that by her own testimony lasted 10 to 12 minutes. She suffered no repercussions in the workplace. She then said of Jones' accusations, quote, clearly a one-time incident that took place in 10 to 12 minutes, and she was not forced to have sex. She left of her own volition, the courts increasingly are finding that is not enough to create a hostile work environment claim. And she also defended creepy Senator Al Franken. Quote: Context is relevant. He did not do this as a member the U.S. Senate. Yes he did. And, by the way, he did this in the capacity of someone who is still functioning as an entertainer. Clearly, Professor Ford's attorney has a left-wing, radical, inconsistent political agenda. And \"The Daily Caller\" even uncovered back in 2017. The same said she vowed to resist President Trump.

And now, we are also learning that Professor Ford is adding one more person to his legal team, an attorney named Michael Bromwich. He's the lawyer currently representing fired FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe.  Now, this brings us to our Hannity history lesson surrounding the Democratic playbook. Now, every two to four years in politics, every election cycle, Democrats used the politics of personal destruction to literally maim the character of their political opponents, even if it means lying in the process. They demonize all conservatives. There's not a conservative that I know that has not been through this. In fact every four years, every two years, Republicans are racist, misogynistic, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic. Oh, they want dirty air and water, and they want to kill your children and throw granny over a cliff. Now, the left has also rushed to judgment in the wake of other major events. They have been wrong. On this program, we've been right. We didn't rush to judgment in the Duke lacrosse case. Remember when the media falsely accused Richard Jewell the Summer Olympics bombing? Remember because he said he fit profile of a lone bomber because he lived with his mother. Richard Jewell's listening to my radio show. I was a local host in Atlanta at the time. He once thanked me for being the only one not to rush to judgment. Remember the rush to judgment in Ferguson, in Missouri? Do you remember the rush to judgment in Baltimore, with Freddie Gray? Remember when Obama said the Cambridge police acted stupidly? You know, we have on this program adopted the \"we will not rush to judgment. We will wait and we will see.\" On the case of the Duke lacrosse kids, I went to meet with their parents.  In the case of Trayvon Martin, George Zimmerman, I met with George Zimmerman's attorney and George Zimmerman, asked him tough questions. And you see it now, every time there's a Supreme Court nominee, well, and it's happens to be a president that's Republican that appoints him, we saw it all the time. Judge Bork, we saw it with Clarence Thomas. Politically, remember 2012? Mitt Romney was sexist. He had binders full of women's resumes. And remember they turn his efforts to hire women into an attack about him being a sexist. Mitt Romney was not. Democrats smeared Romney -- remember they had falsely accused him -- remember Harry Reid, of being a tax cheat? And then after they won the election, they had no regrets about spreading those lies, these false attacks. This happens. This is why Americans have a duty to be skeptical because the media, the left wing have been wrong. It's in their playbook. We see it every two years, every four years, every Supreme Court nominee and every big high-profile case that they politicize. Here's a look at Harry Reid.",

That was going on all morning this morning. Tonight, Rod Rosenstein has been in communication with a president and apparently they will be meeting on Thursday.

Not woman has ever come forward to say he acted inappropriately in the workplace, that he used his power in an untoward way. These allegations are not about sex. They're about power. You don't become a serial rapist for a couple of years and hang it up. That's the garbage of all garbage coming from the Avenatti camp. So, here's what I think will happen -- nobody in their right mind is going to deny him a seat on the Supreme Court based on allegations 35 years old, when everybody at the high school party says they don't know what the lady is talking about, Dr. Ford. And the second allegation is not even worthy of talking about. So, I hope every Republican will be fair to Judge Kavanaugh, listen to what Dr. Ford says and render a good decision here.

You mentioned that exclusive interview, Judge Kavanaugh and his wife Ashley did with our colleague, Martha MacCallum, he was firm in saying he never sexually assaulted anyone. Although I am hearing from some Republicans tonight who are privately saying they think the answers were a bit robotic and on Thursday they're expecting him when he goes before the Senate judiciary panel to be much more fiery in his testimony like he was in a letter today to the Republican Chairman Chuck Grassley where in part, Kavanaugh said, \"That these are smears, pure and simple, and he thinks it's debasing our public discourse.\" There was also an emotional letter from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford that she wrote to the judiciary panel where she said that she felt agony, yet urgency to air these allegations as a civic duty. Although, now three alleged witnesses in addition to Kavanaugh have all said they have no recollection of the alleged incident in high school. The New Yorker magazine meanwhile, as you noted, has published a new allegation by a classmate at Yale, Deborah Ramirez, who claims that Kavanaugh exposed himself to her even though the magazine admits it was not able to confirm that Kavanaugh was actually in that room. And the New York Times has revealed that the allegations is so thin that they interviewed several dozen people in the past week and could not corroborate the story and could not convince -- convincible report that in fact it was true. Now, Michael Avenatti says that within the next 48 hours he will be releasing even more salacious allegations against Kavanaugh. The bottom line tonight is that the Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said that this is a smear campaign against Kavanaugh. And he vowed that no matter what happens before the Judiciary Committee on Thursday he is planning to have a vote up or down on the Senate floor in the next few weeks to get everyone in both parties on the record, Sean.",

There is no due process, no presumption of innocence, no burden of proof. And as we speak, you have the Democratic Party, the left in America, the median in America, all their friends are literally saying, guilt by accusation and trying to the character career reputation of Judge Brett Kavanaugh based on what is decades old uncorroborated allegations. Now, ambiguous claims we have here. Kavanaugh himself is categorically refuting it under oath. And the so-called witnesses categorically deny. Now, of course, it's a coordinated effort to take down Judge Kavanaugh, we're going to show you tonight that this is nothing new from the Democratic Party. There is good reason to be skeptical, as serious as these allegations are and we have said from the beginning to take them seriously. We're going to have tonight a Hannity history lesson how Democrats, the left in this country use identity politics every two years, every four years to gain electoral advantage, all while destroying the reputation of their opponents in the process. The tactics of the left should disgust every rational thinking American who loves and cares about this country and our core values. This isn't about Republican, Democrat, liberal, conservative tonight. We'll also discuss the controversy surrounding the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. The president should under no circumstance fire this beleaguered bureaucrat. We're going to explain that and so much more. This is a very important breaking news, opening monologue."

After days of negotiations with the Senate Judiciary Committee, Professor Christine Ford has now agreed to testify about the allegations she made against Judge Kavanaugh. Let me be perfectly clear. These are serious allegations. I've said it many times. Professor Ford deserves to be heard, and those allegations and accusations should be taken seriously. And this coming Thursday, you the American people will be able to hear from both Professor Ford and Judge Kavanaugh in an open setting. Now, Chairman Grassley of the Senate Judiciary Committee, he was right to hold this hearing, and the Republicans have been and are being extremely fair and accommodating and they are taking these allegations seriously. But tonight, we need to a step back and we need to remember what we're talking about here. These are 35-year-old sexual misconduct allegations made by Professor Ford to congressional Democrats. Now, the claims date back to when Ford and Kavanaugh were in high school. Senator Dianne Feinstein, she was aware of Professor Ford's allegations since July. She sat on them. She kept them a secret, until after Kavanaugh's public hearing and after lengthy meetings with Judge Kavanaugh. In fact, Dianne Feinstein refused to give Senate Republicans, her colleagues, the full unredacted letter where accusations were first made back in July until today. Now, Professor Ford cannot remember the date or location of the alleged incident. The four witnesses that Ford herself listed to corroborate her claims, they are all now on record denying what Ford is alleging. And just a short ago, Judge Kavanaugh sat down with our own Martha MacCallum and categorically refuted these claims once again. Let's take a look."

Tonight, Kavanaugh is now facing one more allegation because over the weekend, The New Yorker, well, they brought up another decades-old claim against and Kavanaugh, in this case a woman named Deborah Ramirez. She is claiming that in the 1980s, again, when he was a freshman in college, that Kavanaugh exposed himself to her at a drunken college party at Yale University. Ramirez herself wasn't totally sure if Kavanaugh was a perpetrator. According to the New Yorker, she became, quote, quickly inebriated at the party, her words. She told \"The New Yorker\" that she was, quote, foggy and slurring her words. And she even acknowledges she has significant memory gap from that evening. Now, The New York Times, well, they spent over a week trying to corroborate her story, talking to dozens of people. And The Times said this, quote, \"They have interviewed several dozen people over the past week in an attempt to corroborate her story. They could find no one with firsthand knowledge. Ms. Ramirez herself contacted former Yale classmates asking if they recall the incident and told some of them that she could not be certain that Mr. Kavanaugh was the one who exposed himself."

As I told the committee during the hearing, a federal judge must be independent, not swayed by public or political pressure. That is a kind of judge I will always be. I will not be intimidated into withdrawing from this process. The coordinated effort to destroy my good name will not drive me out. The vile threats of violence against my family will not drive them out. The last-minute character assassination will not succeed.

Now, despite everything we'd just showed you, and before any public testimony, there are people in this country -- this should not be political. Democrats, people on the left, they have already convicted Judge Kavanaugh. And according to them, he has no presumption of innocence, no right to be heard, no reason to be believed, no due process.

Now, at the very same time, all the people you are watching here, we have a case not 36 or seven or five years ago, where Keith Ellison, the number two person, the number two guy at the DNC, has been accused of repeated physical and emotional abuse and the DNC has smeared and slandered and ignored the person making that allegation. That's back in August this year. So, what you are watching is a Democratic Party playing politics, sadly exploiting a sexual conduct allegation accusation, that's it, for political gain, jumping to conclusions, rushing to judgment. Now, these are serious allegations and as I've said, we should hear from the accuser. But tonight, every American, Republican, Democrat, conservative and liberal. This is why you need a healthy dose of skepticism. Let me tell you why. The attorney representing Professor Ford, her name is Debra Katz, well, has views on sexual assault that have been extraordinary political and inconsistent at best. For example, she said this about Paula Jones. Nobody in the media reports it. Now, Paula Jones' suit is very, very weak and she alleged one incident that took place at a hotel room, that by her own testimony lasted 10 to 12 minutes. She suffered no repercussions in the workplace. She then said of Jones' accusations, quote, clearly a one-time incident that took place in 10 to 12 minutes, and she was not forced to have sex. She left of her own volition, the courts increasingly are finding that is not enough to create a hostile work environment claim."

And now, we are also learning that Professor Ford is adding one more person to his legal team, an attorney named Michael Bromwich. He's the lawyer currently representing fired FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe. Now, this brings us to our Hannity history lesson surrounding the Democratic playbook. Now, every two to four years in politics, every election cycle, Democrats used the politics of personal destruction to literally maim the character of their political opponents, even if it means lying in the process. They demonize all conservatives. There's not a conservative that I know that has not been through this. In fact every four years, every two years, Republicans are racist, misogynistic, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic. Oh, they want dirty air and water, and they want to kill your children and throw granny over a cliff. Now, the left has also rushed to judgment in the wake of other major events. They have been wrong. On this program, we've been right. We didn't rush to judgment in the Duke lacrosse case. Remember when the media falsely accused Richard Jewell the Summer Olympics bombing? Remember because he said he fit profile of a lone bomber because he lived with his mother. Richard Jewell's listening to my radio show. I was a local host in Atlanta at the time. He once thanked me for being the only one not to rush to judgment. Remember the rush to judgment in Ferguson, in Missouri? Do you remember the rush to judgment in Baltimore, with Freddie Gray? Remember when Obama said the Cambridge police acted stupidly? You know, we have on this program adopted the \"we will not rush to judgment. We will wait and we will see.\" On the case of the Duke lacrosse kids, I went to meet with their parents. In the case of Trayvon Martin, George Zimmerman, I met with George Zimmerman's attorney and George Zimmerman, asked him tough questions. And you see it now, every time there's a Supreme Court nominee, well, and it's happens to be a president that's Republican that appoints him, we saw it all the time. Judge Bork, we saw it with Clarence Thomas. Politically, remember 2012? Mitt Romney was sexist. He had binders full of women's resumes. And remember they turn his efforts to hire women into an attack about him being a sexist. Mitt Romney was not. Democrats smeared Romney -- remember they had falsely accused him -- remember Harry Reid, of being a tax cheat? And then after they won the election, they had no regrets about spreading those lies, these false attacks. This happens. This is why Americans have a duty to be skeptical because the media, the left wing have been wrong. It's in their playbook. We see it every two years, every four years, every Supreme Court nominee and every big high-profile case that they politicize. Here's a look at Harry Reid."

We're going to have a lot more on this in a moment. But first, breaking today, it also appears that the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein is hanging onto his job, at least for now. After \"The New York Times\" issued a report accusing Rod Rosenstein, and they are sticking by it, of plotting to secretly record President Trump and planning to rally cabinet officials and invoked the 25th Amendment, rumors spread that Rosenstein might be out of a job. That was going on all morning this morning. Tonight, Rod Rosenstein has been in communication with a president and apparently they will be meeting on Thursday.

Not woman has ever come forward to say he acted inappropriately in the workplace, that he used his power in an untoward way. These allegations are not about sex. They're about power. You don't become a serial rapist for a couple of years and hang it up. That's the garbage of all garbage coming from the Avenatti camp. So, here's what I think will happen -- nobody in their right mind is going to deny him a seat on the Supreme Court based on allegations 35 years old, when everybody at the high school party says they don't know what the lady is talking about, Dr. Ford. And the second allegation is not even worthy of talking about. So, I hope every Republican will be fair to Judge Kavanaugh, listen to what Dr. Ford says and render a good decision here. If he is denied a seat on the Supreme Court based on 35-year-old allegations and uncorroborated, who in the world will come forward in the future to be the judge? There's a lot at stake here."

As President Trump today said all this is political and he is going to stand by his nominee. You mentioned that exclusive interview, Judge Kavanaugh and his wife Ashley did with our colleague, Martha MacCallum, he was firm in saying he never sexually assaulted anyone. Although I am hearing from some Republicans tonight who are privately saying they think the answers were a bit robotic and on Thursday they're expecting him when he goes before the Senate judiciary panel to be much more fiery in his testimony like he was in a letter today to the Republican Chairman Chuck Grassley where in part, Kavanaugh said, \"That these are smears, pure and simple, and he thinks it's debasing our public discourse.\" There was also an emotional letter from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford that she wrote to the judiciary panel where she said that she felt agony, yet urgency to air these allegations as a civic duty. Although, now three alleged witnesses in addition to Kavanaugh have all said they have no recollection of the alleged incident in high school. The New Yorker magazine meanwhile, as you noted, has published a new allegation by a classmate at Yale, Deborah Ramirez, who claims that Kavanaugh exposed himself to her even though the magazine admits it was not able to confirm that Kavanaugh was actually in that room. And the New York Times has revealed that the allegations is so thin that they interviewed several dozen people in the past week and could not corroborate the story and could not convince -- convincible report that in fact it was true. Now, Michael Avenatti says that within the next 48 hours he will be releasing even more salacious allegations against Kavanaugh. The bottom line tonight is that the Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said that this is a smear campaign against Kavanaugh. And he vowed that no matter what happens before the Judiciary Committee on Thursday he is planning to have a vote up or down on the Senate floor in the next few weeks to get everyone in both parties on the record, Sean."

      "utterance": "I don't believe the new allegation. I believe when Brett denies something, he's telling the truth. That it was not corroborated, it wasn't that the New York Times ask two people, they ask dozens of people and they can't even find that he was in the room. So if you can't corroborate an accusation, I don't see how it can possibly be believed. But I also believed Brett when he said he doesn't do something and he said it under oath he didn't do it."

      "utterance": "They are completely uncorroborated allegations, and Brett has unequivocally denied them and I believe him because it's inconsistent with everything we know about him as a person. I've known him for over 20 years, in the professional context in the White House, and also as a close, personal friend. And nothing about this gels with the person that we know and that is why you have had such an outpouring of support from women who know him, throughout every stage of his life."

As Senator Collins said it, it's not fair to anybody to hold something like that back."

      "speaker": "MARTIN",
      "utterance": "The timing of that release of this information is a very disturbing, given that we had a full hearing and a process in place. And it isn't fair to Brett Kavanaugh and it's not actually fair to Dr. Ford, either, the way this has unfolded. And I don't believe the process currently has really gotten to the bottom of this. And I hope that on Thursday we will hear from both of them and we will continue to hear what Brett Kavanaugh said today, which is that this did not happen unequivocally and that none of it is true."

What was your experience?"

      "utterance": "Well, absolutely. You gave me the perfect question, to be able to at say to you I have lived in this town and worked in this town for 35 years, three different administrations. I could count on one hand of the numbers of people who rise to the level of such great integrity and character that I would sit here and defend to the death. Like Brett Kavanaugh. And in his letter to Senator Grassley, and Senator Feinstein, the recent one that was released today, he is saying he owes it to all of us to defend his dignity. We owe it to him because he is an example of really what is happening in this country right now. This is a sickening spectacle of what's happening on Capitol Hill. I've never seen anything like it, and I have been through a number of Supreme Court nominations in three administrations. This is really such a shock to our institution. They are there to protect the fairness for everyone."

Thank you all for being with us. When we come back, we'll have more on Judge Kavanaugh. Also Rod Rosenstein will meet face-to-face with President Trump on Thursday.

And of course the media and Democrats which is redundant we go a hair on fire crazy about it. So in the alternative perhaps it would be wise to simply relieve Rod Rosenstein of oversight of the special counsel case pending an investigation into these very serious charges."

And if you would have done it on Friday they would have called it and compare it to the Saturday night massacre, call it a Friday night massacre. They want it so bad, they can taste it. Is he conflicted? Yes. Are there major problems? Yes. The president shouldn't have to do this. That's Jeff Sessions that's his department. Where is he again?"

Whether or not there are people within the administration that are willing to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove the president or wiretapped the president at one point in time, the president needs to investigate this whether the inspector general investigates it. I don't know."

I think the most important thing for the president to do in order to regain the trust back at this Department of Justice is to do hat Gregg said. Find a way to investigate this matter and put it behind them, and if he finds out that Rod Rosenstein really did do that and not in a joking matter, he has the authority under article two to remove him."

Because whatever the Democrats think of their base, the one thing I know is, that if you guys fold on this and gave and keep bending over backwards, you've done that enough. You've demonstrated that you don't hate women, you've demonstrated that you are open-minded, you've demonstrated that you want to hear from her."
