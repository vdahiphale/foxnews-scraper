Some alarming news broken by the Washington Free Beacon. The Biden administration is in possession of nearly 1 billion records that detail American firearms purchases. So here's the question, is this the first step toward a national gun registry? We have that breaking news in moments. It's unreal. But first, Biden botches another one. That's the focus of tonight's 'Angle'. Now, on Saturday, the New York Times had to run one very embarrassing article. After weeks of beating the war drums on Russia, the great lady had to admit that Ukrainian officials were furious with the Biden administration. So the differences between the Ukrainian government and team Biden had simmered in the background for weeks. But finally, the Ukrainian president criticized the White House in terms that were so blunt that even The Times had to report them saying, \"They keep supporting this theme, this topic\", Zelensky said, \"of the repeated warnings by American officials. And they make it as acute and burning as possible. In my opinion, this is a mistake.\" But just a few hours after that embarrassing dressing down from Zelensky, the gloom and doom twins issued another dire warning.",

      "sentences": "Now, the Biden folks are headed for yet another disaster. And it's important that all of us understand why this is happening. Now, first off, they don't understand Europe. They believe that we have allies in Europe who need to be defended from Putin and Russia. But at this point, that's just nonsense. Europe knows war with Putin would be catastrophic for their economy since they get about 40 percent of their natural gas from Russia. So if they fight Putin, it means the gas stops flowing and they're all freezing. Moreover, Germany sees no threat from Russia. The Germans are happy to work with Russia on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. And they have no intention of providing Ukraine with any weapons. In fact, both Germany and France have opened their own negotiations with Russia and Ukraine without the United States. Now, the truth is that Germany, France and Ukraine are all closer to the Russian position than they are to Biden's threats. Those of us on the populist side here in the United States tried to warn the Biden folks that we don't really have allies in Europe, not the way we used to at least, and they should have listened. Second, the Biden team doesn't understand China. Some of the Biden folks, including Biden himself and John Kerry, his climate czar, are apparently still committed to the old idea that a rising China is good for the world. Of course, that's nonsense. While Russia has a GDP of $1.65 trillion, China's GDP is nearly $17 trillion and rising. The CCP is turning the world's second largest economy into a prison driven by the whim of its president, President Xi. And it is the greatest threat to peace and freedom on Earth. So focusing on Russia and neglecting China is a cataclysmic mistake. Now, other Biden's supporters along with some of the warmongers in the Republican Party, you know who they are, claim that if we don't fight for Ukraine we'll encourage China to take Taiwan. But nothing would make President Xi happier than for the U.S. to waste money, troops and equipment in Eastern Europe. And third, the Biden team doesn't understand the United States. Now, I get the political calculation here. They've had a terrible time in 2021. They have another terrible year coming up, and they're likely going to lose control of both the House and the Senate. So I guess with no good news on the horizon, why not play the war card at this point. Heck, they can always count on members of both parties to join in on the saber rattling.",

      "sentences": "Why have two parties? Now, these people live in an alternate reality where standing up for democracy means protecting Ukraine's borders. Why? While we just systematically dismantle on our own. These quotes show that our political establishment really is deeply out of touch. Team Biden probably hopes that talking about big bad Putin would rally the people, much like 9/11 did for Bush and Cheney. But that is a grave miscalculation. The United States isn't the same country it was in 2002. Our so-called elites have made too many mistakes. We don't trust the Pentagon, the CIA, or the National Security Council now, least not the way we once did. Too much money has been wasted. And too many good Americans have died fighting in the Middle East and Afghanistan. And we've had too many woke lectures from the President and the military about how America is systemically racist. We won't support Joe Biden's attempts to start another foolish war. We know that any problems in Eastern Europe can and should be handled by the Europeans. We know to their own military has to be rebuilt. And we must focus on protecting our interests, not promoting efforts designed to change the narrative about a failing presidency. What the American people want, I think, and what they deserve is a government that really works for us. We need a credible Secretary of State. We need better and fairer trade deals. And we need a military of its leaders who know more about winning battles than giving press conferences. Now, that won't be possible for a while and the Biden team was going to stagger from one embarrassment to the next. But Biden is already losing power. And a new presidential election is less than three years away. So better times are coming. And that's the 'Angle'. Joining me now is David Tafuri, former Obama foreign policy adviser and state department official. David, it's great to have you on tonight.

And he wants to make sure that nobody overreacts, because he's still hopeful that diplomacy will win out. You also have to remember the Ukrainian mindset. This isn't new for them.

All from one administration, all in a single year. So yes, there's a number of us who are very concerned about this. And this is why we wrote the letter. And frankly, we didn't realize it was quite this number of purchases over the last 20-some years that the federal government is now compiling.",

So here's the question, is this the first step toward a national gun registry? We have that breaking news in moments. It's unreal. But first, Biden botches another one. That's the focus of tonight's 'Angle'. Now, on Saturday, the New York Times had to run one very embarrassing article. After weeks of beating the war drums on Russia, the great lady had to admit that Ukrainian officials were furious with the Biden administration. So the differences between the Ukrainian government and team Biden had simmered in the background for weeks. But finally, the Ukrainian president criticized the White House in terms that were so blunt that even The Times had to report them saying, \"They keep supporting this theme, this topic\", Zelensky said, \"of the repeated warnings by American officials. And they make it as acute and burning as possible. In my opinion, this is a mistake.\" But just a few hours after that embarrassing dressing down from Zelensky, the gloom and doom twins issued another dire warning."

      "utterance": "Now, the Biden folks are headed for yet another disaster. And it's important that all of us understand why this is happening. Now, first off, they don't understand Europe. They believe that we have allies in Europe who need to be defended from Putin and Russia. But at this point, that's just nonsense. Europe knows war with Putin would be catastrophic for their economy since they get about 40 percent of their natural gas from Russia. So if they fight Putin, it means the gas stops flowing and they're all freezing. Moreover, Germany sees no threat from Russia. The Germans are happy to work with Russia on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. And they have no intention of providing Ukraine with any weapons. In fact, both Germany and France have opened their own negotiations with Russia and Ukraine without the United States. Now, the truth is that Germany, France and Ukraine are all closer to the Russian position than they are to Biden's threats. Those of us on the populist side here in the United States tried to warn the Biden folks that we don't really have allies in Europe, not the way we used to at least, and they should have listened. Second, the Biden team doesn't understand China. Some of the Biden folks, including Biden himself and John Kerry, his climate czar, are apparently still committed to the old idea that a rising China is good for the world. Of course, that's nonsense. While Russia has a GDP of $1.65 trillion, China's GDP is nearly $17 trillion and rising. The CCP is turning the world's second largest economy into a prison driven by the whim of its president, President Xi. And it is the greatest threat to peace and freedom on Earth. So focusing on Russia and neglecting China is a cataclysmic mistake. Now, other Biden's supporters along with some of the warmongers in the Republican Party, you know who they are, claim that if we don't fight for Ukraine we'll encourage China to take Taiwan. But nothing would make President Xi happier than for the U.S. to waste money, troops and equipment in Eastern Europe. And third, the Biden team doesn't understand the United States. Now, I get the political calculation here. They've had a terrible time in 2021. They have another terrible year coming up, and they're likely going to lose control of both the House and the Senate. So I guess with no good news on the horizon, why not play the war card at this point. Heck, they can always count on members of both parties to join in on the saber rattling."

While we just systematically dismantle on our own. These quotes show that our political establishment really is deeply out of touch. Team Biden probably hopes that talking about big bad Putin would rally the people, much like 9/11 did for Bush and Cheney. But that is a grave miscalculation. The United States isn't the same country it was in 2002. Our so-called elites have made too many mistakes. We don't trust the Pentagon, the CIA, or the National Security Council now, least not the way we once did. Too much money has been wasted. And too many good Americans have died fighting in the Middle East and Afghanistan. And we've had too many woke lectures from the President and the military about how America is systemically racist. We won't support Joe Biden's attempts to start another foolish war. We know that any problems in Eastern Europe can and should be handled by the Europeans. We know to their own military has to be rebuilt. And we must focus on protecting our interests, not promoting efforts designed to change the narrative about a failing presidency. What the American people want, I think, and what they deserve is a government that really works for us. We need a credible Secretary of State. We need better and fairer trade deals. And we need a military of its leaders who know more about winning battles than giving press conferences. Now, that won't be possible for a while and the Biden team was going to stagger from one embarrassment to the next. But Biden is already losing power. And a new presidential election is less than three years away. So better times are coming. And that's the 'Angle'. Joining me now is David Tafuri, former Obama foreign policy adviser and state department official. David, it's great to have you on tonight.

I think what President Zelensky, the president of Ukraine, is trying to say is that he needs to calm his country. And he wants to make sure that nobody overreacts, because he's still hopeful that diplomacy will win out. You also have to remember the Ukrainian mindset. This isn't new for them. They've been dealing with the threat of Russia, since Russia annexed Crimea in 2014. It's been a gradual escalation of attacks on Ukraine and interference in eastern Ukraine by Russia and Russia's military."

Second point is that Germany refuses to offer any military help. Third thing is they're already negotiating without Biden now. They've been doing negotiating talks with France and Germany and Ukraine and Russia without us even present. So what does that say about faith in Biden?"

      "speaker": "TAFURI",
      "utterance": "I think all of the NATO countries, the U.S. and the UK, and Germany and France, we're all united in our objective, which is we want to make sure that Russia does not invade the territorial integrity of Ukraine. Ukraine is a sovereign country. Now, they're going about it in different ways. But President Biden didn't tell President Macron or the leader of Germany that they shouldn't also be having discussions with Putin. In fact, it's a good thing that each leader is trying to have discussions with Putin--"

Thank you. And late today, we received another disturbing development. This one on the domestic front. The Washington Free Beacon reporting, \"The Biden ATF disclosed to lawmakers that it manages a database of nearly 1 billion firearm purchase records, including both digital and hardcopy versions of these transactions. Congressman Michael cloud warns the ATF's database could be exploited by the Biden administration to surveil American gun owners as it pursues new restrictions on firearms.\" Joining me now, Ohio Congressman Jim Jordan. Congressman, you actually wrote a letter back in November, voicing your concern about this, but this is beyond anything you ever feared even at this point, correct?"

I mean, I - think about this, Hillary Clinton destroyed 30,000 emails while she was under investigation, and now every single gun purchase by a law- abiding American is being preserved. So what? So that the federal government can set up a national database? This is scary stuff, what they've done to our First Amendment rights, and now what they're doing to our Second Amendment liberties. All from one administration, all in a single year. So yes, there's a number of us who are very concerned about this. And this is why we wrote the letter. And frankly, we didn't realize it was quite this number of purchases over the last 20-some years that the federal government is now compiling."

But the digitizing apparently was surprise - a surprise to members of Congress. The government - the Biden administration says, No, we're just keeping the records in West Virginia. I guess that's where they're stored. But given the tendency to surveil Americans and tendency to think the worst of Americans expressing free speech rights, there's an understandable cause for concern."

Then we find out the FBI spying on a presidential campaign, then we learn that there's all kinds of abuses in the FISA process, not just what you and I've talked about, and others have talked about. But the inspector general pointed it out with two separate reports, unbelievable abuses of the FISA process. Then you see just three weeks ago - Joe - in one day, Laura, in one day, we had the President of United States give a speech in Georgia, where he called half the country terrorist and racist. That same day, we learned the FBI and the DOJ have set up a domestic terrorism unit. And that's also the same day we learned that the Department of Education solicited the letter from the School Boards Association. So they would have the pretext to do what they wanted to do, namely go spy on American parents, moms and dads showing up at school board meetings. So that's the context. And now we learn, almost a billion purchases are in this database that is searchable and usable by the government that over the last two years, and you were the first to say this. I remember, in April of 2020, you said when they started this lockdown stuff with COVID, where's this going to go? And look what's happened in the last two years. So that is the context that we have to view all this. And that's what scares us so much, and why we wrote the letter and why we're going to continue to scream and shout about what's going on in this administration."
    },

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Well, Congressman, that means that you're concerned about perhaps, in the future cross referencing this 1 billion purchase.

They didn't even mention COVID. They just said that, the power they have by the general state of emergency declared in March of 2020. Does that surprise you?"

But you know what, the Canadian that - the Canadian citizens, they're awake. The unity is so tight in this country unlike we've ever seen in history. And in trucking - the trucking industry has done, I think, it has done a fabulous job of just bringing the people together. And this whole movement isn't just about the truckers. Basically, it's the trucking industry that's been able to unite the people of this country. And you have to be part of these rallies to see the emotional effects of this whole thing. I've been a part of a number of these rallies. I was part of the big Canada wide trucking convoy just in Manitoba. And you see the people sitting on the sidelines, and it's a really emotional experience. You try to focus on the road as a driver, but if you just turn your head to the side you see these protesters. They're waving and every type of piece of patriotic piece of material they can get their hands on, cheering, jumping, dancing. It's just absolutely incredible."

But the general mass of Canadians, they're just completely done with this narrative and we're just tired of it. We just want our lives back. And most importantly, we just want - we just want to be able to have the right to provide for our families. And that's been ripped away from us, and we're not going to stand for it anymore.

Joining me now is Clay Travis, founder of Outkick and co-host of \"The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show.\" Also with me is Horace Cooper, Project 21 Co- Chair. Clay, NASCAR is an incredibly awesome sport, and great people associated with it, but what is going on with the woke-ification of NASCAR?"

      "utterance": "They're making a bad decision, I think, Laura. And look, this is a delicate dance that many businesses at some point in time try to finagle. They're trying to figure out how do we keep the longtime, diehard NASCAR fans, but also get younger? And instead of trying to appeal to them based on a sports-related angle, they are going with a woke angle. And they'd open headlong into the culture wars. I think it's a really bad decision, because neck ophthalmic NASCAR has been on a downward hill for some time now, Laura. And the way to get everybody back, I think, is by having great, entertaining races and incredible stars to build around. They haven't been able to do that. Instead, they have tried to go the woke route. And look, to the NFL's credit, Laura, they have pretty much abandoned woke sports. Thankfully, colleges never really got into it thankfully. The NBA is pretending that the bubble, and remember all the names on the back of the jerseys, that that never happened. They are hoping that is going to end up in a memory hole. And here is NASCAR sitting around banning things left and right, alienating their audience, and still trying to figure out how to play people. It's not working."

      "utterance": "NASCAR should just act like the SEC acts. That's who we are, and we are part of it. We welcome all people. But Horace, NASCAR's president, who came from the NFL, I believe, tried to claim that they were apolitical, saying \"I think, unfortunately, it speaks to the state of where we are as a country. We do not want to associate ourselves with politics left or right.\" But embracing that noose hoax, and then the \"let's go Brandon\" ex- nay on the deal, I don't know, it doesn't smack of moving to the middle, or even to its fan base. HORACE COOPER, PROJECT 21 CO-CHAIRMAN: As we say down in Texas, you've got to dance with the ones who brought you. And in this case, NASCAR fans have stood with this fantastic sport. If you happen to go to any one of these events, what you're going to see is a really, really raucous crowd, an exciting crowd of people that predominate from the southeast part of the United States of America. Those individuals happen to bring a different set of values that aren't easily crammed in to what we look today as the woke agenda. Clay, I'm not going to take a little bit of difference with you on the NFL. You know my Dallas Cowboys, they are no longer in the Super Bowl hunt."

It is a real turnoff. And for a lot of my friends, it is enough to say, if my boys aren't in it, why are we going to watch it? And I think NASCAR is taking itself in the same direction."
