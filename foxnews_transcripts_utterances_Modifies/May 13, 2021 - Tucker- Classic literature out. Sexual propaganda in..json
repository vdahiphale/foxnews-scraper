      "sentences": "Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON. TONIGHT. Loudoun County, Virginia right outside Washington, D.C. was for a very long time, for generations, a reasonable place. It was orderly and calm. It was well-maintained.  Loudoun County famously worked certainly in contrast to the city nearby, and then two things happened to Loudoun County. First, lots of Federal money flowed in. All those government contracts in Washington made Loudoun County rich. In fact, Loudoun County is now the single richest county in the entire United States.  And that's been a problem because any place you find easy money, you will also inevitably find large numbers of unhappy white liberals, those brittle neurotics with the masks on screaming at everyone else to get in line. Loudoun County has a whole bunch of those people now.  It also has a huge number of immigrants. One out of every four people in Loudoun County was born in another country. Now, in general, most immigrants are not very liberal at all, actually, in fact, many of them have what would now be described as extreme right-wing positions on social issues. If you ever have a chance to ask a Salvadoran what he thinks of transgenderism, it'll make you laugh, probably nervously. You'll look around to see if anyone heard it.  But as a practical matter, it doesn't matter at all what immigrants, what Salvadorans or Pakistanis think of social issues or how they organize their own families. Immigrants vote overwhelmingly for the Democratic Party, and those votes give more power, not to them, but to those unhappy white liberals who want to blow everything up. And that's why -- mystery solved - - a lot of places with high levels of recent immigrants tend to be far more liberal than those immigrants themselves. It's interesting and that's definitely true in Loudoun County, Virginia.  Take a look at the schools if you don't believe it. Loudoun County used to have famously good schools, people wanted to send their kids to those schools. Now those schools are run by lunatics who hate the country. It happened fast, it always does.   Here's a video from a County School Board Meeting just two days ago. The first person you're going to see in this video is a middle school teacher called Andrea Weiskopf. Now, as you watch this, keep in mind that Andrea Weiskopf is actually a middle school teacher. She's not a paid actor. We didn't make her up to prove a point. She is entirely real down to the ostentatiously displayed pronouns in her Twitter bio. Here's Miss Weiskopf explaining how the book \"To Kill a Mockingbird,\" a book the rest of us assumed was all about why racism is bad, is in fact itself racist because it causes something called racial trauma due to the fact there are white people in it.",

You've heard a lot of lectures like this recently from people like Andrea Weiskopf, stupid people telling you what you're allowed to say and read. That's essentially 2021 summed up in a single sentence. The scariest part is, they are telling your kids the exact same thing all day, every day in school. So what effect is that having on your kids? On all of our kids? On the country itself? Well, over time, the effect is unimaginable.  For the last year, most parents who put up with this, either they didn't know it was happening or they felt powerless to stop it from happening. They were afraid to object, to speak up, as lunatics like Andrea Weiskopf hurt their children. But that's changing, finally. Some parents have had enough of this.

Last month, the Department of Education proposed a regulation that directs tax dollars to the race hustlers who traffic in this poison. The administration specifically cited the work of Ibram Kendi, real name Henry Rogers, as well as the entirely fraudulent 1619 Project headed by Nikole Hannah-Jones.   So what are these people like? Well, we're going to show you. This show has just obtained a clip, an event held a few days ago by the Oregon Department of Education.

Low IQ vandals wrecking what they did not built from the very bottom to the very top. They are everywhere. We could give you endless examples. Here's just one because it happened just hours ago.  The State of California has announced its new Mathematics framework for students across the state, our biggest state. One of the authors of this framework is a Stanford Professor called Jo Boaler. Here's how she explained the plan. These are her words, quote: \"I'm very pleased to announce the new Mathematics Framework for California. Some highlights: a strong social justice orientation.\"  \"All students should take the same courses, kindergarten through 10th grade. Viva La Math Revolution.\" Right. Numbers are racist, kill them.  It's lunacy. It's the French Revolution. The stuff is everywhere. Have you ever taken a look at the books that your kids are being assigned in school?

And then -- and forcing children now to see one another as either oppressors or as oppressed.  But we are also -- so we're here as a resource. And we're here to help parents gain the confidence to know that they're not crazy when they feel like something is wrong and their gut is telling them that something is wrong. We are here to help them to -- we're here to help them know what to ask, to teach them, what are these words that they are suddenly hearing constantly? What do they mean? And how do they pin their administration down on defining terms? We are here to teach people how to file Freedom of Information Act requests, so that they can see and connect the dots between what they're suddenly getting in e-mails from their schools, what their children are bringing home and what money is being spent on that?

Yes, I would point to South Lake Texas as a place where we just recently saw some success in the community pushing back.

They are relying on parents staying silent because they don't want to be called the ugly names like a racist, and a transphobe and a bigot.

You don't want to be the smartest person in the room and be wrong.\" Dr. Mitchell then allegedly threatened to write an op-ed in \"The Washington Post\" critical of Dr. Baker's findings. Shortly after the conversation, defense attorneys say Dr. Baker released his final autopsy and sure enough, it said neck compression did contribute to George Floyd's death. The attorneys also claimed that when a former medical Maryland Medical Examiner testified during the Derek Chauvin trial, the George Floyd's death was undetermined.

      "utterance": "Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON. TONIGHT. Loudoun County, Virginia right outside Washington, D.C. was for a very long time, for generations, a reasonable place. It was orderly and calm. It was well-maintained. Loudoun County famously worked certainly in contrast to the city nearby, and then two things happened to Loudoun County. First, lots of Federal money flowed in. All those government contracts in Washington made Loudoun County rich. In fact, Loudoun County is now the single richest county in the entire United States. And that's been a problem because any place you find easy money, you will also inevitably find large numbers of unhappy white liberals, those brittle neurotics with the masks on screaming at everyone else to get in line. Loudoun County has a whole bunch of those people now. It also has a huge number of immigrants. One out of every four people in Loudoun County was born in another country. Now, in general, most immigrants are not very liberal at all, actually, in fact, many of them have what would now be described as extreme right-wing positions on social issues. If you ever have a chance to ask a Salvadoran what he thinks of transgenderism, it'll make you laugh, probably nervously. You'll look around to see if anyone heard it. But as a practical matter, it doesn't matter at all what immigrants, what Salvadorans or Pakistanis think of social issues or how they organize their own families. Immigrants vote overwhelmingly for the Democratic Party, and those votes give more power, not to them, but to those unhappy white liberals who want to blow everything up. And that's why -- mystery solved - - a lot of places with high levels of recent immigrants tend to be far more liberal than those immigrants themselves. It's interesting and that's definitely true in Loudoun County, Virginia. Take a look at the schools if you don't believe it. Loudoun County used to have famously good schools, people wanted to send their kids to those schools. Now those schools are run by lunatics who hate the country. It happened fast, it always does. Here's a video from a County School Board Meeting just two days ago. The first person you're going to see in this video is a middle school teacher called Andrea Weiskopf. Now, as you watch this, keep in mind that Andrea Weiskopf is actually a middle school teacher. She's not a paid actor. We didn't make her up to prove a point. She is entirely real down to the ostentatiously displayed pronouns in her Twitter bio. Here's Miss Weiskopf explaining how the book \"To Kill a Mockingbird,\" a book the rest of us assumed was all about why racism is bad, is in fact itself racist because it causes something called racial trauma due to the fact there are white people in it."

      "utterance": "It's funny how they are so afraid of their children seen another view of sexuality, gender, or religion. If you want to talk about books that are assigned, let's read \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" together. If you aren't willing to consider the racial trauma this assigned book causes black children with its white saviorism, then you have no business discussing any books."

      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Oh, so if you don't consider \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" racist says Andrea Weiskopf, then, quote, \"You have no business discussing any books.\" Can you even imagine what this lady's personal life must be like? Miserable does not even begin to describe it. Desperate, hellish. But if she somehow looks familiar, there's a reason for that. You've heard a lot of lectures like this recently from people like Andrea Weiskopf, stupid people telling you what you're allowed to say and read. That's essentially 2021 summed up in a single sentence. The scariest part is, they are telling your kids the exact same thing all day, every day in school. So what effect is that having on your kids? On all of our kids? On the country itself? Well, over time, the effect is unimaginable. For the last year, most parents who put up with this, either they didn't know it was happening or they felt powerless to stop it from happening. They were afraid to object, to speak up, as lunatics like Andrea Weiskopf hurt their children. But that's changing, finally. Some parents have had enough of this. Watch this mother at this week's Loudoun County School Board meeting."

It is to communicate without deceiving people. Today, we don't need your agreement. We want action and a backbone for what we asked for today, to ban CRT.

Hurting people because of their skin color is the entire point of critical race theory. There is no other point of it. And yet, it is now Federal policy. Last month, the Department of Education proposed a regulation that directs tax dollars to the race hustlers who traffic in this poison. The administration specifically cited the work of Ibram Kendi, real name Henry Rogers, as well as the entirely fraudulent 1619 Project headed by Nikole Hannah-Jones. So what are these people like? Well, we're going to show you. This show has just obtained a clip, an event held a few days ago by the Oregon Department of Education. Nikole Hannah-Jones spoke at that event, along with a Portland State Professor called Ethan Johnson who supposedly chairs the school's Black Studies Department.

Erika Sanzi is the Director of Outreach at Parents Defending Education. We're happy to have her on tonight. Erika, thanks so much for coming on. Tell us what you're trying to do with this group."

Essentially, we're trying to address what we see as an alarming increase in activism in the classroom, in reducing children and staff, actually, to their immutable traits, to focusing on social identities such as their race and their gender. And then -- and forcing children now to see one another as either oppressors or as oppressed. But we are also -- so we're here as a resource. And we're here to help parents gain the confidence to know that they're not crazy when they feel like something is wrong and their gut is telling them that something is wrong. We are here to help them to -- we're here to help them know what to ask, to teach them, what are these words that they are suddenly hearing constantly? What do they mean? And how do they pin their administration down on defining terms? We are here to teach people how to file Freedom of Information Act requests, so that they can see and connect the dots between what they're suddenly getting in e-mails from their schools, what their children are bringing home and what money is being spent on that? So we're really here as a resource for lots of things, and a really important point to make about this is, we are inundated every single day with reports and submissions and documents and screenshots and e-mails from parents across the political spectrum from every single racial group from, every single, you know, socioeconomic class. I have not seen much of anything bipartisan recently, and this is a bipartisan phenomenon that almost feels like a tidal wave."

And I'm not even going to ask you why it's been a year of this before you know, people started to fight back, but I'm just glad it's happening. I am really grateful that it is happening. Last question to you, Erika, have you seen pushback from schools? And how are they responding to this?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SANZI",
      "utterance": "Oh, absolutely. We see pushback from schools all the time. We see them refuse to respond to questions in e-mails. We see them telling parents that they don't even have the right to look at their children's online assignments. We see them refusing to respond. We see them refusing to respond to e- mails, and then we see them kind of, you know, again, shifting the definitions and making people feel like they're going crazy. Because suddenly, when the definition that they're using is shown to be toxic and damaging to children. They will quickly shift. So yes, we are seeing pushback. Now, are there some success stories? Yes, I would point to South Lake Texas as a place where we just recently saw some success in the community pushing back. But it takes courage, and the people that are pushing this in the schools, they are relying on parents feeling intimidated. They are relying on parents staying silent because they don't want to be called the ugly names like a racist, and a transphobe and a bigot. But yet, you have to plow through the name calling because reducing children to their immutable traits, shaming and denigrating them is never acceptable, even when we're talking about really, really complex problems."

It was that dangerous. And the C.D.C., of course, was telling us all to triple mask, which we did, and turned blue from oxygen loss. They were telling people to wear masks outdoors at sporting events and concerts, on your bicycle while jogging. But that's all gone now. Now, we don't need to wear masks.

I have just one question for you, and it's a totally sincere question, as most of the questions on this show are. If you have been vaccinated and more power to you, not against it at all, why are you worried about whether or not other people wear masks?

But the fact is that, this government, this administration has done such a terrible job of selling the vaccine. You have -- you know, the science has not changed for this, you know, miraculous hallelujah moment today, where suddenly, we're told the bleeding obvious, which is that if you're vaccinated, you don't need to wear a mask. But Joe Biden was one of the first people in the country to get vaccinated back in December and he has been clinging to his mask like a security blanket ever since. You know, a couple of weeks ago, he came outside and gave a press conference because the C.D.C. had announced you didn't need to wear a mask outside if you've been vaccinated, and he wore a mask to the podium outside to announce that and, you know, he just sends the message with everything he has done that he does not believe that the vaccines work."

      "utterance": "Hey Tucker. These court documents were filed by attorneys defending former Minneapolis police officer Tou Thao. They claim in May of last year, Hennepin County Medical Examiner Dr. Andrew Baker met with prosecutors and told them his autopsy showed no physical evidence that George Floyd died of asphyxiation. The attorneys allege that a few days later, former D.C. medical examiner Dr. Roger Mitchell called Dr. Baker to complain about his findings saying quoting here, \"Neck compression has to be in the diagnosis.\" Adding quoting again, \"You don't want to be the Medical Examiner who tells everyone they didn't see what they saw. You don't want to be the smartest person in the room and be wrong.\" Dr. Mitchell then allegedly threatened to write an op-ed in \"The Washington Post\" critical of Dr. Baker's findings. Shortly after the conversation, defense attorneys say Dr. Baker released his final autopsy and sure enough, it said neck compression did contribute to George Floyd's death. The attorneys also claimed that when a former medical Maryland Medical Examiner testified during the Derek Chauvin trial, the George Floyd's death was undetermined. Dr. Mitchell also targeted that Medical Examiner wanting his medical license investigated. The Minnesota A.G.'s Office calls the allegations bizarre and says it will respond within a week -- Tucker."

Everyone talks about the AR-15. It is the most popular rifle in America. It's a weapon of war according to Democratic officeholders. But what is it exactly? You never hear anybody tell you or take an honest look at it. We did our best to do that. Here's part of the latest episode."

Breathing matters, your stance matters, your trigger control matters. Where if you can pick up an AR platform. This is where my pistol grip is, my hand is generally going to go here. It's a much more intuitive platform."

And it's your range, the Hickok45 range. And if you have an internet connection, the internet is a large appliance basically that brings information into your home. You're familiar with this range if we can just get a shot of this. I swear most of our viewers have seen this many times before. But this is the Hickok45 range.

Again that episode is up tonight in the latest episode of \"Tucker Carlson Originals.\" And of course Episode 2 on the green energy scam is already up, destroying the environment to save the environment. That's on FOX Nation as well. So some people are choosing not to take the coronavirus vaccine and that's bothering the politicians in charge of convincing them to get it so the new plan is to bribe them rather than explaining why the vaccine is good, probably pretty easy case to make, they've decided that you're so dumb, that only by paying you can they get you to take the medicine. Bill de Blasio, of course, has the single dumbest idea. It's amazing if you haven't seen it. Stay tuned."

You don't have to pay anyone extra to move from say Newark to Naples because it's an obvious upgrade. And yet, across the country, rather than explaining why the coronavirus vaccine might be a good idea, its merits, you're seeing politicians decide they will bribe the dummies they govern to take their medicine. In Ohio, for example, Governor Mike DeWine has started a million dollar lottery that's only open to people who have been vaccinated. Oh, that's not patronizing or ridiculous. We asked Mike DeWine if he would come on tonight and explain, but he was busy and couldn't. In New York City, of course, they're doing it. Bill de Blasio runs New York City still. Bill de Blasio smokes a ton of weed so he sees everything from a stoner's point of view. I'm Bill de Blasio. I'm so high I can't think straight what would I want? Needless to say, Bill de Blasio has teamed up with Shake Shack to give free fries to anyone who's been vaccinated. Actually, it's not really free. We read the fine print the maximum savings are $3.09. But when your high details like that go over your head. To pitch the program, Bill de Blasio ate fries. We can prove it."

I mean, you may agree with him or not, but Trump told the truth there. And so does Bill de Blasio. Chadwick Moore tells the truth. He is a columnist for \"The Spectator\" and we're happy to have him. Chadwick Moore, thanks so much. So I just heard mostly heard in my earpiece, Bill de Blasio eating fries, and pardon the expression, but a very moist wet -- it made me never want to take an Advil. You're doing it too, man. You're killing me. CHADWICK MOORE, COLUMNIST, \"THE SPECTATOR\": Well, we all have that stoned roommate in college who ate fast food for breakfast, and now he just happens to be the chief executive of the nation's largest city. I don't really think it's a big deal. He's a very busy guy. That's why he has got to eat. But what I do think is sort of concerning and really hypocritical. As I remember, President Trump hosts the football team at the White House. And excuse me, he served McDonald's and the media was saying that's classist and racist. So I don't know who de Blasio thinks he is trying to entice with the fast food but, it seems a little bizarre. I mean, all the people, the rich white liberals with their \"I got vaccinated\" stickers on Instagram. I don't really think that they're eating at Shake Shack anytime soon."

It's obviously a good idea for a lot of people to take it. But to encourage everyone to take it, including people who don't want to by trying to bribe them, rather than just explain why they should and make a reasonable case as you would with adults, but they're treating people like plebes, like they have total contempt for the people they govern, and I'm including Mike DeWine in this, why are they treating the public like this?"

They think -- you know, well, first of all, they said, you've got to do it and these sort of totalitarians, they get really mad when you do the things they tell you to.

And it was like 78 percent, according to C.D.C. of people who are hospitalized with COVID were obese. So why are they encouraging -- I don't think that population should really be eating more fast food. I'm not a doctor. But, you know, the C.D.C. isn't really talking about that. Instead, they're talking about how racism is a public health crisis. So, I don't really know."

He runs over 400 Kwik Fill and Country Fair gas stations across the states of New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio and elsewhere on the East Coast. So he's got reason to think a lot about this subject. He joins us tonight. John, thanks so much for coming on. I appreciate it. So how can we prevent something this disruptive from happening again?"

      "utterance": "We need more agents, more technicians to do I.T. I suggested -- I was with senators -- a few senators before I suggested starting a West Point type situation where we train experts, cyber people and call it the new Cyber Force. This is the 21st Century. We're fighting different types of wars. We're fighting -- we have Space Force now. We need Cyber Force to fight the wars with so cyberattacks. Last year, our companies paid $7 billion in Bitcoins to get the codes back to reopen up their computers. And right now, I don't understand Bitcoin and cryptocurrency, it seems like to be the thing of criminals and terrorists because that's how they conduct themselves. This week, it happened with the Colonial Pipeline. Next week, it may happen with the electric grid. But we have to put a stop to it. We need better technicians, we have to start a university like we have West Point for the Army, or Annapolis for the Navy, and be able to train our people and they stay with us for five years in that -- in a government job because we're losing trained people that are going off to -- if our government is paying him $100,000.00 a year, $150,000.00 a year, Google or Facebook or Twitter is gobbling them up for $300,000.00 a year. So our companies are lacking the proper people to run the companies and it happened with Colonial Pipeline. After three or four days, they realized they couldn't break the codes. So what did they do? Well, you've got to get it moving again. Because the whole East Coast needed gasoline, they were running out of gasoline, so you have to bite the bullet, pay the $2.00 and then catch the crooks later. But you've got to go on. The company has to go on. The city has to go on. Our country has to go on."

You can shut down an entire country and there is nothing that's not vulnerable to that kind of attack, obviously. I think you can make a really strong point."
