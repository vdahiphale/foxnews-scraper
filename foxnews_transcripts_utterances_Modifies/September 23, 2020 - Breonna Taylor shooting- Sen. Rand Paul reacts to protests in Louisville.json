Today, we heard from doctors Fauci, Redfield and Giroir. Admiral Giroir  will join us later on the show. So, stick around for that in just a few moments.

One of the officers involved was indicted on charges of wanton endangerment for bullets that were fired from his weapon that went into the nearby  apartment, not Taylor's apartment, but another apartment that night. So,  the fact that the grand jury did not charge any of the three officers who exchanged fire in her apartment in her death has led to some difficult  moments on the streets of Louisville tonight.",

      "sentences": "Good evening, Martha. We're in the heart  of downtown Louisville right now. This is Jefferson Park, which over the past weeks and months has served as ground zero, not only for a memorial  for Breonna Taylor, but also for demonstrators. Right now, hundreds, maybe a thousand demonstrators were out. There's actually some small fires   burning here right now. People have been chanting Black Lives Matter chants  and profanities against police. It looks like this group is likely going to march. They've already kind of moved around a little bit. We'll keep you updated on that. Of course, the   big news this evening, none of the three officers involved in the shooting death of Breonna Taylor were charged with murder. One former officer, Detective Brett Hankinson, was charged with three counts of wanton   endangerment, a much lesser charge.  People here are not happy with that decision and protesters are out in the streets. Kentucky's Attorney General, Daniel Cameron, also revealing some  key findings of his office's investigation. Cameron says evidence shows that the officers knocked and denounced at Breonna Taylor's apartment. It  was not a no-knock warrant. The attorney general says that was corroborated  by an independent witness.  The Kentucky Attorney General's office also concluding that two out of three officers involved in Taylor's shooting death were authorized to use  force because they were fired at first by Breonna Taylor's boyfriend, Kenneth Walker. Police say, Kenneth Walker told police he fired first because he thought intruders were breaking in. Breonna Taylor's family and attorney had been demanding that all of the  officers get at least second-degree manslaughter. That has not happened.  And Kentucky's Attorney General says he is a black man speaking on behalf of the entire investigation, as a black man he understands how painful this is for the black community. He says twice today that criminal law is not  always meant to respond to what he calls a tragedy. He also says, representatives of his office have taken a lot of criticism and scrutiny. He says that scrutiny in many ways was misplaced because there was not a day that people in his office didn't go to sleep thinking   about this case. Also, the attorney general today did not reveal the makeup of that grand jury, the age and race of the grand jury. He says this case is too sensitive right now to reveal that. Also, he says he's launching a task force to investigate the process of  obtaining a search warrant here in Kentucky. And again Martha, there's a couple of fires just kind of burning out of control right now.",

However, it's a high-risk raid going in after midnight looking for possession of drugs. And I think it's not worth losing the life of a police officer or someone inside the house. So, I'm just not in favor of doing this in search of drug possession. I don't think it's worth the loss of life. With regard to Louisville, though, I'm kind of saddened to see the fires. I  hope we can begin to heal on this. I've been calling for weeks for the National Guard to be out. I think the governor has not taken that seriously. I hope there will be enough National Guard to prevent the destruction downtown in Louisville. It's a great city. And I hope it doesn't catch on fire more than what we see so far.",

I've introduced federal  legislation also to get rid of no-knock raids to try to prevent some tragedy like this from happening again. So, I think we are responding in a way. The specific details, I can't judge guilt or innocence. And ultimately, this isn't the end. This is the beginning. A jury will have to decide that. But those details are best left to a jury without politicians and everybody else weighing in on guilt or innocence. But I don't want this to happen  again.

The highest death rate in the world is in New York. 1700 deaths per million. The U.S. average about 500. The average are actually about 600 now. The average in Sweden, about 570. But on the question of herd immunity, they're dismissive of this. But I'm sending over to Dr. Fauci, so he can read a little bit on this in Science magazine, in August, three mathematicians came out with the idea that because an infection - transmission of infections and immunity seem to be concentrated in younger people, they seem to catch this faster and be more active and out in public more than it actually skews the formulas on herd immunity and would allow herd immunity at a much lower rate. The other thing from the John Hopkins website, you see is New York's having no new incidents and no new deaths. Now he wants to say, oh, it's because everybody's washing their hands. I don't believe that. I think they're washing their hands in April, we still had all these deaths. So, there's something going on and I can't say with certainty, but over the next couple of months, if there is no significant surge again, without a vaccine in New York, it will look like herd immunity. That's what it looks like in Sweden right now. And it looks like this around the world when people have had a significant surge, they're not getting a second surge. And there are mathematicians who have looked at the formula on herd immunity in the August edition of Science Journal. And they actually say, you know what, herd immunity may come much lower than some of these experts think.",

      "utterance": "Good evening, Martha. We're in the heart of downtown Louisville right now. This is Jefferson Park, which over the past weeks and months has served as ground zero, not only for a memorial for Breonna Taylor, but also for demonstrators. Right now, hundreds, maybe a thousand demonstrators were out. There's actually some small fires burning here right now. People have been chanting Black Lives Matter chants and profanities against police. It looks like this group is likely going to march. They've already kind of moved around a little bit. We'll keep you updated on that. Of course, the big news this evening, none of the three officers involved in the shooting death of Breonna Taylor were charged with murder. One former officer, Detective Brett Hankinson, was charged with three counts of wanton endangerment, a much lesser charge. People here are not happy with that decision and protesters are out in the streets. Kentucky's Attorney General, Daniel Cameron, also revealing some key findings of his office's investigation. Cameron says evidence shows that the officers knocked and denounced at Breonna Taylor's apartment. It was not a no-knock warrant. The attorney general says that was corroborated by an independent witness. The Kentucky Attorney General's office also concluding that two out of three officers involved in Taylor's shooting death were authorized to use force because they were fired at first by Breonna Taylor's boyfriend, Kenneth Walker. Police say, Kenneth Walker told police he fired first because he thought intruders were breaking in. Breonna Taylor's family and attorney had been demanding that all of the officers get at least second-degree manslaughter. That has not happened. And Kentucky's Attorney General says he is a black man speaking on behalf of the entire investigation, as a black man he understands how painful this is for the black community. He says twice today that criminal law is not always meant to respond to what he calls a tragedy. He also says, representatives of his office have taken a lot of criticism and scrutiny. He says that scrutiny in many ways was misplaced because there was not a day that people in his office didn't go to sleep thinking about this case. Also, the attorney general today did not reveal the makeup of that grand jury, the age and race of the grand jury. He says this case is too sensitive right now to reveal that. Also, he says he's launching a task force to investigate the process of obtaining a search warrant here in Kentucky. And again Martha, there's a couple of fires just kind of burning out of control right now."

However, it's a high-risk raid going in after midnight looking for possession of drugs. And I think it's not worth losing the life of a police officer or someone inside the house. So, I'm just not in favor of doing this in search of drug possession. I don't think it's worth the loss of life. With regard to Louisville, though, I'm kind of saddened to see the fires. I hope we can begin to heal on this. I've been calling for weeks for the National Guard to be out. I think the governor has not taken that seriously. I hope there will be enough National Guard to prevent the destruction downtown in Louisville. It's a great city. And I hope it doesn't catch on fire more than what we see so far."

The FBI also did an investigation and those findings were made available to this grand jury. But what do you say to people in Louisville tonight who are upset with what even led up to them being at that apartment and feel that it was a situation that got out of control and that there's nothing being done to fix that? I know you've tried to address that, but what would you say to them tonight to these people who are obviously very upset?"

I've introduced federal legislation also to get rid of no-knock raids to try to prevent some tragedy like this from happening again. So, I think we are responding in a way. The specific details, I can't judge guilt or innocence. And ultimately, this isn't the end. This is the beginning. A jury will have to decide that. But those details are best left to a jury without politicians and everybody else weighing in on guilt or innocence. But I don't want this to happen again. And I am working hard to try to make sure these are federal law; local law prevents this from happening."

      "speaker": "PAUL",

The highest death rate in the world is in New York. 1700 deaths per million. The U.S. average about 500. The average are actually about 600 now. The average in Sweden, about 570. But on the question of herd immunity, they're dismissive of this. But I'm sending over to Dr. Fauci, so he can read a little bit on this in Science magazine, in August, three mathematicians came out with the idea that because an infection - transmission of infections and immunity seem to be concentrated in younger people, they seem to catch this faster and be more active and out in public more than it actually skews the formulas on herd immunity and would allow herd immunity at a much lower rate. The other thing from the John Hopkins website, you see is New York's having no new incidents and no new deaths. Now he wants to say, oh, it's because everybody's washing their hands. I don't believe that. I think they're washing their hands in April, we still had all these deaths. So, there's something going on and I can't say with certainty, but over the next couple of months, if there is no significant surge again, without a vaccine in New York, it will look like herd immunity. That's what it looks like in Sweden right now. And it looks like this around the world when people have had a significant surge, they're not getting a second surge. And there are mathematicians who have looked at the formula on herd immunity in the August edition of Science Journal. And they actually say, you know what, herd immunity may come much lower than some of these experts think."

I don't know if the whole committee will vote for it, but I'm sending the report tomorrow to the Department of Justice and we're asking for a criminal referral.

There have been a number of different events where the CDC guidance has been changed, in the next 24, 48 hours. And I think that has led to a lot of head scratching and people wondering what's going on with that. There was a story that said that basically that the guidelines that had been put together were too strict. They started calling for more than six feet and social distance. And the report said that the White House basically shot it down and said this isn't going out. And then we saw the backpedaling. Can you clarify that?"

And the first thing with the testing guidance, I did mean what I said to Senator Murray today, that the CDC's guidance never said don't test asymptomatic individuals. In fact, we're doing everything we can to improve testing of asymptomatic individuals. But it's important to have that with some degree of public health knowledge, because if you test negative today, it doesn't mean you won't be negative tomorrow.

So, look, Martha, if I just got exposed and I went and isolated in my apartment for 14 days, I didn't see anyone. I stayed there. Do I need a test? I really don't need a test. I'm not going to expose anyone. I'm not sick. But what we saw was the guidance was misinterpreted. It was misrepresented. And we saw all kinds of ill activity stemming from that. The CDC Director, Dr. Redfield, clarified it the next day. And as it kept getting misrepresented and it started propagating, he decided to update the guidance and clarified even more. There's nothing more than that."

Have you ever been in that situation?"

I've never been told by the president to stop testing or to change a guidance or to alter the facts. It just doesn't happen like that. Every task force meeting opens with Dr. Birx looking at all the evidence. What is the epidemiology? It's typically followed by Dr. Fauci. And then it goes through all the different docs and policy areas. So, it's very evidence based, very data driven. I don't feel pressured.

And we do need to follow it. It can resolve completely, or it could lead to arrhythmias or poor heart function. So, we do need to follow it. We need to get more data.

So that spike comes after Portland's mayor, Ted Wheeler, who's also the police commissioner, disbanded their city's task force team in charge of keeping gun violence down in the city. They also slashed the budget of the police by $15 million. So then after those two actions, you have seen a surge in violence. So, the president of the Portland Police Association, Daryl Turner, joins me now. Mr. Turner, thank you very much for being here.

And so, in a city of Portland, July 1st, they disbanded our gun violence reduction team whose presence in the nation for the work that they did. And immediately shootings went up. Homicides went up over higher than it's ever been in a 30-year period for the month of July. August was also a record month, and September is becoming another record month for shooting."

      "speaker": "COONS",
      "utterance": "Well, two things. I would be pointing out to her that it's never happened that this close to an election, just 41 days before an election when half of the states in our country are already voting for president, that a president has moved forward with filling that seat. President Abraham Lincoln is one of just two that had a vacancy this close to the election and he declined to fill that seat. But I would also tell her that whoever that successor is, is going to preside over some very important decisions. As you know just a week after the election, the Supreme Court will hear the Affordable Care Act case and nothing, nothing could more put Ginsburg's -- excuse me -- Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's legacy on the record like the Affordable Care Act."
    },

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

She was a fighter for gender equity and the Affordable Care Act protects every woman in America against discrimination based on being a woman. And in the middle of a pandemic, President Trump and the 18 states that are suing in the Supreme Court are trying to take away healthcare protections from half of all Americans."

      "utterance": "-- that you would make to a president Hillary Clinton that it was a desperate situation and she should fill that seat if she had the ability to do so. I want to ask you about, you know, there's already, we don't know who the nominee is going to be, but Amy Coney Barrett's name is definitely at the top of the list it would appear. We know that the president is meeting with Barbara Lagoa on Friday as well. You are a Christian man, you are a graduate of Yale Divinity School, do you believe that a person's faith is fair game for questions in these hearings?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "COONS",
      "utterance": "There is no and should be no religious test for serving in the United States, that's in our Constitution. And I think we should conduct our questioning of nominees in front of us in a respectful but appropriate way as we can. My concern here is that we shouldn't be moving forward with hearings at all, and so frankly I'm more concerned with the damage that racing through a partisan confirmation just 41 days before the election will do to the court, to our Senate, and to our country. What I hear from Delawareans, Martha, is if we've still got 40 days why aren't we moving ahead with the COVID relief package? Several major CEOs just today came out and said, dedicate your time to a COVID relief package to those negotiations?"

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "-- and would love to see that accomplished as well. But I want to go back to this question of faith in these hearings, because I think it is likely to come up. Because Senator Feinstein when she was speaking with Judge Barrett in the past, she brought up her Catholicism and she said that she was -- that the dogma lived deeply within her and she looked very concerned about that. She is the ranking Democrat member on your committee. Do you have confidence that she is not going to raise that, as you just said, it should not be a factor this time around?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "COONS",
      "utterance": "Look, I have a lot of respect for Senator Feinstein and for her leadership of our caucus on the -- our committee. I'm going to be urging my colleagues to first make it clear, Democrats to Republicans, as Joe Biden did in the campaign remarks that you just played it, that we should be stepping back from this abyss. That we shouldn't be having these confirmation hearings just two weeks from now, that doesn't give us enough time to thoroughly research the opinions, the writings of whoever might be nominated. That's why we shouldn't be racing ahead in this very limited period of time. But in general, as you know, Martha, I'm someone who as the co-chair of the National Prayer Breakfast has tried to bring forward a respectful tone here in Washington, and our deliberations at all times, that's not always easy in this divided Congress in this divided nation. But I think moving ahead with this confirmation this close to the election in direct violation of the president set by the majority four years ago will simply further divide us."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "All right. I want to ask you one more thing before I go. Because you have called for an investigation into the John Durham investigation, which I would point out is an investigation into the investigation, into the Russia issue, which the Mueller team investigated for two years. And that does raise some questions, especially since we don't even have a Durham report yet to criticize or to potentially investigate."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "COONS",

This is the scene on Black Lives Matter plaza I believe is where they are in Washington, D.C. this evening. This is an area and has seen a lot of gatherings over the course of the last several months and it was an area where there was also some breaking up windows and things along those lines a while back. So, we are watching all these situations across the country. The reaction to this very significant decision in the Breonna Taylor case, we are going to have more on that when we come back."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "We are keeping an eye on increasing protest this evening in large cities across the country, you can see them in these four live shots that we have after the grand jury in Louisville, Kentucky decided not to charge the police officers there with the death of Breonna Taylor. One of the three detectives involved in this case was indicted on three counts of wanton endangerment, but that had to do with the firing of his weapon into a nearby apartment in the midst of the chaos that wasn't suing at Taylor's apartment. In Louisville about one hour from now, a country -- countywide, I should say, curfew will go into effect and that is where Jeff Paul joins us tonight on the street there. Good evening, Jeff."

      "speaker": "JEFF PAUL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Hi, Martha. Getting a little hectic here in downtown Louisville after a pretty much peaceful day of protest. You can see a trash can has been set on fire out here with some things thrown in here. We've seen a few others set on fire. This is probably the largest one, but really the only main, sort of, we want to call it property damage that we have seen. Firework there that just exploded. And that's something we see from time to time, there it is protest that use fireworks. I'm pretty sure that was a firework, I don't think that was a bomb of any kind of sort but nonetheless, you never know what's going to happen out of this protest. And just to kind of rerack what happened today. That decision came down and after a few hours of people marching in the streets the police started pushing some of the people who were out here back. But they are back in downtown and you can see there's a few fires going right now. And as always with fires, you never know what's in it. And in this -- in this situation it looks like there was a firework. You know, the police have just showed up. Martha?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "All right, Jeff Paul, somebody putting an incendiary into a garbage can on the street there and it exploded just a few feet of way from where Jeff is covering the story. He has covered a lot of the stories over the course of the summer. And, you know, Jeff, can you give me any sense of who is around you and how organized this group is?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAUL",
      "utterance": "Yes, it's really hard to tell, and you know, people obviously very spirited about what's going on out here. We just had an explosion actually, so from one thing to another you have an explosion and you have people out here singing Breonna Taylor's name. Yes, it's hard to tell really how organized it is right now, especially with some of these fires that have been lit here. I don't think the people who are down here to memorialize Breonna Taylor were exactly involved in that sort of behavior. That's not what we saw with the people who are passionately marching throughout the street. But nonetheless, when it gets dark that's when you really start to see some of this kind of behavior happening and as we get closer to that curfew, that 9 p.m. curfew, we might see some more of it. Martha?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Obviously, that is what we have seen, the implementation of curfews after dark to try to calm things down and that is still an hour away from kicking into effect. What is the police presence there, Jeff, in terms of implanting that in an hour and any way of telling whether or not they are going to be able to do that, whether or not people will cooperate?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAUL",
      "utterance": "It's really hard to tell because when you walk down here you have police on the perimeters. Like if you take a look over here you can see there's some red and blue flashing lights. Just up into the distance, they have some of these dump trucks that are set up here to stop cars from coming down here. But if you take a look where most of these protests have started, this is Jefferson Square Park and these fires are burning now, I don't see one police officer inside. That's not saying they're not in the area and they're not -- just letting that kind of burn out and fizzle out. But you get a little outside and you start getting closer to like, the mayor's house or some of the bigger buildings, that's where you really start to see the police presence."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "yes. Did they stop, when I heard you on earlier today, Jeff, you were saying that the protests which we saw in the afternoon after the decision was moving towards the mayor's house. Did that happened, did they go down there? Was that all -- did that all go peacefully?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAUL",
      "utterance": "Yes. Well, they marched for about three, three and a half miles and we were right there with them. And once they got about a half a mile away from the mayor's house, that's when police just sort of put their stakes in the ground and said you can't get any closer. And the police then started pushing them back. The majority of the protesters ended up moving back. But if you kind of stayed back and you saw probably about a dozen people who ended up with zip ties in their arms behind their back and they were taken off in process. But after that that was really the main clash between police and protesters. Since then we really haven't seen anything else other than these fires down here and the occasional person just kind of doing a burnout with the motorcycle or something like that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "It's just remarkable how many cities we have seen. It's like, you almost get used to seeing fires in American cities and we've witnessed so much of it and you've covered so much of it for us the course of the summer. Thank you very much. Good to see you tonight. Jeff Paul, thank you."

Sir, thank you very much, Mr. Washington. Glad to have you with us this evening."

      "speaker": "WASHINGTON",
      "utterance": "You know, when the decision came down, we were holding hope and thinking that perhaps there was going to be some responsibility placed on these officers for the death of Breonna Taylor. But when we heard the decision being read out to the public it was quite disappointing because what we have now is, no one is going to be held responsible for the death of Breonna Taylor. And I think that's why we've seen the public outcry in Louisville and that's why I think we've been hearing the disappointment being raised by people throughout this country."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yes. You know, there are two aspects in this case in a way that I have heard discussed today. One is what happened before the police officers even showed up at Breonna Taylor's apartment, why they were there, and the warrant, and you know, whether it was not no knock or not announced. Then you have what happened after they burst down that door to her apartment. And the finding as Daniel Cameron presented it, the attorney general, was that the fatal bullet that struck Breonna Taylor was in -- was fired in self-defense because her boyfriend had fired his gun, his weapon first. That was the finding of the grand jury. What do you -- what do you say to that? I mean, a grand jury evaluated all this evidence and that's what they found."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WASHINGTON",
      "utterance": "One of the things, Martha, that we have big problems with, obviously what goes on in a grand jury proceeding is secret so we really don't know how a case is presented to the grand jury. We also know that these no-knock warrants have been very dangerous procedures. There is a lot of controversy because in one instance we are hearing that it was being executed as a no-knock warrants and in another instance, we are hearing that it was being executed as a knock and announce. So, there are lots of facts in this case that are still sketchy, there are a number of witnesses from my understanding who said that they did not hear the police officer announce themselves."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yes, I hear that too."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WASHINGTON",
      "utterance": "So, with the disputes that we have with these facts and just a testimony of Mr. Walker himself, we just felt that there was just enough evidence that was presented to make a jury, to have a jury decide this case and not be stopped at the grand jury level."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yes. We saw in the Rodney King case that at the federal level later on they did find, they did press and guilty charges in that case. Daryl Washington, thank you very much. As we watch these scenes tonight, we are grateful for your input. Thank you, sir. Good to have you with us."
