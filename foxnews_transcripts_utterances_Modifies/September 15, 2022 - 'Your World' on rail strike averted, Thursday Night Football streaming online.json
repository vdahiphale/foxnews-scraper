We are all over it with Edward Lawrence at the White House, where that deal was struck, Jeff Flock in Philadelphia on if the rank-and-file will follow up, and Labor Secretary Marty Walsh, the man who helped get it all done in the first place. Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto. So much going on, this deal that could have been a disaster for the U.S. economy. That doesn't mean, as I said, it's a done deal, but it's closer to a done deal. And the vote is on. Jacqui Heinrich at the White House with the very latest -- Jacqui. Oh, Edward Lawrence.",

Attendance modifications, attendance policy modifications, what are they? At this point, we don't know. They get one extra paid day of leave. That's all we know. What else is out there? No hikes on their co-pays or deductibles for health care and $1,000-a-year bonus. That's kind of nice, too. But I will tell you, talking to some of these people, they really feel they have been taken advantage of over the course of the past couple of years without a raise, continuing to work long, on call at times, shifts.

So, they have been working with a wage from three years ago. And this was -- if they had done a negotiation and got it done in time, you would have seen that increase happen across the board. So, that 14 percent is for the last two years. That's where that increase comes from. And, again, I think this is a good contract. You're looking at -- the companies have done really well in the last couple of years here in the United States of America. The workers have worked really hard. They have worked through a pandemic. They have kept our supply chains moving forward. And what we have to do is respect our workers, quite honestly. And I think that that's what this contract shows. And the carriers were at the table last night, and they stated that. The unions were at the table last night. They stated that. And at the end of the -- at the end of this all, we -- everyone walked away feeling in a good position. And the president talked about it today.

Steve Moore on that part of the story. Steven, I apologize that was not included here. But the gist of that was, no, we don't think that this is something that other unions will do. It's a different case for different groups. Do you agree with that? Now, this has generous provisions, but, again, some of these are backdated. I get that.

It reminded me a little bit, the last time I have seen pay increases like that, you know what it was? The late 1970s, when you had the high inflation. And I will never -- I will never forget, there was a very famous story of the United Auto Workers signing I think it was like a three year deal for a 25 percent pay increase. And it turned out they lost money, because inflation was so high over that period, that they -- the wages just couldn't keep pass -- keep pace with the higher prices.

We have got brand-new FOX News polls coming out at 6:00, and we will see if that's still the top issue. It has been for months, and abortion has crept up certainly following the Dobbs decision, after the leak and the decision becoming official. Democrats have made a lot of gains on this issue. They say that it's helped them in special elections. They think it'll help them in the fall as well. So now comes, two weeks out from the midterms -- or -- excuse me -- two months out from the midterms Senator Lindsey Graham, who has always been a pro-life advocate and many times has introduced a 20-week ban. He now is coming forward with a 15-week ban. Now, previously, he and many other Republicans have said abortion should be a state issue. And that's what happened when Roe got overturned. It was back to the states. So, now for him to show up with a 15-week ban at the federal level is raising a lot of eyebrows and questions. No doubt, the left, the Democrats are going to be against that. But there are those on the right saying, huh, this timing is a little curious. It seems some of those in Republican leadership in the Senate seemed a little caught off guard by the fact that this is coming forward at this point. I have talked to folks within the pro-life communities who say, well, of course, we're going to support it. That's what we're about, but we feel like the timing could have been better. He's my exclusive guest on \"FOX News Sunday.\" So I will ask him all those questions and more -- Neil.",

And, as a Republican, I'm one of the very few I think that have leaned into this issue. This is an issue in my district. It's an issue in my state. I think it's an issue across the country. It's not the number one issue. But, in many districts across the country, it's the second, third or fourth, certainly top three to top five issue. And it's something that I think we should be able to communicate with people about, because there's no -- there's no consensus on abortion for any reason up until birth, just like there's no consensus for outlawing every single abortion. And coming up with solutions, either in state legislatures or in Congress, finding that center middle ground, trying to find common ground is a place where we can start. It's an issue that I have been talking about extensively since overturning Roe, trying to find where we can bring people together, so that both sides don't continue to use it to fund-raise and to use it to their advantage in campaign season.

And Senator Graham's legislation actually wouldn't have an impact on the state of South Carolina, because South Carolina's legislation and bills that have been signed into law are more restrictive. And I don't believe his legislation, reading it firsthand, would have an impact there. But I do believe that we do need to have a message that's compassionate, showing compassion to women and girls who've been raped, who are victims of incest, that we're not going to leave them behind and, in states where they are banning abortion, that we ensure that every woman has access to contraception. In my state of South Carolina, we have women in rural counties and rural areas where there's not a single OB-GYN doctor. And so we need to be thinking, I think, very pragmatically. There's no -- it's not mutually exclusive. I think you can protect women's rights and protect the right to life together.

But they say they haven't had a raise in a couple of years as they negotiated this contract. So maybe it's not as much as you think. Attendance modifications, attendance policy modifications, what are they? At this point, we don't know. They get one extra paid day of leave. That's all we know. What else is out there? No hikes on their co-pays or deductibles for health care and $1,000-a-year bonus. That's kind of nice, too. But I will tell you, talking to some of these people, they really feel they have been taken advantage of over the course of the past couple of years without a raise, continuing to work long, on call at times, shifts. This may not be enough for some people. Some people have said they are going to strike or they're going to vote against it if they don't have to enough of an improvement in their quality of life -- Neil."

And then there was several issues last night. A lot of it's language. It was about getting into the weeds on language. And when you -- when you're in negotiation and you're down to the last several items, it always seems to be the longest to get it resolved. And I think a lot of it was passing paper back and forth. But what I was doing is walking back and forth between the rooms, making sure both sides were staying and talking. Leading up to yesterday, a lot of it was done in person, but through computers. And I -- yesterday morning, when I -- when everyone came in the office, I said, I want to get an agreement before we leave here today. And with the help of both sides, we were able to get an agreement done."

So, those were not new developments, but a 24 percent pay increase by 2024, an immediate 14 percent pay increase, like now, $1,000 annual bonuses for the next five years. Someone's going to have to pay for that. I'm just wondering whether it's going to turn up in higher shipping costs, higher product prices for Americans."

      "speaker": "WALSH",

So, they have been working with a wage from three years ago. And this was -- if they had done a negotiation and got it done in time, you would have seen that increase happen across the board. So, that 14 percent is for the last two years. That's where that increase comes from. And, again, I think this is a good contract. You're looking at -- the companies have done really well in the last couple of years here in the United States of America. The workers have worked really hard. They have worked through a pandemic. They have kept our supply chains moving forward. And what we have to do is respect our workers, quite honestly. And I think that that's what this contract shows. And the carriers were at the table last night, and they stated that. The unions were at the table last night. They stated that. And at the end of the -- at the end of this all, we -- everyone walked away feeling in a good position. And the president talked about it today. It's about making sure that we continue to move our freight around the country and we continue to respect our workers that move that freight."

And we're going to continue to work. I'm working on supply chain issues.

I regret that was not in this thing. But you can go ahead to our FOX Business Web site to see exactly how he explains the math and it will not lead to higher prices or other unions trying to seize on this and say, what you did for them, we want you to do for us. Steve Moore on that part of the story. Steven, I apologize that was not included here. But the gist of that was, no, we don't think that this is something that other unions will do. It's a different case for different groups. Do you agree with that? Now, this has generous provisions, but, again, some of these are backdated. I get that. But if I'm another union, private or public, I'm looking at this and say, well, that's a good start. What do you think?"

It reminded me a little bit, the last time I have seen pay increases like that, you know what it was? The late 1970s, when you had the high inflation. And I will never -- I will never forget, there was a very famous story of the United Auto Workers signing I think it was like a three year deal for a 25 percent pay increase. And it turned out they lost money, because inflation was so high over that period, that they -- the wages just couldn't keep pass -- keep pace with the higher prices. So we're in this spiral right now, Neil, where prices go up, so then labor -- the wages have to go up, and then the prices go up."

They were met with compassion. We're a community and a nation that is stronger because of immigrants.\" But, again, by just calling them immigrants and not illegal at the face of it, that gets maybe to the core of the problem no one's distinguishing.

And they talk about all this, and the spokeswoman for the White House talks about compassion and all this stuff. But, in reality, the inhumane side, it comes from the fact that the administration has provided a completely open border. And we have turned over our responsibility and -- of our border over to the cartels and the Mexican government. And they're enslaving these people, because when these people get off these buses, they're not just free to go wherever they want and live their life. They still owe money to the cartels. And most of these people are going to have to go off to where it was they were assigned, and they're going to have to go into indentured servitude. We're importing a peon class and putting them into slavery right here in the United States. Obviously, the administration and their talking heads took a really good point from Joseph Goebbels, who said that even a lie becomes the truth if you tell it enough times.

So, if they don't recognize these migrants as anything less than illegal, and they have seen them as illegal, therein lies the problem, right? That tells you they don't see it as a problem, two million migrants trying to get into this country, that they don't see that as an issue. They're not illegal. They're immigrants.

There's nobody there. Out of all the -- I went over 950 miles the other day driving home from Nogales, and I found one checkpoint that was manned. And there was only one person in the checkpoint. And he was just waving people through, because what's he going to do. With a line of 1,000 cars down the highway, what's the one Border Patrol agent there going to do?

Now, if you're looking at the two million-plus that are getting into this country illegally, and lumping them in with just as illegal immigrants who should be treated the same, you have got a serious math problem. But, beyond that, you have got a serious crisis, because you're more or less saying that this inflow of people coming into the country, they are just immigrants, not anything illegal about them. So do you like it when Texas is dealing with this on its own and you don't address it, or do you only start worrying about it when Texas is busing those same migrants, legal immigrants to you, and now you're upset about it? We are all over that after this and also over the ongoing long goodbye."

That is the passing of Queen Elizabeth II. As we speak right now and for the last 24 hours, the late queen has been lying in state in a flag-draped casket in Westminster Hall at the houses of Parliament just behind us. There has been a steady stream of people paying their respects in all sorts of respectful ways. And, yes, the line, or queue, as it's called here, leads outside Parliament, across the Thames and down the river. Right now, it's said to be five miles' long, the wait at the moment, nine hours. The mood along that queue -- though, and we spent some time near the folks there, utterly feel-good. Even in death, the queen is uniting folks. And Charles III took a bit of a break today, but his son, Prince William and wife, Kate, observed the flowers, met with crowds at the Sandringham estate. That's in Eastern England and one of the queen's favorites. William confided to one member of the public that yesterday's solemn procession brought back memories of the funeral of his late mother. And, overnight, on the streets all around here, another dress rehearsal, this time for the huge state funeral which is planned for Monday. The casket will be brought from Westminster Hall to Westminster Abbey. That's where the event will -- and then, by procession, by cortege out to Windsor. That is the final resting place. Along with, Neil, President Biden and the first lady, folks are coming from all over the world in the next couple of days for the funeral on Monday. Yes, it will be a grand event regarded by just about everybody, including, of course, the people here -- back to you."

But as you take a look at some of this video from today here in Kyiv, it's really hard to tell if he suffered any sort of serious injuries. Ukrainian officials say he didn't, only minor injuries. But the other driver in the other car was taken to the ambulance. That wreck is now under investigation. But the incident didn't slow down President Zelenskyy, who welcomed the European Union's top official.

But you might notice that abortion is still up there in the top three or four. And maybe it's been resurrected again, just as it was dying down, by no less than Lindsey Graham. We have Shannon Bream with us right now, the anchor, host of \"FOX News Sunday.\" We haven't had a chance to talk since that big news. So, congratulations, Shannon. Very good to have you."

      "utterance": "On this, it's interesting. Abortion remained a hot topic. But it was, I wouldn't say fading as a topic, but less of one, the worse the inflation and the economic news got. Then, lo and behold, Lindsey Graham enters into this debate with a 15-week abortion ban. Maybe you could tell me how that might change the equation."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BREAM",
      "utterance": "Yes, this is really interesting, because, Neil, as you point out, inflation and economic issues tend to be at the top across the board for people who are looking to vote in the midterms. We have got brand-new FOX News polls coming out at 6:00, and we will see if that's still the top issue. It has been for months, and abortion has crept up certainly following the Dobbs decision, after the leak and the decision becoming official. Democrats have made a lot of gains on this issue. They say that it's helped them in special elections. They think it'll help them in the fall as well. So now comes, two weeks out from the midterms -- or -- excuse me -- two months out from the midterms Senator Lindsey Graham, who has always been a pro-life advocate and many times has introduced a 20-week ban. He now is coming forward with a 15-week ban. Now, previously, he and many other Republicans have said abortion should be a state issue. And that's what happened when Roe got overturned. It was back to the states. So, now for him to show up with a 15-week ban at the federal level is raising a lot of eyebrows and questions. No doubt, the left, the Democrats are going to be against that. But there are those on the right saying, huh, this timing is a little curious. It seems some of those in Republican leadership in the Senate seemed a little caught off guard by the fact that this is coming forward at this point. I have talked to folks within the pro-life communities who say, well, of course, we're going to support it. That's what we're about, but we feel like the timing could have been better. He's my exclusive guest on \"FOX News Sunday.\" So I will ask him all those questions and more -- Neil."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "No, I have no doubt you will. But it's interesting, because had he not said anything and just left it with the official position, the states are going to decide this, in some states, even conservative ones like Kansas, say, no, no, no, not going that far. And yet it seemed to be just moving in that direction. And, all of a sudden, I imagine there's some Republicans who say, why now? Why do this now?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BREAM",
      "utterance": "Yes. And GOP candidates are now having to answer out in the field whether they support this, after there had been such an argument about sending it back to the states. You have seen some of them come forward and say like, no, I am pro-life, but I am not going to vote for a federal ban. That's not the deal we made when we asked for Roe to be overturn. We said this was about states. So it is confusing to a lot of folks. But, listen, Senator Graham has said there's never a bad day in his mind to fight on behalf of the unborn. So it's just the timing, I think, that has us all scratching our heads."

You have Rick Scott going his own way on the senatorial committee push, his own idea to tax everybody that he himself has dialed back, but now has been sort of stamped as official Republican policy. Obviously, the Lindsey Graham stuff and the back-and-forth on this abortion issue. They're not as tight or single message as they used to be. What's happening?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BREAM",
      "utterance": "Yes, I think you're right. Over in the Senate especially, Mitch McConnell, minority leader, really hoping to become a majority leader again, has run a very disciplined house. He's very good with procedure and process. I mean, he's an expert at that. And so he's done a very good job of keeping the caucus together. But you're right. Senator Rick Scott, Senator Lindsey Graham, these are kind of unnecessary headaches, I think he probably feels like, in the lead- up to this huge midterm. Both of those senators would say, listen, what I'm doing, my cause is righteous. I don't think there is a need to apologize for it. And they're asking Republicans, both candidates and voters, to embrace what they're doing."

    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Yes, it is an interesting development. Shannon, again, look forward to the Lindsey Graham interview. You're jazzing up Sundays now. It's appointment TV. Shannon Bream, \"FOX News Sunday.\" Don't forget Lindsey Graham with her. Now, that should be a pay-per-view event. But you don't have to pay for it. You can just watch it. That makes it much easier. All right, we wanted to get Nancy Mace's view on all this, the South Carolina congresswoman, what she makes of this concern that Republicans are getting kind of off-message or confusing message. She's coming up."

    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

He has his doubts about some of the quality of candidates that you have heard. You also heard, with Shannon Bream, the idea of Lindsey Graham now talking about a 15-week abortion ban, after that period, might have complicated that. But we just don't know. How that would affect things in the House is anyone's guess, where Republicans are still favored to pick up the seats they would need to control that body. Nancy Mace hoping to make that, the South Carolina congresswoman herself running for reelection, joins us now. Congresswoman, good to see you."

      "utterance": "Do you -- and I raise this more on what's happening in the Senate, Congresswoman, so I apologize for that. You're in the House. But that this mixed messaging or that Republicans are sort of wandering off the message itself, the focus on inflation and the economy get distracted on issues like abortion, the focus on defending Donald Trump, however meritorious that might be among your colleagues, but sapping time and energy from the economy and inflation, what do you make of that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACE",
      "utterance": "Well, inflation and the economy -- and I represent a swing district, Neil, where Republicans are outnumbered almost 2-1 in this congressional district, but the economy and inflation is still the number one issue across the board for every hardworking American this year. And I think, when you look back at the decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, I think both sides were taken aback and taken by surprise by that ruling, and then we were like, well, what's next? And, as a Republican, I'm one of the very few I think that have leaned into this issue. This is an issue in my district. It's an issue in my state. I think it's an issue across the country. It's not the number one issue. But, in many districts across the country, it's the second, third or fourth, certainly top three to top five issue. And it's something that I think we should be able to communicate with people about, because there's no -- there's no consensus on abortion for any reason up until birth, just like there's no consensus for outlawing every single abortion. And coming up with solutions, either in state legislatures or in Congress, finding that center middle ground, trying to find common ground is a place where we can start. It's an issue that I have been talking about extensively since overturning Roe, trying to find where we can bring people together, so that both sides don't continue to use it to fund-raise and to use it to their advantage in campaign season. These decisions, this policy is going to make a real difference in somebody's life."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACE",
      "utterance": "Well, the overturning of Roe simply took the issue out of the courts, and did largely put it into the hands of states legislatures. But there's always been a role for Congress. Under Obama, Democrats could have codified Roe v. Wade, and they decided not to after, after telling America that they would. I do believe that there's a role for Congress to set some guardrails. And Senator Graham's legislation actually wouldn't have an impact on the state of South Carolina, because South Carolina's legislation and bills that have been signed into law are more restrictive. And I don't believe his legislation, reading it firsthand, would have an impact there. But I do believe that we do need to have a message that's compassionate, showing compassion to women and girls who've been raped, who are victims of incest, that we're not going to leave them behind and, in states where they are banning abortion, that we ensure that every woman has access to contraception. In my state of South Carolina, we have women in rural counties and rural areas where there's not a single OB-GYN doctor. And so we need to be thinking, I think, very pragmatically. There's no -- it's not mutually exclusive. I think you can protect women's rights and protect the right to life together. And that's where we have got to find and build consensus on both sides of the aisle and not be so one-sided about it either way, whether you're pro- choice or pro-life."
