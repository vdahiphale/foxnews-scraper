I'm Neil Cavuto, and this is \"Your World,\" getting ready for the president's State of the Union address tomorrow night.  So much going on concurrently, it's hard to fit it into one show. But what we can tell you right now is, the president will be talking a lot about that border fight he's having right now and funding for a wall, but not necessarily try to rush a conference committee that wants to get something done by next Friday.  That could prove easier said than done. Then the president would presumably push an emergency lever that would almost assuredly be challenged in the courts.  There are not a lot of givens on this, though. Kevin Corke gearing up for that speech now at the White House -- Kevin.",

Obviously, this speech will be coming, Neil, on the heels of the longest partial government shutdown in our history, and about 10 days before another possible work stoppage.  Now, that said, the president, we expect, will talk a lot about not just what has happened in the past, but, moving forward, what we can do to come together, that cooperation part of at least an excerpt that we were able to get here at FOX News.   I want to share part of that excerpt with you. This will just sort of give you some idea of what we expect him to sort of hammer home as he addresses congressional lawmakers, and indeed the American people. He's expected to say this. \"Together, we can break decades of political stalemate. We can bridge old divisions, heal old wounds, build new coalitions, forge new solutions and unlock the extraordinary promise of America's future. The decision is ours to make.\" But, as you know, Neil, that will mean working with a speaker, Nancy Pelosi, who has said categorically there will be no funding for a wall along our southern border, no matter what's happening down there, about which, well, at least to hear the president tell it, could mean announcing his intention to declare a national emergency tomorrow night.",

Human trafficking, drugs and criminals of all dimensions, keep out.\" Now, as you can also imagine, Neil, there is plenty of tweaking going on for the president's remarks even at this hour.

Fox News contributor Gianno Caldwell here, Democratic strategist Robert Patillo, and The Federalist's Mollie Hemingway. Mollie, that's what they're thinking about, right? They're thinking about 2020.

That is actually why this photo was released, was by apparently a medical school classmate was upset at those remarks that he made. So already he's he's kind of lost the trust of a lot of Virginians by this embrace of this radical thing that even people who are pro-choice don't think is appropriate. Then he has this photo that's an additional problem, but that's what everyone's kind of focusing on. And now he says he wasn't in the photo or he doesn't believe he was.

The fact that we get over 90 percent of African-Americans that have an allegiance to the Democratic Party, one who claim time and time again that they're the purist party, that there's no racism and bigotry in the Democratic Party, and we continue to see instances like this, and any other where that's to the contrary.  So I think for the nation in and of itself -- and Democrats are obviously looking at political ramifications, like any party would -- the real truth is, there needs to be a conversation on race when it comes to the black community and racism and what's real racism, because we know that Democrats often, when they don't like a policy proposal of the Republicans, they will say it's racist. So now the real meaning of racism has been diluted, and it's because of instances that the Democrats have continued to allege when it didn't exist.  But, however, this is a real act of racism.

Now, a lot of that depends if the military goes along. Precious few have bolted from Nicolas Maduro. That's because they're living high on the hog and loving it, but not so necessarily the rank-and-file military types, who are more inclined, we're told, to support the popularly -- seen as the popularly elected leader, Guaido. Now, Guaido has not been elected president, but he is the opposition leader, with that currency going for him. And it is with that we take a read of all of this from Colonel David Hunt. Colonel, I guess it depends on who the military ultimately aligns itself to. And we're told eventually, especially if they're granted amnesty, it will -- it will be Guaido. Do you buy that?",

But what we can tell you right now is, the president will be talking a lot about that border fight he's having right now and funding for a wall, but not necessarily try to rush a conference committee that wants to get something done by next Friday. That could prove easier said than done. Then the president would presumably push an emergency lever that would almost assuredly be challenged in the courts. There are not a lot of givens on this, though. Kevin Corke gearing up for that speech now at the White House -- Kevin."

Obviously, this speech will be coming, Neil, on the heels of the longest partial government shutdown in our history, and about 10 days before another possible work stoppage. Now, that said, the president, we expect, will talk a lot about not just what has happened in the past, but, moving forward, what we can do to come together, that cooperation part of at least an excerpt that we were able to get here at FOX News. I want to share part of that excerpt with you. This will just sort of give you some idea of what we expect him to sort of hammer home as he addresses congressional lawmakers, and indeed the American people. He's expected to say this. \"Together, we can break decades of political stalemate. We can bridge old divisions, heal old wounds, build new coalitions, forge new solutions and unlock the extraordinary promise of America's future. The decision is ours to make.\" But, as you know, Neil, that will mean working with a speaker, Nancy Pelosi, who has said categorically there will be no funding for a wall along our southern border, no matter what's happening down there, about which, well, at least to hear the president tell it, could mean announcing his intention to declare a national emergency tomorrow night."

If there is no wall, there's no security. Human trafficking, drugs and criminals of all dimensions, keep out.\" Now, as you can also imagine, Neil, there is plenty of tweaking going on for the president's remarks even at this hour.

Just keep in mind, Virginia is a state that has increasingly gone from read to purple, some say even blue right now, with a sweep of the top offices under Democratic control. And its 13 electoral votes are highly prized.  In 2016, Hillary Clinton won them, which is why so many Democrats are putting pressure on the governor to get out now, because they don't want this lingering into the next presidential race. Fox News contributor Gianno Caldwell here, Democratic strategist Robert Patillo, and The Federalist's Mollie Hemingway. Mollie, that's what they're thinking about, right? They're thinking about 2020. And they don't want this and the governor to be an issue then, do they?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, THE FEDERALIST",
      "utterance": "Well, yes. And there is actually another part of this story that's kind of been left out of some of the coverage. All of Governor Northam's problems -- I'm a Virginia and I live there -- began last week when he embraced this very radical late-term abortion bill and seemed to argue even in favor of infanticide or leaving babies to die who had been born if the mother wanted them to. That is actually why this photo was released, was by apparently a medical school classmate was upset at those remarks that he made. So already he's he's kind of lost the trust of a lot of Virginians by this embrace of this radical thing that even people who are pro-choice don't think is appropriate. Then he has this photo that's an additional problem, but that's what everyone's kind of focusing on. And now he says he wasn't in the photo or he doesn't believe he was. And so I don't know how easy it is going to be to get rid of him, because he doesn't really have many options other than clinging on for dear life here."

I mean, so he almost, to make the Democrats happy, leave on his own accord, because an impeachment for an act that was well before he assumed office, that's going to be an uphill climb, right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROBERT PATILLO, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST",
      "utterance": "Well, two points. One, I do think it's important for him to step down for the good of the state, for the good of the party, for to good of the nation, that it does not benefit anybody other than Ralph Northam to continue in office. He's lost the authority to govern the state properly. Secondarily, I don't think it'll be an uphill battle for impeachment, because there's this thing in law. There's this thing when you're passing the bar called character and fitness and called your moral character. So, if you are appearing in a photo in blackface or in a Klan's outfit, and you submit that to the yearbook, whether it's 25 years ago or 25 minutes ago, you do not have the moral character that is necessary in order to govern."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

Now, I think, in the end, a lot of people going to look at just say, resign already. But, Gianno Caldwell, the reality here is that we can question the timing of this yearbook photo release and the fact that no one, in their due diligence -- and this is where the Gillespie campaign might have dropped the ball..."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CALDWELL",
      "utterance": "Well, to me, I think this is a major national teaching moment for African-Americans all over this country; 87 percent of African- Americans voted for this governor. And that's the reason why he sits in office right now today. The fact that we get over 90 percent of African-Americans that have an allegiance to the Democratic Party, one who claim time and time again that they're the purist party, that there's no racism and bigotry in the Democratic Party, and we continue to see instances like this, and any other where that's to the contrary. So I think for the nation in and of itself -- and Democrats are obviously looking at political ramifications, like any party would -- the real truth is, there needs to be a conversation on race when it comes to the black community and racism and what's real racism, because we know that Democrats often, when they don't like a policy proposal of the Republicans, they will say it's racist. So now the real meaning of racism has been diluted, and it's because of instances that the Democrats have continued to allege when it didn't exist.  But, however, this is a real act of racism. And now we have a lame-duck racist governor in the state mansion in Virginia."

    {
      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",

For regular working-class Americans, you care about what's on the table, if you have good education, if we're not getting invaded by other countries, and the economy is going well. So let's take those fringe elements out, these Hollywood celebrities who think the MAGA hat is something evil, and get back to a conversation about what really affects Americans. And what affects Americans and Virginians is a governor who has lost the ability to govern one of the largest states in the nation."

Now, a lot of that depends if the military goes along. Precious few have bolted from Nicolas Maduro. That's because they're living high on the hog and loving it, but not so necessarily the rank-and-file military types, who are more inclined, we're told, to support the popularly -- seen as the popularly elected leader, Guaido. Now, Guaido has not been elected president, but he is the opposition leader, with that currency going for him. And it is with that we take a read of all of this from Colonel David Hunt. Colonel, I guess it depends on who the military ultimately aligns itself to. And we're told eventually, especially if they're granted amnesty, it will -- it will be Guaido. Do you buy that?"

It's what we do with afterwards. And that's where we have failed miserably over the last 50 years, in nation-building. So it seems to me that this is a State Department, intelligence -- and intelligence work, and you have got to figure out what the countries around it like Colombia want to do, and how we can assist that and influence it.

But we shouldn't be putting steps in the -- footsteps inside Venezuela, unless they're clandestine operations run by the intelligence community.  But military -- direct military support in here is just a bad idea for a whole bunch of reasons, one of which, we have got -- we have got our hands full with Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq.

Georgia Republican Congressman Tom Graves was telling me this past weekend that he's part of that bipartisan negotiating conference committee group made up of Republicans and Democrats who are trying to hammer out an accord that would avoid a government shutdown. But they're still miles apart on this, Democrats saying no money for a wall, the president and Republicans insisting on some money for a wall, but they're far, far apart. That might prompt the president to take matters into his own hands, if, by next Friday -- not this Friday, but next Friday, when the deadline comes, and they're still far apart, just to declare an emergency and get cracking on the wall. Let's get the read on that from Florida Republican Congressman Matt Gaetz. Congressman, good to have you. If the president did that, how would you feel?"

And so I think, if the president has to get to that conclusion, it's largely a consequence, Neil, of the Democrats not negotiating in good faith. I think it was on the first day of the conference committee coming together that Nancy Pelosi said there would be zero dollars for any physical barrier at the border. And I think it's that lack of good faith that is leading the president closer and closer to a decision to use his executive authority."

I think Nancy Pelosi has talked about something about a barrier, if the president wants to reinforce something, et cetera. Now, she's quite clear that she doesn't like the word wall. The president quite clear that he is open for alternatives to a wall, per se, but still a wall, a structure of some sort. So it's almost in just the wording of it. Do you know whether there is an effort right now among Republicans and Democrats to come up with another word for wall?"

Now, I know things veered a little off course with that, and they say that their vote wasn't for what was ultimately bragged about by the president. Still, the president has shown great flexibility on negotiating down and talking down the price of that. Is it your sense that the two sides are closer than you think, and an emergency measure might not be necessary at all?"

You will remember, Neil, Nancy Pelosi challenged the president, pass what you believe in while Republicans are in control, so that we can better negotiate. We, in fact, did that. What Democrats haven't done is put what they believe in for border security on the -- on the floor. And I think that the inability to do that shows that there may be no bill that Nancy Pelosi can pass with Democrat votes on the border, because you got a part of her caucus that would support wall funding. You got a part of her caucus that thinks that borders and walls are racist and immoral. And I think that's a very difficult challenge for her to be able to deal with, independent of the president and the Republicans."

Now, on Saturday, he said if it became clear that he could no longer do that, he would be willing to explore the idea of stepping down. And over the last few days, nearly every member of his party has called on him to resign after that racist yearbook photo surfaced.

Now, look, there's another side to this. One of the most virulent racists in the modern era -- and if you looked at the language that he used, it would curl your straight hair -- was President Lyndon Baines Johnson.

Tom Brady is getting a great deal of attention, not only because he did it again, but he did it at 41. And he made it look like he was a 21-year-old.  There is a reason for that, that a lot of doctors are pointing to now, including one coming up next."

    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right. I hate the Patriots. I'm sorry, New England. I just do."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "And I got to get over it, I know, but I'm jealous of you. I'm really jealous of this guy. He's, like, immortal. But he's a remarkable guy. And he's an unusual physical specimen, because, at 41, he's doing things that a lot of 21-year-olds can't do. I don't understand how that's possible. I know that I hate him for it. But Tom Brady shouldn't be blamed for being a perfect physical specimen that defies his age. Physician and surgeon Dr. Kelly Powers joins us. It's the genetic lottery there, but there's got to be more, right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DR. KELLY POWERS, WESTMED MEDICAL GROUP",
      "utterance": "Yes, I was going to say there's no question genetics plays a role here with Tom Brady, I mean, physically and, yes, he's kind of good-looking too, some people might say. I don't know."
    },

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Oh, whatever."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "POWERS",
      "utterance": "You know, you know. So is age just a number? Well, if we look at him, and we look at Drew Brees, and Peyton Manning, and Ben Roethlisberger, these guys are defying the odds here, which is great."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "How do they do it? What are they doing?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "POWERS",
      "utterance": "Well, I know for Tom Brady, Tom Brady is really into no-weight strength training. So what does that mean? Resistant bands, tension bands, he's really into it. He says that he hasn't lifted a weight in almost a decade. So you know those tension bands, the ones that you have seen people at the gym doing."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "POWERS",
      "utterance": "It's elongating the muscle, instead of making it bulky, so not bulky, lengthening. That's what he's saying is the key to his abilities."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "But he hasn't lost his strength, it appears."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "POWERS",
      "utterance": "No."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "The only thing I saw similar, Doctor, was George Foreman, when he was coming back and boxing. I'm told, because he was such a strong puncher, the boxing skills were never his to begin with. He was never very flashy or speedy, but he was strong. And strength like that doesn't deteriorate as rapidly."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "POWERS",
      "utterance": "Right. And look at Tom Brady. He's not one of the big, bulky linebacker guys that you see. So he calls it rotational athletes, meaning that quarterbacks, pitchers and even golfers are rotational athletes. And those rotational athletes need to focus on, according to him, kind of that elongation of the muscle, again, that strength training, what he calls pliability. That's the buzzword."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "But he does other stuff. We all know he is meticulously slavish to his diet, but even when he eats the food he eats, and sleep patterns and all that. What do you know about that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "POWERS",
      "utterance": "I wish I can learn from him, my goodness. I know. He goes -- he claims he goes to sleep every night at 8:00, 8:30, wakes up every morning at 5:00, 5:30. I'm already exhausted saying that statement."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "And it's consistent. He never veers from it, right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "POWERS",
      "utterance": "Consistent, consistent, exactly. And his diet. He stands by an anti-inflammatory diet, which I do believe in."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "What does that mean?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "POWERS",
      "utterance": "Yes, so that's your turmeric, your gingers, your organic veggies.  Tries to stay away from most meats. He wrote the book \"TB12.\" I'm actually reading it right now, because I can't really do cardio myself. So I'm learning from him and what inspiration he is."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "You're dealing with heart issues, right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "POWERS",
      "utterance": "Yes, for dealing with my own heart issues, right. And so I can't do cardio. And I'm kind of trying to emulate him as best I can. But he's really into this..."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "He doesn't eat any meat or very little meat."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "POWERS",
      "utterance": "Very little meat."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Which already sounds very hellish."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "POWERS",
      "utterance": "I don't know when he has time for fun, but you know what? Winning a Super Bowl, that sounds pretty fun to me. So, hey."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "And he doesn't treat himself a lot, or what might be our definition of treating himself, and very disciplined about everything in his life, right?."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "POWERS",
      "utterance": "Yes, mental -- let's talk about his mental health too. I feel like he's such an inspiration for mental health. He has literally -- when he was in college, he went to see a sports psychologist. So, that's great. He's not afraid to ask for help and positive attitude. He's got this great positive attitude. We know stress increases cortisol, which is that hormone that increases weight gain, lowers our immune system. And that's just a big hodgepodge of mess. So if you can keep yourself in that positive attitude, as he has done -- and, plus, look at all the critics."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "And he cheats a lot. Right? He deflates balls and all that. So that comes with that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "POWERS",
      "utterance": "I think my family will be happy you said that, and probably not happy I'm doing this segment."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Right. Right. Right. I'm just jealous. I always get razzing from my brothers in New England and all that. But your sense of what he's doing is not impossible. He's not -- this is something we could all do, not necessarily to the degree he does, but there's not a time limit or an age limit on what you can do."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "POWERS",
      "utterance": "Yes, I think these guys are defying the odds, but, again, personal chef, personal trainer, that stuff helps a little bit."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. They have access to things a lot of folks don't, right?"
