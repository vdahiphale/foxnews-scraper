But if you look at what the FBI was investigating in that \"New York Times\" report, if you look at what they were investigating, Mueller did not go anywhere with that investigation.  He has been writing his report in real time through these indictments and we have seen nothing from Mueller on the central question of was there any coordination, collusion with the Russians and the effort to meddle in the elections or was there even in the knowledge on the part of the president or anybody in his campaign with what the Russians were doing?",

Bring in the therapy llamas for \"The View\" because the only joy there will be miserable. So, could the most ginned-up (ph) scandal ever be simply a figment of the imagination? Short answer, yes. Long answer, hell yes. In this piece in \"The Hill,\" Jonathan Turley suggests that collusion in the deep state narrative are both interpretations of the same bucket of facts colored by our own biases. So which one is true? That Trump colluded with Putin or there is a secret group undermining the president? May be neither, but they feel true to both sides.  On one side, based on the Hillary Steele file, the FBI chased the Russian story because that's their job. They were told they had to do something which meant find something. They are still looking. Meanwhile, the other side, season orchestrated coup against Trump run by obsessed never Trump- ers and Obama left-overs. You see how both describe the same thing? They both feel right especially because biases are easily confirmed with what we want to see is presented is somehow true.   Its two different sandwiches made from the same crap. And that crap smells like ad profit from \"The New York Times\" and MSNBC. Yet in reality, it's simpler. There was no collusion, just Russians doing what they do with the deep state about as organized as an emotional CNN panel. It's the obvious conclusion and it pleases no one which makes it all the more likely that it's true. All right, Juan, weeks away from the report. Prepare to be disappointed.

And I've been thinking about this and I go, you can argue that tunnels are proof that walls work because it forces the criminal to engage in riskier, more involved, time-consuming endeavors. For example, if you don't have a wall then you don't have to dig a tunnel. For example, you could use the same argument like why would I buy a lock for my bike if somebody has bolt cutters? Well, you reduce the risk of your bike getting stolen the same way that walls reduce the risk of cross over. So, deterrents always -- and this goes back to the whole idea of going to legal ports of entry, drugs, all deterrents do is a funnel efforts of the criminals into more difficult, labor-intensive arenas.

The criminal complaint indicates that Patterson, the suspect, blasted through their front door or the Closs' house with a shotgun, killed James Closs in cold blood and then hunted through the house until he found Jayme Closs hiding with her mother in a bathroom. A portion of the criminal complaint reads, \"JLC, which is Jayme, stated that she heard a gunshot and knew her father had just been killed. Jayme stated her mother had her cell phone with her and used the phone to cal 9111. Jayme stated Patterson broke down the bathroom door and told her mother to hang up the phone. Jayme stated Patterson told her mother to put tape over her daughter's mouth which her mother did and then Patterson shot her mother.\" The criminal complaint indicates Patterson had no connection to the Closs family but that one day he randomly saw Jayme getting on a school bus and plotted that he was going to steal her, going to great lengths to murder her parents. Police say Patterson used a popular shotgun that he thought would help avoid him being detected. He stole license plates and ditched his. He wiped down the gun and shell casings before using them to clean off DNA. He shaved his head and face and put on a ski mask to avoid leaving behind hair. Patterson kept Jayme captive for nearly three months, making her hide under his bed when people came over until this brave girl made a run for it last Thursday. The district attorney just told us that there are potentially more charges in this case because so far police have not released any details about potential molestation, Juan.",

All he saw was someone in need but still managed to help the lineman get his car up and running again to make it to the game on time. So after the team won, Allen took to social media. He's like, \"I've got to find Dave.\" He wants to thank him and give him tickets to next week's AFC championship game. Well, within 12 hours, he was able to track down Dave and let them know how grateful he was. Get this: as it turns out, Dave had been homeless and been living out of his truck for the last eight months. Since this story broke, nearly $10,000 has been raised by the community as an additional thank-you for the selfless act. And have a good time at the game.",

He has been writing his report in real time through these indictments and we have seen nothing from Mueller on the central question of was there any coordination, collusion with the Russians and the effort to meddle in the elections or was there even in the knowledge on the part of the president or anybody in his campaign with what the Russians were doing?"

Long answer, hell yes. In this piece in \"The Hill,\" Jonathan Turley suggests that collusion in the deep state narrative are both interpretations of the same bucket of facts colored by our own biases. So which one is true? That Trump colluded with Putin or there is a secret group undermining the president? May be neither, but they feel true to both sides. On one side, based on the Hillary Steele file, the FBI chased the Russian story because that's their job. They were told they had to do something which meant find something. They are still looking. Meanwhile, the other side, season orchestrated coup against Trump run by obsessed never Trump- ers and Obama left-overs. You see how both describe the same thing? They both feel right especially because biases are easily confirmed with what we want to see is presented is somehow true. Its two different sandwiches made from the same crap. And that crap smells like ad profit from \"The New York Times\" and MSNBC. Yet in reality, it's simpler. There was no collusion, just Russians doing what they do with the deep state about as organized as an emotional CNN panel. It's the obvious conclusion and it pleases no one which makes it all the more likely that it's true. All right, Juan, weeks away from the report. Prepare to be disappointed.

The FBI culture is a very Russian-influence culture. They've been fighting the Cold War for two generations. If a politician -- a businessman comes in and doesn't play ball with the conventional wisdom of Washington establishment, they automatically assume he's a Russian spy. So when they have this thing, there's this rumor that they changed the -- at the RNC, the GOP platform against Ukraine. That was fake news. They never did. They never watered it down.

It's quite amazing. But on the double standard, when you read \"The New York Times\" story about why the FBI opened this counterintelligence investigation, which by the way they can open on anybody for any reason apparently. There was no evidence in the piece cited about why they did that.

I was listening to Howard Stern today and he expressed an argument that I've heard before about why walls don't work, right. He said it's because of tunnels. And I've been thinking about this and I go, you can argue that tunnels are proof that walls work because it forces the criminal to engage in riskier, more involved, time-consuming endeavors. For example, if you don't have a wall then you don't have to dig a tunnel. For example, you could use the same argument like why would I buy a lock for my bike if somebody has bolt cutters? Well, you reduce the risk of your bike getting stolen the same way that walls reduce the risk of cross over. So, deterrents always -- and this goes back to the whole idea of going to legal ports of entry, drugs, all deterrents do is a funnel efforts of the criminals into more difficult, labor-intensive arenas. That is a success. So walls, no tunnels or with tunnels, are still competent."

The second thing to say is, you know, with regard to the Republican effort ongoing now to try to get some kind of negotiation on the Hill, well, you've heard from people like Chris Coons who was on Fox News Sunday yesterday, we're willing to negotiate but we need somebody who is reliable. And the president shifts in terms of what he wants and what he doesn't want on a regular basis so that even his top aides can't be confident as to what will make a deal.

First, police say that Jake Patterson admitted to killing James and Denise Closs because he wanted to get his hands on their 13-year-old daughter. The criminal complaint indicates that Patterson, the suspect, blasted through their front door or the Closs' house with a shotgun, killed James Closs in cold blood and then hunted through the house until he found Jayme Closs hiding with her mother in a bathroom. A portion of the criminal complaint reads, \"JLC, which is Jayme, stated that she heard a gunshot and knew her father had just been killed. Jayme stated her mother had her cell phone with her and used the phone to cal 9111. Jayme stated Patterson broke down the bathroom door and told her mother to hang up the phone. Jayme stated Patterson told her mother to put tape over her daughter's mouth which her mother did and then Patterson shot her mother.\" The criminal complaint indicates Patterson had no connection to the Closs family but that one day he randomly saw Jayme getting on a school bus and plotted that he was going to steal her, going to great lengths to murder her parents. Police say Patterson used a popular shotgun that he thought would help avoid him being detected. He stole license plates and ditched his. He wiped down the gun and shell casings before using them to clean off DNA. He shaved his head and face and put on a ski mask to avoid leaving behind hair. Patterson kept Jayme captive for nearly three months, making her hide under his bed when people came over until this brave girl made a run for it last Thursday. The district attorney just told us that there are potentially more charges in this case because so far police have not released any details about potential molestation, Juan."

So, when you look at how he saw her, a 13-year-old girl and decided he was going to go into her home, kill her parents and take her. We don't know the reason why he wanted to take her.

And I think that's probably the healthiest thing to do after you've been kept 88 days in this creepy ramshackle home in the middle of the woods with, like, stuffed animals all over the place and dirty mattresses on the ground and women's clothes. They found empty, sugary alcoholic beverages.  You can't even imagine the potential of what happened there. But the fact that she escaped was pretty remarkable. Because what he would do is he would put these bins with weights on them and surround the whole entire bed so she couldn't escape. But he said at one point, \"I'm going to go out, and I'll be back in five to six hours.\" And she thought, \"Five to six hours? That's going to give me enough time to get out.\" And luckily, she got out and ran into a neighbor.

It was this woman, Sarah Thomas. Ms. Thomas became the first woman to officiate an NFL playoff game. Right now, this mother of three is in her fourth season in the NFL. Yesterday's moment in the spotlight brought praise from another female trailblazer. Billy Jean King, the tennis icon. She tweeted, \"You have to see it to be it. Little girls everywhere are watching. Way to go, Sarah Thomas!\" And by the way, talking about basketball, she has some sisters. Lauren Holtkamp is currently the only full-time NBA referee, but the NBA recently promoted two more women to full-time positions. The times, they are a- changing."
