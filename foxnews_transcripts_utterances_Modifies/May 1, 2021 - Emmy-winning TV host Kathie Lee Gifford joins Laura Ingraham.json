Now, the press must have watched a completely different Biden address earlier in the week, you're going to be shocked by their reactions to it, the most extreme and the most inane, we're going to bring you the worst in media. Plus, it's the return of our mystery guest's series. Here's your first clue. Now this particular person just recently received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The big reveal later in the hour, and an update on the White House's most dangerous resident, Raymond Arroyo has that all in Friday Follies. But first, the go-getters versus the gloom gang. That's the focus of tonight's angle. Over the past 24 hours, we've been just overwhelmed by your response to our red state trailblazers townhall in Orlando last night. Now we had five GOP governors who joined us for a wide-ranging conversation about how they've grown their economies, how they've protected individual freedoms, and how they've beaten back the radical Leftist dominating the Democratic Party. Now, none of them had waited for Washington's permission to open their businesses or lift their mask mandates or frankly get their students back in the classroom. And none of them are cowed by the woke mob BLM or the gender fluidity crowd. They're all happy warriors.",

Then, of course, that crisis of the pandemic just folds into the next crisis. This systemic racism crisis, the climate crisis. Hawaii just declared a climate emergency, this happened yesterday. So, these perpetually hype crises are then just used to justify the Left's brazen efforts to take more of our money, and more of our liberty, that's how the game always goes. But the only real crisis that America suffers from today are those that are created by them, the Democrats, like the border crisis, or the education crisis, or the crisis of rising crime. So, if Texas and Florida and the other red states had followed New York and California's lead a year ago, think about it, America's economy would be in the dumps, just like Europe's, this is a headline out of Germany today where they're implementing once again, more pandemic restrictions. Meanwhile, our first quarter real GDP number that just came out 6.4 percent growth, that is truly astounding. And of course, Biden is trying to claim credit as all his doing, but he deserves exactly zero credit for today's booming economy. It was all the doing of Donald J. Trump, the red state governors, and the American people who rejected the doomsdayers, and stuck with first principles. They trusted their own constituents over the so-called experts who just wanted us matched up and afraid for as long as possible. So, if Biden had been president, think about this just a year ago, he had been president, all of America would look like Michigan, failing, miserable and pessimistic. Let's not forget how they saw this whole thing unfolding about a year ago this time, they were saying that we might not recover from this pandemic economically for decades. But what the story of the past year really reveals is that Americans can't be held down or held back by Washington for very long. Yes, the Democrats won the election by selling Biden as a nice kind of moderate Democrat. But now, now the voters are beginning to see what they really got. They got an elderly hostage to the far left. They've gone from Obama's yes, we can to Biden's Yes, we're racist. This deeply cynical view means that Democrats can only occupy America. They can't really govern it . What a depressing world they want to foist on us. But my friends, optimism beats pessimism any day of the week. And by next year, a lot of those suburban women who voted for Biden, they're going to think this doom and gloom social distancing act of the Democrats has gotten really old. And they're going to be looking for a brighter vision.",

It is a disgusting answer. And there's a lot of that that we get from the Biden Administration. I agree with you. Listening to the speech a few nights ago, I have to confess I'm not much of an optimist myself. But even I'm listening to that and thinking like, dude, cheer up a little bit. But my worry is that Biden gets away with this kind of thing. He gets away with lying disgusting, like he just did, because of course, he's got the media on his side. But also, that speech was really the probably the most radical speech we've heard from a president in that setting, maybe ever, but it's so - but the way he comes across, it's so sort of boring, he just puts you to sleep. And I think just viscerally you don't get the sense if you're not paying attention, that what he's doing is radical, you have to really pay attention. It's hard to pay attention.

      "utterance": "We warned you a year ago that Democrats would seek to use the pandemic, to keep us in a continual crisis mode. Then, of course, that crisis of the pandemic just folds into the next crisis. This systemic racism crisis, the climate crisis. Hawaii just declared a climate emergency, this happened yesterday. So, these perpetually hype crises are then just used to justify the Left's brazen efforts to take more of our money, and more of our liberty, that's how the game always goes. But the only real crisis that America suffers from today are those that are created by them, the Democrats, like the border crisis, or the education crisis, or the crisis of rising crime. So, if Texas and Florida and the other red states had followed New York and California's lead a year ago, think about it, America's economy would be in the dumps, just like Europe's, this is a headline out of Germany today where they're implementing once again, more pandemic restrictions. Meanwhile, our first quarter real GDP number that just came out 6.4 percent growth, that is truly astounding. And of course, Biden is trying to claim credit as all his doing, but he deserves exactly zero credit for today's booming economy. It was all the doing of Donald J. Trump, the red state governors, and the American people who rejected the doomsdayers, and stuck with first principles. They trusted their own constituents over the so-called experts who just wanted us matched up and afraid for as long as possible. So, if Biden had been president, think about this just a year ago, he had been president, all of America would look like Michigan, failing, miserable and pessimistic. Let's not forget how they saw this whole thing unfolding about a year ago this time, they were saying that we might not recover from this pandemic economically for decades. But what the story of the past year really reveals is that Americans can't be held down or held back by Washington for very long. Yes, the Democrats won the election by selling Biden as a nice kind of moderate Democrat. But now, now the voters are beginning to see what they really got. They got an elderly hostage to the far left. They've gone from Obama's yes, we can to Biden's Yes, we're racist. This deeply cynical view means that Democrats can only occupy America. They can't really govern it . What a depressing world they want to foist on us. But my friends, optimism beats pessimism any day of the week. And by next year, a lot of those suburban women who voted for Biden, they're going to think this doom and gloom social distancing act of the Democrats has gotten really old. And they're going to be looking for a brighter vision."

It is a disgusting answer. And there's a lot of that that we get from the Biden Administration. I agree with you. Listening to the speech a few nights ago, I have to confess I'm not much of an optimist myself. But even I'm listening to that and thinking like, dude, cheer up a little bit. But my worry is that Biden gets away with this kind of thing. He gets away with lying disgusting, like he just did, because of course, he's got the media on his side. But also, that speech was really the probably the most radical speech we've heard from a president in that setting, maybe ever, but it's so - but the way he comes across, it's so sort of boring, he just puts you to sleep. And I think just viscerally you don't get the sense if you're not paying attention, that what he's doing is radical, you have to really pay attention. It's hard to pay attention.

And then you have Abbott, who's done a gangbuster in Texas with the open border down there, still doing incredible stuff.

But people like Anthony Fauci, people who are just completely unrelated to the reality of what's going on. You talked about that, in your open regarding Joe Biden, the idea that people aren't getting together like their people, I've been invited to three different Cinco de Mayo parties, you know, like, they're not waiting for permission to in order to gather together and celebrate and clack a few beers together. I mean, it's one of these things where they act as if they're in control, but the reality just defies them. And I think that that's something that's good in America and that we should encourage, and I think these coming weeks and months, we're going to see more and more of it, as we see that distance increase between what we hear from our government officials and what people are actually doing in their own lives."

And we weren't even thinking about it, so we both got sort of close to each other. At the same time we went, oh, hi, and then we just kept walking. But I was always a huge fan of Regis because every time I'd watch him, he was doing something stupid, but it was hysterical, or he was doing something great which nobody had ever done before, but he always seemed fearless to me. And he always seemed to really love his audience. Nothing was ever done in a way to be offensive. Interestingly enough, because Don Rickles was one of his closest friends, and Don Rickles is the exact opposite, ripping everyone to pieces, but one of the sweetest guys in the world in real life. Regis was everyman, he just was, and he had the greatest attitude of gratitude. He just couldn't believe that out of all the people on this planet, he got to be Regis. And in a way, before he died, Laura, and it broke my heart because I hadn't seen him. He and Joy had moved to California, for the most part, and of course there was COVID at that time, and I hadn't seen him in months because I was in L.A. And I saw him get out of the car and walked towards my house. And I went oh, Lord, this is going to be the last time I'm going to see my friend, I just knew it. But we picked up right where we did before, and we laughed. And the nice thing about it and the great thing about it that I will always cherish is that Regis and I became great friends when we work together for 15 years, but after I left the show, for the next 20 years, we became even much deeper friends."

What was their alleged crime, stealing Nancy Pelosi's laptop during the Capitol riot? I kid you not. Both Paul and Marilyn will be here exclusively on Monday to tell us more about this nightmarish experience. That's all the time we have tonight. We had a great week, and kudos again to the five governors who showed up for our town hall last night.
