      "sentences": "Tucker, good evening to you. We just got some new information from the U.S. Secret Service that says the investigation into a U.S. Secret Service officer involved shooting is ongoing.  A male subject and a Secret Service Officer were both transported to a local hospital. At no time during this incident was the White House complex breached or were any of the protectees in danger. It was about 10 minutes to six. I was out on the North Lawn and heard in rapid succession, bam-boom, like that, what sounded like two gunshots.  It was going on, the incident at the corner of -- southeast corner of 17th and Pennsylvania Avenue, just on the other side of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building.   Within a couple of minutes, the Secret Service agent who was stationed here with the President, in the Brady Briefing Room, walked up to the President and said sir, we have to leave. There's been shots fired outside the White House. The President was taken to the area near the Oval Office, where he waited for a few minutes, but wanted, Tucker, to come back into the Briefing Room. You'll remember that when those protests were going on across Lafayette Square across the street from the White House, the President was whisked down to the bunker for a short period of time.   The President didn't want to repeat of that, so he got back here to the Brady Briefing Room just as soon as it was possible. Again, according to the Secret Service, at no time did an individual breach the grounds of the White House, at no time were the protectees in danger. There are many of them here at the White House, Tucker, but a Secret Service Officer, a uniformed officer and a suspect both taken to the hospital. No word yet on their condition though one source tell me the injuries do not appear to be life threatening -- Tucker.",

      "sentences": "John Roberts, thanks so much for that.   Craziness, but it seems now almost normal. Violence is a feature of daily life at this point in the nation's capital. Over the weekend, 21 people were shot in a single incident in Washington. More than half of them were women, one was a D.C. police officer. It was the single biggest mass shooting in America this year, and yet, you probably heard nothing about it.  Members of Congress didn't lock arms on the House floor to demand an end to the gun violence. CNN didn't book a procession of weepy teenage gun control activists or extended Town Hall meeting. News organizations barely touched the story, and when they did, they moved on fast. It wouldn't help the Biden campaign to talk about it, so they didn't talk about it.  As far as we can tell, neither CNN nor MSNBC even mentioned it today. Twenty one people shot in a group in our capital city and they acted like it didn't happen, but it did happen. We're showing it to you on the screen right now.  Twenty one African-Americans shot by a gunman, yet the media spent all weekend telling you about how Simon Cowell fell off his electric bike in Malibu, because really, Black Lives Matter. MSNBC wants you to know that. It's grotesque. But it's now the rule. Dead bodies don't count unless they are politically useful dead bodies.  Last month, the gang members shot 15 people outside a funeral home in Chicago. It looked like Fallujah. We played some of the video of it on the show. It was very upsetting.   The other channels did not play it. None of the primetime hosts on CNN or MSNBC even mentioned the shooting. They didn't care. Politicians didn't care either. Muriel Bowser is the Mayor of Washington, D.C. Bowser claims to care about black lives very much. She ordered the slogan Black Lives Matter in fact painted in yellow on the road leading to the White House just to underscore how much she cares. So how did Muriel Bowser respond when 21 African-Americans were gunned down in her city? Well, she talked about her coronavirus lockdowns.  Bowser has banned gatherings in the city of more than 50 people and apparently there were more than that at the cookout where the shooting occurred. This enraged Muriel Bowser.  Here's what the Mayor said about the shooting yesterday, quote, \"It's important as a community that we have zero tolerance for this kind of activity,\" end quote. Now to be perfectly clear, Mayor Bowser was not talking about the mass shootings. When she said we need zero tolerance, Bowser is happy to tolerate violence, she does every day. She often encourages violence.   What Bowser won't put up with is citizens violating her lockdown orders. Bowser's Chief of Police, a man called Peter Newsham reiterated that point, quote, \"We can't have these large gatherings in the city,\" the Chief said. In other words, shootings are acceptable as long as the police don't commit them, but disobey our corona decrees and we will come for you.  The media wholeheartedly agree with this, of course. Violence does not bother them. They encourage it regularly. Disobedience bothers them.  This weekend, motorcycle riders mostly on Harley-Davidsons from all over the country gathered in Sturgis, South Dakota for their annual rally, the Sturgis Rally. Some of them forgot their masks. This outraged our news media. The people on motorcycles were too masculine and too patriotic, and therefore too unlikely to vote for Joe Biden to go un-criticized. So the media spent a lot of the weekend trying to shame the bikers into disappearing. In other words, as some of the poorest people in Washington bled onto the sidewalk, this is what your news anchors talked about.",

In Georgetown, one of the richest, most liberal neighborhoods in the city, certainly, in the country, a group of thugs marched on residential streets in the middle of the night to make certain that no one was sleeping.   People who live there must have been confused. In Georgetown, Black Lives Matter yard signs are about as common as designer dog breeds -- it is very common.  The residents apparently thought they bought themselves peace by paying their indulgences with the correct political slogans, but they hadn't. The fact their neighborhood is still safe is now considered a crime and the mob made that very clear.",

Meanwhile, back in Georgetown, again, the real world, just in case the residents here didn't feel sufficiently threatened, the mob then barricaded a key bridge, the Francis Scott Key Bridge. That's the main artery from Georgetown out of the city. Blocking main arteries out of cities is an obvious threat to public safety. It's far more dangerous than any over attended cookout. But police didn't stop it, they helped the mob. And once again, the media collectively ignored all of it.   And what exactly did the liberal passive heavily elderly residents of Georgetown do to deserve this kind of abuse and harassment from a mob of Joe Biden voters? That's the core question. But no one on television wanted to talk about that. So again, they just ignored the entire thing.  They're doing it all over the country. Story after story, ignored, disappeared down the memory hole because it is politically inconvenient. In Los Angeles, for example, a City Council member called Mike Bonin voted to slash the LAPD budget by $150 million. He is very opposed to the police, but that didn't stop him from calling the police.  Since April, it turns out that cops have been called to Bonin's home eight separate times, often to deal with -- surprise, surprise -- protesters. Bonin's defense is that he didn't make the calls. No. Somehow the LAPD with collusion from rightwing elements made the calls.  Does that make sense? No, it doesn't make sense. But it's good enough for the newspapers in Los Angeles. They're not covering the story. It's not a story. Right.  A guy who votes to defund the police calls them eight times to keep the lunatics from coming through his front door? Not a story. Okay.  Last Thursday, meanwhile, in Portland, Oregon, a city that effectively no longer has a government, rioters threw paint on an elderly woman. What was her crime? She made the mistake of trying to stop them from destroying a building. Here's why this is so interesting. As the mob attacked her, they explained their agenda, quote, \"This isn't your world anymore,\" they shouted. \"Put your mask on.\" Boy, does that tell you everything.  Meanwhile, in the City of Chicago, rioters have dropped any pretense of ideology. Sure, they'll vote for Joe Biden, obviously, but this isn't about the election. They just want to steal things. And in effect, authorities there, as they are in so many places, are allowing them to do that. Early this morning, caravans of looters sacked stores in downtown Chicago. Here's part of it.",

      "sentences": "What country is this? And what's the justification for that? There's always a story at the bottom of these things that the media repeat, allow them to believe it was justified.  The pretext for that theft and destruction you just saw was a false report that a teenager had been executed by the police. It was a lie as it turned out, it usually is a lie. In fact, a 20-year-old had been killed after shooting at the police. Whatever. We're so used to violence justified by lies that few people seem to notice the difference, and speaking of, just this weekend, Joe Biden honored Michael Brown. That was the man killed in Ferguson, Missouri after he violently attacked a store owner on tape, and then a cop. Joe Biden apparently doesn't remember that part. He seems to consider Michael Brown a martyr.  It's hard to know who in America still believes these lies. Most people no longer seem to believe anything they hear from politicians. When everything is political, we learn to trust nothing. But one thing that is real and will always be real is the debris left behind. Bullet holes are real. So are burnt store, so are boarded up windows and terrified neighbors. That will always be real -- and we have it. So what will be the aftermath of all of this? What are America's cities going to look like a year from now? There's no question people flee Georgetown. They may have BLM signs in the driveway, but it doesn't mean they want screaming BLM lunatics on their streets. They don't. Nobody does, actually, no matter what they tell you. No matter what color they are, no one likes that. That's true for people in Georgetown, in Portland, Oregon, in San Francisco and Chicago, New York -- any other place where order and decency have disappeared.   People will not live long with chaos. No matter what they tell you. No matter what signs they put in their yard, they will leave and many of them have already left. We are about to see one of the great demographic shifts in American history. Unless the insanity stops and soon, our biggest cities will revert to what they were 50 years ago -- broke, dirty and dangerous. On the bright side, we'll have resolved the gentrification problem. So a lot of college professors pat themselves on the back. Peter Kirsanow is a Commissioner in the U.S. Civil Rights Commission and we're happy to have him on the show regularly including tonight. Dr. Kirsanow, thanks so much for coming on.  To the extent to which we've seen this movie before, every day, it makes my head swim. We have seen almost a perfect replay of this. We know what happens if you would just briefly summarize what is almost inevitably going to happen when these riots stop.",

      "sentences": "This has happened so many times. Like you said, this is a repeating movie. We saw it back during the Michael Brown incident, the Freddie Gray incident in Ferguson and Baltimore and now, we're seeing it on steroids. And for a while, shortly after the George Floyd incident, for a few weeks, the left and the media gained some advantage. There was a shift in the political and cultural landscape as a result of their narrative that systemic racism and chaos was abroad. And they thought that that would have a political effect a harm on Trump, but it quickly spiraled out of control.  And that's why, I think as you indicated in your open that the media and the left, don't want to report much about it and they don't want to ascribe at least anything related to systemic racism to this and that's why they have engaged in, effectively a blackout of these incidents. But what we see on the ground is what was predicted after Ferguson, after Baltimore and that is more than double digit spikes in the crime rate. In 36 of the largest 50 cities in the United States, since June, we've had double digit spikes in homicide rates, let alone other types of violent crimes. That's going to persist. Many big cities, if not the majority of big cities have already equaled their 2019 homicide totals by today. Again, eminently predictable and the backlash that the left and the media are witnessing is contributing to the blackout because they're concerned now that because of the insanity related to defund the police, it is now going to redound to the detriment of the left Democrats and it is going to have a cultural impact also, as you indicated. People are going to be fleeing the cities. In inner city neighborhoods, we've seen this over and over and over again, and now, it's metastasizing into the broader environments such as, you know, the magnificent mile in Chicago and more elite neighborhoods. And the left understands, Democrats understand this does not help their candidate in November, and because the media is carrying the water quite blatantly now for the left and for Democrats, they will shut this down.",

This is -- this is different than Ferguson and it is qualitatively and quantitatively different than Ferguson. Again, they actually tried to change the cultural, the sociological landscape, and that's going to take a while to put back the genie back in the bottle to mix metaphors. But that's a real problem for them, especially now because they're trapped. They know they must defeat Trump. They have no way out. They've been riding this for a while, and they don't want to antagonize the Black Lives Matter movement or the far left, by the same token, they know they're alienating just average everyday people who are saying, wait a minute, what happens to me? And here's the real troubling part for Democrats. Eighty one percent of blacks either want police presence to be the same or greater, because it is black neighborhoods as usual that suffer most. Now, it's actually as I said, it's spreading out into other neighborhoods, too. But if just two to three percent of those individuals shift their vote to Trump -- game over.",

You're going to see depression, you're going to see suicides, special needs not taken care of. All of that occurs if the schools don't open. Now, what are these 97,000 kids all have in common? All of them, almost all of them have mild cases. The same time C.D.C. -- and this did not go reported -- 600 kids have been hospitalized since the beginning, way less than adults have been hospitalized. They get much milder cases. Now, what we have to do to reopen the schools of course, is to provide virtual learning for those most at risk, teachers most at risk. We have to have an infrastructure in place. We have to teach our kids about how to take proper precautions. But we need our schools to be centers for learning and centers for socialization and social skills. That will decrease the amount of despair and deaths from non-COVID related causes. We have to test everyone as well, and we should have prodigious testing. Here's one other thing we have to do, sadly. No hugs, please. Now, if you look at this pin, Tucker, you'll see this pin looks like something you might remember. No smoking, please.

      "utterance": "Tucker, good evening to you. We just got some new information from the U.S. Secret Service that says the investigation into a U.S. Secret Service officer involved shooting is ongoing. A male subject and a Secret Service Officer were both transported to a local hospital. At no time during this incident was the White House complex breached or were any of the protectees in danger. It was about 10 minutes to six. I was out on the North Lawn and heard in rapid succession, bam-boom, like that, what sounded like two gunshots. It was going on, the incident at the corner of -- southeast corner of 17th and Pennsylvania Avenue, just on the other side of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. Within a couple of minutes, the Secret Service agent who was stationed here with the President, in the Brady Briefing Room, walked up to the President and said sir, we have to leave. There's been shots fired outside the White House. The President was taken to the area near the Oval Office, where he waited for a few minutes, but wanted, Tucker, to come back into the Briefing Room. You'll remember that when those protests were going on across Lafayette Square across the street from the White House, the President was whisked down to the bunker for a short period of time. The President didn't want to repeat of that, so he got back here to the Brady Briefing Room just as soon as it was possible. Again, according to the Secret Service, at no time did an individual breach the grounds of the White House, at no time were the protectees in danger. There are many of them here at the White House, Tucker, but a Secret Service Officer, a uniformed officer and a suspect both taken to the hospital. No word yet on their condition though one source tell me the injuries do not appear to be life threatening -- Tucker."

      "utterance": "John Roberts, thanks so much for that. Craziness, but it seems now almost normal. Violence is a feature of daily life at this point in the nation's capital. Over the weekend, 21 people were shot in a single incident in Washington. More than half of them were women, one was a D.C. police officer. It was the single biggest mass shooting in America this year, and yet, you probably heard nothing about it. Members of Congress didn't lock arms on the House floor to demand an end to the gun violence. CNN didn't book a procession of weepy teenage gun control activists or extended Town Hall meeting. News organizations barely touched the story, and when they did, they moved on fast. It wouldn't help the Biden campaign to talk about it, so they didn't talk about it. As far as we can tell, neither CNN nor MSNBC even mentioned it today. Twenty one people shot in a group in our capital city and they acted like it didn't happen, but it did happen. We're showing it to you on the screen right now. Twenty one African-Americans shot by a gunman, yet the media spent all weekend telling you about how Simon Cowell fell off his electric bike in Malibu, because really, Black Lives Matter. MSNBC wants you to know that. It's grotesque. But it's now the rule. Dead bodies don't count unless they are politically useful dead bodies. Last month, the gang members shot 15 people outside a funeral home in Chicago. It looked like Fallujah. We played some of the video of it on the show. It was very upsetting. The other channels did not play it. None of the primetime hosts on CNN or MSNBC even mentioned the shooting. They didn't care. Politicians didn't care either. Muriel Bowser is the Mayor of Washington, D.C. Bowser claims to care about black lives very much. She ordered the slogan Black Lives Matter in fact painted in yellow on the road leading to the White House just to underscore how much she cares. So how did Muriel Bowser respond when 21 African-Americans were gunned down in her city? Well, she talked about her coronavirus lockdowns. Bowser has banned gatherings in the city of more than 50 people and apparently there were more than that at the cookout where the shooting occurred. This enraged Muriel Bowser. Here's what the Mayor said about the shooting yesterday, quote, \"It's important as a community that we have zero tolerance for this kind of activity,\" end quote. Now to be perfectly clear, Mayor Bowser was not talking about the mass shootings. When she said we need zero tolerance, Bowser is happy to tolerate violence, she does every day. She often encourages violence. What Bowser won't put up with is citizens violating her lockdown orders. Bowser's Chief of Police, a man called Peter Newsham reiterated that point, quote, \"We can't have these large gatherings in the city,\" the Chief said. In other words, shootings are acceptable as long as the police don't commit them, but disobey our corona decrees and we will come for you. The media wholeheartedly agree with this, of course. Violence does not bother them. They encourage it regularly. Disobedience bothers them. This weekend, motorcycle riders mostly on Harley-Davidsons from all over the country gathered in Sturgis, South Dakota for their annual rally, the Sturgis Rally. Some of them forgot their masks. This outraged our news media. The people on motorcycles were too masculine and too patriotic, and therefore too unlikely to vote for Joe Biden to go un-criticized. So the media spent a lot of the weekend trying to shame the bikers into disappearing. In other words, as some of the poorest people in Washington bled onto the sidewalk, this is what your news anchors talked about."

      "utterance": "Oh, super spreaders. In other words, men who are unapologetically male. They hate that. Meanwhile, the City of Washington back in the real world continue to spiral toward chaos. In Georgetown, one of the richest, most liberal neighborhoods in the city, certainly, in the country, a group of thugs marched on residential streets in the middle of the night to make certain that no one was sleeping. People who live there must have been confused. In Georgetown, Black Lives Matter yard signs are about as common as designer dog breeds -- it is very common. The residents apparently thought they bought themselves peace by paying their indulgences with the correct political slogans, but they hadn't. The fact their neighborhood is still safe is now considered a crime and the mob made that very clear."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Did you see that footage on CNN? Oh, you didn't. You saw footage of super spreaders at Sturgis. How dare they ride motorcycles without masks? Meanwhile, back in Georgetown, again, the real world, just in case the residents here didn't feel sufficiently threatened, the mob then barricaded a key bridge, the Francis Scott Key Bridge. That's the main artery from Georgetown out of the city. Blocking main arteries out of cities is an obvious threat to public safety. It's far more dangerous than any over attended cookout. But police didn't stop it, they helped the mob. And once again, the media collectively ignored all of it. And what exactly did the liberal passive heavily elderly residents of Georgetown do to deserve this kind of abuse and harassment from a mob of Joe Biden voters? That's the core question. But no one on television wanted to talk about that. So again, they just ignored the entire thing. They're doing it all over the country. Story after story, ignored, disappeared down the memory hole because it is politically inconvenient. In Los Angeles, for example, a City Council member called Mike Bonin voted to slash the LAPD budget by $150 million. He is very opposed to the police, but that didn't stop him from calling the police. Since April, it turns out that cops have been called to Bonin's home eight separate times, often to deal with -- surprise, surprise -- protesters. Bonin's defense is that he didn't make the calls. No. Somehow the LAPD with collusion from rightwing elements made the calls. Does that make sense? No, it doesn't make sense. But it's good enough for the newspapers in Los Angeles. They're not covering the story. It's not a story. Right. A guy who votes to defund the police calls them eight times to keep the lunatics from coming through his front door? Not a story. Okay. Last Thursday, meanwhile, in Portland, Oregon, a city that effectively no longer has a government, rioters threw paint on an elderly woman. What was her crime? She made the mistake of trying to stop them from destroying a building. Here's why this is so interesting. As the mob attacked her, they explained their agenda, quote, \"This isn't your world anymore,\" they shouted. \"Put your mask on.\" Boy, does that tell you everything. Meanwhile, in the City of Chicago, rioters have dropped any pretense of ideology. Sure, they'll vote for Joe Biden, obviously, but this isn't about the election. They just want to steal things. And in effect, authorities there, as they are in so many places, are allowing them to do that. Early this morning, caravans of looters sacked stores in downtown Chicago. Here's part of it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "What country is this? And what's the justification for that? There's always a story at the bottom of these things that the media repeat, allow them to believe it was justified. The pretext for that theft and destruction you just saw was a false report that a teenager had been executed by the police. It was a lie as it turned out, it usually is a lie. In fact, a 20-year-old had been killed after shooting at the police. Whatever. We're so used to violence justified by lies that few people seem to notice the difference, and speaking of, just this weekend, Joe Biden honored Michael Brown. That was the man killed in Ferguson, Missouri after he violently attacked a store owner on tape, and then a cop. Joe Biden apparently doesn't remember that part. He seems to consider Michael Brown a martyr. It's hard to know who in America still believes these lies. Most people no longer seem to believe anything they hear from politicians. When everything is political, we learn to trust nothing. But one thing that is real and will always be real is the debris left behind. Bullet holes are real. So are burnt store, so are boarded up windows and terrified neighbors. That will always be real -- and we have it. So what will be the aftermath of all of this? What are America's cities going to look like a year from now? There's no question people flee Georgetown. They may have BLM signs in the driveway, but it doesn't mean they want screaming BLM lunatics on their streets. They don't. Nobody does, actually, no matter what they tell you. No matter what color they are, no one likes that. That's true for people in Georgetown, in Portland, Oregon, in San Francisco and Chicago, New York -- any other place where order and decency have disappeared. People will not live long with chaos. No matter what they tell you. No matter what signs they put in their yard, they will leave and many of them have already left. We are about to see one of the great demographic shifts in American history. Unless the insanity stops and soon, our biggest cities will revert to what they were 50 years ago -- broke, dirty and dangerous. On the bright side, we'll have resolved the gentrification problem. So a lot of college professors pat themselves on the back. Peter Kirsanow is a Commissioner in the U.S. Civil Rights Commission and we're happy to have him on the show regularly including tonight. Dr. Kirsanow, thanks so much for coming on. To the extent to which we've seen this movie before, every day, it makes my head swim. We have seen almost a perfect replay of this. We know what happens if you would just briefly summarize what is almost inevitably going to happen when these riots stop."

      "speaker": "PETER KIRSANOW, COMMISSIONER, U.S. CIVIL RIGHTS COMMISSION",
      "utterance": "This has happened so many times. Like you said, this is a repeating movie. We saw it back during the Michael Brown incident, the Freddie Gray incident in Ferguson and Baltimore and now, we're seeing it on steroids. And for a while, shortly after the George Floyd incident, for a few weeks, the left and the media gained some advantage. There was a shift in the political and cultural landscape as a result of their narrative that systemic racism and chaos was abroad. And they thought that that would have a political effect a harm on Trump, but it quickly spiraled out of control. And that's why, I think as you indicated in your open that the media and the left, don't want to report much about it and they don't want to ascribe at least anything related to systemic racism to this and that's why they have engaged in, effectively a blackout of these incidents. But what we see on the ground is what was predicted after Ferguson, after Baltimore and that is more than double digit spikes in the crime rate. In 36 of the largest 50 cities in the United States, since June, we've had double digit spikes in homicide rates, let alone other types of violent crimes. That's going to persist. Many big cities, if not the majority of big cities have already equaled their 2019 homicide totals by today. Again, eminently predictable and the backlash that the left and the media are witnessing is contributing to the blackout because they're concerned now that because of the insanity related to defund the police, it is now going to redound to the detriment of the left Democrats and it is going to have a cultural impact also, as you indicated. People are going to be fleeing the cities. In inner city neighborhoods, we've seen this over and over and over again, and now, it's metastasizing into the broader environments such as, you know, the magnificent mile in Chicago and more elite neighborhoods. And the left understands, Democrats understand this does not help their candidate in November, and because the media is carrying the water quite blatantly now for the left and for Democrats, they will shut this down."

This is -- this is different than Ferguson and it is qualitatively and quantitatively different than Ferguson. Again, they actually tried to change the cultural, the sociological landscape, and that's going to take a while to put back the genie back in the bottle to mix metaphors. But that's a real problem for them, especially now because they're trapped. They know they must defeat Trump. They have no way out. They've been riding this for a while, and they don't want to antagonize the Black Lives Matter movement or the far left, by the same token, they know they're alienating just average everyday people who are saying, wait a minute, what happens to me? And here's the real troubling part for Democrats. Eighty one percent of blacks either want police presence to be the same or greater, because it is black neighborhoods as usual that suffer most. Now, it's actually as I said, it's spreading out into other neighborhoods, too. But if just two to three percent of those individuals shift their vote to Trump -- game over."

Child abuse, which is going unreported. Lack of vaccinations, immunizations against other diseases like measles. Not getting proper nutrition. You're going to see starvation. You're going to see depression, you're going to see suicides, special needs not taken care of. All of that occurs if the schools don't open. Now, what are these 97,000 kids all have in common? All of them, almost all of them have mild cases. The same time C.D.C. -- and this did not go reported -- 600 kids have been hospitalized since the beginning, way less than adults have been hospitalized. They get much milder cases. Now, what we have to do to reopen the schools of course, is to provide virtual learning for those most at risk, teachers most at risk. We have to have an infrastructure in place. We have to teach our kids about how to take proper precautions. But we need our schools to be centers for learning and centers for socialization and social skills. That will decrease the amount of despair and deaths from non-COVID related causes. We have to test everyone as well, and we should have prodigious testing. Here's one other thing we have to do, sadly. No hugs, please. Now, if you look at this pin, Tucker, you'll see this pin looks like something you might remember. No smoking, please.

She knows a lot about this topic and she joins us tonight. Janice, thanks so much for coming on. I don't want to rub salt in this very fresh wound, but to hear the Governor of New York pass the buck on to the President for his decision. How do you respond to that?"

      "utterance": "He has blamed everybody else except the person that signed the mandate, the order to bring COVID patients into nursing homes and that was Andrew Cuomo. He signed the order. At the very beginning, he said, listen, if you have a problem with what happens in New York, you blame me The buck stops at my desk. He has never taken any responsibility or accountability, and as you just played, he has blamed everyone except himself. God, Mother Nature, he's blamed Fox News. He's blamed \"The New York Post,\" Mother Nature -- it never ends. And today, he continued to blame Fox News and says there doesn't need to be an independent investigation because the last investigation was done by himself into his administration, and of course, he came up clean. The people to blame were the nursing care workers and the visitors. And by the way, we weren't allowed to visit my in-laws before they died. So I don't believe that one."

They were actually August the 3rd, last Monday. And today, they couldn't fit me in last Monday, but they said that they would put me on today to give me my five minutes to talk about my in-laws and why I hold the Governor partly responsible for their deaths. That invitation was rescinded, after you know, I was told that the Chair said you will have your five minutes and I never got that today. So I thank you, Tucker, for being good on your word and having me on your program today."

      "utterance": "Absolutely. Thank you. Well, Joe Biden, once you get underneath the man and into what he is actually proposing, has backed a series of proposals that the overwhelming majority of Americans disagree with. We're not talking about those proposals very often. Why not? That's next. By the way, we are all waiting for Joe Biden to pick his running mate. That is likely to happen sometime this week. To restate, we are hearing once again what we told you last week that Susan Rice is the front runner for that job. It doesn't mean it's going to happen. But as of right now, it looks like Susan Rice is the front runner for that job. Of course we'll tell you when we learn more. We'll be right back."

      "utterance": "America just got a lot poorer and a lot more dangerous. People are very worried about those two problems. But over on the Joe Biden campaign, a major focus remains transgender issues, whatever you think of that category of concerns, it doesn't apply to many Americans. And yet a draft Democratic platform obtained by \"The Washington Examiner\" shows that the word \"transgender\" appears more often than the word \"inequality\" or the word \"taxes.\" Joe Biden supports allowing biological men for example, to compete against biological women in sports. Polls show most Americans overwhelmingly oppose this idea. It hurts their daughters. So why isn't the Trump campaign mentioning this? One campaign claims men can get pregnant, which is insane. And the other campaign doesn't say anything about it. Well, POLITICO reports that top advisers to the campaign are reluctant to talk about it because it's embarrassing. So it goes unchallenged. Terry Schilling is the Executive Director of the American Principles Project. He's not embarrassed by it. He thinks it matters. He joins us tonight. Terry, thanks so much for coming on."

      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "So, this is not a question of sexual liberation or lie and let live. This is a question of denying Science: Biology and changing the definition of biological sex. That's the foundation of all human society. So it's not really a small issue. Okay? It's a big issue. Why isn't the reelection campaign mentioning this?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCHILLING",
      "utterance": "Look, Tucker, the thing about this issue is it -- frankly, I don't know why people aren't picking this up. We just got done with a poll. We surveyed over 7,000 voters in the top 10 swing states across the country. We found that three quarters of Americans, including 53 percent of Joe Biden's own supporters oppose allowing transgendered boys, that's boys that identify as girls to compete in women's athletics. This is a super majority. So, you know, first and foremost, as a political activist, I'm very concerned about their lack of willingness to take this issue on, but frankly, as a father, you know, Tucker, I've got five kids, and hopefully my wife will give me four or five more, but my two oldest are girls. And frankly, you know, the idea that these guys are going to allow my daughters who are both athletes have their scholarships and their athletic opportunities taken away, it is incredibly stupid. And we need to push the Republican Party to run hard on these issues because there's no losing this whatsoever."

      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "It's not about attacking people who choose to call themselves whatever they choose to call themselves, it is fine. I think most Americans are very tolerant in that way. But the idea that we have to pretend there is no difference between men and women, boys and girls, is totally insane. So why would we sit back and let people force us to nod as they say something we all know is false?"

You know, all of these political organizations, they organize gun owners and seniors, but no one is there defending the family. And we decided to put this campaign together and not ask permission, you know, and that's what we're doing here. We're running the ads. We are forcing issue and we're going to show them how to attack Joe Biden and get some political points out there."

Sometimes even at the airport when I'm trapped there, I'll go -- if only there was something like CNN that would be on that would just incessantly tell me how evil America is. By the way, a CNN host saying there's no anti-Trump network. You're denying your existence. You're cheap. That's like Neil Armstrong -- that's like Neil Armstrong denying the moon landing or McDonald's denying the existence of hamburgers. You know, you exist -- it exists and you produce it daily. It's a massive industry and CNN is a hood ornament. It's why Mary Trump didn't need a publicist when you have Jeff Zucker pushing the book. By the way, I don't get why they deny this. It's their special sauce. This is like France denying mimes and you know mimes -- just denying mimes. But if you took -- if you took all of the anti-Trump content from CNN, all you would have left is a case of empty Botox cartridges outside Don Lemon's dressing room."

Think about all the things that CNN denies. They actually mocked and they laughed at the rise in shootings in Chicago. Wasn't it like three weeks ago? Do you remember that three or four weeks ago? They deny the looting. They like to conflate the looting and the vandalism with peaceful protest. And then they accuse others of that crime. They deny that Joe Biden is crumbling before their very eyes. I mean, instead they say, look, he can ride a bike. He can ride a bike. Fantastic. It's strange."
