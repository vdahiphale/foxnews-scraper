I'm Tammy Bruce in for Laura Ingraham this evening, and this is a special edition of the \"Ingraham Angle: Fear and Loathing in America.\" Now tonight, liberal policies leading to a spike in crimes. We're going to show you a graphic video of a brutal mob attack on a teen girl in New York City. Plus, Ari Fleischer and Chadwick Moore are here to expose the worst media offenders of the week. We've got our eyes on you guys.  And Hollywood celebrities may need some grief counseling now that their savior Elizabeth Warren is out of the race. Actor Robert Davi is here to comment about that.  Also, new day details on why we cannot trust China, especially when it comes to the coronavirus.  But first today Hulu released, what is possibly the least anticipated and most self-indulgent documentary series ever, and guess who with stars - Hillary Clinton. Now no one actually on Earth has ever asked for this series to be made. I'm going to guess that perhaps, obviously, Hillary probably did. So it's basically a vanity project for the Clintons who are some of the biggest grifters to ever live in the White House. So, of course, Hillary had a ball filming it. She even took the time to go after Bernie Sanders.",

Harmeet with this documentary coming out, and you've heard Juanita's response, what is your take on everything that's happening now?  HARMEET DHILLON, TRUMP 2020 ADVISORY BOARD MEMBER: Well, what can I say? The narrative today that that Elizabeth Warren could not get the nomination for the Democrats, because they are sexist, belies this very history. Their prior nominee was a woman. A woman who was an apologist for a rapist and a sexual harasser for decades. So I don't think that's the problem. And I think the democrats need to come to their double - grips with their double standard on this issue.

In 2004, when he was promoting his biography, he said the reason that he had that affair with Monica Lewinsky and did what he did, was because he could. Now, I'm going to believe that answer, right, as opposed to this one.

HARMEET DHILLON, TRUMP 2020 ADVISORY BOARD MEMBER: Well, what can I say? The narrative today that that Elizabeth Warren could not get the nomination for the Democrats, because they are sexist, belies this very history. Their prior nominee was a woman. A woman who was an apologist for a rapist and a sexual harasser for decades. So I don't think that's the problem.

Also up were burglaries more than 21 percent. Grand larcenies. I was in the subway last night. And a man waited for the train to approach through a shopping cart on the track.

Black, New Hampshire not - You know, so for Michael Moore to say this, the working man's hero, that was the tests of black American voters. That's why I think the DNC was putting more emphasis on South Carolina, rightfully so. And look at that, that's probably the most racist thing I've ever heard him say."

You care, you should be the Surgeon General. And it's only because of the party you belong to, regardless of the facts. And that's where the bias comes in. Whoopi, of course, is biased.

She wants a safe space for all, tweeting \"To the people who fought for Elizabeth Warren, you owe no one anything right now.

The Grand Princess was under scrutiny because seven passengers on the ship's previous cruise to Mexico tested positive for coronavirus. One of them, an elderly man, died, and several dozen passengers along with crewmembers who went on the Mexico cruise remained on the ship for this cruise. And we just learned another passenger on the Grand Princess cruise to Mexico is now confirmed to be Hawaiian first case of coronavirus. Meantime, both New York and California have seen an increase in the number of cases, and officials in both states have complained about a lack of test kits. But the CDC and the administration dispute that, saying a million kits have been distributed, and a million more are on their way to any state that needs them. There are currently 290 cases of coronavirus in the U.S., 14 people have died. Tammy?"

Dr. Wachs, let's start with you, and thank you both for joining me tonight, I appreciate it. Given what Secretary Pompeo has just said, and us knowing as Americans and as regular people, really, can we believe anything that has been coming out of China on the virus issue?"

And it has been very frustrating because even with the pattern of the number of cases that seem to go from zero to tens of thousands, many of us in the medical field are scratching our heads as to, are we getting the full story? And in terms of the source, whether it was from a bat or whether from a snake or whether it was from a nearby lab, you would think China would want to work with us and give us the information so we could help accelerate the vaccine. At the fact they haven't kind of shows that they are holding back."

Dr. Oskoui, for you, especially also as a cardiologist, you're looking at respiratory issues, et cetera. And the value of knowing how many people are actually affected by something, for the medical community, how important is that when we talk about the spread? And what does that mean?"

      "speaker": "DR. RAMIN OSKOUI, CARDIOLOGIST",

We know, for instance, that SARS in 2003 almost exclusively affected those of northeast Asian dissent. We need to know the age of these people. We need to know, do they have diabetes, emphysema, are they otherwise immunosuppressed? Taiwan, democratic Taiwan has done an excellent job in terms of messaging. The health minister is on TV every single day. They have a website where people can see where these individuals are. It's actually served to calm fears and help people. And I think information is power. We have seen hoarding. We have seen bad behavior by U.S. citizens, but it's understandable."

    {
      "speaker": "BRUCE",
      "utterance": "But it's just been awful, some of the reactions. And the president's reaction, at first, while it was ridiculed, really has given us a window with which to breathe in a way. It has kept it from becoming a dynamic emergency within the chaotic framework, and gave us some chance to be able to look at what was happening. But I want you both to listen to an HHS undersecretary who gave us this idea about what the numbers really might be when it comes to the mortality rate. Let's play that."

      "speaker": "ADM. BRETT GIROIR, ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR HEALTH AT HHS",
      "utterance": "The best estimates now of the overall mortality rate for COVID-19 is somewhere between 0.1 percent and one percent, OK. That is lower than you heard probably in many reports."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BRUCE",
      "utterance": "And Dr. Wachs, obviously that is based in this presumption, because the Chinese are not being honest about how widespread it is, that it may in fact, we're learning, may have been even in America and around the world longer than we thought, that more people are affected who are symptomless or have already recovered. And as a result, the mortality rate itself goes down, isn't that right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WACHS",
      "utterance": "Absolutely, yes. And remember, we haven't been able to test. It took a while to get these test kits, these RNA test kits that take a lot more than just a few weeks to make. And so we believe it was probably here, and we couldn't test it, so we didn't have numbers."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BRUCE",
      "utterance": "And that's the other thing, Dr. Oskoui, about China, and the notion of the demographics, even if we didn't have numbers for Europe or numbers for the United States, they had numbers. They would have an idea of the spread of it, and the kinds of people affected, the issue of pollution in China, certainly like pollution in Iran, the rate of smoking, individuals who still spoke, like men in China smoking, so the respiratory ailment framework of course works even more quickly, correct?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "OSKOUI",
      "utterance": "Correct. We can probably estimate, though, that they started in China probably in late October. And given its peak, we will probably see it peak in the United States in late April, early May. But unfortunately, we don't have that data, data that they clearly have. This is the most sophisticated surveillance state in the history of the world. We need that data. The world needs that data. Right now, some of the best data we have actually isn't from the United States. It is actually from Imperial College, London. Neil Ferguson has done some excellent work."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BRUCE",
      "utterance": "And both of you, thank you very much. We know that the Israelis are working on the vaccine. The data we need when it comes to coronaviruses is general, but this in particular certainly.

But the difference is, we're wreaking havoc on global and domestic economies."
    },

      "speaker": "BRUCE",

But really responding to this idea that this is really perhaps like the flu, but as we have seen, it is manifesting as pneumonia and really wreaking havoc on the elderly and people with pre-existing respiratory infections. Those are the people I think, it is becoming apparent, are in particular trouble. Joining me now is Congressman Ken Buck. Those kinds of comments, I suppose, could spread some panic. We know that the media gives us these headlines about the spread without perspective. Congressman, do you think that is important when it comes to is it just about the fact in the moment, or is there more important element to be discussed, including the broader perspective of what is really happening?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REP. KEN BUCK (R-CO)",
      "utterance": "I think the broadest perspective is very important. I am very happy that Vice President Pence is addressing America as often as he is and reassuring America about the spread of this disease and what is being done to make sure that we are combating this disease. It is a serious issue, and it's an issue that I think the administration, and I really see a lot of the states coming together and moving beyond politics. And so I think the American people are somewhat reassured. I think there is still a sense of panic, but it certainly doesn't help when someone at CNBC makes a statement like that. I think it is an ignorant statement."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BRUCE",
      "utterance": "And especially when we have the flu, which is very widespread, right. We are in the middle of flu season. We've had I think this year at this point 18,000 people have died. A couple weeks ago at the height of coronavirus panic over 100 children died here in the United States from the flu, 283,000 Americans have been hospitalized since the beginning of the 2019-20 flu season. At least 29 million people have the flu, so when we think about this, congressman, these remarkable numbers, and Americans go about their lives because we know, and we wash our hands, and the information for coronavirus is the silver lining is able to help us defeat the flu as well. But it really does show that a lot of this may be political when it comes to attacks on the president. He was ridiculed for the work he did in the beginning which I think kept this from becoming an immediate emergency in this country. Do you think politics has infused some of this conversation?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BUCK",
      "utterance": "I work on Capitol Hill, and I see politics every day. And unfortunately, I see people that try to make political gain out of things that they should not try to make political gain out of. And to try to lay this issue, which starts in China, comes to the United States and is being handled as well as we could possibly hope, to try to lay this at the president's feet is unfair. And I think most people have seen three years of unfair treatment by the Democrats of this president, and I think they are immune to the kind of attacks that the Democrats are now making."
