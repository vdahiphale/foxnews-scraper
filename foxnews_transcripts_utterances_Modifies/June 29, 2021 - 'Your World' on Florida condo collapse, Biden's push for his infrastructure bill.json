He shared these photos with The Miami Herald in the ground level garage, as well as the pool equipment room, two days before the building collapsed, showing cracks in concrete and severely corroded rebar under the pool. He also said there was standing water all over the parking garage. A spokesman for the condo association released this: \"The board retained experts and trusted experts, and at no time were they told of imminent threat of danger or collapse.\" All eight of the state's urban search-and-rescue teams are on site using cameras, dogs, sonar, robots, tunneling and looking for pockets where a resident could still be alive. One block north of the Champlain Towers South is its sister building, the Champlain Towers North, built by the same developer at the same time in the early '80s with a similar design, and all the same materials. Well, concerned and worried residents there have decided to hire an engineering firm, which today spending hours inspecting that building thoroughly.

And it was an incredible scene, as it still persists to be an incredible scene. And these guys are incredible heroes. They don't stop working 24 hours a day, and, I'm telling you, in the worst conditions. We had a fire there. We had a constant fire with the smoke, the inhalation, the -- trying to put it out with water. And then the rain has not seized.

And we stopped and looked. And that was the day that baby was rescued a week-and-a-half in. I think it was eight or nine days.

But the issue keeps coming up from studies and surveys and problems that have popped up before, some dating back years.

I studied land subsidence in the entire city of Miami Beach and Surfside for a different purpose. The purpose is to understand why we have so much flooding. Since the mid-2000s, there was a significant increase in flooding in the Miami Beach. And so we try to understand what contribute to that, how much the contribution is due to sea level rise and how much is due to land subsidence, because flooding occurred. It was these two processes together. So, for that, we used the data that was acquired from European satellites in the 1990s. The study itself was done in the past five years, and it was published last year. So, we didn't focus on any particular building,. We studied all the buildings in that area. And we found a different area where we had subsidence. Most of the areas were in the western part of the city, which is expected, because that part of the city was built on reclaimed wetlands. So, when you have been soil and building afterwards, there is some subsidence. But we found one particular case in the eastern part of the city, which is supposed to be stable. So we reported about that. So we didn't -- we didn't look in a particular building. It just came out when we look at the results of the radar from space, that that building was subsiding at the rate of two millimeter per year, which is very small. And we cannot see it with our eyes, but it can be detected with certain instruments like the radar from space.",

Biden says the infrastructure plan will rebuild thousands of bridges, as more than half of the country's bridges right now are more than 50 years old. It also aims to create 35,000 electric buses, get rid of lead pipes, clean and cap old gas wells, make high-speed Internet accessible for everyone, and position America to better compete with China, who the president says is way outworking us.

One of the most important things that Biden does have in this bill, two aspects, broadband and railways. But the issue is, you can't just build new train lines or extend existing train lines and expect the traffic to follow. And where progressives like Ritchie Torres in Congress do get it right is that you have an affordable housing issue, and you have a land use issue.

We have -- it just happened that this disaster occurred in the area where you saw Team 1 to Florida, which is one of the most renowned known teams in the world of search-and-rescue. And they were on the building immediately. When that call went out, basically, a part when -- they asked and send everybody. At that moment, when police arrived, and they saw the destruction, it was incredible. And we have had the very best working, and 35 people immediately accounted for and worked and rescued. And it was an incredible scene, as it still persists to be an incredible scene. And these guys are incredible heroes. They don't stop working 24 hours a day, and, I'm telling you, in the worst conditions. We had a fire there. We had a constant fire with the smoke, the inhalation, the -- trying to put it out with water. And then the rain has not seized. We have between 50 and 60 percent chance of rain almost every day, and we have had rain. And then when it's not raining, it's incredible heat. So every condition that could be possible negative to these men and women that are working so hard had -- they have endured them. And their hope is still to find people alive. And you -- when you talk to them and be able to share a little time with them, they will tell you that they have a lot of hope.

We had teams, all the state of Florida teams, teams from abroad, the Israeli teams. I think the Mexican teams are coming in, and people that have all the experience in the world when it comes to these type of building collapses. But I will tell you, as far as what that hope is concerned, Neil, when I went to the earthquake disaster in Haiti, when we got there, that we were taking a lot of supplies, medical supplies, and so on, as we were driving by, there was a -- we see a big commotion of people like jumping up and down and stuff. And we stopped and looked. And that was the day that baby was rescued a week-and-a-half in. I think it was eight or nine days. And that was a baby, the most innocent little baby, and was rescued under a pile. And so there is -- I believe God is strong. And the will and the faith that these people have, hopefully, hopefully, we could find people alive. And that's our hope. That's the hope that we have."

But the issue keeps coming up from studies and surveys and problems that have popped up before, some dating back years. And to this next fellow, Shimon Wdowinski, a Florida International University Institute of Environment professor there who had detected back in the 1990s that the building might have been sinking at the rate of a couple of millimeters a year. He joins us right now. Professor, thank you very, very much. Were you commissioned at the time to do this work, to study this particular building at the time? Was this part of a look at other buildings in the area?"

      "utterance": "Good afternoon. And thanks for having me. My study was very different in the focus and the way it's been conducted. I studied land subsidence in the entire city of Miami Beach and Surfside for a different purpose. The purpose is to understand why we have so much flooding. Since the mid-2000s, there was a significant increase in flooding in the Miami Beach. And so we try to understand what contribute to that, how much the contribution is due to sea level rise and how much is due to land subsidence, because flooding occurred. It was these two processes together. So, for that, we used the data that was acquired from European satellites in the 1990s. The study itself was done in the past five years, and it was published last year. So, we didn't focus on any particular building,. We studied all the buildings in that area. And we found a different area where we had subsidence. Most of the areas were in the western part of the city, which is expected, because that part of the city was built on reclaimed wetlands. So, when you have been soil and building afterwards, there is some subsidence. But we found one particular case in the eastern part of the city, which is supposed to be stable. So we reported about that. So we didn't -- we didn't look in a particular building. It just came out when we look at the results of the radar from space, that that building was subsiding at the rate of two millimeter per year, which is very small. And we cannot see it with our eyes, but it can be detected with certain instruments like the radar from space."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "WDOWINSKI",
      "utterance": "Well, we notified, but we notified the people who deal with sea level, sea level rise and the hazard, the sustainability about land subsidence, because that was the focus of our study. It wasn't studies that focused on buildings. It's just a byproduct of these technologies that we can measure buildings that move. So, we notified about our study to the right community, which is the community with sea level rise."

It was a very smart journalist from USA Today who did find my study, and looked and he saw that it occurred -- that we marked over there that building. So, he contact me. It was Thursday morning. And he asked me, is it correct? And I looked again in our publication, and I confirmed that. He reported it in his paper. And since then, everybody got interested."

He touted that bipartisan infrastructure deal, saying it's the U.S. government's biggest investment ever in roads and bridges, in public transit, and clean drinking water and many other areas of daily life, including high-speed Internet. President Biden says this is -- quote -- \"a blue-collar blueprint to rebuild America and will create new kinds of jobs with dignity for years to come,\" primarily jobs that don't require a four-year or even two-year degree. Biden says the infrastructure plan will rebuild thousands of bridges, as more than half of the country's bridges right now are more than 50 years old. It also aims to create 35,000 electric buses, get rid of lead pipes, clean and cap old gas wells, make high-speed Internet accessible for everyone, and position America to better compete with China, who the president says is way outworking us.

Let's get the read on that with Tiana Lowe of The Washington Examiner, our own Charlie Gasparino. Guys, thank you for joining me. Tiana, what's the problem the president has with the left?

But there is a case to be made that this is a very brute force bill. America has some of the best bridges and roads in the OECD, in terms of failure rate and in terms of quality. One of the most important things that Biden does have in this bill, two aspects, broadband and railways. But the issue is, you can't just build new train lines or extend existing train lines and expect the traffic to follow. And where progressives like Ritchie Torres in Congress do get it right is that you have an affordable housing issue, and you have a land use issue. This is something where Biden would be wise to consider tethering that federal funding to de-zoning and to allowing more housing density attached to those train lines, because, otherwise, you just have trains to nowhere."

By the way, when was the last time an infrastructure bill really -- we have been talking about infrastructure bills so much. We keep implementing them. And we still have allegedly lousy roads and bridges. I mean, it's just -- it's funny just how much money federally we spend on this and how and how bad the outcome is. And there's a lot of reasons for that, namely, that it's probably not that bad to begin with. State and local localities are supposed to do most of this. Be that as it may, Republicans, it's something to talk about. They will spend money on roads and bridges. Where I think the -- where the Republicans aren't going to go on board with any of this is the tax increases and on the Green New Deal stuff -- type stuff. And that's why it was, in my view, smart to break it up. And I can understand why AOC is and the left is that sort of tone-deaf to this thing. If you break it up, you could probably get both things through, right? You get this one through. Then you do the stuff the Republicans aren't going to do on--"

Breaking it up what it made it a lot more tenable, because now you have the progressive wing of the Democratic Party saying, we aren't going to go forward with a bipartisan bill unless we get a guaranteed massive reconciliation bill, which really puts Biden in a bind, because he either alienates the centrist Republicans who he requires to get this passed through, even in reconciliation, and the left, that it's threatening to nuke the bipartisan bill."

So, most scientists believe that, being that the world is contracting somewhat, you can go from one end of the planet to the other within a day, that, yes, we are going to have another pandemic. And the point is that we need to get to the origins of this virus and where it came from in China. It seems to be most likely the Wuhan lab. And I think, eventually, we're going to know."

You can't go across the borders, for example, in Malaysia or in parts of the Far East like Thailand. And we know that Australia is having lockdown now and that New Zealand is being very, very careful with their borders. So, this is a concern. Of course, these viruses do mutate.

And we have transformed policing in many, many parts of the country, maybe not all. Now, what is community policing? It's not too complicated. But you build a relationship between police and people of mutual respect. I want to repeat that, a relationship of mutual respect. The community respects the police and the police respect the community. And it has worked spectacularly well in those places where it's been attempted. One of them, I'm happy to say, is the city of Boston, which has the lowest homicide rate in America, Neil. I want to repeat that. Boston has the lowest homicide rate in America. And what has it done? It strongly committed itself to a relationship between its police and the community that was positive, strong, that got police officers out of their patrol cars and into the streets and into the community with their citizens. And it's made a huge difference. And it's not just Boston. It's lots and lots of places. An important fact, even with the pandemic and -- all the problems -- we have got a lot of it - - violence in Boston this year is down a little bit from last year. So, this works. But you got to work at it. You have got to train police. Police themselves have got to be committed to this. And I'm happy to say that, in many, many communities in the country, they are, and it's made a huge difference."

I'm not here to play politics with it. But I am curious, Governor, about whether you're sending a signal to Democrats, if you let this issue go, or you start running on the defund police movement, you're burnt. Is that what you're saying; you're going to repeat my sins?"

It's a commitment to this idea of community policing, which is important, it's relevant, whether you're talking about small towns or big cities. And we have seen it work.

They may have been the sole provider of their families as well. If they had come here illegally or overstayed their welcome, then they were deported. But these are individuals that maybe even had children here who weren't able to petition for them to stay. And then, aside from all the others, there might actually be grounds for asylum. Maybe when they have returned to their mother country, they are now under siege, or they have political opponents in their country of origin which could pose a physical threat to their safety, which will then allow them to seek asylum in the United States. So, there are varying, shifting sands when it comes to reasons why individuals who have been deported may be able to actually return to the United States."

Well, those individuals, if they do petition to return, most of them are not allowed back into the country. But if they're individuals that have overstayed their welcome, and they're seeking some other reasons why to come back to the United States, it has happened. In fact, years ago -- this is back in my college days -- I used to help individuals seeking asylum, whether they have overstayed their welcome, and they're back in their mother -- their country of origin, or they have been deported as a result of an expired visa or whatnot. These are cases that I actually worked on. So, yes, it's absolutely possible. And it really depends on, once the paperwork is done and before - - when they come before the AOJ at the Immigration Nationalization Office what ends up happening to their petition."

      "speaker": "COLWIN",
      "utterance": "Well, it would really be individuals that were either they had already been subject as physical violence, they have either been in prison -- these are the cases that I have worked on. But these are the cases that I can tell you just generally are the more successful asylum cases that are permitted here. So, if their lives are threatened, if they have been -- they have already been in prison, if they have had physical assaults by members of the government or law enforcement, if they fall into categories where, in their particular country of origin, they are at particular risk, for individuals, for countries that, say, where homosexuality is criminal, and their lives are at risk as a result. So, there are definite reasons why individuals can seek asylum, and they can do so successfully. And -- but let me -- and to your point, though, Neil, they are heavily scrutinized."

We are really -- we don't have any structural damages as of now. And we're hoping that we are a very good building, which we actually have been taking care of our building for many years. And it's very well-attended, and renovation has been done. We never neglected our building, and thanks to our board of directors. But definitely all this situation is very shaky and very unstable for everybody who lives on the coastline. We would like to have more research done. We would like to have more answers to our questions, whether it's safe our children in the future. I don't know if anybody can answer this.

And then we started being awoken by our friends telling us that this happened. So we didn't even know, unless -- until we figured out we didn't have electricity and water. And this could happen from natural disaster as well. It could be tornado. It could be some terrible storm. It happened before. So we could -- it's unimaginable tragedy, what happened, because, immediately, of course, we have some friends there. And my little boy has a 7-year-old girl who he used to play with and so forth. So we want to express our sympathy to all of the people in the south building.
