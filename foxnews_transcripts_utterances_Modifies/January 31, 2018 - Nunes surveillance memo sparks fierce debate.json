We are committed to working with the appropriate oversight entities to ensure the continuing integrity of the FISA process.

As expressed during our initial review, we have grave concerns about material omissions of fact that fundamentally impact the memo's accuracy.\" To which the House Intel Chair, Devin Nunes, responded with this statement, \"The memo contains all the relevant facts on FISA abuse. After fighting our demands for these documents for months, the FBI and DOJ now seem to be going through a series of increasingly ridiculous, increasingly desperate excuses to avoid transparency.\"  So where are we on all this and what does that mean?

But I would just note that at this point what is really the other option? Are we just going to pretend that this hasn't happened, this national discussion isn't ongoing and we are not going to see what's in the memo? If someone wants to talk about undermining faith in institutions it would seem to me that withdrawing Congress' ability and obligation to do oversight here and then hoping that this just goes away is the worst of all options. The better option is for her to come out. Democrats can respond, the FBI can add the contacts they think is necessary, and the American people can finally know there is a presidency at stake here.",

But the FBI has expressed concerns about the contents of the memo repeatedly on more than one occasion. Even today the Department of Justice, Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, indicated that he shared those concerns that the FBI had. And the question I think, the broader question here is and the question I think is reinforced by what Senator Feinstein said is why isn't the case that there is no unified document that comes out potentially from the Republicans and the Democrats articulating what concerns there may be with the FISA process and have that be the thing that is presented to the public instead of what is admittedly I think on all sides the work product of the Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee.",

I think people need to see. We have two big questions over all this -- did Donald Trump collude with the Russians to steal the election in 2016, and did the FBI and DOJ put their fingers on the scale? Now, remember this is also, Christopher Wray in his testimony for confirmation spoke about how he couldn't give Congress information because it was classified. This gets this backwards.

The point that was just made, Congress has oversight here. These are not a separate and independent branch of government. And so that's why I think the transparency issue here doesn't seem to me to be a worthwhile counterargument. I'm not seeing it, especially given that they are saying we need our own memo to come out.
