I'm Laura Ingraham, this is The Ingraham Angle from New York City tonight. The radical new Democrats are out for blood. But Pelosi is standing in their way. This is getting better and better. Congressman Devin Nunes's here to sound off on the impeachment game of the Left plus with word tonight that Biden is jumping into the 2020 race, I'm so having.  Someone should tell the Democrats that their two front runners are now white men with a combined age of 153, that's good if you're a first growth Bordeaux though, that's great. That debate and highlights from today's wacky Biden event with the firefighters, if you missed it, wait right here and an important Ingraham Angle update for you.  Portland state is now responding to this show after we covered the anti- free speech thugs at their school last week, you would want to stick around for that. But first, the elites admitting privileges, that's the focus of tonight's Angle.  We've heard a lot about white privilege lately from the social justice crowd now this idea that whiteness itself can be an asset, a proxy for class or other social privilege. But today we saw what the real abusive privilege looks like. When elites of different ethnic backgrounds and races use their money to buy status. Educational status that is for their children. What do Manuel Henriquez, CEO of Hercules Capital; Doug Hodge, former Chief Operating Officer of PIMCO; actresses Felicity Huffman; Lori Loughlin and Gordon Caplan, co-Chair of the power house international law firm, Willkie Farr; all have in common? They were among the 33 parents and 9 athletic coaches across the country charged in a $25 million bribery scheme to get their kids into top colleges.",

These parents are a catalog of wealth and privilege. This case is about the widening corruption of elite college admissions to the steady application of wealth combined with fraud.

Professional education consultants don't say I can get you into a specific, particular college.\"  Well part of the Singer magic was allegedly having expert test takers take ACT and SAT test for his clients and also the added bonus of photo shopping applicants heads on to random athletic looking bodies. Now in The New York Times piece about this, the focus was partly on how today's high pressure application environment effects this. \"The charges underscored how college admissions have become so cut throat and competitive that some have sought to break the rules.\"  Well, guess what? The process has been super competitive for decades, especially since universities have increased admissions of foreign students. And this is no excuse though for gaming the system and in this case, that's just breaking the rules but breaking the law.",

That's what I call a desperate housewife, apparently driven to desperate and illegal measures and just a few years earlier by the way, Huffman was tweeting this photo of herself, demanding respect and equality. You see that hashtag about our daughter's. I guess that equality though wouldn't apply to the girls applying opposite of her daughters for the same college slot. Well, here's how I see all of this. There was a time when colleges used to mostly admit on merit, mainly test scores plus athletics and extra-curriculars. Then they started various legal forms of corruption, legacy admissions, lowered standards for athletes, admission for big donors and of course affirmative action.  But this latest bus takes the corruption to an entirely new level where the elites played the process, turning what was a partial scam into a full scale racket. Once college admissions is perceived as a scam, well guess, what it attracts scam artists and the solution is to bust these scammers but also to reconsider the legal schemes, the elites have used and abused for years which only hurts the hard working qualified kids who deserve admission like the prosecutor said.  The reputation of elite colleges was built on merit and these institutions were envisioned as rungs for those with the qualifications to climb up that ladder. They were not supposed to be clubs for the elites. Now we need to return to the principle of merit based admission again. Make the lawbreakers pay in this case but also it's time to look at the institutionalized abuses of the admissions process across the board, especially since a lot of these schools are being subsidized in one way or another by the taxpayers. And that's the Angle.   All right, joining me now, Harmeet Dhillon, Attorney and Republican Party official. Dan Lee is the co-founder of Solomon Admissions and Christopher Hunt is a college essay consultant for College Essay Mentor. All right, guys, Harmeet, I don't know who this story is more damaging to, universities who've moved you know, far left than obviously this is terrible for them or the elites who are so desperate to get their kids into what they think are the best schools ever and I think to myself, is it worth going to jail? Is this really worth it and what really is going on here?",

So these kids are already spoiled brats just to be very frank and you know, they weren't expected to excel apparently. The parents are waiting until, oh my God, now it's time to go to college and maybe they weren't thinking about it earlier.

The reason that the scam was able to go on is that there's set aside in each of these top schools for sports and apparently, there's no actual standards, they don't check whether they're actually good at this sports or anything like that.

Only the media relations department ever got back to us. As promised, we followed up on this story, and we asked Portland State officials today if there had been any arrests or any kind of action taken against that protester. Well, we received another statement. Quote, \"The individual who disrupted the meeting is not a current student at Portland State. If he was a student, he would be subject to PSU's student code of conduct that has sanctions for violating rules governing student conduct.\" Now remember, police stood by for an hour while this man tried to derail a conservative event. The university says that protester, though, didn't break any laws. Free-speech experts, however, still beg to differ. And after a prominent Greenpeace Canada member took climate alarmists to task this morning on \"FOX and Friends,\" President Trump quoted him on Twitter. In response, the media immediately we lack jackals on the president. The independent U.K. blaring \"Trump repeats false claim.\" A CNN headline called the president's tweet his \"latest denial of science.\" \"Huffington Post\" claims Trump parrots anti-science misinformation. But is that accurate? Well, we put that question to a man who studied climate change for 35 years. Greg Wrightstone is a geologist and author of the book \"Inconvenient Facts, The Science that Al Dore Does Not Want You to Know.\" It should be noted that Apple approved an app that he built for this book, but then they pulled it down. Greg, I want to begin this, with this dire warning about carbon. The United Nations recently issued a warning that the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was at levels not seen in 3 million years. That's a long time, Greg. That sounds scary. So why are you denying the impact of this? You denier. GREG WRIGHTSTONE, AUTHOR, \"INCONVENIENT FACTS\": Yes, well, the fact of the matter is we increased carbon dioxide by about 120 parts per million since the beginning of the industrial revolution. We are a little over 400 now. To put that in perspective, throughout earth's history prior to our current period, the average CO2 levels on earth were 2,600 parts per million, six and half times what they are right now, and earth thrived. So this is really a minor increase in carbon dioxide. It really needs to be put in that long-term perspective, and we see it's really just a blip. And the other thing is that when I'm talking around the country, my talks usually center around how rising temperatures and increasing CO2 are benefiting the earth and humanity. We see tremendous benefits from increasing CO2. CO2 fertilization effect is benefiting the plants.",

He pled guilty today and is cooperating. ‘The Sacramento Bee' quoting a local college admissions counselor, Margaret Ammot saying, \"Singer would tell parents that he could get their child into the college of their choice. Professional education consultants don't say I can get you into a specific, particular college.\" Well part of the Singer magic was allegedly having expert test takers take ACT and SAT test for his clients and also the added bonus of photo shopping applicants heads on to random athletic looking bodies. Now in The New York Times piece about this, the focus was partly on how today's high pressure application environment effects this. \"The charges underscored how college admissions have become so cut throat and competitive that some have sought to break the rules.\" Well, guess what? The process has been super competitive for decades, especially since universities have increased admissions of foreign students. And this is no excuse though for gaming the system and in this case, that's just breaking the rules but breaking the law."

That's what I call a desperate housewife, apparently driven to desperate and illegal measures and just a few years earlier by the way, Huffman was tweeting this photo of herself, demanding respect and equality. You see that hashtag about our daughter's. I guess that equality though wouldn't apply to the girls applying opposite of her daughters for the same college slot. Well, here's how I see all of this. There was a time when colleges used to mostly admit on merit, mainly test scores plus athletics and extra-curriculars. Then they started various legal forms of corruption, legacy admissions, lowered standards for athletes, admission for big donors and of course affirmative action. But this latest bus takes the corruption to an entirely new level where the elites played the process, turning what was a partial scam into a full scale racket. Once college admissions is perceived as a scam, well guess, what it attracts scam artists and the solution is to bust these scammers but also to reconsider the legal schemes, the elites have used and abused for years which only hurts the hard working qualified kids who deserve admission like the prosecutor said. The reputation of elite colleges was built on merit and these institutions were envisioned as rungs for those with the qualifications to climb up that ladder. They were not supposed to be clubs for the elites. Now we need to return to the principle of merit based admission again. Make the lawbreakers pay in this case but also it's time to look at the institutionalized abuses of the admissions process across the board, especially since a lot of these schools are being subsidized in one way or another by the taxpayers. And that's the Angle. All right, joining me now, Harmeet Dhillon, Attorney and Republican Party official. Dan Lee is the co-founder of Solomon Admissions and Christopher Hunt is a college essay consultant for College Essay Mentor. All right, guys, Harmeet, I don't know who this story is more damaging to, universities who've moved you know, far left than obviously this is terrible for them or the elites who are so desperate to get their kids into what they think are the best schools ever and I think to myself, is it worth going to jail?

So these kids are already spoiled brats just to be very frank and you know, they weren't expected to excel apparently. The parents are waiting until, oh my God, now it's time to go to college and maybe they weren't thinking about it earlier.

You talked about foreign students but the federal government subsidizing anybody who wants to go to college means that people who shouldn't be going to college are going to college and that's really crowding out the illegitimate competition and then you know frankly quotas. The reason that the scam was able to go on is that there's set aside in each of these top schools for sports and apparently, there's no actual standards, they don't check whether they're actually good at this sports or anything like that. They just let them in and then they proceed not to even participate in the sports at all and I just wonder you know, there's absolutely no quality control at these schools, where these kids are."

But we have a huge weight of college debt, $1.5 trillion outstanding in college debt today and I think it's average kid owes about $28,000 which you know, most people probably will be able to pay off but a lot of people won't.

So now that they are moving off of that, I wouldn't take it as that they are giving up. Remember, they have opened up an entire investigation where they are going to supposedly go after all of Trump's businesses.

At one point she said \"We had multiple conversations with the Justice Department about bringing a gross negligence charge,\" meaning against Hillary, \"And that's, as I said, the advice that we got from the department was that they did not think that it was constitutionally vague and not sustainable.\" So in other words, they discussed charging Hillary, but Justice is like, no, no, no, that won't work.

They got kicked out of the Navy and sentenced. There's multiple examples of where somebody takes classified information accidentally. They get prosecuted. This was done on purpose, a private server, emails being sent to the private server. The private server then disappears. Later, emails show up that are classified.

No repercussions, and no repercussions in a case where regular Americans, military men and women, get prosecuted and get the book thrown at them.

We reached out to 17 people at that university to come on our show last Thursday to provide a statement to us about free speech on campus, what they are doing to protect it. Only the media relations department ever got back to us. As promised, we followed up on this story, and we asked Portland State officials today if there had been any arrests or any kind of action taken against that protester. Well, we received another statement. Quote, \"The individual who disrupted the meeting is not a current student at Portland State. If he was a student, he would be subject to PSU's student code of conduct that has sanctions for violating rules governing student conduct.\" Now remember, police stood by for an hour while this man tried to derail a conservative event. The university says that protester, though, didn't break any laws. Free-speech experts, however, still beg to differ. And after a prominent Greenpeace Canada member took climate alarmists to task this morning on \"FOX and Friends,\" President Trump quoted him on Twitter. In response, the media immediately we lack jackals on the president. The independent U.K. blaring \"Trump repeats false claim.\" A CNN headline called the president's tweet his \"latest denial of science.\" \"Huffington Post\" claims Trump parrots anti-science misinformation. But is that accurate? Well, we put that question to a man who studied climate change for 35 years. Greg Wrightstone is a geologist and author of the book \"Inconvenient Facts, The Science that Al Dore Does Not Want You to Know.\" It should be noted that Apple approved an app that he built for this book, but then they pulled it down. Greg, I want to begin this, with this dire warning about carbon. The United Nations recently issued a warning that the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was at levels not seen in 3 million years. That's a long time, Greg. That sounds scary. So why are you denying the impact of this? You denier. GREG WRIGHTSTONE, AUTHOR, \"INCONVENIENT FACTS\": Yes, well, the fact of the matter is we increased carbon dioxide by about 120 parts per million since the beginning of the industrial revolution. We are a little over 400 now. To put that in perspective, throughout earth's history prior to our current period, the average CO2 levels on earth were 2,600 parts per million, six and half times what they are right now, and earth thrived. So this is really a minor increase in carbon dioxide. It really needs to be put in that long-term perspective, and we see it's really just a blip. And the other thing is that when I'm talking around the country, my talks usually center around how rising temperatures and increasing CO2 are benefiting the earth and humanity. We see tremendous benefits from increasing CO2. CO2 fertilization effect is benefiting the plants."

We know that throughout human history, warming periods like we're in now, and, yes, we are in a warming period, it's been warming for over 300 years.
