      "sentences": "We begin with the \"Fox News Alert\", the wait is finally over. Tonight, special counsel Robert Mueller submits his final report on the investigation into Russian interference. What many have called collusion in the 2016 elections. After nearly two years, the Mueller report is now in the hands of Attorney General William Barr. A question at this hour. What will Barr do with it? The attorney general has been clear about his intentions to release the report's findings. But some lawmakers doubt it.  In primetime, I'm Harris Faulkner in tonight for Martha MacCallum, who is on assignment. THE STORY tonight is the conclusion of 675 days of speculation over whether President Donald Trump or his campaign coordinated with the Russian government.  A senior DOJ official confirming to Fox News now, no further indictments will coming from the special counsel's office. And Attorney General William Barr may provide details of the report to Capitol Hill very soon. Writing this, \"I may be in a position to advise you of the special counsel's principal conclusions as soon as this weekend.\"  And earlier today, POLITICO reported Democrats secretly think the Mueller report will be a dud, but that may not stop them from investigating the president and his allies, even if there is no evidence of collusion. A Mueller report devoid of any Russia collusion should be a win for the Trump White House.",

The Associated Press breaking this hour saying that Giuliani, the rest of the legal team on an early look at Mueller's findings before the public sees it. He says that is absolutely not true. They are confident, Giuliani tells me that Bill Barr, the Attorney General will handle this appropriately. As you said, after two years investigating Mueller has now basically said, his probe is over with no further indictments. Even the president's critics like James Comey were telegraphing last night. They're no longer sure there was collusion or obstruction of justice despite all the speculation.  On the surface that certainly sounds like good news for the president. Means flatly, he and members of his family close aides will not be indicted by Robert Mueller. However, we still do not know the specifics of the report, and this hardly means all of the probes are over.  Democrats run the House as you noted, they're already talking about bringing Mueller in as a witness for sworn testimony. They could find other damaging information on the president that does not lead to a Mueller indictment as we say. But could be considered by the House for possible impeachment. Let's not also forget, the Southern District here in New York or former attorney Michael Cohen pled guilty to crimes already. They're still investigating various Trump organization business dealings.  President White House not in charge of this process. That is Bill Barr, in terms of the Mueller report being released to Congress, the public. Remember, Barr took charge today at about 4:35 p.m. Eastern Time.   He contacted the White House, said the report is coming. Then, Barr himself informed the Judiciary Committees in the House and Senate. And he wrote as you say, \"The special counsel has submitted to me today a confidential report explaining the prosecution or declination decision.\" Meaning, declining to prosecute. \"He has reached as required by the law. I am reviewing the report and anticipate, I may be in a position to advise you of the special counsel's principal conclusions as soon as this weekend.\" All of this is critical, Harris because as you said, it's in Barr's hands.",

That's the headline. There still is other information in this report that could be damaging politically, but also could be of a sensitive nature. We're talking about Russian interference.  Again, not collusion. Where -- but there's appears to be no proof that Russia -- you know, changed the result of the 2016 election, but did they interfere? That's what's been investigated.

Trey, good to see you and talk with you, I should say tonight. You know, that question of what comes next is so important. Because William Barr will make a decision now, not only about what the public will see but what Congress will see. Talk to me about the process. TREY GOWDY, CONTRIBUTOR (via telephone): Well, I think it's important for your viewers, Harris, to realize the reason we have Bob Mueller because the Department of Justice who otherwise would be handling this felt like they had a conflict. So, Mueller, in essence, worked for the Department of Justice. That is who the report goes to.   The only obligation to notify Congress is if he had a recommendation that his supervisor, Rod Rosenstein or Bill Barr did not follow. So, what's going to happen is Barr is going to read the report, I think he is going to want to share as much as he can. Because Barr understands what I've understood from day one. Mueller's number one job was report on what Russia did. The second part of that is with whom if anyone did they do it. That's the Democrat focus. That is their obsession, but that was not Mueller's obsession. So, I'm sure he will want to share what the intelligence community is this is the way to prepare for 2020, and beyond. And in the Democrats can subpoena him, they can bring Mueller to Capitol Hill. But we have three separate branches of government and congressional investigations.   Do you remember, Harris, when the House Intelligence Committee had to vote to turn over transcripts to the special counsel?",

So, so prosecutors have been very, very careful naming people and indictments that are not going to eventually stand in front of 12 that have peers and have their peers passed judgment.  The other thing about the report, it would not surprise me at all if they interviewed people who said six or seven different things. I mean, that's just the nature of eyewitness testimony. So, in a political context, you're going to seize on whichever witness said whatever is most beneficial for you. And you're going to ignore the five other people who saw all the stop light was green and not red, which is why when politics and the criminal justice system collide, it is always the justice system that perishes. So, I hope he does not. I hope he -- I hope he does not set. 200 plus years of precedent in this country about not forcing people to prove their innocence on his head. You can't prove your innocence. The president can't, he's not above the law but he's also not below the law. And the fact is he is the president, does not mean he should have to prove his innocence either.",

There is not one iota of evidence that he actually obstructed Robert Mueller, and I wouldn't expect him to obstruct attorney General Barr here either because the bottom line is no indictments. If there were going to be more indictments you would expect it to be of all the people around President Trump. Forget about President Trump himself. There are people on the Left suggesting that the reason no indictments came down is supposedly because you can't indict a sitting president. OK, but you could indict everybody around him. None of those people got indicted. So that suggests that this may be a giant nothing burger. We don't know yet, but the Democrats already suggesting preemptively that this is all a giant cover-up. It's just as they shifted the goalposts from -- it was it was collusion first, then it was obstruction, now they're shifting to preemptive narratives about cover-ups that haven't taken place yet.",

And Robert Mueller doesn't have anywhere else to go. Not to say that maybe the Southern District of New York doesn't have somewhere else to go but the office of the special counsel will be closed down. I am told that the president is glad that this is all over. Now we're also being told it's not likely we're going to hear anything about the special report, the special counsel's report at least until sometime on Sunday. They have a lot of material to go through. They have to determine what might be classified, what might be subject to executive privilege. And it's going to take them a while before they can put together a summary to deliver to Congress. The fact that Robert Mueller though said, that he is not seeking anymore indictment was seen as a comfort by the president's outside attorneys. Rudy Giuliani telling me, quote, \"This marks the end of the Russia investigation. We await a disclosure of the facts. We are confident that there is no finding of collusion by the president and this underscore what the president had been saying from the beginning that he did nothing wrong.\" Now the president has had some success in undermining the very premise of the Mueller investigation. He had said week after week, month after month that this is nothing but a witch hunt, that this is nothing but an attempt to overturn the 2016 election. And if you look at USA Today poll in its findings that came out in the last few days, the president has had some success in making that case because 50 percent of the people who were polled said they do believe that the president is subject to a witch hunt. And as he was way out -- on his way out the door this morning via helicopter, and you can hear them behind me. They are taking advantage of the president not being here to practice the helicopter landings on the White House's South Lawn.

Rudy Giuliani called me to tell me that that absolutely is not the case, it's up to William Barr what he wants to do. And then there is the bigger picture. That is the sense here, Harris, is that if this report goes a long distance toward exonerating the president, well, does Congress then try to get ahold of the whole report and the investigate materials? And there's got to be a warehouse full of those. And then if this report it fully exonerates the president, do the Democrats then re-calibrate completely what they were planning to do and go after the president on something else?

So that's what John Roberts was just talking about that they would try to push for this.

That's among Democrats and six House committees calling for that without delay release of the report, according to the Associated Press being reported at this time. All right.

There are 60 which is a grand jury investigation now which will not will be released, and then, Harris, on his own investigation.

So, I feel like I can share some of it right now. And it goes to the idea of how comprehensive the investigation was by special counsel Robert Mueller. These individuals described to me an investigation that was really driven by the forensics and by the documents. And some of these major events like the June 2016 Trump tower meeting, the Republican convention, the changes to the party platform, they were almost treated like a crime scene, if you will, in terms of how people were interviewed, the documents that were collected, the phone records and then individuals were challenged on their version of events with that paperwork.

The other investigation has been looking at issues that arose out of the Clinton e-mail investigation in 2016, specifically, the leaking of classified information.

Hey, guys, there's probably not going to be collusion here. When Catherine Herridge and all of us are reporting we don't know what's in this report yet. It's confidential.

He is able to go out there just hours before and say it's probably not going to be a lot.",

What many have called collusion in the 2016 elections. After nearly two years, the Mueller report is now in the hands of Attorney General William Barr. A question at this hour. What will Barr do with it? The attorney general has been clear about his intentions to release the report's findings. But some lawmakers doubt it. In primetime, I'm Harris Faulkner in tonight for Martha MacCallum, who is on assignment. THE STORY tonight is the conclusion of 675 days of speculation over whether President Donald Trump or his campaign coordinated with the Russian government. A senior DOJ official confirming to Fox News now, no further indictments will coming from the special counsel's office. And Attorney General William Barr may provide details of the report to Capitol Hill very soon. Writing this, \"I may be in a position to advise you of the special counsel's principal conclusions as soon as this weekend.\" And earlier today, POLITICO reported Democrats secretly think the Mueller report will be a dud, but that may not stop them from investigating the president and his allies, even if there is no evidence of collusion.

The Associated Press breaking this hour saying that Giuliani, the rest of the legal team on an early look at Mueller's findings before the public sees it. He says that is absolutely not true. They are confident, Giuliani tells me that Bill Barr, the Attorney General will handle this appropriately. As you said, after two years investigating Mueller has now basically said, his probe is over with no further indictments. Even the president's critics like James Comey were telegraphing last night. They're no longer sure there was collusion or obstruction of justice despite all the speculation. On the surface that certainly sounds like good news for the president. Means flatly, he and members of his family close aides will not be indicted by Robert Mueller. However, we still do not know the specifics of the report, and this hardly means all of the probes are over. Democrats run the House as you noted, they're already talking about bringing Mueller in as a witness for sworn testimony. They could find other damaging information on the president that does not lead to a Mueller indictment as we say. But could be considered by the House for possible impeachment. Let's not also forget, the Southern District here in New York or former attorney Michael Cohen pled guilty to crimes already. They're still investigating various Trump organization business dealings. President White House not in charge of this process. That is Bill Barr, in terms of the Mueller report being released to Congress, the public. Remember, Barr took charge today at about 4:35 p.m. Eastern Time. He contacted the White House, said the report is coming. Then, Barr himself informed the Judiciary Committees in the House and Senate. And he wrote as you say, \"The special counsel has submitted to me today a confidential report explaining the prosecution or declination decision.\" Meaning, declining to prosecute. \"He has reached as required by the law. I am reviewing the report and anticipate, I may be in a position to advise you of the special counsel's principal conclusions as soon as this weekend.\" All of this is critical, Harris because as you said, it's in Barr's hands."

The type of information that could be left out as I'm reading tonight of a report to Congress or the Republic. A question mark here could it be grand jury information, executive privilege, classified material, there's a lot we don't know but those are some options of things that we might not see."

But this is an extraordinary case, it's the president of the United States. So, even though it's clear now tonight that Robert Mueller, the headline is, is not going to indict the president. That's the headline. There still is other information in this report that could be damaging politically, but also could be of a sensitive nature. We're talking about Russian interference. Again, not collusion. Where -- but there's appears to be no proof that Russia -- you know, changed the result of the 2016 election, but did they interfere? That's what's been investigated.

So, Mueller, in essence, worked for the Department of Justice. That is who the report goes to. The only obligation to notify Congress is if he had a recommendation that his supervisor, Rod Rosenstein or Bill Barr did not follow. So, what's going to happen is Barr is going to read the report, I think he is going to want to share as much as he can. Because Barr understands what I've understood from day one. Mueller's number one job was report on what Russia did. The second part of that is with whom if anyone did they do it. That's the Democrat focus. That is their obsession, but that was not Mueller's obsession. So, I'm sure he will want to share what the intelligence community is this is the way to prepare for 2020, and beyond. And in the Democrats can subpoena him, they can bring Mueller to Capitol Hill. But we have three separate branches of government and congressional investigations.

And they're not going to be in front of a jury that can determine their lack of guilt. So, so prosecutors have been very, very careful naming people and indictments that are not going to eventually stand in front of 12 that have peers and have their peers passed judgment. The other thing about the report, it would not surprise me at all if they interviewed people who said six or seven different things. I mean, that's just the nature of eyewitness testimony. So, in a political context, you're going to seize on whichever witness said whatever is most beneficial for you. And you're going to ignore the five other people who saw all the stop light was green and not red, which is why when politics and the criminal justice system collide, it is always the justice system that perishes. So, I hope he does not. I hope he -- I hope he does not set. 200 plus years of precedent in this country about not forcing people to prove their innocence on his head. You can't prove your innocence. The president can't, he's not above the law but he's also not below the law. And the fact is he is the president, does not mean he should have to prove his innocence either."

You have to prove these beyond a reasonable doubt to convict somebody in this country. But in politics, you just have to throw stuff against the wall and see what sticks.

They're doing that in real time. They're claiming that maybe, just maybe once the entire report is released, then it will tell us something different from the fact that there are no indictments as we now know. And it will be amazing to watch them shift the goalposts. I'm seeing the media already suggesting that the big stories that President Trump is going to pounce. Whenever Republicans are exonerated of something, then it becomes a story about Republicans pouncing. It's never about media malfeasance for two years suggesting beyond the evidence at hand that President Trump was responsible for deep dark collusion with Russia that ended with Hillary Clinton losing the election."

Here's what we have. 20/20 Democratic hopeful Kamala Harris, the senator says this in a tweet. \"Americans deserve to know the truth now that the Mueller report is complete. The report must be released immediately and A.G. Barr must publicly testify under oath about the investigation's findings. We need total transparency.\" Has William Barr either previously in his confirmation hearings or anything you've heard since, Ben, said anything other than he will follow the rules and regulations and release the report. It's his intention to release as much as possible."

Because if I'm President Trump, that's actually what I want released. Plus A.G. Barr has already vowed that that's exactly what he's going to do. We keep hearing that President Trump obstructed the investigation over and over and over. There is not one iota of evidence that he actually obstructed Robert Mueller, and I wouldn't expect him to obstruct attorney General Barr here either because the bottom line is no indictments. If there were going to be more indictments you would expect it to be of all the people around President Trump. Forget about President Trump himself. There are people on the Left suggesting that the reason no indictments came down is supposedly because you can't indict a sitting president. OK, but you could indict everybody around him. None of those people got indicted. So that suggests that this may be a giant nothing burger. We don't know yet, but the Democrats already suggesting preemptively that this is all a giant cover-up. It's just as they shifted the goalposts from -- it was it was collusion first, then it was obstruction, now they're shifting to preemptive narratives about cover-ups that haven't taken place yet."

Is that going to stop the investigations? No. Will it stop the Democrats from looking to the SDNY? Of course, not.

That's the other big issue for us to discuss. The big picture, no more indictments, it sounds like relatively good news for the President. But until we see the report, we don't even know how many pages is it. Is this a thousand-page report that has all kinds of damaging information, that there was behavior that was troubling to the Special Counsel but did not rise to the level of indictment, we simply don't know. Or is he going to put together a report that said there was this problem, this problem, but at the end of the day there was no collusion, no obstruction, we simply don't know yet. I think it's important and instructive though that Bill Barr, A, was previously Attorney General under President Bush 41, has impeccable credentials, is known for his independence. And B, Democrats pounded him again and again in his confirmation hearings and he repeatedly said I am going to be in charge of this report. And when they said -- John Cornyn, as you know a key Republican said well, Rudy Giuliani says that they're going to get the report and they might make corrections to it before it goes public. And Barr on camera under oath said no, I am going to be in charge. So that's good news and bad news for the White House. If there's bad stuff in here, Barr is not going to cover it up. If there's good stuff that clears the President, he's going to finally get the President not just a report but an Attorney General of the United States saying he's been cleared."

And we all talk -- and they were talking about Russian collusion, interviewing people about possibility of Russian influence on the campaign as late as a week ago. So this has always been about Russian collusion. And here's a thing, Harris. You know the idea that the President of the United States or a candidate who becomes President of the United States would collude with a foreign power should be frightening to all of America no matter what party you're from. And the fact that the Mueller investigation, the most remarkable group of investigators that we could have assembled likely found no collusion, we see no indictments left. I can do the math, you can do the math, there's not going to be any collusion. There's not going to be any obstruction. If they're able to prove it didn't happen, it's a good thing.

Well, he didn't. So, the implication is that you trusted what Mueller was doing. And I think we all did. You know, putting aside the premises on which that investigation started. But let's see what's in it. Let's not get ahead of ourselves of course, but let's see what's in it. It's pretty telling that there is no more indictments. Let's see what's in it and be objective about what we are finding there. And again, I hope the Democrats can be objective about that. And we should all be happy about the good news that our president is not corrupt and did not collude with Russia. That is good news no matter what side of the aisle you're you on."

There are those who like you noted, are calling for impeachment almost every single day. There are those like Adam Schiff who claim that there was direct evidence of collusion. Well that turned out not to be true, didn't it? And then there is I think the more moderate side who would caution us all, who do understand that this is deeply divisive.

We understand of course that there are going to be -- might be classified material that can't be released but the more transparency is, the better for the American people. We still stand by that.

We should always be working to defend ourselves from that and we should be looking into what happened in 2016 and 2018 but it will happen in 2020. The Russians are certainly going to do it again. You know, the question is always how much of an effect does that have, or there were any Americans involved. It turns out it doesn't look like there was.

When this report becomes fully transparent as I hope it does, the truth will come out. And you can't just keep infringing on someone's civil liberties the way the Democrats apparently wish to do looking in -- looking for every possible reason why this person might have committed a crime.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "JOHN ROBERTS, CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Well, the latest here from the White House and the president who is spending the weekend down at Mar-a-Largo, is that this thing is over. The fact that Robert Mueller will be leaving the special counsel's office in the next few days is an indication that the Russia investigation is over. And Robert Mueller doesn't have anywhere else to go. Not to say that maybe the Southern District of New York doesn't have somewhere else to go but the office of the special counsel will be closed down. I am told that the president is glad that this is all over. Now we're also being told it's not likely we're going to hear anything about the special report, the special counsel's report at least until sometime on Sunday. They have a lot of material to go through. They have to determine what might be classified, what might be subject to executive privilege. And it's going to take them a while before they can put together a summary to deliver to Congress. The fact that Robert Mueller though said, that he is not seeking anymore indictment was seen as a comfort by the president's outside attorneys. Rudy Giuliani telling me, quote, \"This marks the end of the Russia investigation. We await a disclosure of the facts. We are confident that there is no finding of collusion by the president and this underscore what the president had been saying from the beginning that he did nothing wrong.\" Now the president has had some success in undermining the very premise of the Mueller investigation. He had said week after week, month after month that this is nothing but a witch hunt, that this is nothing but an attempt to overturn the 2016 election. And if you look at USA Today poll in its findings that came out in the last few days, the president has had some success in making that case because 50 percent of the people who were polled said they do believe that the president is subject to a witch hunt. And as he was way out -- on his way out the door this morning via helicopter, and you can hear them behind me. They are taking advantage of the president not being here to practice the helicopter landings on the White House's South Lawn. The president was doing his best to continue to undermine the Mueller investigation. Listen here."

      "speaker": "ROBERTS",

Will he consult with the president's attorneys? Will they have a hand in crafting the summary that is going to Congress? There was an Associated Press report out that Rudy Giuliani was demanding to see the report before it goes to Congress. Rudy Giuliani called me to tell me that that absolutely is not the case, it's up to William Barr what he wants to do. And then there is the bigger picture. That is the sense here, Harris, is that if this report goes a long distance toward exonerating the president, well, does Congress then try to get ahold of the whole report and the investigate materials? And there's got to be a warehouse full of those. And then if this report it fully exonerates the president, do the Democrats then re-calibrate completely what they were planning to do and go after the president on something else? So, a lot of unknowns here. But I think it's pretty safe to say it will likely be at least 24 hours before we hear more developments on this in terms of what that report actually contains."

We appreciate the update from the perspective of the White House and all the information that you brought. Before I get to Congressman Doug Collins, ranking member of the committee on the judiciary, I want to bring this in. He was one of four people who receive this from the attorney general today. The Democratic chairs of six House committees are now demanding that the Justice Department release, quote/unquote, \"without delay the full report it has received from the special counsel Robert Mueller.\" They say they expect Attorney General Barr also to hand over all evidence that Mueller has uncovered. So that's what John Roberts was just talking about that they would try to push for this. And in fact, Democrat are saying that since the Justice Department asserts a sitting president cannot indicted, Barr's failure to release evidence of criminal or other misconduct by President Trump, quote, \"would raise serious questions about whether the DOJ Policy is being used as a pretext for cover up of misconduct.\" End quote. That's among Democrats and six House committees calling for that without delay release of the report, according to the Associated Press being reported at this time. All right. So, before we get to the Congressman, can we pop up on the screen the letter that came from the attorney general? Again, my next guest the honorable Doug Collins received this. That's how it is written in the letter. \"The special counsel has submitted to me today a confidential report explaining prosecution or declination decisions that he has reached as required by 28 CFR. I am reviewing the report, and anticipate that I may be in a position to advise you of the special counsel's principal conclusions as soon as this weekend.\" And now, the ranking member on the House judiciary committee, Doug Collins. Congressman, I bring you in now to get a look at what happens next in all of this."

This follows the course of action that has laid out by the regulation at justice. And that's exactly what Bill Barr is doing. He is doing exactly what we knew he would do. And that is follow regulations to a t. He delivered the letter today, he has now said that the investigation is over and that Mueller has turned over his report for him for his assessment and going to through it to make his explanation. It is important to note here several things that are out there. And I will just report what we know. And that is from the letter and then where we go next. The letter clearly states that there was no interference by attorney general or acting attorneys general in any request by Mr. Mueller for his investigation. That's a big topic because the Democrats have been talking all along to make sure that nobody interfered. Well, no one interfered. He had plenty of time to do everything. He has now completed it. What will happen now as said in the letter that he will, Barr -- Mr. Barr will actually, the attorney general will then prepare his report and then he will send that to us as early as this weekend. And at that point in time, we will have the process of what Mueller found. And it will be coming out to the public as we go forth in the way that Bill Barr is set out in the regulation. So, I want everybody to understand exactly what happens next. The report will come out, it is up to Bill Barr on how that comes out. But he does have to give it to us as he did today. And so far, he has done everything by the book. That is a good thing."

And I'm sure that the chairman's office and also Chairman Graham and the Ranking Member Feinstein's committee are as well and we'll be prepared to get that out. I think, well, let's go back and remember. When Attorney General Barr was going through the confirmation and when the conversation that we have had, he wants to release as much as legally possible. And I think there'd been a lot of conversation tonight and including my Democratic friends who seem to be going a little bit concerning now about the fact that this doesn't seem to be leading where they always thought it was going to be leading. But at this point in time, what we are seeing is him putting that together. There's classified information in there possibly. There are 60 which is a grand jury investigation now which will not will be released, and then, Harris, on his own investigation. So, he will release I believe and he has said this publicly all that he can legally put forward. And I think that is where we will see this from. And Democrats are just going to have to understand that, that they have looked everything on a report that may come back and say exactly what we have been saying for two years, and the president has been saying that the collusion was not there. So, but, that is still to come. But they are, I think they are panicking right now."

Those cases will continue on I do believe, has been talked about before that those are, you know, proceeding on and are getting further down the line. Remember also, that Mr. Horowitz who is the inspector general at the Department of Justice also is still investigating the FISA abuses. This is something that we need to go back to is reminding people what really did happen. If the report comes back as we think it will and there is no collusion. And hopefully that's what it's going to say when we see that and we think it will. But we can go back and actually show where there were issues at the Department of Justice and the other things that precipitated this Russia investigation, namely, Strozk, Page, and McCabe and others who circumvented the procedures circumvented things that led us to the position to where we're now. So, I think a lot of investigations are going on but this is a big conclusion to a Russia investigation that we're looking forward to finishing up and moving forward with the work of the people that want us to do."

It is some place where immediately after we saw sentencing of one of the principals in this case, they lit up with what comes next. And that sentencing for Manafort perhaps could be something that the federal level, that could get a pardon from the president.

So, cases that arise, for example, out of the Southern District of New York. I want to share information with you and the folks at home. I have had a lot of contact with individuals who have been questioned by the special counsel over the last two years and I've not been able to report some of this information because they've asked me to hold it until the report is complete. So, I feel like I can share some of it right now. And it goes to the idea of how comprehensive the investigation was by special counsel Robert Mueller. These individuals described to me an investigation that was really driven by the forensics and by the documents. And some of these major events like the June 2016 Trump tower meeting, the Republican convention, the changes to the party platform, they were almost treated like a crime scene, if you will, in terms of how people were interviewed, the documents that were collected, the phone records and then individuals were challenged on their version of events with that paperwork. For some people who were only witnesses in this investigation, they were not forgets, they were still looking at legal bills upward of $100,000.

But in the building behind me the Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz, they've been running essentially a parallel or a tandem investigation, if you will, into three key areas. One of them is these allegations of FISA abuse. So, this is abuse of the surveillance warrant system during the 2016 campaign and whether there was an honest application or a straightforward application that did not withhold evidence from the FISA court in October of 2016 for Trump campaign aide or whether exculpatory evidence or evidence that was in conflict with getting the application was presented to this court. The other investigation has been looking at issues that arose out of the Clinton e-mail investigation in 2016, specifically, the leaking of classified information. And you recall that former FBI Director James Comey said he deliberately leaked his memo about a conversation with the president in order to kick- start the special counsel investigation which in effect it did, along with his firing, Harris."

And then you fast forward to what happened last night. We had it on the program here last night, James Comey, the same man had an op-ed in the New York Times breaking last night into this morning saying we don't think there is evidence of collusion or obstruction of justice. And I don't care, he said. \"I have no idea whether the special counsel will conclude that Mr. Trump knowingly conspired with the Russians or that he obstructed justice with the required corrupt intent. I also don't care.\" Even though Comey and all these other critics have been saying for a year and a half that they believe that all of that evidence might be there, number one. And number two, an ally of the president just texted me how is it that James Comey before -- hours before this report came out was able to do sort of an expectation setting op-ed? Hey, guys, there's probably not going to be collusion here. When Catherine Herridge and all of us are reporting we don't know what's in this report yet. It's confidential. Only the attorney general has it. But James Comey, who the president has repeatedly said is a key ally of Mueller and they were friends, they've denied that.

I'm a man of, you know, I grew up in Lowell, Massachusetts and I didn't grow up with any wealth whatsoever, I've four kids to put through college. And what the overreach of the government has done and what this investigation which has lasted one year, 675 days or one year, 10 months and six days has done to individuals has destroyed some lives. Look what they did or tried to do to Jerome Corsi. They asked him to sign a document to plead guilty to a crime. And now we see that the Mueller investigation is over, and they are not charging Dr. Corsi with any crime. This is what is going on. It is overreach of the government that was started because Hillary Clinton took $5 million and created a false dossier and James Comey, the messiah complex James Comey, the man who discernment in his own mind and what is right and wrong took that false dossier present it to President-elect Donald Trump and launched an investigation because Hillary Clinton couldn't win an election.

I want to see the full unredacted report because the American taxpayers have a right to see where $40 million went of their money to prove something that I knew from day one. There was no collusion. There was no cooperation. There was no coordination between the Trump campaign and the Russians. Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton fair and square. We knew it from day one.

The special counsel will be concluding his service in the coming days. A small number of staffs will remain to assist in closing the operations of the office for a period of time. Corey Lewandowski, have you spoken to the president tonight?"

      "speaker": "LEWANDOWSKI",
      "utterance": "You know, I haven't spoken to him, Harris. But that tells me is there are no sealed indictments. So, let's be very clear. If there was sealed indictments --"

      "utterance": "That was the question I had."

      "speaker": "LEWANDOWSKI",
      "utterance": "-- the special prosecutors and his entire team would not be disbanding. We've now seen this over a series of weeks. They are all leaving and going back to their respective positions. So, what we know is there had been no current indictments as it relates to Russia collusion and there are no sealed indictments is what this indicates to us which is a very clear signal that this entire hoax is finally over."

      "speaker": "FAULKNER",
      "utterance": "As you and I'm sure you fully will because you were with the campaign, the president fully intends to run for re-election. You've got another campaign coming up. How does this play for messaging for the president this weekend while we wait for this report?"
    },

      "speaker": "LEWANDOWSKI",
      "utterance": "Well, I think what's going to happen is that Democrats are clearly still going to overreach. They are going to continue with their socialist agenda and try to impeach this president. And they will have the recourse for that at the ballot box in 2020. This presidential has delivered on every promise."

      "speaker": "FAULKNER",

      "utterance": "Now we don't know what's in the report yet."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LEWANDOWSKI",
      "utterance": "-- that he was right all the time. Well, we know what's in the report, Harris. We know there are no additional indictments, there are no sealed indictments, we know that the special counsel's job is now over and he is going back to the private sector. What we know is that what the president has said. This was $40 million, 675 days of wasted taxpayer money to prove what we knew from day one which there was no collusion."

      "utterance": "Corey Lewandowski, thank you very much for your first reaction tonight on the story. You see me looking down and I'm catching some things that are coming up on our urgent que. I -- from the Attorney General Barr has left the Department of Justice. We told you that. I should receive some kind of guidance tomorrow on when we may get information about what Barr is advising Congress. And of course, we've had member of Congress on this very program. Former Attorney General Sessions is telling Fox News at this point that he won't comment on the release of the Mueller report. Quote/unquote, \"At this time, there is so much more news to come on all of this.\" So significant players like Sessions and others are commenting or not commenting at this hour. But what we can tell you is that the process of Robert Mueller looking into whether or not the Trump campaign colluded with Russia has come to a conclusion in a report that is now in the hands of both the Attorney General William Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein. Rosenstein choosing to stay on for a few extra days. That decision this week. We are continuing here on Fox News channel to cover all the breaking news with regard to this. It has been 675 days of investigation and wait, and now movement. That is “The Story” on Friday night. I'm Harris in for Martha. Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC.
