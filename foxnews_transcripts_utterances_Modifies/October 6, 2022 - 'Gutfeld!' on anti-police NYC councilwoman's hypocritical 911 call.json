      "sentences": "Delicious. Happy Thursday, everybody. Oh, you look fantastic. There I go talking to myself again. Do you ever notice how left the politicians never concern themselves with threats until they're the target? I refer to police defender New York City council woman Tiffany Caban. Now Caban's dad was an elevator mechanic. So it's not clear why hers doesn't go all the way to the top. But last week, she urged businesses not to dial 9/11 when faced with criminal activity. That's great advice, Tiffany. Who should they call? Domino's and hope the delivery guy is packing heat? Maybe you can scald the mugger with hot cheese. Days before a ghoul stabbed a veteran EMT worker to death. Caban released a public safety guide urging merchants to call 311 not 911 to seek mental health services and engage in community mediation rather than call the cops. That will work. 311, what's your emergency? Yes, my store is being bummed rushed by 100 juvenile delinquents and they're destroying the place. Could you get a psychologist out here to talk to them pronto? They advise merchants to give the person causing harm the chance to correct the behavior. Say no, stop or that is not OK. So you're supposed to say the same thing to a guy robbing you at gunpoint as a girl says to a guy trying to get to second base on a first date. You'd be better off offering him a Cinnabon and a hand job. Oddly they do go together.",

      "sentences": "The guide also suggest asking the attacker if you guys went to high school together. Yes, please stop stabbing for a second so I get my high school yearbook. I think -- I think you sat behind me in history. Now you think someone this nuts would know that you can't reason with crazy people. But that's her suggestion rather than calling the cops. Well, guess who called the cops yesterday? Tiffany Caban. Now she claims she didn't call 911 probably because, you know, she forgot the number. But after receiving threatening phone calls likely over her bad ideas, she or her staff contacted the authorities. Man if this isn't irony defined, you know, I wonder how that call went. 54th Pprecinct Sergeant Jones speaking. You'll never guess who this is. It's Councilwoman Tiffany Ca -- hello? Hello? True, it appears the only justice that she's a part of is poetic. Now I'm willing to bet she didn't reference that guide when these threats came through, which is a shame. I mean, how would they know threatening people is bad if she didn't tell them it's not OK. I bet you didn't seek out a mental health pro either or even give the callers a chance to correct their behavior or just hang up. I bet she didn't call 311 either because they would tell her to call the cops. So this is a pisser. She tells victims who unlike her are face to face with actual physical threats not to call the cops but that's what she or her staff did with voicemails. Honestly, who dresses this dumb broad in the morning and packs her Wonder Woman lunchbox? Now, make no mistake, the threats to her are bad. As my mother often said, an eye for an eye doesn't work, especially when you're dealing with a person who's already blind as (BLEEP) You know, my mother had a mouth on her but she was right. You know, people are getting murdered, robbed and raped and she's out offering brochures and then she gets a threat and now she's the victim. So she calls the cops, something she doesn't want for you because if you call them it's proof that the cops are 100 percent necessary in this effed up world that people who think like her had created in the first place. But she's no different than the other defunders like Cori Bush who wants cops off the streets as vulnerable citizens pay thousands for her own private security. Just as Democrats deny her pro perp ideology. Cory won't.",

It seems murder victims only matter if the perp use the wrong pronoun. But when you look at the crime stats, male and female violence numbers are far outweighing the reverse. And it's getting worse, especially with race. And yet, where is AOC or her progressive ilk? You know, they will gladly tell you about the threats against their lives. The online hate, the voicemails, and who can forget AOC narrowly escaping death with a bunch of white people with the average age of 55 came within a half mile of her office on one day. They want to -- they want to sic the Feds on the people when their feelings are hurt. But when it comes to protecting other women from real physical harm, they don't give a damn. When one woman got viciously beaten by a psychopath in Caban's burrow, she tweeted, subway violence is a one in a million event. She literally turned a victim into a statistic, and an incorrect one by far. Here's a real stat. Serious crimes Rose 35.6 percent over last summer's recent highs, that's incredible. But that stat doesn't matter because it's probably racist. I mean, violence against women can't matter if the perpetrator can also claim some form of victimhood. Unless it happens to her of course on e-mail, social media or by phone. And so now there are more minority victims. Thanks to Democrats. And it's left- wing women who champing it, like their lives didn't depend on it. So good luck on the subway girls. The next time you're attacked by a knife-wielding thug just ask who they had for gym class.",

They could have done this in 2020, but there was an election to sway. The ball is now in the Delaware U.S. attorney's court, David Weiss, who happens to be a Trump appointee. Fortunately, no one will ever bring that up. And it remains to be seen whether he'll charge Hunter. The investigation originally centered on his international business dealings, but then it shifted to whether he didn't report all his income and lied on paperwork to buy a gun. Although to be fair, it's hard to claim crack and hookers as a tax deduction. Lord knows I've tried. By I, I mean Bill Hemmer. But it's similar, but it's similar to how they got Al Capone except Capone probably had less syphilis. We got Hunter's father for comment.",

Do you ever notice how left the politicians never concern themselves with threats until they're the target? I refer to police defender New York City council woman Tiffany Caban. Now Caban's dad was an elevator mechanic. So it's not clear why hers doesn't go all the way to the top. But last week, she urged businesses not to dial 9/11 when faced with criminal activity. That's great advice, Tiffany. Who should they call? Domino's and hope the delivery guy is packing heat? Maybe you can scald the mugger with hot cheese. Days before a ghoul stabbed a veteran EMT worker to death. Caban released a public safety guide urging merchants to call 311 not 911 to seek mental health services and engage in community mediation rather than call the cops. That will work. 311, what's your emergency? Yes, my store is being bummed rushed by 100 juvenile delinquents and they're destroying the place. Could you get a psychologist out here to talk to them pronto? They advise merchants to give the person causing harm the chance to correct the behavior. Say no, stop or that is not OK. So you're supposed to say the same thing to a guy robbing you at gunpoint as a girl says to a guy trying to get to second base on a first date. You'd be better off offering him a Cinnabon and a hand job. Oddly they do go together."

I think -- I think you sat behind me in history. Now you think someone this nuts would know that you can't reason with crazy people. But that's her suggestion rather than calling the cops. Well, guess who called the cops yesterday? Tiffany Caban. Now she claims she didn't call 911 probably because, you know, she forgot the number. But after receiving threatening phone calls likely over her bad ideas, she or her staff contacted the authorities. Man if this isn't irony defined, you know, I wonder how that call went. 54th Pprecinct Sergeant Jones speaking. You'll never guess who this is. It's Councilwoman Tiffany Ca -- hello? Hello? True, it appears the only justice that she's a part of is poetic. Now I'm willing to bet she didn't reference that guide when these threats came through, which is a shame. I mean, how would they know threatening people is bad if she didn't tell them it's not OK. I bet you didn't seek out a mental health pro either or even give the callers a chance to correct their behavior or just hang up. I bet she didn't call 311 either because they would tell her to call the cops. So this is a pisser. She tells victims who unlike her are face to face with actual physical threats not to call the cops but that's what she or her staff did with voicemails. Honestly, who dresses this dumb broad in the morning and packs her Wonder Woman lunchbox? Now, make no mistake, the threats to her are bad. As my mother often said, an eye for an eye doesn't work, especially when you're dealing with a person who's already blind as (BLEEP) You know, my mother had a mouth on her but she was right. You know, people are getting murdered, robbed and raped and she's out offering brochures and then she gets a threat and now she's the victim. So she calls the cops, something she doesn't want for you because if you call them it's proof that the cops are 100 percent necessary in this effed up world that people who think like her had created in the first place. But she's no different than the other defunders like Cori Bush who wants cops off the streets as vulnerable citizens pay thousands for her own private security. Just as Democrats deny her pro perp ideology. Cory won't."

It seems murder victims only matter if the perp use the wrong pronoun. But when you look at the crime stats, male and female violence numbers are far outweighing the reverse. And it's getting worse, especially with race. And yet, where is AOC or her progressive ilk? You know, they will gladly tell you about the threats against their lives. The online hate, the voicemails, and who can forget AOC narrowly escaping death with a bunch of white people with the average age of 55 came within a half mile of her office on one day. They want to -- they want to sic the Feds on the people when their feelings are hurt. But when it comes to protecting other women from real physical harm, they don't give a damn. When one woman got viciously beaten by a psychopath in Caban's burrow, she tweeted, subway violence is a one in a million event. She literally turned a victim into a statistic, and an incorrect one by far. Here's a real stat. Serious crimes Rose 35.6 percent over last summer's recent highs, that's incredible. But that stat doesn't matter because it's probably racist. I mean, violence against women can't matter if the perpetrator can also claim some form of victimhood. Unless it happens to her of course on e-mail, social media or by phone. And so now there are more minority victims. Thanks to Democrats. And it's left- wing women who champing it, like their lives didn't depend on it. So good luck on the subway girls. The next time you're attacked by a knife-wielding thug just ask who they had for gym class."

That's kind of like the whole point of being in Congress. Right? Like the whole point is to write legislation and to get caught up in the words. And so for me, it's like, part of it's funny because it's so ridiculous.

And that dim rest stop light, I have to take their word for it. Don't knock it. But currently about 44 percent of women ages 18 to 29 or as Leo DiCaprio calls them senior citizens. They count themselves as liberal, which is easy when they've never had to pay for their dinner. Am I right? But for dudes in that same age bracket, only 25 percent are libs.

They could have done this in 2020, but there was an election to sway. The ball is now in the Delaware U.S. attorney's court, David Weiss, who happens to be a Trump appointee. Fortunately, no one will ever bring that up. And it remains to be seen whether he'll charge Hunter. The investigation originally centered on his international business dealings, but then it shifted to whether he didn't report all his income and lied on paperwork to buy a gun. Although to be fair, it's hard to claim crack and hookers as a tax deduction. Lord knows I've tried. By I, I mean Bill Hemmer.

The two players, linebacker Bobby Wagner, and defensive Takkarist McKinley tackled Alex Taylor, who is a member of the animal rights group, Direct Action Everywhere, after security tried and failed to take him down.
