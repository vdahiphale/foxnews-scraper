But we definitely have an America that's -- increased tribalism in our politics. So my specialization is polling, I know not everybody love it, but right before the election, Pew asked some voters who are you voting for and could you respect someone who voted for the other candidates?

If a 66-year-old adult man shoots a bunch of people, maybe it's that adult man who shot the people fault that he shot the people. But I think this goes beyond Trump, if we are going to talk about the rhetoric. The way that people talk about Republicans -- it isn't just the way we talk about Trump, is that if you support small government solutions, then you are taking someone's food away to starve their kids, and your pushing the off -- their grandma off the cliff with the other hand. So that is -- really certainly does make Republicans look like evil people. I think that that's a problem. I think it's also very disingenuous because just having a different approach to solving problems is not the same as wanting people to die.

      "sentences": "You know, I'd just been up to bat at home plate and they told us to take five cuts, and you know how it is as a baseball player, you sometimes think, you know, maybe my five cuts will be eight or ten cut. But today, I said, you know what, I'm going five cuts and because I chose to do what I was supposed to do, I was walking away as the shooter was preparing. I walked over to the dugout and Senator Jeff Blake from Arizona said, can I have a ride home or back to Capitol Hill, and I said sure. I said, but I'm going to go one extra cut at the batting cages which was yet farther away.  So I walked a little further out and I'm putting on my helmet, and we hear a loud shot. I live in Kentucky, so people hunt in my neighborhood, even in the bottomland around my neighborhood. It's not uncommon to hear a shotgun. I heard a loud shot and it sounded really close. But like anything else, you think, well, I don't know what that was, but we're just about to say, well, let's get started again. But then we heard five to ten shots quickly in a row and we knew something was wrong, and then we heard 10, 20 more shots. And probably, maybe a total of 50 or 60 shots. At this point, everybody is ducking for cover. Everybody is scrambling. Two staffers were in left field and the shooter is along the third-base line hiding behind the dugout, sort of a concrete cinderblock dugout. Two of the staffers raced the whole warming track, the perimeter of the outfield, so they're right next to where I am. There's a big oak tree, couple of hundred year old oak tree right next to the batting cage. I'm behind that tree. There're two staffers on the other side of the 20 foot fence. About this time we see that the shooter shoots Representative Scalise, and he's down. People are yelling I'm hit all around the place.  So the two guys on the other side of the fence, one of them has got to make a decision. It's a tough decision. Do I lay still and hope they think I'm dead, or they don't come close to look, or do I decide this is not a good place to be? While they're laying there, the bullets are landing all around them in the dirt of the warning track. So one of them decides he's coming over the fence. It's about a 20-foot tall fence, chain-link fence. I think he set it in record time. He was over in two seconds. I'm not sure I was going over that fast if I have to. But I'm on the outside of the fence, he joins me, we're behind the tree. At this point, we hear that he's changing magazines, loading again, firing again, and it's sort of like a killing field. All across -- the whole wide open field, nobody can get to Scalise. Scalise's down but he's moving, and he's crawling very, you know, as much as he can in the outfield, although he's got a pretty significant gunshot injury, but he crawls about 15 yards. Still no one can get to him because there's bullets spraying across the entire field. The people in the first base dugout, it's a submerged dugout, you know what's this like, Eric, you go down about two feet to get to the dugout. They're down below the lip of it, but the bullets are going into the dirt in front of the dugout and bouncing up into the back of the dugout.  We hear at this point that the shooter seems to be moving, and it seems like he's going towards home plate which means he's coming to the right half of the field where we are, where most of the players are, and fortunately where the Capitol Hill police is located. So the staffer and I behind the tree, we've got to make a decision, we've got to run across a fairly open field but in the opposite direction of the shooter, or we could stay and see what happens. But we sort of made the choice we were unarmed and nothing we could do against somebody with a semiautomatic rifle, so we decide to run at that point. And at about that point where we start hearing the Capitol Hill police, who are just amazing heroes, begin firing back. I found out later that they were both shocked in the process. We lost our signal. We lost our signal.",

On both sides it's happening. But, you know, in fact, there's a wake up, America, monologue where I address exactly that. What's going on? What's the reason? Where are we? Is this America or is it Raqqa? This is more like Sunni on Shia violence and it is Republicans versus Democrats. But Kristen, I think it's relevant to note that this guy, he was a Bernie Sanders campaign worker, who was a devout socialist, who walked up to this baseball field and asked a representative, are these Republicans or Democrats, when he found out they're Republicans he decided to open fire on the group."

In fact, of all the politicians out there, I don't view him as being someone whose rhetoric is over-the-top in a way that would encourage someone to violence. But we definitely have an America that's -- increased tribalism in our politics. So my specialization is polling, I know not everybody love it, but right before the election, Pew asked some voters who are you voting for and could you respect someone who voted for the other candidates? Among Trump voters, 40 percent said they could never respect a Clinton voter, among Clinton voters, 58 percent said they'll have a hard time respecting a Trump voter. We can't even respect each other as people."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "Well, first of all, we don't see enough of people blaming the shooter for shooting people. I think that it's OK, of course, to examine the climate surrounding it, but this is this guy's fault. If a 66-year-old adult man shoots a bunch of people, maybe it's that adult man who shot the people fault that he shot the people. But I think this goes beyond Trump, if we are going to talk about the rhetoric. The way that people talk about Republicans -- it isn't just the way we talk about Trump, is that if you support small government solutions, then you are taking someone's food away to starve their kids, and your pushing the off -- their grandma off the cliff with the other hand. So that is -- really certainly does make Republicans look like evil people. I think that that's a problem. I think it's also very disingenuous because just having a different approach to solving problems is not the same as wanting people to die. But I think that it takes a special kind of evil disgusting person to go shoot a bunch of people regardless of what other people are saying."

These are Democrats who have said this. Bill de Blasio said it's not an overstatement that saying some children will die because of this. This is heightened rhetoric. Cory Booker goes in and said Americans will cost Americans lives. Nancy Pelosi, this is deadly, this is deadly. Bernie Sanders says thousands of Americans would die. The Democrats aren't afraid to use that word when talking about a Republican policy. And you're going to tell me that crazy people aren't going to hear this and go, oh, my god, they really are going to kill us. What do we do?"

In that debate you can see someone saying, look, if you don't give someone the right to protect themselves, you're putting them at risk for dying. I mean, there are ways that political rhetoric in talking about policies, can't talk about issues of life or death. That in no way excuses someone actually going out and killing someone."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "SEN. RAND PAUL, R-KAN.",
      "utterance": "You know, I'd just been up to bat at home plate and they told us to take five cuts, and you know how it is as a baseball player, you sometimes think, you know, maybe my five cuts will be eight or ten cut. But today, I said, you know what, I'm going five cuts and because I chose to do what I was supposed to do, I was walking away as the shooter was preparing. I walked over to the dugout and Senator Jeff Blake from Arizona said, can I have a ride home or back to Capitol Hill, and I said sure. I said, but I'm going to go one extra cut at the batting cages which was yet farther away. So I walked a little further out and I'm putting on my helmet, and we hear a loud shot. I live in Kentucky, so people hunt in my neighborhood, even in the bottomland around my neighborhood. It's not uncommon to hear a shotgun. I heard a loud shot and it sounded really close. But like anything else, you think, well, I don't know what that was, but we're just about to say, well, let's get started again. But then we heard five to ten shots quickly in a row and we knew something was wrong, and then we heard 10, 20 more shots. And probably, maybe a total of 50 or 60 shots. At this point, everybody is ducking for cover. Everybody is scrambling. Two staffers were in left field and the shooter is along the third-base line hiding behind the dugout, sort of a concrete cinderblock dugout. Two of the staffers raced the whole warming track, the perimeter of the outfield, so they're right next to where I am. There's a big oak tree, couple of hundred year old oak tree right next to the batting cage. I'm behind that tree. There're two staffers on the other side of the 20 foot fence. About this time we see that the shooter shoots Representative Scalise, and he's down. People are yelling I'm hit all around the place. So the two guys on the other side of the fence, one of them has got to make a decision. It's a tough decision. Do I lay still and hope they think I'm dead, or they don't come close to look, or do I decide this is not a good place to be? While they're laying there, the bullets are landing all around them in the dirt of the warning track. So one of them decides he's coming over the fence. It's about a 20-foot tall fence, chain-link fence. I think he set it in record time. He was over in two seconds. I'm not sure I was going over that fast if I have to. But I'm on the outside of the fence, he joins me, we're behind the tree. At this point, we hear that he's changing magazines, loading again, firing again, and it's sort of like a killing field. All across -- the whole wide open field, nobody can get to Scalise. Scalise's down but he's moving, and he's crawling very, you know, as much as he can in the outfield, although he's got a pretty significant gunshot injury, but he crawls about 15 yards. Still no one can get to him because there's bullets spraying across the entire field. The people in the first base dugout, it's a submerged dugout, you know what's this like, Eric, you go down about two feet to get to the dugout. They're down below the lip of it, but the bullets are going into the dirt in front of the dugout and bouncing up into the back of the dugout. We hear at this point that the shooter seems to be moving, and it seems like he's going towards home plate which means he's coming to the right half of the field where we are, where most of the players are, and fortunately where the Capitol Hill police is located. So the staffer and I behind the tree, we've got to make a decision, we've got to run across a fairly open field but in the opposite direction of the shooter, or we could stay and see what happens. But we sort of made the choice we were unarmed and nothing we could do against somebody with a semiautomatic rifle, so we decide to run at that point. And at about that point where we start hearing the Capitol Hill police, who are just amazing heroes, begin firing back. I found out later that they were both shocked in the process. We lost our signal. We lost our signal."

Where are we when a society -- in a society when a guy like Steve Scalise, with a wife and two kids, is gunned down on second freaking base? Congressman Mo Brooks described the terror he felt while lying down in a dugout being shot at with, quote, just a baseball bat for defense. Don't lose the poetic irony on the fact that this happened on a baseball field, the most American of American past time. Is this America or this Raqqa or Yemen? So today, this was clearly politically motivated as the shooter was a Bernie Sanders 2016 campaign volunteer. And here's the socialist hiding a poster with his politics written all over it. So this was a targeted attack on Republicans, no doubt. You know, American politics has been called a blood sport where both sides are using strong words or refute the other side policies. It's been that way for 240 years, that's America. But there's been a sea change recently. In the words liberal politicians and celebrities are willing to use. Democrat politicians have been playing fast and loose with the way they disagree with the right on the GOP health care propose law just alone. Cory Booker, a Democrat from New Jersey said this will, quote, mean death, pain, and suffering. Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic governor of Virginia said people are going to die. Yep, Virginia. Let's call it the home field for today's shooting. Listen to Democrat and former attorney general Loretta Lynch, go too far."

Before you liberals blow a gasket saying I'm being partisan, I will tell you, I will guarantee you this -- I would be writing the same monologue and delivering the same monologue if it were a Democrat softball practice targeted and terrorized. That I promise you. Now Kat, I think you yelled at me in the A-block, saying this goes both ways. But it does go both ways.

Noteworthy is the reason why there was Capitol Hill police there at all was because Steve Scalise is what's called the whip. It's a part of the leadership group in both the Senate and -- in Congress and in the Senate, meaning the speaker of the House, majority leader, the minority leader, the whip and so forth. That's the reason they get 24-hour Secret Service and Capitol Hill police, one or the other. So the reason why this wasn't a Rand Paul massacre, as he points out, was because they were there. Eboni, I want to ask you something. One of the things, I think, that was most important, we -- a tidbit of information we got out of there is they're looking for, potentially, a larger group here. Is he a lone wolf, or is he part of a larger group? And what's the motive?"

But one of them was liking this page right here. Now, early in the day, it's called \"TERMINATE\" -- capital letters -- \"TERMINATE the Republican Party.\" Some -- there was some pushback, some people saying, \"Hey, things like that shouldn't be allowed on social media.\""

There's plenty of people who, I'm sure, in that group that aren't going to hurt anyone, that aren't going to think of it that way. Again, could this -- could being that strict and that Draconian, in a sense, on social media prevent crime? Yes, it would, but we'd be also getting rid of all of our freedom.

It's someone who's very passionate about politics, and that's something that we want to encourage. So what was it that led him down this path, from being someone who was passionate about politics?

Again, I'm just wondering, because oftentimes the other issue we have with gun control, Eric, when we start talking about this in the political sphere, is mental health. Everybody -- it's bipartisan support around around the furtherance of mental health evaluations when it comes to who should have a gun in this country. And what I'm asking, and this is a legitimate question. Traditional mental health, schizophrenia, bipolar, we know of that stuff.

So a lot of people feel like today is a little bit of a wake-up call for Washington, D.C., to feel how -- and not in a, you know, \"this is what they deserve\" way, but maybe this is the type of firsthand experience some people need to realize how dangerous this world really is."

She sees all this going on. I think Americans are -- Americans are saying, \"I have a right to bear arms,\" as Kat points out. \"I'm going to do it.\""

      "utterance": "Well, I go all over the country. I do focus groups and talk to people about what they're thinking and feeling. And folks across the political spectrum right now feel unsettled; they feel unsafe. They feel like things just aren't quite going their way, and they're angry at Washington. But they're also angry at the anger in Washington. That they feel like they'd like the temperature to be turned down a little bit. I think across America, even though we've had a change of administrations, with a lot of this change, people are feeling very unsettled. They're not feeling particularly safe right now. And I think when people are nervous and scared, that's when more scary things happen."

So -- but I do think one of the things about the humanity of today was Senator Flake called Scalise's wife and said what was going on. Can you imagine getting that phone call? I mean, it just -- it's so frightening. But no, I think a lot of members say, \"No, I am a member of Congress. I know the risks.\" But we have all been at events, and you do feel scared sometimes."
