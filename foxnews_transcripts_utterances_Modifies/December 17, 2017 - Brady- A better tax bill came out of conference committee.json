The House Judiciary Committee taking a big new step to investigate allocations of anti-Trump bias at the FBI. What's more important than trusting the FBI and the DOJ? New questions this morning meanwhile about Paul Ryan's future as Speaker of the House. Good morning everyone, thanks for being here I'm Maria Bartiromo. Welcome to \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" Most of the hard work is done. New -- now Republicans have the votes to pass their tax bill this week. What does it mean for American taxpayers? House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady joins me live in just a moment. Also, lawmakers are promising to subpoena top FBI officials as they look into allegations of bias at the bureau. I'll talk to House Judiciary Committee Member Darrell Issa as well as former U.S. Attorney Bud Cummins. Then following the report he plans to step down after the 2018 midterms, what does the future hold for House Speaker Paul Ryan? Karl Rove joins me on that as we look ahead right now on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\"  And it is a big week ahead on Capitol Hill, Republicans in Congress look to seal the deal on tax reform likely Tuesday. The House is expected to vote on the bill this Tuesday. The Senate should follow suit with a vote later on in the week. The measure then moves to the President's desk where he could sign it into law right before Christmas. Joining us right now to walk us through is Texas Congressman Kevin Brady. He is the Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. Mr. Chairman congratulations to you.",

I think a big improvement over the House and the Senate. I think there are numerous small ones as well but those are really key and at the end of the day look at the difference. So that family of four, average family of four making $73,000 a year will see a tax cut of $2,059. And I know some in Washington sort of think look, that's not much, what -- for families who are hardworking. I don't care where you are, boy that tax relief matters.",

We heard a lot from our U.S. companies and manufacturers saying we will expand under this tax reform. We'll increase paychecks so let's do it now.

And when you look at the corporate rates coming all the way down from 35 percent, that's all about growth. On the individual side, Mr. Chairman, it was a little messier. I wrote an Op- Ed in the Wall Street Journal on Friday just outlining President Trump's first year from an economic standpoint and I said it's nothing short of excellence. But in terms of this tax plan what I write about the individual side is that much of the individual side has been a lot about ensuring that the rich do not get so much tax relief. And so I wonder OK, so you take the top rate down from 39.6 to 37 percent, but I wonder given the fact that the top 10 percent of earners pay 71 percent of the taxes right now. Is that going to be enough to actually encourage them to spend more money given they're losing their deductions, Mr. Chairman? A lot of rich people are seeing their taxes go higher. You know that because of the elimination of the deductions.",

I mean most people forget as well that the current tax code actually has about a two percent rate increase on middle, higher income and higher upper-middle-class families with what's called the (INAUDIBLE) things. So that's gone as well. So we did a lot in there, tax relief at every rate level. And so I think at the end of the day we are going to get growth from those rates on the individual side. Would I have liked it to be simpler and flatter? Yes but here is one key point. We said you started this with us several years ago. This is not our tax code. It belongs to the American people and why we really stripped it down to the foundation to rebuild it. We listened and the American people in our lawmakers said certain provisions are really important in the 21st-century tax code. And this bill reflects those priorities.",

Second of all, the evidence doesn't point that direction. He's announcing he wants to take on entitlement spending next year, he's raising a bundle of money. I think he's transferred -- raised and transferred $30 million to the National Republican Congressional Campaign Committee. He's raising money for a super PAC whose goal is to raise $100 million to keep the Republican majority in the House.

But having said that, the Democrats need to take 24 seats in order to take the House. In order to do that, they have to take a lot of seats held by incumbents. And the real question is going to be by next April, May or June when filing deadlines are closing, have most of those Republican incumbents in those 23 seats held by Republicans that were carried by Hillary Clinton are most of those or almost all of those Republican incumbents running for reelection. If they are and they're taking the races seriously, then the Republicans should be able to hold on to the House.

The House Judiciary Committee taking a big new step to investigate allocations of anti-Trump bias at the FBI. What's more important than trusting the FBI and the DOJ? New questions this morning meanwhile about Paul Ryan's future as Speaker of the House. Good morning everyone, thanks for being here I'm Maria Bartiromo. Welcome to \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" Most of the hard work is done. New -- now Republicans have the votes to pass their tax bill this week. What does it mean for American taxpayers? House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady joins me live in just a moment. Also, lawmakers are promising to subpoena top FBI officials as they look into allegations of bias at the bureau. I'll talk to House Judiciary Committee Member Darrell Issa as well as former U.S. Attorney Bud Cummins. Then following the report he plans to step down after the 2018 midterms, what does the future hold for House Speaker Paul Ryan? Karl Rove joins me on that as we look ahead right now on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" And it is a big week ahead on Capitol Hill, Republicans in Congress look to seal the deal on tax reform likely Tuesday. The House is expected to vote on the bill this Tuesday. The Senate should follow suit with a vote later on in the week. The measure then moves to the President's desk where he could sign it into law right before Christmas. Joining us right now to walk us through is Texas Congressman Kevin Brady. He is the Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. Mr. Chairman congratulations to you."

Tell us about this committee -- the conference committee this past week and what is different in this final bill than what we saw going into it from the House and Senate what's most important in terms of what changes Mr. Chairman?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BRADY",
      "utterance": "Yes Maria, you know normally, maybe the biggest surprise here for everyone is that the Conference Committee report turned down a bill better than neither than the House and Senate and that rarely happens. And I think lowering that top rate is especially important for families in those salt states in making sure that the rates kick in now for every size business in America to make them more competitive immediately again. I think a big improvement over the House and the Senate. I think there are numerous small ones as well but those are really key and at the end of the day look at the difference. So that family of four, average family of four making $73,000 a year will see a tax cut of $2,059. And I know some in Washington sort of think look, that's not much, what -- for families who are hardworking. I don't care where you are, boy that tax relief matters."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Yes, sure. It does matter but you still right now as we speak have the left calling this a giveaway to the rich. I don't understand how they can say this with a straight face and not think that everybody understands that they're doing talking points and they are lying to the American people given the fact that the high end is not seeing giveaways. In any way, this is largely middle-class and corporate rates. But let's go through this 21 percent rate for the corporations here and the pass-through rate. Why was that so critical?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BRADY",
      "utterance": "Well I think it was critical for us to balance out. We want to make sure we lowered the top rate again for those high tax states to make sure they're seeing relief as well. We want to make sure this could balance within the budget and so the decision was made to make a change, a slight change in the corporation but move it forward so that our companies can be competitive. We heard a lot from our U.S. companies and manufacturers saying we will expand under this tax reform. We'll increase paychecks so let's do it now. And now our companies are globally competitive day one, so those were very important I think improvements, big improvements over the House or the Senate bill."

      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",

The whole campaign Donald Trump was talking about bringing trillions of dollars back to America from overseas, but we were thinking it was going to be closer to 10 percent. How did you come upon 15.5 percent on repatriation Mr. Chairman?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BRADY",
      "utterance": "Yes, so it is higher that I think that many people expected higher frankly than I did going into these discussions as well. Look this is all about balancing priorities, moving those rates forward, being this pro- growth as we can. Those dollars will come back and I would tell you, I think the international portion of this, there was a lot of good work done here. I think we'll continue to make improvements. We'll continue as businesses analyze their competitiveness. I think we'll continue to look at that area of tax code going forward."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "All right, so you think then in the coming years, there's still room for movement. Is that what you're saying on some -- on some of this plan?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BRADY",
      "utterance": "Well I do. I will tell you this. I think the message to our global competitors whether it's China, Europe, Canada, Mexico is America is never going to fall this far behind again. We're not waiting 31 years to become competitive again. We're going to continue to match the moves of our competitors. We'll continue to make the changes in our tax code so we can bring these jobs back to America and our local businesses can compete and win anywhere in the world. And so look, there is just a whole new attitude about a making America strong for the long term."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Yes, and much of the conversation around corporate rates coming down has been about growth. There is no doubt that's been your priority, that's been the President's priority. And when you look at the corporate rates coming all the way down from 35 percent, that's all about growth. On the individual side, Mr. Chairman, it was a little messier. I wrote an Op- Ed in the Wall Street Journal on Friday just outlining President Trump's first year from an economic standpoint and I said it's nothing short of excellence. But in terms of this tax plan what I write about the individual side is that much of the individual side has been a lot about ensuring that the rich do not get so much tax relief. And so I wonder OK, so you take the top rate down from 39.6 to 37 percent, but I wonder given the fact that the top 10 percent of earners pay 71 percent of the taxes right now. Is that going to be enough to actually encourage them to spend more money given they're losing their deductions, Mr. Chairman? A lot of rich people are seeing their taxes go higher. You know that because of the elimination of the deductions."

I mean most people forget as well that the current tax code actually has about a two percent rate increase on middle, higher income and higher upper-middle-class families with what's called the (INAUDIBLE) things. So that's gone as well. So we did a lot in there, tax relief at every rate level. And so I think at the end of the day we are going to get growth from those rates on the individual side. Would I have liked it to be simpler and flatter? Yes but here is one key point. We said you started this with us several years ago. This is not our tax code. It belongs to the American people and why we really stripped it down to the foundation to rebuild it. We listened and the American people in our lawmakers said certain provisions are really important in the 21st-century tax code. And this bill reflects those priorities."

She's hired to do research about Trump colluding with the Russians at the same time that we know that Hillary Clinton and her Clinton Foundation took $140 million after allowing the sale of 20 percent of the U.S. stockpile of uranium. Some people call that treason, that happened and yet, Bruce Ohr's wife is hired who works for Fusion GPS. They come up with this dossier which we know is a bunch of garbage and that's actually the justification for wiretapping the Trump organization?"

And there are people along the chain that knew or should have known where it came from, who paid for it and how credible it was. But it was used for foreign surveillance. It was used to unmask United States citizens and then it was formed as the predicate for a Special Counsel that we are dealing with today who is staffed with the same people that shepherded all this fake information through the system.

This is Mr. Strzok to his girlfriend. Lisa Page says you might have been meant to stay where you are because you are meant to protect this country from that menace. Peter answers her, I can protect our country on many levels. So they're talking about an insurance policy here in case Donald Trump is in fact elected president. So what happens? They come back, they see that in fact, America voted in Donald Trump and they decide, we don't like the way this happened so we're going to change things, we're going to change the course of events.

I mean, that agent Strzok knew how he felt about these things and he should have gone to his superiors and said this isn't the right investigation for me to be dealing with. But the management at the FBI should have known that McCabe's wife was running for office and was getting big money from the very people they were investigating. I mean, some of these management decisions at FBI are inexplicable and the good news is they've got a good director in there, Chris Wray. Rod Rosenstein continues to be a guy of integrity and I believe Bob Mueller is a guy of integrity but he's going to have to prove it. He's going to have to prove it pretty soon because if there's -- if he hadn't found anything to support what was the predicate for this investigation, he needs to file a report and tell them there's nothing there and shut it down."

So you know, Weissman or Strzok or you know, McCabe, they gave money to Hillary Clinton's campaign. Should they be working on this investigation about Donald Trump?

But there's a larger -- there's larger problems here about the management and the management decisions that were made.

You know, we've heard the Democrats back to Watergate during the U.S. attorneys firings lament the politicization of the DOJ. But this isn't only politics.

And Paul Ryan is smart enough to know that as Speaker, he would begin to lose a lot of his authority if he were to say, you know what, I'm out of here. Second of all, the evidence doesn't point that direction. He's announcing he wants to take on entitlement spending next year, he's raising a bundle of money. I think he's transferred -- raised and transferred $30 million to the National Republican Congressional Campaign Committee. He's raising money for a super PAC whose goal is to raise $100 million to keep the Republican majority in the House. And look, if your -- if your eyes are on the exit door, some people redouble their efforts but most people just fall into the habit of slowing down and letting things go and I don't sense that in Paul Ryan."

No President has ever been in this bad of shape at this point early in their term as President Trump is not even close. The Republicans as a result of that and failure to pass repeal and replace of ObamaCare are lagging in the so-called generic ballot. But having said that, the Democrats need to take 24 seats in order to take the House. In order to do that, they have to take a lot of seats held by incumbents. And the real question is going to be by next April, May or June when filing deadlines are closing, have most of those Republican incumbents in those 23 seats held by Republicans that were carried by Hillary Clinton are most of those or almost all of those Republican incumbents running for reelection. If they are and they're taking the races seriously, then the Republicans should be able to hold on to the House. But if we've got a lot of retirements among those vulnerable seats, with a lot of open seats or a lot of incumbents not taking the race seriously then the Republican majority is very much in doubt"

First of all, it will start showing up in February in the -- in lower withholdings under the new tables of everybody who gets a paycheck and I think people are going to see more money in their pockets. Small business people are going to be able to take a look at what their tax accountant or their comptroller is going to be able to say, boss, this is what it means for our business. I've talked to some corporate CFO's just like I suspect you have. They will know within minutes of the passage of the final bill exactly what this will do to their bottom line for the coming year and they can adjust their capital investment plans and their benefits and benefit plans and so forth accordingly. And I think it's going to be felt throughout the economy. Look we have a very robust sense that the American economy is revving up. We've had three-quarters to three percent growth consumer confidence high, small business confidence high, corporate CEO confidence high and all of that points add. Then growth abroad, all of those things point to a good -- to a good year in 2018. And the President's approval rating on the economy are significantly higher than this -- than this personal approval or his job approval ratings which shows that people are getting that the economy is getting better. There's just lots of things he does and says to keep that from getting in -- that keep from getting in the way of that."

Well the S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up in the double-digits so you're already seeing an anticipation of this tax plan impacting earnings and you would think that once earnings are better, then companies will use that extra savings to invest in their businesses and hire new workers. What's next do you think for this administration? They come n January, they've got this tax plan passed, historic new legislation, do they go to welfare, do they go to infrastructure, do they go somewhere else?

The Democrats are in the resistance mode so things can pass the House with majority but then they get stuck in the Senate unless there are eight Democrats who are willing to come across and do something constructive. And we don't know that that's the case. In fact, I think it's highly unlikely that's the case. That's why I hold little hope out for major infrastructure bill. Remember the Present talked about a trillion dollar infrastructure bill. Well, first of all, he got resistance on the Republican side. For a lot of them, they look back and say that $800 billion stimulus bill that President Obama promised with shovel-ready jobs, that didn't help generate the economy. And we've now gone through a battle over the tax reform bill in which the Democrats have said we can't add to the deficit. Well, how do you know turnaround, how do we turn around and have the Democrats say oh, well we meant you shouldn't add to the deficit by cutting taxes but my god we're all in favor of adding to the deficit by more spending, a little bit difficult to make that transition."

But when the debt grows significantly faster than the economy, that's when we begin to get into Greek-like difficulty and we're getting into nosebleed territory, and that's why I think the focus of the House on restraining spending, think about this. In March of last -- in March of this year, the CBO did an analysis for the next 10 years. They said over the next 10 years there will be $43 trillion in federal revenues taken in but there will be an estimated $52 trillion in spending. And mandatory spending will go from 70 percent of the budget to nearly 80 percent of the budget and will grow over 70 percent while discretionary spending will grow 18percent.

They did include the usability of that $10,000. But as you know, you live in New York, New Jersey, or California, that $10,000 when you combine it of property tax and income tax, it's not going to go very far toward people who have done the right thing and are earning enough to itemize. This is a bill that's going to be great for business. It's going to help move the economy. It's going to have some problems for a few of us in high tax states and I don't see any relief from Sacramento that's going to lower Californians taxes."

      "utterance": "No. They aren't going to lower taxes in Sacramento and they're not going to lower taxes in New York as well. So the issue is the individual side of this plan is still a little murky. Do you think that a 37 percent rate for the top earners which is down from 39.6 is going to be enough to move the needle on spending? We need to remember that consumer spending is two-thirds of economic growth. So if this is a growth plan, why are they so afraid to lower taxes for the rich, those people who actually pay the majority of taxes and spend the majority of the money?"

This is a good bill for businesses and some good things in it to help get business investment, but if you're an executive in a company or somebody's being asked to make investments and you're paying 53 percent blended in California, this isn't helping you much. And you're right. The investment class of people are going to find this as a problem. I will say one thing in favor of the bill, and that is that it's going to distort the top tax brackets decisions on how to do things. Meaning they're going to make a lot of real estate investments and they're going to do things that move them toward those 20-25 percent rates that are available for pass-through and C-corps. I'm not sure that's altogether good. I would have liked a more balanced bill. I made suggestions to leadership. I didn't get what I wanted but I did -- I will commend them for at least giving us some consideration. You know this is a good bill in some ways. As a matter of fact, it's a bill that when you think about it, Democrats should be voting for because it does a great deal for if you will, the mainstream of workers that they say they care about."

So if that's the best they can do is come out with somebody who should have been jailed instead of notarized and celebritized, I'm OK. You know, making the right vote for your district and Republicans doing what they believe is right to move the economy, that's important. Making votes to try to keep a majority is never a good idea. I think you have to do what Speaker Ryan says he's going to do, entitlement reform, some serious changes. The President wanting to reorganize government and get better trade deals. If we keep the majority, great, if we don't keep the majority, it shouldn't be because we did something to sell out our values, it should be because we did the right thing and for a time it may not be appreciated."

Then, of course, we know that Loretta Lynch then the Head of the DOJ meets with Bill Clinton just a couple days before Hillary is supposed to be interviewed at the FBI.

There are a lot of things that career FBI and Department of Justice people will tell you were wrong in that investigation and many believe the conclusion was wrong. I think the important thing is that we've got to clean up, if you will, the standards at the FBI and Department of Justice, get the politics out of it whether it's a special prosecutor, or special powers for the Inspector General Michael Horowitz, so that he can get through this bureaucracy. You may not be aware of this but your listeners may not, but the Department of Justice is the only cabinet position in which the I.G. is shut out of major parts of investigation specifically wrongdoing by attorneys are something that the I.G. has been locked out of. We've got to get the Inspector General to have that access like I.G.'s do in every other part of government. If that takes a special prosecutor so be it."

      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "I don't even understand why the I.G. would be shut out of that. I mean, it is the Inspector General who uncovered these texts of Lisa Page and Peter Strzok. I mean, if the Inspector General did not find those texts, we wouldn't even know. And you're telling me Robert Mueller didn't realize there was this bias in all of the people he's lined up to do this investigation?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ISSA",
      "utterance": "Well, you know, in Casablanca, people were shocked. There was gambling at Rick's Casino. The reality is there is strong bias within government agencies with the possible exception of the Department of Defense where the military has a real creed not to be political and if you're not controlling it, if you're not recognizing it, if you're not making political -- sorry -- appointment decisions on finding people who were apolitical to the greatest extent possible, you're going to have this problem. And Special Prosecutor Mueller is -- has picked people with very easy to find, strong biases, strong contribution history that says they probably are not the right people for an investigation of either side"

      "speaker": "ISSA",
      "utterance": "I believe that that was said by the Deputy Attorney General that there is a possibility based on the I.G.'s ongoing investigation that they may have to reopen it because of these flaws. I think when you have a career professional telling us that, the answer is yes:"

It's time for our panel. A.B. Stoddard is an Associate Editor and a Columnist with Real Clear Politics. Susan Ferrechio is Chief Congressional Correspondent with the Washington Examiner. It's good to see you both. Thanks so much for joining us. The tax plan, Susan?"

Remember they started the year with great ambitions and fell flat on their faces when they tried to repeal the health care law. They tried and failed and they tried and they failed. They lost momentum, they were discouraged. Everybody thought that the tax plan was going to be impossible to put through because they didn't pass the ObamaCare. Not only are they going to pass this tax plan this week, but it repeals the ObamaCare mandate which again accomplishes something else that they promised in the 2016 campaign."

      "utterance": "That's true and I think when Chairman Brady talks about you know, fixing his system after 31 years, and what it's going to do in terms of economic growth is that is a great talking point. The problem is for them, it unites them, as Susan said it gives them an accomplishment, maybe they can move on to infrastructure with that unity. The problem is whether or not voters really feel it is a boom in the midterms. You were talking about this earlier in the show. It might not be. It will help the party hold together, it will energize donors, and their own voters. But whether or not it brings them around from their other problems is something that they continue to work out."

      "speaker": "FERRECHIO",

      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",

    {
      "speaker": "FERRECHIO",
      "utterance": "Well, you know what he will have to stand on is the fact if they pass the tax bill you will still see the stock market soaring. You'll still see you know, a confidence boosted for businesses and small businesses and large businesses alike. So I think that's going to help. The economy is rolling along at a good clip right now. That's going to continue. If they hadn't passed this tax bill, a lot of business people were predicting things will go in the opposite direction."

But what will his personal approval ratings be in the districts that the Republicans need to hold on to hold a majority in the House? I think moving on this thing like infrastructure for another win is much more -- it's just a better prospect for them in tackling --"

      "speaker": "STODDARD",
      "utterance": "At the same time, the President should not attack the FBI. He is the commander-in-chief and attacking his own institutions is a mistake. The other thing is the Special Counsel. Robert Mueller's body of work will be assessed for what it is. When that product comes out, people can flip out but not until then. What he is doing is a result of President Trump firing James Comey. It is not a result of the dossier. He is looking into Obstruction of Justice. There are potential financial crimes being examined here. That is completely separate from texts between lovers and the other question."
