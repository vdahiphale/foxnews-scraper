If you look at the numbers, border states sending migrants north by the numbers and there you see the numbers to Washington, New York, Chicago and Martha's Vineyard. If you look at the numbers for the Del Rio sector in July, the encounters were 49,563. Del Rio, Texas has a population of 34,000. Martha's Vineyard got 50 migrants today, year round population about 17,000 goes down in the winter. Let's bring in our panel, Byron York Chief Political Correspondent, The Washington Examiner. Marie Harf, former State Department spokeswoman under President Obama and syndicated radio host, Hugh Hewitt. Byron, what about this? There is an element here that these are humans that are traveling the country. This is a political move, but it's also something that does get attention.",

As for the fact that these are human beings and should be treated humanely and should be taken care of if they are in the United States. You have to remember, the Biden administration has been moving illegal border crossers into other cities around the country. We've received reports of airplanes landing in the middle of the night at Westchester County Airport. In New York, we've seen reports of dozens of flights arriving in Jacksonville, Florida. Earlier this year, NBC reported that the Biden administration actually had a plan to relocate illegal crossers to many cities inside the United States. So, I think what the border state governors have done is to just push this problem into the national spotlight where it cannot be ignored. And by the way, every number you just showed of border crossers you've gone to, Chicago or to New York or Washington. All of those are less than cross the border in a single day.",

And also flying them to places like Martha's Vineyard, where they do not have an infrastructure like we do in Washington or other cities to actually assist these migrants. So, this is a political stunt. This is being used for sort of media attention purposes, in part because the issues they had been using for the past few weeks and months, namely inflation, and some other issues are starting to get a little better for the president. And I think Republican governors know that this is something they're based in voters care about. And they believe this as a political issue they can win on so they are using these migrants as political pawns. And it is cruel.",

I've been following the individual stories of the migrants, and they are speaking they -- were offered the voluntary assistance to move to D.C. and to Martha's Vineyard, they did it all by consent. They are no doubt better off where they are tonight than where they were a month ago. But in one stroke, Governors Ron DeSantis have put a human face not only on the migrants, but on the communities that received them without any infrastructure, Marie. I live in Southern California, for most of the last three decades, there isn't an infrastructure to receive 2 million people, that is a myth. The border has to be defended.",
