And the process is going to take place next Wednesday and Thursday at the Rules Committee, where we will hear testimony. The effort that we're after is to create a circumstance where, in an administration, as we know Barack Obama's administration, had between $5 billion and $15 billion a year to use the spending as they saw it should take place.
