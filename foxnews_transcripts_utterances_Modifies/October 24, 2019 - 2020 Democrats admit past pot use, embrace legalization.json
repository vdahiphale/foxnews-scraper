This is “The Five.” The impeachment battle boiling over on Capitol Hill. Republicans now demanding to know when and who the whistleblower is. And they want that person to testify publicly.  It comes as President Trump is praising House Republicans as, quote, \"tough and smart\" after they stormed the closed-door impeachment hearing. Today, Senator Lindsey Graham introduced a resolution condemning the inquiry. He and other Republicans not happy with how the process is playing out.",

But unfortunately, Juan, this is what happens when you lose elections. The Democrats outvoted the Republicans in the midterms. Pelosi has the gavel. They can do whatever the hell they want. And the Republicans are force to pull the stuff.  It's really people who stayed home on election day last time. I mean, if you want to point fingers, they needed more Trump voters and they didn't get them. And now, Trump is getting eaten alive by people on the inside.  First it was Comey and McCabe. The transition was a horror show. And then there was all these people working against him, an embassy at the National Security Council and he can't get anything done because every time he tries to do one thing or the other, people cut him down in the dark. And it's really disgraceful. Ukraine is the most corrupt basically, on the entire planet. This place is a mess. We send them billions of dollars. Everyone is getting rich over there, including the Biden family. They colluded with the Democrats last election. It's a Russian speaking country. It's totally a mess. And all the president is trying to do is find out what the hell is going on over there, find out what happened last time, how is everything starting to begin with. He's playing politics. He's trying to fight back. And he's getting killed for it.   Now, they are holding secret impeachment hearings. It's disgusting. And all the Republicans want to do is find out what's happening behind closed doors and they can't even share their side of the story, because all the whistleblowers and their lawyers have colluded with Schiff in order to tee this ting up.  Now does anyone even care in the administration? They don't even have a team that's fighting this thing. I mean, I've said more things on the show to push back against what's going on than I've seen out of the White House. Where is the Senate? Where is Lindsey Graham? Why isn't he holding hearings? Why isn't he interviewing the people that are testifying behind closed doors?  It's time for them to get tougher than they already are. You know, you can say I condemn this. You can send a bunch of guys in to try to find out what's going on, but they need lawyers, they need killers, they need people with experience, parliamentarians who know who to fight this thing.

They were preferring a Mitt Romney who got Candy Crowley. You don't have it in the White House now. This guy likes to punch back and he's going to do it. Donny Deutsch calling someone a weenie. This guy is an eight-pack of ball park franks. I mean, he still wears Speedo's under his suit. OK. That's what a weenie is.   But here's the deal. Calling those Republicans out as a bunch of white guys, what you're doing is you are injecting color into something where it has no relevance. So, what's that -- what's that called when you inject race into something where there is no racist variable? It's called race- baiting. So, CNN and MSNBC are engaging in something incredibly pretty dangerous. They always have it. It's getting pretty bad. They are seeking to divide a country based on pigment. That's what they are doing. And when I see that, it makes me realize how awful the media is. And if you subtracted the media from the story, we probably get closer to the truth. And to be honest, the truth is the media and the Democrats would prefer only one kind of resistance, their own. Which is why they are calling these guys a mob. That's why they create hate hoaxes. They demean supporters. They fabricate racial animus.   They do that because they're trying to scare the way they scare like anybody who believes their pack, whether it's Candace Owens or Peter Thiel. If they're not, you know, if you are black and you are not a liberal, if you are a gay and not a conservative, you're dead.  So, I just think, I think it's good to fight back. I don't think it was a mob. They are doing the job that the journalist -- like journalists prefer to get it spoon-fed to them from Adam Schiff.",

There is this concept of the secondhand information, where did this whistleblower get that information? How credible are those sources? And then also just the fact that the whistleblower didn't check that box that said yes in fact he had spoken to the likes of Adam Schiff ahead of time. So, I think all of the questions around the whistleblower are the problem. So, Republicans, I'm not a big fan of them storming a hearing. That's all nonsense. But I do think that they are concerned about Adam Schiff as being an honest person is real. I mean, he has lied repeatedly several times throughout this.

BILA: Juan, if you take all the distraction away, though, I think it's a good point. How much time do we actually spend looking at Facebook, looking on social media, scrolling through old e-mails? We take all that out, you can be just as productive in less hours, can't you?",

I mean, they ate the fried chicken in the room. They all do sit-ins over guns. The mob action, the Democrats love mob action. That's what they've been doing the less three years. But unfortunately, Juan, this is what happens when you lose elections. The Democrats outvoted the Republicans in the midterms. Pelosi has the gavel. They can do whatever the hell they want. And the Republicans are force to pull the stuff. It's really people who stayed home on election day last time. I mean, if you want to point fingers, they needed more Trump voters and they didn't get them. And now, Trump is getting eaten alive by people on the inside. First it was Comey and McCabe. The transition was a horror show. And then there was all these people working against him, an embassy at the National Security Council and he can't get anything done because every time he tries to do one thing or the other, people cut him down in the dark. And it's really disgraceful. Ukraine is the most corrupt basically, on the entire planet. This place is a mess. We send them billions of dollars. Everyone is getting rich over there, including the Biden family. They colluded with the Democrats last election. It's a Russian speaking country. It's totally a mess. And all the president is trying to do is find out what the hell is going on over there, find out what happened last time, how is everything starting to begin with. He's playing politics. He's trying to fight back. And he's getting killed for it. Now, they are holding secret impeachment hearings. It's disgusting. And all the Republicans want to do is find out what's happening behind closed doors and they can't even share their side of the story, because all the whistleblowers and their lawyers have colluded with Schiff in order to tee this ting up. Now does anyone even care in the administration? They don't even have a team that's fighting this thing. I mean, I've said more things on the show to push back against what's going on than I've seen out of the White House. Where is the Senate? Where is Lindsey Graham? Why isn't he holding hearings? Why isn't he interviewing the people that are testifying behind closed doors? It's time for them to get tougher than they already are. You know, you can say I condemn this. You can send a bunch of guys in to try to find out what's going on, but they need lawyers, they need killers, they need people with experience, parliamentarians who know who to fight this thing.

This guy is an eight-pack of ball park franks. I mean, he still wears Speedo's under his suit. OK. That's what a weenie is. But here's the deal. Calling those Republicans out as a bunch of white guys, what you're doing is you are injecting color into something where it has no relevance. So, what's that -- what's that called when you inject race into something where there is no racist variable? It's called race- baiting. So, CNN and MSNBC are engaging in something incredibly pretty dangerous. They always have it. It's getting pretty bad. They are seeking to divide a country based on pigment. That's what they are doing. And when I see that, it makes me realize how awful the media is. And if you subtracted the media from the story, we probably get closer to the truth. And to be honest, the truth is the media and the Democrats would prefer only one kind of resistance, their own. Which is why they are calling these guys a mob. That's why they create hate hoaxes. They demean supporters. They fabricate racial animus. They do that because they're trying to scare the way they scare like anybody who believes their pack, whether it's Candace Owens or Peter Thiel. If they're not, you know, if you are black and you are not a liberal, if you are a gay and not a conservative, you're dead. So, I just think, I think it's good to fight back. I don't think it was a mob. They are doing the job that the journalist -- like journalists prefer to get it spoon-fed to them from Adam Schiff."

      "speaker": "BILA",

There are these allegations now of serious political bias, of not only being a registered Democrat but having worked with high-profile Democrats in the past. There is this concept of the secondhand information, where did this whistleblower get that information? How credible are those sources? And then also just the fact that the whistleblower didn't check that box that said yes in fact he had spoken to the likes of Adam Schiff ahead of time. So, I think all of the questions around the whistleblower are the problem. So, Republicans, I'm not a big fan of them storming a hearing. That's all nonsense. But I do think that they are concerned about Adam Schiff as being an honest person is real. I mean, he has lied repeatedly several times throughout this. And also, just concerns about the whistleblower. In this particular case, seem -- seems to be more concern. I would be looking at this and saying, we need to hear from where this information came from."

Because it's threatening, because they're so used to living in an academic bubble where everyone agrees and the people who don't agree fall in line or they face punishment. The students get ostracized or the people in administration get ostracized in the faculty rooms. They're so used to everyone caving and they're so worried that the student body might heaven forbid, go to one of these things and just learn something or maybe say, oh, you know what, these people who believe something different than I do. They're not so bad or maybe we've actually thinking for themselves. Heaven forbids. Colleges and universities are turning into the biggest waste of money for parents because you send your kids to school, and this kind of insanity ensues. I mean, can you imagine that there is an anti-ICE protest on a campus and the newspaper just simply covers the event and simply asks for a comment. And now you actually have students protesting. And I want to know how those students got into Harvard or got into a school that supposed to be reputable. If they don't even have the basic knowledge of how basic journalism works. I mean, this is not something that we should even be debating, but it's a sad state of affairs. And I really think parents should look at this and say, do I want to send my kids to an indoctrination camp where they're not going to learn how to think, where their views, if they differ at all from the mainstream, will be completely shot down.

Now, I do understand, by the way so what they did doesn't reflect agreement with ICE or disagreement with ICE. It's just journalism. But I do think, I understand the instinct of the people who are protesting. I don't think they're mindless. I don't think that they are venal. I think that they want to call out ICE for breaking up families, for imprisoning children. I think they feel ICE is an abusive place.

If you deem somebody a moral, right, then all their speech is hate speech, then their hate speech becomes a hate crime. Then you could shut out - I don't need to hear them. They were immoral. And then you remove dialog and what's the next step when you remove dialog, violence. The interesting thing about an activist mentality is there's a lot of research or new research that shows, they reject community-based functions, fun things to do with people. Instead, they choose activism because you can exercise power over the people. They're not interested in a back and forth. They're interested in domination. That is why activists like that are always so angry and so friendless. So that's why - that's why there is no back and forth. A, they think you're evil, and B, they don't want to talk to you."
