His family claims the doctor was beaten, electrocuted, and subjected to other tortures. Ultimately, he was released from detention, but Fitaihi and his family are barred from leaving Saudi Arabia.  The crackdown reportedly served as a mechanism for Crown Prince bin Salman to silence his critics and consolidate his power.

Jamal Khashoggi had been living in exile in writing about bin Salman's crackdowns in critics and activists. Saudi officials track Khashoggi to a consulate in Istanbul, Turkey, where he was killed and dismembered. Bin Salman has always denied connection to the murder, but cannot escape suspicion.

It's still early, but I think it's also worth looking at how the Democratic Party itself led everybody to this situation. They had for a really long time clearly supported Joe Biden, the establishment pick. He was supposed to be doing really well. He was supposed to basically have things on his way to wrapping up by South Carolina. I think that people took their eyes off Bernie when he had his heart attack and they just assumed that he was going to be out of his race. He came back stronger than ever. Elizabeth Warren was having her surge right at that time, so I think that also added to why people thought that it was going to be a time. Then for some reason the party puts forth this impeachment proceeding that ends three days before Iowa, utterly destroys Biden.

His family claims the doctor was beaten, electrocuted, and subjected to other tortures. Ultimately, he was released from detention, but Fitaihi and his family are barred from leaving Saudi Arabia.

A federal appeals court says Florida cannot bar felons who served their time from registering to vote simply because they have failed to pay all fines and fees stemming from their cases. That ruling upholds a Tallahassee federal judge's preliminary injunction against the measure approved overwhelmingly by voters in 2018. Judges say the rule amounts to an unfair poll tax that would disenfranchise many of those felons. There are growing concerns among Democrats tonight about the possibility that none of their presidential candidates will have enough delegates to secure the party's nomination outright at their convention this summer. That opens up the prospect of a contested convention, a brokered convention. Whatever you want to call it, it's potentially a mess.

Let's bring in our panel, Steve Hayes, editor of \"The Dispatch,\" Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at \"The Federalist,\" and Michael Crowley, White House correspondent for \"The New York Times.\" OK, Steve, it just seems that going into this debate that Mike Bloomberg seems to have the target on his back, whereas Bernie Sanders is leading this race exponentially. You look at the latest ABC/\"Washington Post\" national poll, he is up eight since January, that's a national poll. And the RCP average on national, Nevada, and South Carolina puts him within striking distance of Biden in South Carolina in recent polls."

You have got two 78-year-old candidates, probably the leaders in the Democratic field, going after one another about their relative heart health at this point. That's not really the debate that you want to have. If you look at where Mike Bloomberg has spent so far, it's approaching $450 million through two contests which he didn't participate in."

      "utterance": "Never anything like that. For perspective, Hillary Clinton in her entire campaign in 2016 spent about $1.2 billion. Donald Trump won by spending roughly $650 million. So you've got Michael Bloomberg before he has been a candidate anywhere, before he has been on a ballot anywhere, having spent what is approaching what Donald Trump spent in the entire thing. So this is totally new territory. I think Michael Bloomberg is likely to be the target of a lot of attacks tonight, which I think is sort of shortsighted. You can imagine why Democrats on the stage with him would want to go after him. He's new, he's a billionaire, he's a former Republican, he's not really from their party. So he presents an attractive target. But it's shortsighted because each one of those candidates wants to be the one left standing to take on Bernie Sanders, who is the strongest."

It seems like they are still driving, even though the prospects, as you keep going along here, get smaller and smaller for some of these campaigns. MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR, \"THE FEDERALIST\": It does seem to be a perfect storm here where nobody has any incentive to get out at this point. It's still early, but I think it's also worth looking at how the Democratic Party itself led everybody to this situation. They had for a really long time clearly supported Joe Biden, the establishment pick. He was supposed to be doing really well. He was supposed to basically have things on his way to wrapping up by South Carolina. I think that people took their eyes off Bernie when he had his heart attack and they just assumed that he was going to be out of his race. He came back stronger than ever. Elizabeth Warren was having her surge right at that time, so I think that also added to why people thought that it was going to be a time. Then for some reason the party puts forth this impeachment proceeding that ends three days before Iowa, utterly destroys Biden. So now everyone is glomming on to Bloomberg as this savior, and he's had to spend half a billion dollars to still say in the low teens in votes. This is kind of a disaster."

I think there are a lot of moderate centrist Democrats who see Bloomberg as a savior, but I think a lot of Democrats think this guy is coming in and hijacking our party the way a lot of Republicans felt about Trump. Where are his Democratic credentials? He's a former Republican. He has taken all sorts of positions that are anathema to party gospel, including -- I believe he compared the teachers unions to radicalism, in his words, of the NRA."

It may not be the issue they want to focus on, but it is an issue. If you've got two guys leading that potentially are older than Reagan was when he left office, that's a big deal."

This is why it's problematic for Bernie Sanders to have reversed himself now and suggested he's not going to put out his full medical records. I think we'll see this is a test of the proposition that Michael raised, and I agree with him. The question will be what is the tolerance among Democrats who are looking for an alternative to Bernie Sanders for this kind of rhetoric from Mike Bloomberg? Do they say, we are going to go with Bloomberg because we think he gives us the best chance to take Donald Trump and the swallow all of their concerns. I think that would be hard for a lot of progressives."

It's also true, though, that people tend to make decisions on more personal thing then in the abstract, and Bernie Sanders is getting a lot of crowds. I do want to say one quick thing about the comparison between Trump and Bloomberg. You hear people say they are both New York brash billionaires. I think the big difference is that Bloomberg seems to have the support of the establishment in his party and the media, whereas Trump had to fight against those things, but he had support of the people in taking on actual issues -- immigration, interventionist wars, trade deals. And with Mike Bloomberg, clearly the establishment is willing to make this deal hoping that he will be able to stop Bernie Sanders from getting enough of a plurality. Will the people be that way, though?"

And I think if you look at him on the debate stage or you see him out on the campaign trail, he looks like somebody who is not up for the job. That is not necessarily a statement about his age. He just looks like he can't be the guy to take on Donald Trump. I think that matters a lot to rank-and-file Democrats who see him, especially in these early states, you see him up close, you're in the room, you have a chance to ask him a question. He doesn't seem like a vigorous candidate to take on Donald Trump, and some of these others, I think, present an alternative."

One is there are so many problems with the field and there are so many flaws with the candidates. And Bernie Sanders has a strong base but very strong opposition. Michael Bloomberg has strong support among a small minority right now in the party and a lot of people who can't tolerate him. But then, on top of it all, you have a process that looks like it could stretch out for a really long time. You could have the field divided up. You could have nobody get a majority of delegates. This could go to the convention. Every time we head towards a convention, people say you are going to say you have a brokered convention, contest. And there are a lot of years where people say this is really the time and it's not. But it does seem like you have the stars aligning in a very plausible way right now. It's a nightmare scenario because Democrats feel like this is a national emergency. They just want to get Trump out at all costs, but they can't agree on how to do it."
