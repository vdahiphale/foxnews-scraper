The question I have for all the Democrats right now, especially for the people who voted for some of these new members who came in today, swearing to the things they weren't going to do, like vote for Nancy Pelosi. My question to all of them now is, why are you putting the value of those who are at our border trying to overrun our border agents on the weekends during - in San Diego, why are you putting their rights ahead of American's rights? Why are you putting the lives of Americans at risk such as that brave officer in California who was killed by somebody who is here illegally and protected through - just show sanctuary city laws, which actually have now cost lives again?  My question to the Democrats today is, putting this bill up, knowing it won't get signed, knowing the Senate won't take it up and knowing it doesn't put border security at the front and foremost - the President is right, we have to protect our borders and fix our broken immigration system.",

I have not changed the text from the articles I introduced back in July 2017.\" Let's take a look at the rule book. Article I, Section 2, \"The House of Representatives shall have the sole Power of Impeachment.\" It requires a simple majority. Article I, Section 3, \"the Senate shall have the sole Power to try all Impeachments. And no person shall be convicted without concurrence of two-thirds of the members present.\"   According to an op-ed that Sherman wrote back in 2017, he thinks the easiest provable crime is obstruction. Here's what he said. \"We have the sworn testimony of a credible and percipient witness and Trump's own words on videotape, Lester Holt, and audiotape, The New York Times. It is time now for the House Judiciary Committee to begin hearings on impeachment.\"  Well, Democrats right now control the House, but it appears Mr. Sherman's dreams of hearings are perhaps, in a word, premature.",

They've taken him at every turn to say we are going to disagree, going to find everything wrong.

Donald Trump has brought and done what he said he was going to do. He's brought America jobs, he's taken the right way to regulations, he's filed to keep our border safe, he's made to keep our standing across the world strong again. What they don't like is someone who succeeds. They don't like a President who actually does what he says he's going to do. All Brad Sherman did today was run to the front, file his bill so he could get the text and the tweet and the news release saying, I'm the first in this Congress to try and impeach Donald Trump.

Let's begin with a case out of California that made national headlines. 33-year-old illegal immigrant and gang member Gustavo Perez Arriaga is now charged with shooting and killing Newman police officer Ron Singh after being stopped for a suspicion of driving under the influence. He had also been arrested for drunk driving in 2011 and 2014. In most states, those arrests would have led to ICE being notified of Arriaga's illegal status. But under California sanctuary law, local police are prevented from cooperating with federal immigration agents. Officer Singh leaves behind a wife and 5-month-old son, and we just learned that President Trump spoke this evening with the officer's family and colleagues. Mexico native Amancio Betancourt Martinez was deported from the U.S. in 2015 after a drug conviction. Now, after illegally reentering the U.S., the 27-year-old is now charged with raping a young girl in Alabama. In Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, a 17-year-old illegal immigrant from Mexico in jail for murder was released after just seven months. The jail called it a clerical error. And he was rebooked but was still a free man for over 30 hours. Meantime, ICE has placed a detainer on an illegal immigrant from Jamaica who admitted to shooting and killing a 12-year-old boy in Connecticut. Tajay Chambers said he mistook the boy for his older cousin. And finally, back to the Golden State. Illegal immigrant Gustavo Garcia Ruiz was arrested in Central California last month for being under the influence of drugs. When ICE learned he was in jail, they placed an immigration detainer asking deputies to notify them before releasing him. But under California's sanctuary law, he was instead released. Days later, Garcia Ruiz allegedly committed 11 crimes, including killing a stranger and shooting at others before he was killed during a high-speed police chase. And here's the gut kick. Garcia Ruiz is a known convicted, violent criminal; armed robbery, assault with a deadly weapon, repeatedly deported. But in California, none of that can be used to notify immigration agents.

The question I have for all the Democrats right now, especially for the people who voted for some of these new members who came in today, swearing to the things they weren't going to do, like vote for Nancy Pelosi. My question to all of them now is, why are you putting the value of those who are at our border trying to overrun our border agents on the weekends during - in San Diego, why are you putting their rights ahead of American's rights? Why are you putting the lives of Americans at risk such as that brave officer in California who was killed by somebody who is here illegally and protected through - just show sanctuary city laws, which actually have now cost lives again? My question to the Democrats today is, putting this bill up, knowing it won't get signed, knowing the Senate won't take it up and knowing it doesn't put border security at the front and foremost - the President is right, we have to protect our borders and fix our broken immigration system."

In other words, listen to us, but don't watch us. And right now, there is a disaster going on of aid in Georgia and Florida and many other places.

But with the new Congress, all bills from last session expired, undeterred, he tried again, tweeting, \"Today, I reintroduced Articles of #Impeachment against @realDonaldTrump with @RepAlGreen. I have not changed the text from the articles I introduced back in July 2017.\" Let's take a look at the rule book. Article I, Section 2, \"The House of Representatives shall have the sole Power of Impeachment.\" It requires a simple majority. Article I, Section 3, \"the Senate shall have the sole Power to try all Impeachments. And no person shall be convicted without concurrence of two-thirds of the members present.\" According to an op-ed that Sherman wrote back in 2017, he thinks the easiest provable crime is obstruction. Here's what he said. \"We have the sworn testimony of a credible and percipient witness and Trump's own words on videotape, Lester Holt, and audiotape, The New York Times. It is time now for the House Judiciary Committee to begin hearings on impeachment.\" Well, Democrats right now control the House, but it appears Mr. Sherman's dreams of hearings are perhaps, in a word, premature."

If they could have filed articles of impeachment in November of '16 after he won the election, they would have done it then. They've given no opportunity to this President. They've taken him at every turn to say we are going to disagree, going to find everything wrong. They've even introduced all of those impeachment based on things that he said that are actually words of Democrat's mouth, that were mean to people. Donald Trump has brought and done what he said he was going to do. He's brought America jobs, he's taken the right way to regulations, he's filed to keep our border safe, he's made to keep our standing across the world strong again. What they don't like is someone who succeeds. They don't like a President who actually does what he says he's going to do. All Brad Sherman did today was run to the front, file his bill so he could get the text and the tweet and the news release saying, I'm the first in this Congress to try and impeach Donald Trump. How about we actually look at what's actually going on and follow the rule of law? Why don't we actually do what even his Speaker said, is find out if anything is actually there? Instead of saying, \"Oh, I've got the solution,\" \"no, let's get over the photo ops,\" let's let the President be the President. And by the way, Brad Sherman, why don't we work in San Diego in your own State of California about what's going on at the border and let's fix that?"

Congressman Jim Cooper and Congresswoman Elissa Slotkin voting \"present.\" They couldn't even pick anybody. They couldn't make up their minds. And congress - this is my favorite. Congressman Jeff Van Drew, who is one of the very last, based on his name, to vote, he stood up and said, \"No.\" I mean, he literally stood up and said, \"No.\" What? You don't want a Speaker? Was there a doctor, no? Who was it? Who you're actually voting for? Actual profiles encourage people. This is a terrible embarrassment. You don't even know who you want to have to be the Speaker of the House. Well, it's been a busy day and night in Washington. And here to make sense of it all is David Bossie, former Trump 2016 Deputy Campaign Manager, co- author of the new book Trump's Enemies, and now a Fox News contributor, and Chris Hahn, former aide to Senator Chuck Schumer. Thank you, gentlemen, both for being here. Chris, I want to start with you. Brad Sherman, first order of business, dropped articles of impeachment. Is that the right move?

Those - the radical left of the Democrat Party wants to impeach this President. They hate this President more than they love the country. I say it all the time, and it is true.

Let's begin with a case out of California that made national headlines. 33-year-old illegal immigrant and gang member Gustavo Perez Arriaga is now charged with shooting and killing Newman police officer Ron Singh after being stopped for a suspicion of driving under the influence. He had also been arrested for drunk driving in 2011 and 2014. In most states, those arrests would have led to ICE being notified of Arriaga's illegal status. But under California sanctuary law, local police are prevented from cooperating with federal immigration agents. Officer Singh leaves behind a wife and 5-month-old son, and we just learned that President Trump spoke this evening with the officer's family and colleagues. Mexico native Amancio Betancourt Martinez was deported from the U.S. in 2015 after a drug conviction. Now, after illegally reentering the U.S., the 27-year-old is now charged with raping a young girl in Alabama. In Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, a 17-year-old illegal immigrant from Mexico in jail for murder was released after just seven months. The jail called it a clerical error. And he was rebooked but was still a free man for over 30 hours. Meantime, ICE has placed a detainer on an illegal immigrant from Jamaica who admitted to shooting and killing a 12-year-old boy in Connecticut. Tajay Chambers said he mistook the boy for his older cousin. And finally, back to the Golden State. Illegal immigrant Gustavo Garcia Ruiz was arrested in Central California last month for being under the influence of drugs. When ICE learned he was in jail, they placed an immigration detainer asking deputies to notify them before releasing him. But under California's sanctuary law, he was instead released. Days later, Garcia Ruiz allegedly committed 11 crimes, including killing a stranger and shooting at others before he was killed during a high-speed police chase. And here's the gut kick. Garcia Ruiz is a known convicted, violent criminal; armed robbery, assault with a deadly weapon, repeatedly deported. But in California, none of that can be used to notify immigration agents. Jason."

That concertina wire by itself reduced the apprehensions. It reduced the people that got away and increased the effectiveness and the probability of arrest. That really helped us, and that's just concertina wire, temporary wire. Imagine what a wall can do. A wall can really help Border Patrol agents, and it's a matter of officer safety and the safety of the American public."

You're a great person for the limited time I've interacted with you, but I have to believe in a guy who's been at the border for 18 years, put his life on the line, and is out there arresting people that are trying to sneak into this country. Some of them are good, decent people, maybe, but we don't know. And they've taken 17,000 criminals that have been coming up north here. I have to tell you, it is a huge problem. I thank you, gentlemen. It's going to continue, and we hope you continue to come back and join us on this show. Again, up next, less than four hours on the job and every single House Democrat votes to leave town, putting the ball in the Senate's court to make that next move on the shutdown showdown. Senator Mike Lee from Utah joins me on the next steps to end this bitter border battle."

Mike and I are friends, the senator and I both having represented the state of Utah. But Senator, thank you for joining us here. Is Mitch McConnell right?

Sometimes there's a good reason to cast a vote even if you're not sure that it's going to pass. Sometimes setting the record for who is where on that vote is helpful.

No. Are they saying that there is something inherently evil about the would be 651st mile? No. We are talking about a number that's infinitesimally small compared to the overall budget. We are not talking about one percent of the federal budget or even one half of one percent of the budget. This is necessary to keep our country safe to protect our border. We need to do it."

I think most Americans don't even know that we are in a shutdown because they don't feel the effects of it. The normal pitch points of veterans, our military, Social Security, all of that is open and running. So I don't even know if America necessarily even noticing it. I know it's hard on the federal workers who expect and deserve their paychecks. But are there Democrats that will eventually get to this point?"

    {
      "speaker": "LEE",

And the reason I say that is most of the Democrats I talk to in the House and in the Senate are not themselves that offended by the idea of spending money on a fence to protect our border. Most of them acknowledge this is not a big deal. And so I don't know why they are spending so much political capital on making sure that we can't make the American people safe with a fence."

      "utterance": "Yes, he did. And look, at the outset, I want to say his predecessor, my former colleague, Senator Orrin Hatch, was kind to me when I came in. He didn't tell me how to do my job, and I intend to extend the same courtesy to my new colleague, Senator Romney. That said, I disagree with his op-ed. I don't think it was the right approach. I think it's important -- I respect the fact that he wants to work with the president and support him where he agrees with him. I don't think it's necessarily helpful to come in and attack his character right at the get-go, right at the beginning of his legislative career."

He was elected to solve problems. That's what he's known for. This created a problem and it didn't actually solve a problem."

But here's what I can say. As you know, I have my concerns about this president, but I've been very pleased with what he's actually done in office. If we look at what he's done, he's made the American people safer, he has made our economy stronger, and he has fought big government. That's what we elected him to do."

If you look down at the bottom, 1/2020th percentage obviously taking a stab at Senator Warren. Being in the Senate, obviously with the 2020 election, how much of a distraction is this going to be? Because so many of your colleagues, they all look in the mirror and they don't see themselves as a senator. They see themselves as the next president of the United States."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LEE",
      "utterance": "That's right. They say when a senator looks in the mirror, he or she sees a president. It doesn't have that effect on me but apparently a lot of other people do have that reaction. Look, there's no question about it. This is going to be a three-ring circus. But we are familiar with three ring circuses like this this in the Senate. I saw it a few years ago when all of my Republican colleagues and half of my Democratic colleagues were running for president of the same time. We're gearing up for the same thing in 2020, just on the Democratic side."

But I just don't understand how the Democrats on day one, four hours into office, they decide in the House, hey, we're going to go into recess. We are not coming back until Tuesday, and that they sent over a bill not to the Senate that doesn't have even a dime for border wall funding."

      "utterance": "It's silly. It's petulant, and I call upon them to reconsider what they've done, to reconsider the fact that in the past, for 20 years now, Congress has been calling on our federal government to make sure that we protect our border. This is a step necessary to do that. They have voted for more funding than this in the past, and they need to give this funding now."
