That something, as you pointed out with him that you've been talking about it, we've been covering a lot at The Weekly Standard.   I think there are going to be interesting documents here. Even the 576 that we've seen so far, we've learned a lot about Al Qaeda, we've learned a lot about its relationships. We've learned about its work with state sponsors. We've learned about relationships between Al Qaeda senior leadership and the Taliban. What it's done just in that little glimpse of these documents that we've seen is give us an understanding of the enemy we are fighting and that we've been fighting for the past 16 years. I think these documents will provide a much deeper look at that. It will allow not only intelligence analysts but the American public to better appreciate and understand how they have adapted to the fight that we've been engaged in the past 16 years.",

The question of course at the end of the day is, will North Korea buckle under sanctions? They are now about the most sanctioned country on earth, and they continue their forward march toward a nuclear arsenal. So the question arises, can that be stopped with sanctions? We don't really know because the full range of sanctions has yet to be imposed, but I think it's an indispensable first step before you try to consider what else you would do.

You have to do this, but the North Koreans are showing that they are survivors. They're willing to persevere. Someone said the other day they're willing to eat grass if that's what it takes to keep this nuclear program going.  I think the key question now of course on the farther horizon is the question of whether we are going to have a use of military force. The near-term question is will we, the U.S., maybe some of our allies, start to sanction Chinese financial entities that do business with North Korea and risk some kind of rupture with our very important economic relationship with China which can reverberate at all kinds of dangerous rays for our economy and for the world economy.

This idea that you can't contain North Korea, they really do have nuclear power or they are on the precipice. So why not just admit it and move on? Partly because they will not be able to be contained. They will share this information with North Korea, which is why sanctions need to be stepped up.  It is very good to have this deal that brings along the Russians and the Chinese, the Chinese in particular who do so much trading with North Korea. But in order for sanctions to work they have to hurt, and North Korea is very effective at predicting the hurt of sanctions and stopping up in response. And unless we actually target well, it's not going to be very effective. And so this is a good first step. The pressure needs to keep being applied lest we go to war.",
