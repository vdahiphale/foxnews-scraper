Good, everybody. I'm Martha MacCallum, live in Washington tonight. More on that for you in moments. But first, high drama in the courtroom. All part of this wild week in the trial of Paul Manafort that was capped off with an unexplained and uncharacteristic five-hour delay in the courtroom that is fueling a lot of speculation about the biggest test yet, for Special Counsel Robert Mueller.  Now, the trial of his former campaign chair comes to a screeching halt at one point today, fronting speculation of a possible issue with one of the jurors.  All the way from that possibility to a potential guilty plea from Manafort. So, which is it or is it either of those. Judge T.S. Ellis has scolded the Mueller team repeatedly. And now, they're suggesting that they may be confusing the jury. Peter Doocy, watching all of this dramatic action from the courthouse in Alexandria, Virginia. Good evening, Peter.",

      "sentences": "Good evening, Martha. The last thing Judge T.S. Ellis told the Mueller team for they broke for the week while the Mueller team was trying to figure out exactly how much time they're going to have next week for closing arguments is. That it's no accident most T.V. shows are only 30 minutes. So, they went back and forth eventually. They settle on two hours for closing arguments next week. And then, the judge said, that if the Mueller team thinks they can hold a jurors attention for two-hour straight, they live on a different planet than he does.  This is a judge who continues to try to speed up this trial that he almost didn't allow to advance a few months ago because he told the Mueller team in May, he thought they were just using these fraud charges against Paul Manafort to try to get evidence on President Trump that could result in impeachment. But, this judge, T.S. Ellis, who later ruled that the trial could proceed has been very critical of the government's team throughout. And they are now filing motions complaining that he is prejudicing, or misleading, or confusing the jury with his quips.  So far, they've gotten him to admit he was wrong once in open court. Today, though, he ignored their complaint, the judge does constantly ask them how long individual segments of the trial are going to take him, wants them to go as fast as possible. But, it was the judge today who delayed the start time by five hours.   The jury was reminded very quickly this morning how important it is that they don't talk to anybody including each other about the details on this case. But beyond that, we have no idea why a 9:45 a.m. start time got pushed back to 2:30 p.m.? And we're not going to find out immediately, and it's going to be tough to find out because the transcripts of bench conferences during this delay have now been sealed from public view. Martha.",

We learned that he was using some of the money they'd - he was stealing to finance on a fare in London. All of this didn't help his credibility and to the degree that the jurors begin to think of this as kind of one grift reverse as another grifter, maybe they are more sympathetic to Manafort than the sense at why is this guy being charged for something that could send him to jail for 200 years and the other guy got off.",

Because the biggest thing they are worried about is this -- is this intensity gap that Democrats are going to come to the polls.

It's a completely different thing when it comes time to the general. Then you have to own that. And you know, as Byron said, his approval rating is right around 42 percent. His disapproval rating is just below 53 percent. So, it's a big thing to overcome.   I frankly think he could do a lot more good for his party.

Investigators say Sabo hit the concrete and never regained consciousness and was taken off life support Tuesday afternoon. Jamill Jones accompanied by his attorney turned himself into police on Thursday afternoon. He was arraigned, pleaded not guilty and was released on his own recognizance. There is surveillance video of Jamill Jones standing by his car but he's alone. We don't know if there's video of Jones and Szabo or if the actual punch was on video. But if there is, police have yet to release it. So we don't know if Jones was defending himself or if he was the aggressor. But his family released a statement saying, I'm quoting, \"The Jones family stands by Jamill and his legal right to be presumed innocent in what is ultimately a tragic incident.\" As you can imagine Sandor Szab's mom has a much different take, here again she is on Sheppard Smith reporting.",

In fact, multiple states have passed legislation dealing with them and because the victim is oftentimes drunk that actually has a higher propensity for death. It rather severs a back artery in the brain or if they are knocked out and they hit their skull of the pavement, then that's a huge hemorrhage or a skull fracture. So, in that the state of New York passed in 2015 a Senate bill that accounted for what was then a one-punch killing of a 59-year-old man in the Bronx by a 17-year-old, they were so aghast at the fact that this does happen actually. And so, it empowers prosecutors to prosecute a felony charge for it would be a second degree manslaughter for this kind of case. And so the intent is simply an appreciation and then a disregard of this kind of circumstance, which is basically an unjustifiable substantial and significant outcome. So here it falls squarely within that. And again, it's much more common than we think and that's why the law in New York has accounted for it.",

It's true that the New York legislature has looked at changes in the law like this. One comparable change that was considered in 2016 actually it didn't pass for a change in the legislature. Another tragic aspect to also keep in mind here, is that from a civil liability standpoint, there is no indication that Wake Forest would be on the hook for any kind of liability to the family because this was an attack that happened outside of the scope of his employment.

Furthermore, what I find really interesting is that the president said that he doesn't know why they are kneeling. But on June 8th he gave an interview and he said, since they're kneeling for criminal justice reform, let me know who has been, you know, a recipient of this and I will see if I should pardon them.

They try to bring the whole family over and then they go through the process and they don't always become citizens. And so, the other part of this too, is that Melania's parents are from Slovenia, it's not a terrorist haven as the president has discussed as we've seen in the last couple of years. We've had a number of people from countries that have terrorist ties with chain migration and their families are not vetted.

Good, everybody. I'm Martha MacCallum, live in Washington tonight. More on that for you in moments. But first, high drama in the courtroom. All part of this wild week in the trial of Paul Manafort that was capped off with an unexplained and uncharacteristic five-hour delay in the courtroom that is fueling a lot of speculation about the biggest test yet, for Special Counsel Robert Mueller. Now, the trial of his former campaign chair comes to a screeching halt at one point today, fronting speculation of a possible issue with one of the jurors. All the way from that possibility to a potential guilty plea from Manafort. So, which is it or is it either of those. Judge T.S. Ellis has scolded the Mueller team repeatedly. And now, they're suggesting that they may be confusing the jury. Peter Doocy, watching all of this dramatic action from the courthouse in Alexandria, Virginia. Good evening, Peter."

    {
      "speaker": "PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS",
      "utterance": "Good evening, Martha. The last thing Judge T.S. Ellis told the Mueller team for they broke for the week while the Mueller team was trying to figure out exactly how much time they're going to have next week for closing arguments is. That it's no accident most T.V. shows are only 30 minutes. So, they went back and forth eventually. They settle on two hours for closing arguments next week. And then, the judge said, that if the Mueller team thinks they can hold a jurors attention for two-hour straight, they live on a different planet than he does. This is a judge who continues to try to speed up this trial that he almost didn't allow to advance a few months ago because he told the Mueller team in May, he thought they were just using these fraud charges against Paul Manafort to try to get evidence on President Trump that could result in impeachment. But, this judge, T.S. Ellis, who later ruled that the trial could proceed has been very critical of the government's team throughout. And they are now filing motions complaining that he is prejudicing, or misleading, or confusing the jury with his quips. So far, they've gotten him to admit he was wrong once in open court. Today, though, he ignored their complaint, the judge does constantly ask them how long individual segments of the trial are going to take him, wants them to go as fast as possible. But, it was the judge today who delayed the start time by five hours. The jury was reminded very quickly this morning how important it is that they don't talk to anybody including each other about the details on this case. But beyond that, we have no idea why a 9:45 a.m. start time got pushed back to 2:30 p.m.? And we're not going to find out immediately, and it's going to be tough to find out because the transcripts of bench conferences during this delay have now been sealed from public view. Martha."

Gentlemen, welcome to all of you. Byron, let me start with you. You've been watching this case very closely.

Either hundreds of thousands of dollars by his testament or $3 million by Manafort's testament. We learned that he was using some of the money they'd - he was stealing to finance on a fare in London. All of this didn't help his credibility and to the degree that the jurors begin to think of this as kind of one grift reverse as another grifter, maybe they are more sympathetic to Manafort than the sense at why is this guy being charged for something that could send him to jail for 200 years and the other guy got off."

Because what we keep hearing is this is a separate thing, it happened years, and years ago, they're looking into his financial situation, what might have motivated him to promise -- you know, that he would have access to the president or he could offer that access to other people. Perhaps, they were payoffs involved in all of that. So, Jon, as you look at this, you know, the role of Rick Gates moving forward is there any -- anything that we've learned this week that would indicate that there is anything more to it than financial dealings from a long time ago?"

But, remember, the other part of that is anything else that happens to come up in the course of that investigation and that's what led us to where we are at today. So, you know, as far as Gates, I mean, look, there's no honor among thieves, right? You don't know who to believe, you don't know if you can believe President Trump, you don't know if you can believe Rick Gates, Paul Manafort, Stone. You don't know that you can believe any of them.

You know, in terms of the president and the campaign, we've watched him in the races that we saw this weekend. And we're learning a little bit more about how they're targeting exactly where he goes. Byron, your thoughts on what Brad Parscale, who's the head of the 2020 campaign. Says we're looking at RNC numbers. So, when we go into the states, we're doing it in a very targeted specific way."

    {
      "speaker": "YORK",
      "utterance": "The Trump campaign was much more sophisticated in its use of data than most people thought in 2016. They're going to be at least that good now. And the fact that when he went to Ohio, the president went to Delaware County, and not to some other county in the Ohio 12th district. It wasn't an accident at all. And we know the president's approval ratings, we know they are generally about in the 40s. And he wants to target those people who are well disposed toward him, who voted for him and get them back out. Because the biggest thing they are worried about is this -- is this intensity gap that Democrats are going to come to the polls. The president does tend to turn out to people on both sides when he goes anywhere. They've got to get their side out and getting closer to them is a way to do that."

In terms of their machine and how well it works, how confident do you think they should be based on what you know?"

      "speaker": "BENSON",
      "utterance": "Oh, I know the RNC has put in a lot of time and resources to really step up their data game, it's much more sophisticated than it was a few years ago. So, Byron is right, they are doing the smart thing. They are figuring out where the president will be an asset, he is in many places. He's also not in many places. So, there will be definitely Senate races where the Republican candidates say, \"Please, West Virginia, come on down. North Dakota, come on down.\" There will be other races were the Republican candidates say, \"Thanks, but no thanks, maybe a tweet would be fine but why don't you go elsewhere?\" And this is politics 101."

He says, you know, we were so much bigger and so much better at data. And targeting voters that to think they had any influence is in his mind. You know, and he thinks that Democrats are been a little bit intimidated by their -- by their get out the vote game. What do you say?"

      "speaker": "SUMMERS",
      "utterance": "I think that's an interesting tactic to put out there and try to scare people. But I don't think that's the actually the reality. I mean, as these guys have already pointed out, there's a big difference between having President Trump come out in a primary situation where -- you know, 88-90 percent of his base actually supports him. It's a completely different thing when it comes time to the general. Then you have to own that. And you know, as Byron said, his approval rating is right around 42 percent. His disapproval rating is just below 53 percent. So, it's a big thing to overcome. I frankly think he could do a lot more good for his party. Not that I'm here to give him advice, but -- you know, he often gets in the way of Republican candidates and himself by stepping on opportunities to really amplify some of his own good news. And objectively, he has had some good news. But instead, he tweets about Russia. And so, then that's what people are talking about."

First of all with Iran, with the firing of this missile and the mobilization in exercises that they say they moved up to the summer timeframe because of these sanctions, they usually do it in the fall. What do you -- what do you take away from that?"

They fired a missile two to three weeks after the inauguration, testified ballistic missiles. Trump came right out sanction them and said malign behavior again is going to be worse coming from the United States. We're not going to put up with this and they haven't done anything like that since. They're doing it now because they're pretty much under a booth when it comes to the sanctions were imposing on them. They are significant in terms of taking them out of the dollar financial market implication, it may spread to the international market as well and then shutting down gold precious metals, aluminum, steel, graphite, coal, automobiles, a long list of things. And next coming November is when we go after oil and the energy sector and that is going to be very imposing on the Iranians. Their economy is already in the tank. It is struggling severely and the Rial is their currency, it is almost close to being valueless and black market is the way of doing business in Iran. So the pressure is on them and come November it will be on them like it's never been before."

      "utterance": "Yes. Turkey is facing a political on a financial crisis. The political crisis really goes back to the coup of 2016 when Erdogan nearly was toppled and not a single NATO nation to include the United States provided any moral support. Nobody spoke in his favor because he's moving that regime to an authoritarian regime moving away from democracy. And as a result of that, he came out and he said I want the leader who was the catalyst for this coup who resides in the United States, the guy by the name of Fethullah Gulen to be removed. He lives in Pennsylvania. We said no. He arrested a U.S. citizen who resides in Turkey and that's now the famous Pastor Bronson, tragic that he is in prison. He's in now on the house arrest. And this dispute has really boiled over and that is why the tariffs on aluminum, steel are being issued by the Trump administration at a time when Turkey is in a financial crisis with the Lira their currency being significantly devalued against the dollar and inflation is spiraling up out of control."

There'll be a little bit of a contagion here, not a massive one like what happened in Greece. So it's got implications more pressure beyond Erdogan.

    {
      "speaker": "KEANE",
      "utterance": "Yes, we're frustrated with them over -- this is over Syria. And the reality is the Turks argument is that we are supporting the Syrian Kurds who are the main ground force guided by special operations forces from the United States to defeat ISIS in the caliphate in eastern Turkey. They look at Syrian Kurds as terrorists in their mind. They're tied to -- they are connected to a terrorist organization that is trying to topple the regime and carve out a Kurdis town inside of Turkey and Syria but they're loosely tied to them. The reality is also we resent as you just mentioned a relationship that turkey has with Russia and also with Iran that are actually operating against our interests in Syria. So that frustration is there and there is --it actually goes back to ISIS. ISIS would never have moved from 600 Iraqi fighters to 14,000 in six months and then in 18 months 30,000 if Erdogan didn't have his border open. Even though we were saying shut it down, even though he said I got to shut it down, he let it happen because he strategically made a serious mistake. He thought ISIS would go against the regime and take it down. He didn't understand. ISIS was interested in its own geography which was east in Iraq and the south in Saudi Arabia."

      "utterance": "Hi Martha. This happened in the New York borough of Queens at 1:15 Sunday morning. Sandor Szabo who was visiting from Boca Raton, Florida was looking for an Uber ride after his stepsister's wedding. A person familiar with the investigation told The Associated Press that Szabo may have been drunkenly banging on car windows and when he banged on the window of 35-year-old Jamill Jones, the Wake Forest coach apparently got out of his car followed Szabo to the sidewalk, punched him and drove off. Investigators say Sabo hit the concrete and never regained consciousness and was taken off life support Tuesday afternoon. Jamill Jones accompanied by his attorney turned himself into police on Thursday afternoon. He was arraigned, pleaded not guilty and was released on his own recognizance. There is surveillance video of Jamill Jones standing by his car but he's alone. We don't know if there's video of Jones and Szabo or if the actual punch was on video. But if there is, police have yet to release it. So we don't know if Jones was defending himself or if he was the aggressor. But his family released a statement saying, I'm quoting, \"The Jones family stands by Jamill and his legal right to be presumed innocent in what is ultimately a tragic incident.\" As you can imagine Sandor Szab's mom has a much different take, here again she is on Sheppard Smith reporting."

Good to have you here tonight. Seth, let me start with you. The New York medical examiner ruled this a homicide. Is there an opportunity then for when this is charged to become more than assault?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SETH BERENZWEIG, SPORTS LAW ATTORNEY",
      "utterance": "Well, there's certainly an opportunity for that, but when the coroner or even the police department enter a finding, that's not binding on the district attorney's office, and the coroner's office is in charge of the cause of death but that's not directly connected to the responsibility for that death. I think the bottom line on this case is that, unfortunately, the law indicates there are times where you end up with a very shocking result. Our heart goes out to the mother and we understand her wondering why this would never go beyond a simple misdemeanor assault. But the problem is that New York criminal law has some unique aspects that make it difficult to charge someone for murder or homicide in the absence of an intention to cause either death or serious disfigurement."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Well, Emily, how much comes down to the power behind the punch? As the mother is discussing there and does that go to intent? The other factor here, is there are some suggestion that he was drunk. So, you know, his own ability to respond to that punch or to maybe not be able to stand if indeed that was the case would definitely be determined in an autopsy I would imagine."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "EMILY COMPAGNO, ATTORNEY",
      "utterance": "Right. Well, there's actually -- there's a few salient points here that viewers need to understand. Now first the one punch killing as they're known at, they're really that rare. In fact, multiple states have passed legislation dealing with them and because the victim is oftentimes drunk that actually has a higher propensity for death. It rather severs a back artery in the brain or if they are knocked out and they hit their skull of the pavement, then that's a huge hemorrhage or a skull fracture. So, in that the state of New York passed in 2015 a Senate bill that accounted for what was then a one-punch killing of a 59-year-old man in the Bronx by a 17-year-old, they were so aghast at the fact that this does happen actually. And so, it empowers prosecutors to prosecute a felony charge for it would be a second degree manslaughter for this kind of case. And so the intent is simply an appreciation and then a disregard of this kind of circumstance, which is basically an unjustifiable substantial and significant outcome. So here it falls squarely within that. And again, it's much more common than we think and that's why the law in New York has accounted for it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "All right. So, Seth, in terms of the fact that as we heard the mother say, that he left the scene."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BERENZWEIG",
      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "And did not, they didn't hear from him for several days afterwards, what's the impact of that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BERENZWEIG",
      "utterance": "Well, I think that certainly if it was a vehicular incident, then that would relate to a more traditional definition under the law of hit and run. But in a situation like this I don't think that it really necessarily changes the analysis with respect to whether this is a situation where he'll be held responsible for murder or homicide. It's true that the New York legislature has looked at changes in the law like this. One comparable change that was considered in 2016 actually it didn't pass for a change in the legislature. Another tragic aspect to also keep in mind here, is that from a civil liability standpoint, there is no indication that Wake Forest would be on the hook for any kind of liability to the family because this was an attack that happened outside of the scope of his employment. And even if there was a judgment against this coach, he would probably be able to discharge it in bankruptcy. So tragically other than--"

Eleven players did some sort of demonstration during the national anthem including kneeling, someone went into the tunnel and that kind of thing. President Trump was back at it tweeting this, this morning. \"Be happy, be cool! Exclamation point. \"A football games that fans are paying so much money to watch and enjoy, is no place to protest.\" He says. \"Most of that money goes to the players anyway, find another way to protest. Stand proudly for your national anthem or be suspended without pay.\" Joining me now is Wendy Osefo, political commentator and professor, and Katie Pavlich, news editor at Townhall.com and a Fox News contributor. Great to have both of you with us today. I'm watching some of the games last night. You know, the president thinks this is a winning issue for him. But you know, in reality, the revenue has been rising, ratings are down but revenue is up, so is it really a winning issue for him, Katie?"

      "speaker": "KATIE PAVLICH, EDITOR, TOWNHALL.COM NEWS",

And as the president of the United States, you know, there are very few things with the nation that keep the entire country together. The national anthem thus far has been one of those things. So it does help him politically. When it comes to the NFL, revenue may be up but ratings are down. And I think it's to these player's detriment to be continuing to behave this way when the league is trying to put in rules where they can go in the locker room to avoid this kind of disrespectful behavior on the field. You know, ESPN did a survey last year asking people why they tuned out of games and the number one reason was because of these protests. So, they can argue all they want, that they have the right to do it in the workplace, fine, but the viewers and fans also have a right to tune out."

      "speaker": "WENDY OSEFO, DEMOCRAT STRATEGIST",
      "utterance": "Yes. I think that that's completely flawed. Because what we do know is that we have had countless players who have written about this. We have Eric Reed from the 49ers who wrote a New York Times op-ed, we have Malcolm Jenkins from the Eagles who also wrote a Washington Post op-ed. And these are just op-eds but we have people who have had interviews and have said the reason why they are protesting because of racial injustice. Furthermore, what I find really interesting is that the president said that he doesn't know why they are kneeling. But on June 8th he gave an interview and he said, since they're kneeling for criminal justice reform, let me know who has been, you know, a recipient of this and I will see if I should pardon them. So, again, I think this is just red meat for his base. We all know why these people are kneeling, they said it countless times. But, again, the president just using this."

And I feel like if they were more specific, and you know, there was a meeting yesterday in Bedminster that the president held about prison reform. I mean, obviously that's an issue that he cares about. It feels like they ought to be able to come together.

And also, I do want to point out that there are a number of NFL players who are also saying we don't want to protest the national anthem. Dak Prescott from the Cowboys saying I would never protest in that way. I wish we're standing for the national anthem.

It's a, you know, obviously a personal moment for them of great meaning, but when the lawyer was questioned do they come under chain migration, and he said essentially yes, which is something the president is clearly against, Katie.

However, it's not necessarily apples and oranges or apples versus when it comes to the way that they did this. Melania became a citizen in 2006. Chain migration typically as an entire family is coming after one person comes within a year. They try to bring the whole family over and then they go through the process and they don't always become citizens. And so, the other part of this too, is that Melania's parents are from Slovenia, it's not a terrorist haven as the president has discussed as we've seen in the last couple of years. We've had a number of people from countries that have terrorist ties with chain migration and their families are not vetted. And so there's been a 12-year gap between when Melania became a citizen when her parents decided to go through the process. She did sponsor them. But let's look at the details of why we're--"

Furthermore, if we take away chain migration that really incentivizes people to come here illegally. As someone who is from one of those s-hole countries, Nigeria, there's a lot of Nigerians who come to this country and they bring their family members over.

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "A touching moment. Charles Jr. and Larry McDaniel were given the dog tag that belonged to their father who vanished during the Korean War. Army Master Sergeant Charles McDaniel was an army medic with a wife and two young boys at home when he was lost in action. His dog tag was found among the 55 boxes that were handed over by North Korea late last month. Here now we are honored to have his sons, Charles Jr. and Larry McDaniel. Gentlemen, thank you so much for being here. Charles, let me start with you, what was it like when you got that phone call?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCDANIEL, JR.",
      "utterance": "I was sitting and reading, my wife actually picked up the phone and she said it's for you. And as an army survivor, we always look at our phone there and the call, the caseworker said I have amazing news for you. He asked me if I had seen the 55 boxes and I had. There are around 7,700 MIAs still. And so you think 55 boxes there are pretty remote possibility of being your father but you know, you think possibly it could be so. And he said yes, I've seen that and he said well, we found one dog tag. And he said it's your father's. It's amazing, I do this, I've done this about 10 times now with people and I can't get keep it like, and that's what happened. I had to stop and pause and reflect a little bit. I met Paul at the conference we just had face to face and thanked him several times profusely. But what they do is amazing and we don't ever know that's going on until it happens."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "LARRY MCDANIEL, JR., SON OF MISSING KOREAN WAR VETERAN",
      "utterance": "Well, I was surprised like everyone else. Because in all reality, we had assumed that he was deceased for all of these years. So that part wasn't a surprise. I honestly didn't ever expect to have anything relating directly to him."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "What happens next, Charles? You know, I mean, there are, as you say 55 boxes of remains and we expect that more will come. Do you think that you will get a call that says that they have found his remains?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCDANIEL, JR.",
      "utterance": "Well, the dog tag is the only identifiable thing -- I just do a little sigh. It was amazing, I just went to Larry and I just went to a conference, it was an updating that they do every year for Korean War MIA's, there were 700 people there related in some way for the most part. And I felt really a little guilty because we were the only ones that had some certitude but just because there's a dog tag there doesn't mean that his remains are there. So there's still an untold story. And there's several issues about this, the way the army issues this, you know, if you're a military person you'll know, there's a long chain with a dog tag and there's a short chain with a dog tag. This is the short chain. What this often is, if there's a deceased comrade, one of their buddies takes off the short chain. So, I don't know if this is the one that one of his friends took off and then later he was killed and this became removed from the body--"
