More than $3 million taxpayer dollars have been spent, more than a hundred people from the campaign, government and private industry have been interviewed, 15 search warrant issued. Millions of documents turned over, and no one has been charged of any crime involving collusion, treason or espionage. In fact, the New York Times reporting this week, \"A year and a half later, no public evidence has surfaced connecting Mr. Trump's advisers to the hacking or linking Mr. Trump himself to the Russian government's disruptive efforts.\"  In that New York Times piece, some stunning information came out. You ready? A hundred days before the election, the Obama administration placed at least one spy in the Trump campaign. The Obama administration opened up an investigation into the Trump campaign without any criminal evidence. The Obama used secret subpoenas to obtain phone records and other documents from the Trump campaign and the Obama administration used an unverified dossier of Russian smears paid for by Hillary to eavesdrop on the Trump campaign.  The bottom line remains, team Obama spied on the Trump campaign using wiretaps and moles with no clear justification. And now, the same Federal agencies who launched the investigation are stonewalling the American people. House Intelligence Chairman, Devin Nunes had this to say.",

You had the New York Times report come out this week, crossfire hurricane was the code name they used of this counter-intelligence investigation, and there was a meeting that Papadopoulos had with someone over in Great Britain.  It turns out Papadopoulos who was like 28 at the time and Carter Page, we all know Carter Page and who he is, they are invited over to Great Britain to go to all of these conferences, they get fed full of rumors about, \"Oh, the Russians may have some of Hillary's e-mails,\" and they pass it along over drinks to an Ambassador.

Millions of documents turned over, and no one has been charged of any crime involving collusion, treason or espionage. In fact, the New York Times reporting this week, \"A year and a half later, no public evidence has surfaced connecting Mr. Trump's advisers to the hacking or linking Mr. Trump himself to the Russian government's disruptive efforts.\" In that New York Times piece, some stunning information came out. You ready? A hundred days before the election, the Obama administration placed at least one spy in the Trump campaign. The Obama administration opened up an investigation into the Trump campaign without any criminal evidence. The Obama used secret subpoenas to obtain phone records and other documents from the Trump campaign and the Obama administration used an unverified dossier of Russian smears paid for by Hillary to eavesdrop on the Trump campaign. The bottom line remains, team Obama spied on the Trump campaign using wiretaps and moles with no clear justification.

Imagine if the Bush administration had used a counter- intelligence operation against the Obama campaign over nothing, because right now, there has been no criminal evidence to show there was any wrongdoing to justify the wiretapping and the secret subpoenas and even the opening up of the investigation. You had the New York Times report come out this week, crossfire hurricane was the code name they used of this counter-intelligence investigation, and there was a meeting that Papadopoulos had with someone over in Great Britain. It turns out Papadopoulos who was like 28 at the time and Carter Page, we all know Carter Page and who he is, they are invited over to Great Britain to go to all of these conferences, they get fed full of rumors about, \"Oh, the Russians may have some of Hillary's e-mails,\" and they pass it along over drinks to an Ambassador. And then, the FBI sends Peter Strzok over to London and they cook up the investigation based on gossip."

This is where the New York Times and The Washington Post and others have gotten their information. So, based on that information that they themselves leaked, based on this information, we know that there was an informant. Now, the thing is Jesse, these types of informants don't just work on one case. They must be working on numerous cases for the CIA, as well as the FBI, and they usually go by a code name, those code names are basically the only thing that anybody at the DOJ or the FBI would ever see.

I said this deal has a 5% chance of going through. It was going incredibly thanks to Mike Pompeo with the three hostages returned without a palette of cash with the dismantling of certain sites. But maybe, they are reverting to type -- allegedly Dennis Rodman gave Little Kim a copy of \"The Art of the Deal.\" But I am not sure he has read it all because in Chapter 2, the President wrote very clearly, \"Never be so invested in a deal that you are not ready to walk away from it at any point.\" And guess what, this is the wrong President to test and he will walk away from the deal if they start playing games again."

We still have a lot more room to go in terms of a 10, we've got the Naval blockade over the fuel vessels. They have cut off all access to capital through the banking institutions.

So, I think, you know, against his acting to type, he will go to Singapore on the 12th and he will want to be seen with our President. But whether it leads to the denuclearization of the peninsula, no more nuclear testing, no more ballistic missile launches, it's a dictatorship. Jesse, they lie. That's what they do, whether it's Khrushchev in '62 with Cuban missile crisis, whether it is Hitler in 1938 in Munich saying, \"Oh, I am not going to invade anybody.\" Dictatorships lie."

If they would have just let it go, at this point, I mean, there is a little bit of sweet revenge in it for me and certainly, probably the family in the sense that, if they wouldn't have done this, this stuff would be going on."

You have come up with nothing other than their own nefarious actions and their own collusions. They have come up with nothing. So, at this point, you've got to come to something. Like just come to something because if they try to drag it out for a year, they try to drag it so that the Democrats have their talking points. I watch it right now. You see the Democratic senators, this is McCarthyism. I am like, \"What?\" You have a guy that's been screaming, \"Russia, Russia, Russia.\" With no evidence of obvious collusion.

He's been out there, obviously, 99% of intelligent people believe he's the person leaking this. When I did my testimony to his committee, it was supposed to be behind closed doors. It was supposed to be secret. We get done at 7:00 at night, I go and starting at 12:00 in my Twitter feed, I am reading about verbatim what's going on in the room. So, as people are taking bathroom breaks, this is being leaked from the House Intelligence Committee. Think about that. But that's what's going on in our government. These guys are -- I can see the response that he's had with -- he's scared because he had the media in their back pockets as we see from all of this. These guys are working together with the radical left and they are getting whatever they want done. The problem is, they used to have some credibility, so people still believe that, so they are able to sell that narrative.

On the other hand, you have had people reporting, a lot of this on our network, it turns out to be true now that the Department of Justice and the FBI under President Obama rigged the investigation for Hillary and then really turned the screws to Trump. And now it looks like in a corrupt and illegal way, and the facts are out now and the facts belong on this side. TRUMP, JR. A hundred percent. And by the way, this has been a much more recent narrative frankly than the other. I mean, they have been looking at the other one for over two years.

Her campaign manager brother who allegedly took $170,000.00 from the Russians in order to end the Russian sanctions under the Obama administration, that's what should have been investigated.
