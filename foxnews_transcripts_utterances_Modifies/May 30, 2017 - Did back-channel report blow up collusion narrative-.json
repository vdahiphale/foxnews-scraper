I am describing the inner street city of Chicago, but the state house in Austin. All hell broke down as legislatures threatened each other and almost came to blows. A Republican (inaudible) threatened to shoot a Democrat but only in self-defense, because he threatened his life. This ridiculous and almost dangerous scenario gives us a little image of how polarizing the debates on sanctuary cities has gotten. That was in responsibility to Texas's new law that demands that local police chiefs and sheriffs under the threat of jail or removal from office comply with federal request to hold criminal suspects for possible deportation. It's like a 2010 Arizona show me your papers measure what allowed police to ask about a person's immigration status during traffic stops. That was eventually struck down in court. I don't believe in cherry-picking which laws to follow and which ones to disregard based on politics or anything else. The moment you enter our country without following our legal immigration process, you are subjected to deportation. Our immigration system is slow and broken, but two wrongs don't make a right. You can't get to break our laws without consequence. But this Texas law raises concerns about the 4th amendment protection. If skin color is the only test to ask for someone's immigration papers, we are not doing what our forefathers intended and the constitution is not worth the paper it is written on. We are better than our lawmakers asking like criminals themselves. Surely we can come up with a legal way to fix this immigration problem, Counselor, what is your take and prediction around the state of SB4?",

I am describing the inner street city of Chicago, but the state house in Austin. All hell broke down as legislatures threatened each other and almost came to blows. A Republican (inaudible) threatened to shoot a Democrat but only in self-defense, because he threatened his life. This ridiculous and almost dangerous scenario gives us a little image of how polarizing the debates on sanctuary cities has gotten. That was in responsibility to Texas's new law that demands that local police chiefs and sheriffs under the threat of jail or removal from office comply with federal request to hold criminal suspects for possible deportation. It's like a 2010 Arizona show me your papers measure what allowed police to ask about a person's immigration status during traffic stops. That was eventually struck down in court. I don't believe in cherry-picking which laws to follow and which ones to disregard based on politics or anything else. The moment you enter our country without following our legal immigration process, you are subjected to deportation. Our immigration system is slow and broken, but two wrongs don't make a right. You can't get to break our laws without consequence. But this Texas law raises concerns about the 4th amendment protection. If skin color is the only test to ask for someone's immigration papers, we are not doing what our forefathers intended and the constitution is not worth the paper it is written on. We are better than our lawmakers asking like criminals themselves. Surely we can come up with a legal way to fix this immigration problem, Counselor, what is your take and prediction around the state of SB4?"

I think that, when I see something that happened like in this in Texas, a lot of protestors having a sign and saying, \"I'm illegal, and I'm staying here.

Because there's some of these stories that you'll say, OK, you know, someone who's 26 and came here when he was 12 years old. You're 12 years old, and your family's going to the United States, I can say, \"No, Mom, I'm not supposed to\"? You're going to go with your mom, because you're 12 years old.

It's a critical advance for the technology, as North Korea races to develop a long-range missile that could potentially hit the U.S. mainland. Just this morning, North Korea issued a defiant new language, promising to, quote, \"deliver a\" -- quote -- \"bigger gift package for the U.S.\" following yet another successful shorter-range missile test on Sunday. Nile, I want to start with you. The USS Nimitz is on its way. Ronald Reagan is there. Carl Vinson is there. We have three carrier strike groups in the Korean area -- peninsula area.

And China, of course, has been very slow to move, and they have been very slow to move for many, many years, even decades on the North Korean front. We do need to see more action being taken by Beijing. If they don't, then certainly, the United States needs to ramp up these existing sanctions against North Korea and also the military presence in the region. Without a doubt, I think the intercontinental ballistic missile threat posed by North Korea looms larger and larger by the day.

It's not like a situation where they think the only problem in the equation is North Korea, which is a problem they're actually quite used to dealing with. A rabid dictator on their border. What they don't want to have happen is regime change in North Korea, where you have a a democratic government set up, which is very destabilizing for China.

All right. Yes, I have just one concern with this guy, just that he's putting his own convenience over the First Amendment. So ideologically, I have a problem with it. And also logistically, if you're worried about free speech people getting too mad, what you're going to do is take away their speech and that's going to make it better? I don't see any justification for this."

The KKK, as despicable as they are and were, were allowed to march in Skokie, Illinois, a predominantly Jewish neighborhood. Look, and Kat, you're right. Free speech is -- speech is protected, even if it's ugly and gross and hateful. And in this case, it's anti -- it's still talking about free speech. And that's what he's shutting down."

And once you're on the slippery path of suppressing free speech, that's a path to totalitarianism. And America is all about freedom of speech. And I think that as long as you have freedom of speech in America, this is still a free country. And we have to defend it."

A job that's now where you're going to have to deal with things like this."

I would say that, you know, there are no two greater nations on earth than the United States and Great Britain; and the special relationship between our two great countries is the most powerful force for freedom today. And so I've been very privileged to work with political leaders on both sides of the Atlantic. And it is, of course, a tremendous privilege to be living in the United States now, which is a true force for liberty and freedom on the world stage. Long may that continue."

And I think that it's going to strengthen the special relationship between the United States and the U.K. And Brexit is also going to tremendously impact the whole of Europe, actually.
