It doesn't appear that way with what Senator Joe Manchin said today as these two bills are up on Capitol Hill. Meantime, asked about those bills in an ABC poll, here's how people responded. If they become law, would it help people like you, 25 percent, hurt people like you, 32 percent. That's just over the past couple of days. We'll start there with our panel. Let's bring them in, \"Washington Post\" columnist Marc Thiessen, Leslie Marshall, Democratic strategist, and Kimberley Strassel, a member of the editorial board at \"The Wall Street Journal.\" Kimberley, let me start with you. It's not surprising that Joe Manchin comes out and says I want to see the specifics. I want to see what the impact is going to be. And I'm not just going to pass something without knowing what's in it. He has kind of been saying that all along. But where does this go? KIMBERLEY STRASSEL, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\": He did actually make some news today, Bret, because if you drill down into what he said, a lot of attention to these buzz words about shell games and gimmicks. But he got more specific in that. He said look, if you have all these programs and you only have them run a couple of years and you claim that they are going to end when they don't, the bill is actually like twice the amount of $1.75. And I said $1.75. Well, if you extrapolate that, it means stuff is going to have to come out of this bill, like big programs. He also expressed some concern about the climate provisions. He is not close to a yes, and major modifications are going to have to happen from what they have talked about in the House. Yet, still, the question is how much will progressives swallow of that, and when will they say no themselves?",

These should not have been married, these two pieces of legislation. And I feeling as a moderate centrist that the progressive caucus is holding us hostage. And I think that all Democrats, whether it's a Manchin, a Sinema, or a Sanders have to decide do they want to have a lost gubernatorial election tomorrow in Virginia? Do they want to lose more seats in the House and Senate and lose majority in both the House and Senate and perhaps in the White House in 2024? We have to work together. And big programs have already gone to the wayside, one of which Senator Sanders will not let go of, because you have 15 Democrats that are very vulnerable in their districts that are promised lower drug prices. That's something Manchin doesn't like, and Sanders seems to require, and he definitely heads the progressive caucus.",

MARC THIESSEN, COLUMNIST, \"WASHINGTON POST\": Going down like a rock. He's right that approval rating go up and down. But it's very hard to recover when only 37 percent of the American people say that you are competent. When people make a decision that you are incompetent, it is very hard to recover from that. And that is the most devastating number in that poll, 50 percent of the American people think he is incompetent. And just the Joe Manchin press conference today is evidence of that incompetence. And Joe Manchin isn't just another stakeholder in this debate. He's got a veto. Let's be straight about it. If he doesn't agree to it, it's not going to get passed. So why would you release a framework that you haven't cleared with Joe Manchin yet, and have this whole debacle unfold over the last week? You need to sit down with Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, figure out what they're willing to accept, what they are willing to not accept, craft that as a framework, and say to the other Democrats this is it. If you want the Build Back Better, this is what it is, and you're going to have to live with it, and get their votes locked in before you start releasing it.",
