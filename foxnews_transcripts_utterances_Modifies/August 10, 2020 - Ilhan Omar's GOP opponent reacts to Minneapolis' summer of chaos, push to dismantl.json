And also tonight, Lori Lightfoot, she just watches her city burn and somehow finds a way to blame President Trump. The head of the Chicago Police Union sounds off. Plus, as college football players and coaches now, including Nick Saban, beg for a fall season, administrators stand in their way. Burgess Owens tells us why the young men must play.  And Raymond Arroyo explains what Biden did this weekend on two wheels, it was so impressive, and new details of the unconvention, so \"Seen & Unseen\" has answers.  But first, \"Democrats Cities Implode,\" that's the focus of tonight's Angle. 10 weeks after the death of George Floyd during an attempted arrest a few miles from here, we came here to assess the situation on the ground. Because the riots that left behind block after block of destruction left people in their wake.  And tonight, we're going to bring you the never told stories of those business owners who were abandoned by the politicians and the police. Now, much of what you're going to see and hear tonight is extremely disturbing and it begs for political change.",

And then, when they needed safety and leadership most the political leaders were nowhere to be found. Now, when the governor finally mobilized and deployed the National Guard and accepted Federal help, it was too late for many of the people in the neighborhood. Criminals and rioters, they were able to flatten livelihoods and terrorize those who deserved safety and peace of mind.   Now, here in Minneapolis, Left has used the tragic death of Mr. Floyd to excuse the criminal devastation. And over the past several weeks in Portland, officials there, they blame the violence on President Trump, and it was just as pathetic.",

Now it was also brazen that they drove up to luxury stores. Then they loaded up on merchandise, then they just sped away in the cars that they had left idling in the streets. But the police were too overwhelmed to stop all of them. Now, let's remember this is happening not because of George Floyd and it's not happening because of police brutality or some or some altercation earlier in the afternoon. This is happening because of 50 years of terrible leadership in these cities, a breakdown in the family, lack of father figure, we all know that.   And it's culminating in a summer of annihilation, where you can assault police officers and get away with it. You can destroy property, you can get away with it. You can steal from stores in broad daylight and get away with it. You can brutally beat innocent bystanders, and you'll get away with it. And of course, you can march by the thousands with zero social distancing during a pandemic, and get away with it. Now, for months, officials in the media, they've alternatively celebrated or tolerated all of this, while hassling the rest of us for wanting our kids to go to school or to want to have college football or to have an outdoor picnic, which is what, by the way, Mayor Lori Lightfoot was focused on just hours before the chaos in downtown. \"It's called a pandemic people,\" she tweeted. \"Well this reckless behavior online Montrose Beach is what will cause us to shut down the parks and the lakefront.\"",

That's going to be great for the kids. It's another Chicago disaster.  But the message is clear. No matter how rich and successful a city is, or a neighborhood in a city is, it can't be saved from poor Democrat leadership. They'll try to defund the police and then embolden criminals. They'll cry racism to avoid any accountability for their own failures. And then when it comes time to clean up the mess that everything's been left behind, well, they're nowhere to be found.  After the dust settles, they'll still expect minorities, those hurt most by their god awful policies, to vote for them without question. Otherwise, remember, as Joe Biden said to that radio host, \"you ain't Black --\" The inescapable conclusion from all that has been tolerated in liberal cities these past 10 weeks. If the Democrats win, the looters will know that they have free rein to attack not just every city in town in the country, but the suburbs as well. And that's exactly what they'll do, and that's \"The Angle.\"  Now, tonight, we're coming to you live from an area of Minneapolis represented by Congresswoman Ilhan Omar, the radical \"Squad\" member who supports abolishing the Minneapolis police department and other insane policies that will only hurt her constituents. That's why my next guest is trying to unseat Congresswoman Omar. Joining me now is Lacy Johnson who's running against her in Minnesota's Fifth Congressional District. Lacy, I was out and about in your district today and I can tell you I talked to a lot of folks none of them have seen. Congresswoman Ilan Omar not along Lake Street, not along all those buildings that have been wrecked and ruined. Is the city ready to make a change?",

And, unfortunately, there's a lot of Black communities affected by these communities of color and poor communities are affected by this. And so it does not surprise me at all, that Ms. Omar is not anywhere to be seen during this, because we know that her main goals and objectives are personal things and her own ambition. And it's not about solving the problems. It is not about the caring for the people of this community. It's not about the lives of the people of this community.

I hear it all now. There is no police.   There's like six police in 14 square miles in this particular third precinct where it was. Obviously, it's boarded up and no one there now. But these people are like, this isn't political. This is common sense. No one's going to come back here unless we have safety, period. No one.

But that's what happen when you don't live in the community.  I live in this community, and everyone who lives here was witness and affected by the violence and things like that. We've had a great increase of robberies, of home invasions, murders, and everything into this community. So we know that any politician that's talking about defunding the police or demilitarizing the police or disarming the police, they're just totally out of touch and they don't have a clue of what's going on in this community and they need to be replaced. So Omar fits into that category, and the people of this community deserve better.

If you take the virus, we've had the first outbreak and then the lull and then the second. Usually, historically, it starts to taper off and it may well do as that in the United States, and it already is declining as it has in Europe and Sweden and France. And then the lockdowns been redefined as whether to go back to school or not, that's the fundamental existential issue, and the psychic damage on millions of children. People are realizing they got to go back to school and Trump is advocating that in wise, sober and judicious way of doing it, but that's an issue were Biden is on the wrong side.  The economy is volatile. It's starting to pick up. Joe Biden has - he's not just cognitively impaired, it seems like Laura, but there's a theme now to it. In a very volatile situation with race relations, he keeps coming out with these statements that are bizarre, surrealistic. About Asians all looking alike or you ain't Black or insulting really a Black journalist - a professional and suggesting that he might be a junkie or cocaine addict. And that almost resonates earlier things he said in the past about, put you all in chains or Barack Obama. And when you put that volatile situation in with the VP selection, it's not it's not a static situation. I think Trump is doing a lot better. I'm not a big fan of executive orders. But whether we like it or not pin and phone is the way that a lot of people act and he's really taken the lead with bypassing Schumer and Pelosi.

The narrative that triggered that whole rioting and looting downtown yesterday was a person that was shot by the police. And the narrative got out in the neighborhood pretty quickly that the offender did not have a gun, which was 100 percent lie. So much so that the victim, he was having quotation marks. His grandmother was on the scene, basically, telling everybody to knock it off. She told him to knock - be change his life the night before this happened and he wouldn't listen. He just wouldn't listen. This is an notorious criminal. I mean, at 20 years old. So, again, it's an excuse for bad behavior because they know the politicians and people that run this city and county will not do a damn thing about it every single time.

The Chicago Tribune did a really good article today on Kim Foxx, the state's attorney and how she has prosecuted much less felonies than her predecessor and the same first three years.

Now it was also brazen that they drove up to luxury stores. Then they loaded up on merchandise, then they just sped away in the cars that they had left idling in the streets. But the police were too overwhelmed to stop all of them. Now, let's remember this is happening not because of George Floyd and it's not happening because of police brutality or some or some altercation earlier in the afternoon. This is happening because of 50 years of terrible leadership in these cities, a breakdown in the family, lack of father figure, we all know that. And it's culminating in a summer of annihilation, where you can assault police officers and get away with it. You can destroy property, you can get away with it. You can steal from stores in broad daylight and get away with it. You can brutally beat innocent bystanders, and you'll get away with it. And of course, you can march by the thousands with zero social distancing during a pandemic, and get away with it. Now, for months, officials in the media, they've alternatively celebrated or tolerated all of this, while hassling the rest of us for wanting our kids to go to school or to want to have college football or to have an outdoor picnic, which is what, by the way, Mayor Lori Lightfoot was focused on just hours before the chaos in downtown. \"It's called a pandemic people,\" she tweeted. \"Well this reckless behavior online Montrose Beach is what will cause us to shut down the parks and the lakefront.\""

Oh, by the way, and caving to the teachers' unions, did you check that all out over the weekend? They're shutting down schools there for in-person learning. It's all going to be online there. That's going to be great for the kids. It's another Chicago disaster. But the message is clear. No matter how rich and successful a city is, or a neighborhood in a city is, it can't be saved from poor Democrat leadership. They'll try to defund the police and then embolden criminals. They'll cry racism to avoid any accountability for their own failures. And then when it comes time to clean up the mess that everything's been left behind, well, they're nowhere to be found. After the dust settles, they'll still expect minorities, those hurt most by their god awful policies, to vote for them without question. Otherwise, remember, as Joe Biden said to that radio host, \"you ain't Black --\" The inescapable conclusion from all that has been tolerated in liberal cities these past 10 weeks. If the Democrats win, the looters will know that they have free rein to attack not just every city in town in the country, but the suburbs as well. And that's exactly what they'll do, and that's \"The Angle.\" Now, tonight, we're coming to you live from an area of Minneapolis represented by Congresswoman Ilhan Omar, the radical \"Squad\" member who supports abolishing the Minneapolis police department and other insane policies that will only hurt her constituents. That's why my next guest is trying to unseat Congresswoman Omar. Joining me now is Lacy Johnson who's running against her in Minnesota's Fifth Congressional District. Lacy, I was out and about in your district today and I can tell you I talked to a lot of folks none of them have seen.

And, unfortunately, there's a lot of Black communities affected by these communities of color and poor communities are affected by this. And so it does not surprise me at all, that Ms. Omar is not anywhere to be seen during this, because we know that her main goals and objectives are personal things and her own ambition. And it's not about solving the problems. It is not about the caring for the people of this community. It's not about the lives of the people of this community. What she's looking for are votes from the people of the community like most Democrats do, and it's all about voting for them, and not about the lives of the people in these communities."

These are good people. These are people who work 13, 14 hour days to launch their businesses in neighborhoods that they love, only to have them destroyed in a matter of hours and no police presence. I hear it all now. There is no police. There's like six police in 14 square miles in this particular third precinct where it was. Obviously, it's boarded up and no one there now. But these people are like, this isn't political. This is common sense. No one's going to come back here unless we have safety, period. No one.

But even more important than that, I mean, the whole idea is just insane. And it points to the fact that she's just totally out of touch, don't understand the community. But that's what happen when you don't live in the community. I live in this community, and everyone who lives here was witness and affected by the violence and things like that. We've had a great increase of robberies, of home invasions, murders, and everything into this community. So we know that any politician that's talking about defunding the police or demilitarizing the police or disarming the police, they're just totally out of touch and they don't have a clue of what's going on in this community and they need to be replaced. So Omar fits into that category, and the people of this community deserve better. In fact, one of the reasons I am in politics is because we deserve better leadership than what they're currently doing.

And while the polls show Joe Biden ahead of the President, that lead is shrinking. Now one reason for that is, obvious, the Democrats decision to align themselves with the anti-cop, anti-American radicals, ripping apart our cities. And add to that, the party's embrace of these COVID lockdowns in the opposition to everything that we enjoy. Well, usually enjoy, kids, schools - but schools, sports, football, everything. And it's clear why President Trump is gaining support now, with fewer than 90 days left until the election. Joining me now is Victor Davis Hanson, Hoover Institution Senior Fellow. Victor, it was a shock for me and my crew today to see this. You see it on television. But until you walk the streets and talk to the folks here who tried to build these communities, you don't really get it. And the cameras pulled back a long time ago. There's a lot of anger on the ground here. And I can tell you the anger wasn't directed at the police for brutality.

And then the lockdowns been redefined as whether to go back to school or not, that's the fundamental existential issue, and the psychic damage on millions of children. People are realizing they got to go back to school and Trump is advocating that in wise, sober and judicious way of doing it, but that's an issue were Biden is on the wrong side. The economy is volatile. It's starting to pick up. Joe Biden has - he's not just cognitively impaired, it seems like Laura, but there's a theme now to it. In a very volatile situation with race relations, he keeps coming out with these statements that are bizarre, surrealistic. About Asians all looking alike or you ain't Black or insulting really a Black journalist - a professional and suggesting that he might be a junkie or cocaine addict. And that almost resonates earlier things he said in the past about, put you all in chains or Barack Obama. And when you put that volatile situation in with the VP selection, it's not it's not a static situation. I think Trump is doing a lot better. I'm not a big fan of executive orders. But whether we like it or not pin and phone is the way that a lot of people act and he's really taken the lead with bypassing Schumer and Pelosi. He's got better - I think, better and sober - more sober advice on the health issues with my colleague, Scott Atlas. I think he's much more attuned to the social and economic repercussions of this decision. So--"

Well, these are suspected violent felons allowed to go free. Now, local Fox affiliate reporting about long those bailed out from this Minnesota Freedom Fund, sets back to shot at police, a woman accused of killing a friend. And Christopher Boswell, twice convicted rapists, currently charged with kidnapping, assault, sexual assault, two separate cases. MFF paid $350,000 in cash for his release.

It transcends race. It's basically middle class and poor people who depend on the elements of government and people who are immune from the consequences of their own cheap ideology, starting pontificating, and yet, they're in a different world. They're in a cocoon and they start lecturing. And whether it's de Blasio in politics or the Cuomo brothers, they keep giving these sermons, but they don't live the real life that's the consequences of their ideology and rhetoric. And I think people are starting to get really angry, and it's not a racial issue anymore. I think it's across the divide. And that's I think class is becoming much more important than race."

The narrative that triggered that whole rioting and looting downtown yesterday was a person that was shot by the police. And the narrative got out in the neighborhood pretty quickly that the offender did not have a gun, which was 100 percent lie. So much so that the victim, he was having quotation marks. His grandmother was on the scene, basically, telling everybody to knock it off. She told him to knock - be change his life the night before this happened and he wouldn't listen. He just wouldn't listen. This is an notorious criminal. I mean, at 20 years old. So, again, it's an excuse for bad behavior because they know the politicians and people that run this city and county will not do a damn thing about it every single time. Just a couple of quick stats. The Chicago Tribune did a really good article today on Kim Foxx, the state's attorney and how she has prosecuted much less felonies than her predecessor and the same first three years. Charges for aggravated battery to a police officer has gone down in half since Kim Foxx has taken office in the first three years.

What the left loves, the radical left loves, is chaos. Right now, they are doing everything they can, whether it be church or schools, and right now, football. These young men want to go out and play. If they do it at an NFL level to get safely out there on the field and do their thing. And this is, by the way, the group that's least at risk. They can get this thing done. Those who don't want to go out, they can opt out and give them a choice of not losing eligibility. So there are things they can do to get this done with, but the left is so concerned about keeping chaos in the picture, and they don't mind really who suffers in the process.

And the city came in and put this fence, as you see in here. And they sent us a bill for $3,700. And we asked them, we could not be able, they said they don't have any resource. So the city that you're paying taxes, the city that you're supporting, the big community you're building, sends you a bill? You're getting punished? Enough is enough, guys. Let's rebuild this community and stand by us. We left our country for a future, to see the American dream. And look how it happened. You work hard, you pay your taxes, we have not done anything wrong. And the peaceful protests hijacked, then the government say, oh, we're going to back up and build your neighborhood. Where? Where is the safety? Where's the rebuilding? It's 10 weeks, no response, no response."

Larry McKenzie, longtime high school basketball coach, youth advocate, in north Minneapolis. So many people love you, Larry. I wish you could be in studio with me, but we can't because of COVID. What's it going to take to truly get Minneapolis back on its feet? These are great people. I got a chance to meet so many wonderful people today. These are good neighbors, these are good people, but they're mad. And they're heartbroken, but they're mad, Larry."

      "utterance": "I asked a number of the folks I interviewed, some on camera, some off camera, where are the politicians? They happen to be mostly Democrats. But this wasn't political. This was common sense. They said no one is here. We never hear from them. We call them, they offer some sympathy, Larry. But they say we have got to have a change. And then if the new people come in and they are no good, we'll kick them out too. That was basically the sentiment. They want political change."
