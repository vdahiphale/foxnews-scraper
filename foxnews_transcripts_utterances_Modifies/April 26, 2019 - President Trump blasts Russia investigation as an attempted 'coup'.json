The Trump agenda is delivering success after success on the economy, with the first quarter GDP number shattering expectations. Full coverage of that just ahead.  But, first, the radical Democrats are hitting new levels of extremism, and as they compete to out-liberal each other on everything from the Green New Deal to open borders and, yes, even letting murderers vote from prison, President Trump is giving his early assessment of the candidates so far.  Let's take a look.",

With names that included, according to our own Sara Carter, the wife of the chief of staff to Vice President Pence who previously worked with Strzok on the Clinton e-mail case. Joining me now with reaction to all of this, the author of \"The Russia Hoax\", Fox News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett, along with Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton, and Congressman Mike Turner.  Gentlemen, thank you for joining me this evening.  You know, this is extraordinary, and, Greg, I'll start with you because while all of what we have experienced has been surprising to all of us. None of us are naive. All of us have experience. And yet, all of us remember Nixon. We all know that the government can be secretive. This has been extraordinary at any level.

We already know as Bill Barr pointed out to great controversy that the Trump campaign was being spied on. There was electronic surveillance. There was a confidential informant and now, apparently, there may have been a mole. So, look, the president was correct when he played the comment a moment ago. This was an attempted coup, a silent, nonviolent coup based on phony information to drive him from office. And, you know, Clinton was the financier, Brennan was the instigator, Clapper was the leaker, and then you had Christopher Steele and Glenn Simpson, the facilitators who created it all with a fabricated document, and Comey and McCabe and Strzok and Page were driving the engine of this attempted coup.",

The Trafficking Victims Act, there is a lot of things that Congress should do to slow this down. The Democratic leadership hasn't offered up one idea, not one to address the situation on the border.

Do you agree that this is what the Democrats should be doing and is it possible at all that they can fit into this framework? KAYLEIGH MCENANY, TRUMP 2020 CAMPAIGN PRESS SECRETARY: No, this is not what the Democrats should be doing. This is identity politics exactly as you said, and this is what the left does. Everyone has to neatly fit into a bucket, a certain racial category or gender category. They balkanize society into different segments and hope we all fight against one another as they rise to the top. What they are doing here is saying I want a woman Vice President because guess what, we females are props to the Democratic Party. They don't care about women's rights, if they did, they want to be advocating for infanticide and killing women and men outside of the womb.

Fewer choices for us under President Trump who the Democrats constantly complain about, his policies have changed our lives and the lives of every American for the better.

The Trump agenda is delivering success after success on the economy, with the first quarter GDP number shattering expectations. Full coverage of that just ahead. But, first, the radical Democrats are hitting new levels of extremism, and as they compete to out-liberal each other on everything from the Green New Deal to open borders and, yes, even letting murderers vote from prison, President Trump is giving his early assessment of the candidates so far.

Last night, even Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein chided the Obama administration and the FBI for its handling of the original Russian meddling investigation.

Now, the president's comments as we continue to learn more about possible spying efforts against the Trump White House, because according to newly released 2016 text messages, disgraced FBI lovers, Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, appeared to suggest actually recruiting sources from within the new White House to gather information on team Trump. With names that included, according to our own Sara Carter, the wife of the chief of staff to Vice President Pence who previously worked with Strzok on the Clinton e-mail case. Joining me now with reaction to all of this, the author of \"The Russia Hoax\", Fox News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett, along with Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton, and Congressman Mike Turner. Gentlemen, thank you for joining me this evening. You know, this is extraordinary, and, Greg, I'll start with you because while all of what we have experienced has been surprising to all of us. None of us are naive. All of us have experience. And yet, all of us remember Nixon. We all know that the government can be secretive. This has been extraordinary at any level. What is your take now with this new revelation? Is this something par for the course? Or does this take it to change and turn into some place quite different?"

It does appear as though they are trying to plant a mole within the transition team to spy on the Trump campaign. We already know as Bill Barr pointed out to great controversy that the Trump campaign was being spied on. There was electronic surveillance. There was a confidential informant and now, apparently, there may have been a mole. So, look, the president was correct when he played the comment a moment ago. This was an attempted coup, a silent, nonviolent coup based on phony information to drive him from office. And, you know, Clinton was the financier, Brennan was the instigator, Clapper was the leaker, and then you had Christopher Steele and Glenn Simpson, the facilitators who created it all with a fabricated document, and Comey and McCabe and Strzok and Page were driving the engine of this attempted coup."

The FBI right now is hiding text messages of Andrew McCabe, Peter Strzok and Lisa Page from Judicial Watch. So, I'm glad Congress is able to get some of them. But there are others that are out there. And on top of that, you start off talking about the presidential campaign. You can't -- you have to remember that the Democratic Party apparatus was involved in this. The Democratic National Committee spent money on this effort to overthrow the president by working with Russia intel. They were meeting with the FBI general counsel just shortly before the election, the lawyer for the DNC and Hillary Clinton. Joe Biden was in this infamous early January 2017 Oval Office meeting with Barack Obama and Susan Rice and James Comey, where they all talked excitedly --"

Mike, you know, for I think all of us, also, when we deal with things like this, and people say -- they mention Watergate, but this is exclusively different. Watergate was a team of people and the president involving re- election trying to get information on the opponent and all of that. This is an agency, the law enforcement -- highest law enforcement of the nation, colluding and spying and working to change an election that was legal and to usurp a duly elected president. That is something we have never seen before? Would you agree? Mike?"

They are supposed to be part of what goes to the heart of our national security. And instead, they are using these tools to undermine our democratic principles, to undermine a duly elected president. And what we have seen now, even with Brennan, Clapper and Comey, and the things they have said on national TV, post the Obama administration, their absolute opposition to this president. And certainly, I think it is evident in the ways we see the abuse of power of the Department of Justice, the FBI and our intelligence agency."

Hi, guys. Thanks for coming on tonight. Fascinating things. We pretty much know what we can expect from President Trump. He does seem to be having a very good time. But, Austan, let me ask you, we are in an extraordinary economic framework here. I think that's undeniable. What do you think when it comes to certainly Joe Biden who will not be able to ignore his role with the Obama two terms and the nature of what happened with the economy there? What do you think should be his approach in dealing with -- he did mention the economy on his video.

So I don't know that it is going to be rolling out a series of policy fact sheets or something, if that's what you are saying. Now, I would comment that it struck me from the president's reaction today that the president looked like he doesn't want to run against Joe Biden and he is trying to throw up a series of critiques. I mean, really? A 72- year-old man accusing his opponent of being too old? If you look at Joe Biden's approval rating, he got 100,000 donors in one day, that he leads the primary in the polling and his net favorability is 15 points better than the president's, I can understand why the president would be a little nervous about Joe Biden."

And he does have and we all have to admit at this point of time that name recognition, of course, gets you a higher bump in the popularity and approval polls. And he also has really been behind the scenes to a degree, certainly during the Obama administration. He has never really taken a huge debate framework to have to deal with that, especially with what the Democrat Party is having to offer. Ari, in the meantime, you know, he did raise a lot of money. People in the GOP are going after Joe Biden. Wouldn't that be an interesting way to send a message to the Democrats that, yes, sent Joe Biden, because he is the guy that's the easiest to beat? What do you think?"

    {
      "speaker": "ARI FLEISCHER, CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Yes, I don't think President Trump is worried about any of the Democrats. That's the president's style. Let me correct one thing Austan said. President Trump did not say Joe Biden was too old. He said he was too sleepy. So, get your facts right. I think Joe Biden's real issue is he is a fish out of water in the modern Democrat Party. And he has such a liberal contingent that has captured the energy, the hearts, the minds, and the souls of so many Democrats. The question is, can an old style, old school, more moderate politician like Joe Biden prevail over all those Democrats? My suspicion is that Joe Biden is going to run out of air like a balloon. You are going to watch him fly through the air with the air gradually coming out. I think he has peaked at his highest numbers on the day he entered and it is down hill from here."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BRUCE",
      "utterance": "Yes, I would say, Austan, would you say at the same time that you've got a fellow who is entering, when we speak about the old style politics, as though he is entitled to this? This is almost like, you know, the next in line, the kind of framework that voters rejected in 2016, that Hillary was the next in line? Is that going to be a fit?"

    {
      "speaker": "GOOLSBEE",

Anyone that runs for president should explain what they want to do and why they think they could do the job better than the person who is there now or whoever their opponent is. I did not take that from the tone. If you watch Joe Biden's announcement, it wasn't at all of the, hey, it's my turn. So I am owed this. I don't think, thus far at least, Joe Biden is not having a problem in the Democrat Party. He is leading in the polls within the Democrat Party. His net favorability is vastly in excess of President Trump's. Ari might be right that he might go down from here. He is not starting from a position of weakness, by any means."

Remember, Hillary was defeating Barack Obama by a solid margin, double- digit margin this time in 2008. So, I think Biden's issue is going to be that he's going to have to continue to denounce who he is. You have seen him walk away from the positions he felt, heartfelt positions strongly in favor of in the '70s, '80s, and '90s. Even '03, he haven't heard it yet, but it's coming.

And yet, because Democrats feel that there is some advantage to having the border open, there is this fight. Mr. Homan, you've been on the front lines here. I mean we understand that this problem exists. We do seem to be hearing from the media a little bit and some Democrats maybe now they're perceiving it as being a problem for them in the upcoming election that like Tom Friedman at The New York Times that building a wall is important.

So that man wasn't even a mayor. and they probably closed like 600,000.

      "utterance": "Yes, this is the most nonpartisan issue that we could ever have because the violence that gets exacted here, the destruction of lives, it doesn't discriminate. Right. Regard of who you are, what political party you belong to. Congressman some of the rhetoric though when it comes to abolishing ICE and romanticizing this environment condemning the President. This is news that's covered around the world giving the impression that you know that the President and the desire to secure the border and the interests perhaps of the Republicans, it emboldens individuals feeling as though they not just have a right to be here but that criminality or at least not following our laws is not necessarily such a bad thing because even certain Americans don't like law enforcement or ICE or the President. Do you think that's contributing to some of the lawlessness that we see once illegal aliens get into the interior of the country?"

      "speaker": "ANDY BIGGS, CONGRESSMAN",
      "utterance": "Yes, I think you're exactly right. We're providing the incentives for people to come here and disobey our laws. They disobey the first law when we don't enforce our border. They come here; we're releasing them within a few days many of them. And do you know what some of these people are criminally violent as this fellow who just killed the infant. I mean this is a real problem for us and our rhetoric that comes from certain quarters of our country who say ISIS is bad, CBP is bad, this is detrimental to this nation and is really aiding and abetting this movement. And quite frankly the ICE agents, the Border Patrol agents, they're being overwhelmed. We're not providing adequate resources. We're not providing adequate staffing and we really have to step up but we're not getting the support we need across the aisle."

This woman dealing with this maniac who allegedly kills a four-month-old baby. Well you know maybe she was too afraid to call ICE because of the rhetoric that she has heard. It's a family like hers that is supported by and defended by law enforcement. And the rhetoric is that you know ICE is everyone's enemy whereas in fact it's the immigrant community that is supported first and is the first victim of criminal illegal aliens. Is this message, I know the President has been sending that message, is that message at all resonating outside and within the country with the individuals, within the community at all."

And despite all the rhetoric, I've got to give you the accounts. When the Democrats push abolish ICE, let's push sanctuary cities so you know illegal aliens who can get to a place you can be protected from ICE. When you talk about open borders. When you talk about free college tuition, free driver's license."

If you abolish ICE, you're throwing all of them out, which of course would be horrific. Gentlemen, thanks for joining me.

Joining us now with reaction is Fox News Contributor, Emily Compagno, Trump 2020 Campaign National Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany and Relatable Podcast Host Allie Beth Stuckey. Ladies welcome aboard. Thanks for joining me. You know what's interesting to me in all of this conversation is the presumption that a woman either wouldn't naturally fit into that position and that you don't need to pledge or the fact that any of these gentlemen would have to be the ones being asked if they'd be want to be the Vice President by a woman. Let me ask you Allie Beth. It's an interesting framework. And I want a woman to be in power. I want a woman to be President and Vice President and whatever position she wants. But I want it to be the right women. Is it - do you find it a little sexist that these are the guys who are saying that they're going to, I don't know pick a woman to help be their secretary? What do you think of this whole conversation?"

So, I'm already questioning their feminist credentials. But yes, I agree with you. It's incredibly patronizing and it's incredibly disheartening to know that if you're a woman on the left apparently, you're not going to be looked at for competency and qualifications, you're only going to be looked at because of your gender. I think that's a huge disservice to the very qualified women who are on the left who may do a really good job of being Vice President. Unfortunately, they're never going to know whether or not it's because they were qualified for the job."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BRUCE",
      "utterance": "You know, Kayleigh I mean this is one of the issues with identity politics right. Is this idea that it's not about what you've done or what you can accomplish or the fact that you've been a great competitor, it's that someone is going to tap you because you fit a category. Does that need to remain to be the case because women once given the opportunity we deliver. Do you agree that this is what the Democrats should be doing and is it possible at all that they can fit into this framework? KAYLEIGH MCENANY, TRUMP 2020 CAMPAIGN PRESS SECRETARY: No, this is not what the Democrats should be doing. This is identity politics exactly as you said, and this is what the left does. Everyone has to neatly fit into a bucket, a certain racial category or gender category. They balkanize society into different segments and hope we all fight against one another as they rise to the top."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "What they are doing here is saying I want a woman Vice President because guess what, we females are props to the Democratic Party. They don't care about women's rights, if they did, they want to be advocating for infanticide and killing women and men outside of the womb. So, this is ridiculous, it's identity politics but not surprised that's the Democratic Party of today. BRUCE",
      "utterance": "Yes. When we look at the issues and how the Democrats would just look at the eight years of Obama, a lot of promises, a lot of demonstrations of what they thought was important but when it came to delivering women's lives, it did not improve unemployment of course, extraordinary levels wages did not go up. Fewer choices for us under President Trump who the Democrats constantly complain about, his policies have changed our lives and the lives of every American for the better. Do you think that's what can be focused on, it is the 21st century or is there a space where you've got to specify certain gender or race or at least mentions or certain kinds of identity groups? Is there any value to that at all?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "EMILY COMPAGNO, CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "I think the value lies in specificity but in a neutral sense in terms of that identity. So, what I mean by that is policies that are specific. So that every human and every man and woman here understand how they are affected at the kitchen table right. So economically how their bank accounts are affected, how their rights and freedoms are affected and how it affects the actual genders. That's more of a trickle down and a subsequent result. And I think that the issue with that is that's why it's a token rather than a decision, it's rather than an action. And especially in terms of going into it these candidates that are saying I'm definitely going to have this certain diverse requirement in that box checked. Well those of us who are in those boxes feel we'd rather have it be an action rather than that commitment to the decision."

And Allie Beth I mean this comes down when we're just checking boxes as Emily noted then it's almost as though there is the no expectation for more that there is no expectation for us to be able to deliver that we're like a picture on the wall that this meets a certain requirement. Is that the follow through that happens when it comes to then the jobs were given and the authority that we also receive in the process of this?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STUCKEY",
      "utterance": "Well, it's the line that we use a lot when we're talking about the Democrats nowadays. It's the soft bigotry of low expectations. I personally must just have a higher view of women than they do on the left and these people who think that we are just a quota to be filled. I would love to be hired for something. I would love to be chosen for something, but I want to be chosen because I know that I'm the best that I was the best candidate for that position, that I was qualified, that I was seen as competent. I think there are plenty of competent qualified women that can fill positions of power. And I think that we are better than just a picture on the wall is as you said."

I wanted to be the right person and a person who will be good for the country which means it will be a Republican. At the same time, you've got women - women inevitably could become of course the nominee. What are all these men do you think are going to do when they're the ones in the position to be chosen by the woman. Are they already removing themselves from being the Vice President because they were going to deign to pick the woman for that position themselves?"

      "utterance": "Sure. By their logic all of these men in the Democratic 2020 fields should move aside, there should be a double female ticket because that's what identity politics in the Democratic Party demands, it's the diametric opposite of what President Trump has done standing behind this camera at the rally venue are a few dozen patriots and why are people getting here 24 hours before the rally because President Trump looks at Americans like Americans and what is the result been for women specifically generational lows and unemployment, paid family leave and his budget, the child tax credit doubling, the policies of this President are working for everyone."

I'm amazed that Donald Trump is standing up for something that's just so obvious. To our friend on the left, let's remind them that the Second Amendment is designed to prevent a tyrannical government, a tyrant. Now you guys have called Donald Trump, a fascist, a racist and a tyrant. Why in the world would you want to restrict the Second Amendment to protect you from Donald Trump. The other thing is they'd never ask how many Americans are alive because of hearing guns we know how many Americans get killed or killed because of accidents. But how many Americans are alive because they really get a firearm to protect themselves. A criminologist in Florida says 1.25 million Americans every single year use a firearm to prevent harm. 20 percent believe but for the firearm they would have been dead. So, it just seems to me you ought to add up how many people are alive versus how many people died before you talk about how bad the Second Amendment is."
