So it's kind of an interesting thing because I mean, if I get involved in a crime I'm going to try to make sure it's as scandalous as possible because I want, I want -- I don't want the court to function objectively, that way I can always win the appeal. But in terms of public opinion this is a really good point to be made especially now that justice can be overwhelmed by public opinion which is now magnified by social media. Because if you remember the time that this was going on, there was no way he could be innocent because all you heard all the time, because you believe when you see the stuff on social media, you know, how can he be innocent?

In fact, the most recent case that got a lot of attention is police officer Derek Chauvin in Minnesota, he got a trial and the prosecution had to put on the case, that's our system works.

The messaging, the border, Democrats ought to agree to build out this wall, if Republicans are agreeing to, will agree to some root causes investments and figuring out what we do with the number of undocumented people here in America who will pay their taxes and get on a path the right way to citizenship.

The wall is the perfect example, just the thought of it worked. Right? Everybody understood it, but it's evil. Same as the Wuhan lab theory. That was -- but that was his idea, so it's evil. And so, I'm thinking like, why is it that all of the institutions are getting softer, like, you talk about the border or anywhere. It's because Trump's positions were always the tough positions. So, stance on the border, very, very tough, no-nonsense. Law and order, for example, very tough on crime. CNN suddenly becomes pro-antifa. So, you see what happens, it's like because he is x, they have to be anti-x. COVID. He said it's China, China, China. What happens, Fauci and the media say no, no, no. So, what happens is, it's -- this is why I think that it is often just a lost cause. Once -- it has nothing to do with the issue or the idea.

I'm going to look at her in an unfavorable light, Harold, and I'm going to take those comments she made literally. The Taliban condones atrocities. They condone raping and stoning women, attacks against children, attacks against civilians. The United States does not condone any of that. So, she says that she's all about -- she suffered injustice. Maybe she did. She probably suffered a little. But then as a refugee, this country rescued her, brought her here, and we elected her into the Congress. We pay for her health care. We pay her salary. Yet she's violating all sorts of ethics laws and, and immigration laws, according to reports. So, CNN is trying to rehab her, and it blew up in their face. They expected her to say yes, I don't believe that, and she just flat out rejected it. So, they have a problem. And it's their problem. And it's fun to watch.",

So it's kind of an interesting thing because I mean, if I get involved in a crime I'm going to try to make sure it's as scandalous as possible because I want, I want -- I don't want the court to function objectively, that way I can always win the appeal. But in terms of public opinion this is a really good point to be made especially now that justice can be overwhelmed by public opinion which is now magnified by social media. Because if you remember the time that this was going on, there was no way he could be innocent because all you heard all the time, because you believe when you see the stuff on social media, you know, how can he be innocent? And then he's got his team working around the clock, he should buy them all drinks but they shouldn't drink it."

We should all be thankful that our system is predicated and built around protecting individual rights, they are going to be outcomes that we don't like in legal cases. In fact, the most recent case that got a lot of attention is police officer Derek Chauvin in Minnesota, he got a trial and the prosecution had to put on the case, that's our system works.

And there are cases like this that play out all the time as a result of emotion getting into the courtroom or prosecutors not doing their job the right way and then the victims who have spent decades of their life trying to get what they deserve in terms of some kind of justice for crimes that were committed against them. That all goes away in the blink of an eye, like today because the things weren't done the right way. I believe that it's a good thing that the system has all of these protections built in for the accused and it's up to and has a responsibility of the prosecutors and the judges and the jury to stick to the rules that we have in the Constitution in order to protect the rights of victims so that they get the justice that they deserve."

If visiting the border would solve our immigration challenges, the border surge challenge, this problem would have been solved a long time ago, but Lindsey Graham and Marco Rubio, and Ted Cruz and President Trump and other presidents who have gone there before, I get the politics of it. But if we only want to play the politics every two years then this is what we should keep doing. If we want to try to solve this, and we've got to look at the three parts of this. The messaging, the border, Democrats ought to agree to build out this wall, if Republicans are agreeing to, will agree to some root causes investments and figuring out what we do with the number of undocumented people here in America who will pay their taxes and get on a path the right way to citizenship.

It's not just x that's evil, it's everything linked to x, right? So, the problem with Trump is he's had a lot of really great ideas but they are evil by extension because they come from him. The wall is the perfect example, just the thought of it worked. Right? Everybody understood it, but it's evil. Same as the Wuhan lab theory. That was -- but that was his idea, so it's evil. And so, I'm thinking like, why is it that all of the institutions are getting softer, like, you talk about the border or anywhere. It's because Trump's positions were always the tough positions. So, stance on the border, very, very tough, no-nonsense. Law and order, for example, very tough on crime. CNN suddenly becomes pro-antifa. So, you see what happens, it's like because he is x, they have to be anti-x. COVID. He said it's China, China, China. What happens, Fauci and the media say no, no, no. So, what happens is, it's -- this is why I think that it is often just a lost cause. Once -- it has nothing to do with the issue or the idea. Once you stake out a position in teams where politics, the other side has to take the other side. So even if Trump, all of a sudden if Trump said I'm for open borders, CNN and the media would be for the wall."

And U.S. government State Department sanctioned and put on lists of terrorist organizations around the world, terrorist organizations that we have fought wars over, that Americans have died fighting against, people who have attacked us here on our own soil. So, it is far beyond time that not just Jewish Democrats in the -- in the House condemn her, but people like, I don't know, the Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi. Because last time this happened two or three weeks ago, there was some condemnation that Nancy Pelosi went on the Sunday shows and said, really, actually, I'm not condemning her, so please don't misconstrue that. But then today, you had Ilhan Omar trying to kind of walk this back on her Twitter feed with this gobbledygook of intersectionality and justice. And in her original remarks, she said that Jewish colleagues of hers in the House have not been good partners and justice. Well, what does that mean to her? Does that mean taking away funding for the Iron Dome that protects millions of Israeli lives and Palestinian lives and Arab lives in Israel? Is that what that means?

Hating on the national anthem, hating the country is profitable. She could become a sports analyst at ESPN, a culture critic at CNN, she could be the style -- a stylist for Teen Vogue. Embrace -- you know, mundane theatrical like that in this day and age are considered somewhat cool to a certain part of our media. So, I think she should just like be happy that she got the attention. But we should not -- we should not martyr her. I don't think she should be removed from anything. You just stop caring about her. You just -- like treat her like the way she treats the flag. Just -- I don't need it."

She's the track and field star. I think she's from Houston. What an incredible story. We should be talking about her story the way that -- she didn't even tell anybody that her biological mother had passed away the week before the race, and she ran it for her and she wins. A beautiful person, she's got style and swagger. We should be talking about them. And actually, if you look at a lot of these athletes that win at the end of their race when they have a chance to speak to the cameras, almost all of them thank God, right? So, if you can't think your country, maybe like figure out a way to talk about something that can bring people together. I also believe that Gwen Berry wants to be the next Colin Kaepernick, she's going to have to get some media training because she repeated every negative thing that she says has been sent said about her.

It's like when you're riding in the car with someone on trip, and you're listening to the radio, and every single time a country music come -- song comes on, they change the channels. They may not hate country music, but you're giving me the impression that you hate country music. When she says I respect my people, she's talking about black people, she not talking about my people, the American people, OK. And if she is really about respect, she would have respected the flag, the country, and those other two athletes who were on first and second place, steps. She had the wise men that are trying to save her, because obviously, she's in big trouble. This is a cleanup job again. And it failed. She booted it. Was this is on CNN again? CNN is constantly trying to rehab people that are saying anti-American things, and it keeps not working. They're obviously doing something wrong. The Washington Post now thinks they're the racial referee of this country. Like Dan Crenshaw wouldn't have said what he said if she were white. He probably would have condemned her stronger. He wants her off the squad. Who cares what color she is? That's not the point. The Washington Post is trying to create a situation where you cannot criticize anybody who's African American. They will make you a bigot if you do that. And it shouldn't matter what color you are. If you turn your back to the flag like that, most people think that's anti-American."

George Wallace was a Democrat, again, for the record. He was not a Republican. The other thing is, what I love about sports is that it's all based on ability and skill, and perseverance, and hard work, and you are judged by that. You can take everything else out of it. Race -- they're taking gender out of it now, so I guess they can do that too. And it's all about who can get to the finish line first, if you're racing or whatever sport that you're in. And I think it's unfortunate now that even the wokeness is trying to divvy up sports in a way that isn't based on hard work and getting the job done and who's going to be the best. It's based on all of these social justice, you know, categories that they want to check off. It's unfortunate."
