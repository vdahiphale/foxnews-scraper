They have nothing to offer the voters. They can't solve the violence problem. And they're not equipped to fix it.     China supports Joe Biden and desperately wants him to win. I can tell you that upon very good information. And so all Democrats have left is two arguments. Number one, America is systemically racist; and number two, Trump is bad. The RNC blew up that narrative, though, in a big way, showcasing stories from everyday Americans, whose lives were impacted in profoundly positive ways by Trump's America-first policies, including African-American men and women. Now, this outreach has the Democrat ticket - I think it has completely flummoxed, as we saw in this \"TODAY\" show interview of Kamala Harris.",

That's what the Democrats are doing to their own cities. They're now at risk of being left behind for decades if they don't make serious changes now. But that's up to them. But they're not going to stop us from living our God-given destiny in reaching for the stars. They might have given up on America, but the rest of us are giving her our all. And that's the \"Angle.\" Joining me now is Bernie Kerik, former NYPD Commissioner.

I have to tell you, leaving the White House last night, as I walked through the streets, as a police executive and somebody that ran the NYPD, I was completely disgusted by the fact that the cops in D.C. are overworked, they didn't have enough resources, they didn't have the manpower they needed, they weren't in the right spots. No genius had to tell you that there is going to be problems at the exit gates of the White House. There were hundreds of these lunatics out there, these antifa and \"Black Lives Matter\" screamers, and yet, there wasn't enough enforcement at those spots to keep people safe and secure.

They want to intimidate people away from going to Trump rallies exercising their Constitutional rights. You try that outside of an abortion clinic, just praying outside of an abortion clinic, and they'll - they'll call you a domestic terrorist, Bernie.  KERIK: These people were harassed. They were taunted. They were threatened. They were spit at. They were throwing things at them. They surrounded them. They wouldn't let them pass. Criminal conduct, and there wasn't enough cops to deal with. And I'm telling you, Laura, I have to believe this stuff is intentional.

The science is that outdoor events, whether they're liberal, conservative, spring break, motorcycle rally, it doesn't matter, they really don't spread this virus. OK? There's been a lot of contact- tracing done in a lot of countries. As far as spreads indoors, it spreads intrafamilially. It spreads in hospitals. It can sometimes spread in bars and - of all the public health measures, I would say closing bars is arguably the one that makes the most sense. They - none of them make that much sense, but that's the one that makes the most sense. It doesn't spread outdoors. And this is - it's a joke.

The other 3 percent were a mix of indoor and outdoor. We've had no super-spread events anywhere in the world that were exclusively outdoors.

In Houston and Southeast Texas, which is really the hub of the early spike, numbers are down even further. By the way, I just looked up the Florida numbers for deaths. And deaths lag. OK? So if deaths are going down, the epidemic is really on its way out in a state. Florida had 229 deaths on Friday, August 14th. Today, they reported 89 deaths. So that's a drop of 60 percent. And that's Friday-over- Friday. So it should be roughly comparable. So - I mean, it's very hard to see anything but this epidemic in the south being basically over.

And I think some of the most potent line of messaging we saw was from President Trump last night where he said Joe Biden for 47 years took donations from blue collar Americans, he gave them hugs and kisses, he told them that he felt their pain, and then went back to Washington, D.C. and voted to send their jobs to China. Also, that video we saw of New York City public housing residents talking about how liberals like Bill de Blasio gave preferential treatment over illegal immigrants who cut the line, broke the law to come here, over black Americans.

And what we did see from the limiting polling that came out, if you start from the day that the Democrats started the convention, August 17th, to now, that's been 11 days, Joe Biden has dropped about a half a percentage point nationally. He's dropped about 1.3 percentage in the top six battleground states in the aggregate. And he's also, if you look at the betting averages, which is a really interesting thing to focus on, Biden started on the 17th ahead by about 14.5 percent. It's now down to about six.

And Kenosha is a swing county that went to President Trump, a Republican, for the first time in 44 years in 2016 to then candidate Trump. And where Kenosha goes typically the state goes. You also look at Kenosha County and the Milwaukee media markets, and when we're talking about those suburban moms that President Trump needs to win over, they're watching the local news and seeing what's going on in Kenosha.

Now, as I told you back in June, the Democrats had made a calculated decision not to address the violence, not to address the violence and riots as long as they thought that they were going to be helping them politically. And sure enough, the moment Don Lemon let it slip that some focus group somewhere was showing Democrat voter erosion because of the unrest. Well, Joe and Kamala tried to turn the titanic around."

He tried to ride the energy of the far-left all the way to victory on November 3rd, but now it looks like that wave has pulled him under and a riptide of radicalism is drowning the Democrats. They have nothing to offer the voters. They can't solve the violence problem. And they're not equipped to fix it. China supports Joe Biden and desperately wants him to win. I can tell you that upon very good information. And so all Democrats have left is two arguments. Number one, America is systemically racist; and number two, Trump is bad. The RNC blew up that narrative, though, in a big way, showcasing stories from everyday Americans, whose lives were impacted in profoundly positive ways by Trump's America-first policies, including African-American men and women. Now, this outreach has the Democrat ticket - I think it has completely flummoxed, as we saw in this \"TODAY\" show interview of Kamala Harris."

But it's no reason to toss America in a dumpster and set her on fire. That's what the Democrats are doing to their own cities. They're now at risk of being left behind for decades if they don't make serious changes now. But that's up to them. But they're not going to stop us from living our God-given destiny in reaching for the stars. They might have given up on America, but the rest of us are giving her our all. And that's the \"Angle.\" Joining me now is Bernie Kerik, former NYPD Commissioner.

I have to tell you, leaving the White House last night, as I walked through the streets, as a police executive and somebody that ran the NYPD, I was completely disgusted by the fact that the cops in D.C. are overworked, they didn't have enough resources, they didn't have the manpower they needed, they weren't in the right spots. No genius had to tell you that there is going to be problems at the exit gates of the White House. There were hundreds of these lunatics out there, these antifa and \"Black Lives Matter\" screamers, and yet, there wasn't enough enforcement at those spots to keep people safe and secure. And we saw that with Rand Paul and a number of other people that left the White House. It's crazy. And I have to wonder, is it intentional?

They want to intimidate people away from going to Trump rallies exercising their Constitutional rights. You try that outside of an abortion clinic, just praying outside of an abortion clinic, and they'll - they'll call you a domestic terrorist, Bernie.  KERIK: These people were harassed. They were taunted. They were threatened. They were spit at. They were throwing things at them. They surrounded them. They wouldn't let them pass. Criminal conduct, and there wasn't enough cops to deal with. And I'm telling you, Laura, I have to believe this stuff is intentional. When you look at what's going on in the other cities, is that what's happening there too? Every one of these Democrat-run cities are responding the same way. Why?

ALEX BERENSON, \"UNREPORTED TRUTHS OF COVID\" AUTHOR & FORMER NEW YORK TIMES REPORTER: I mean, I hate hearing this stuff, Laura. Can we talk about the science for a second? The science is that outdoor events, whether they're liberal, conservative, spring break, motorcycle rally, it doesn't matter, they really don't spread this virus. OK? There's been a lot of contact- tracing done in a lot of countries. As far as spreads indoors, it spreads intrafamilially. It spreads in hospitals. It can sometimes spread in bars and - of all the public health measures, I would say closing bars is arguably the one that makes the most sense. They - none of them make that much sense, but that's the one that makes the most sense. It doesn't spread outdoors. And this is - it's a joke.

The other 3 percent were a mix of indoor and outdoor. We've had no super-spread events anywhere in the world that were exclusively outdoors. And to your point, Laura, when there was a big pushback that maybe the southern wave was caused by the George Floyd protests or things like that, what did all of the media do? They said, oh, no, it doesn't spread outside, it couldn't have been that, it doesn't spread outside.

In Houston and Southeast Texas, which is really the hub of the early spike, numbers are down even further. By the way, I just looked up the Florida numbers for deaths. And deaths lag. OK? So if deaths are going down, the epidemic is really on its way out in a state. Florida had 229 deaths on Friday, August 14th. Today, they reported 89 deaths. So that's a drop of 60 percent. And that's Friday-over- Friday. So it should be roughly comparable. So - I mean, it's very hard to see anything but this epidemic in the south being basically over. And really without lockdowns - I mean, again, the only thing those states really did is they pushed masks a little bit and they closed bars.

And I think some of the most potent line of messaging we saw was from President Trump last night where he said Joe Biden for 47 years took donations from blue collar Americans, he gave them hugs and kisses, he told them that he felt their pain, and then went back to Washington, D.C. and voted to send their jobs to China. Also, that video we saw of New York City public housing residents talking about how liberals like Bill de Blasio gave preferential treatment over illegal immigrants who cut the line, broke the law to come here, over black Americans. I think some of that messaging that we're going to see over the next couple months is going to be incredibly moving and powerful."

      "utterance": "And Tom, I want to show folks what the polling is looking like today in swing states compared to the same time in 2016. Here's the Real Clear Politics average. You know it well. Biden is leading Trump by three- and-a-half points in Wisconsin. But back in 2016, Hillary led by 11.5 percent. Biden both say 5.8 percent lead in Pennsylvania today, but that's less than the 9.2 percent, almost double, point lead that Hillary had in 2016. And then in Michigan, polls showing that Biden up now just 2.6 percent, again, where Hillary led by nine points four years ago. Tom, does this tell you anything significant?"

      "utterance": "Well, it tells you that this race is far from over. Hillary Clinton, remember, the Democrats went second last time around, and Hillary Clinton did get a pretty significant bump out of her convention in Philadelphia. That didn't last, though. This time around, it's a completely different scenario, because the conventions are back-to-back. They are being held virtually. And what we did see from the limiting polling that came out, if you start from the day that the Democrats started the convention, August 17th, to now, that's been 11 days, Joe Biden has dropped about a half a percentage point nationally. He's dropped about 1.3 percentage in the top six battleground states in the aggregate. And he's also, if you look at the betting averages, which is a really interesting thing to focus on, Biden started on the 17th ahead by about 14.5 percent. It's now down to about six. So the people who are putting their money down on who they think is going to win this race are viewing what they saw over the last 10 or so days pretty favorably for Trump and the Republicans and not so favorably for Biden and the Democrats."

      "utterance": "And Lisa, I'm going to stick to these two issues that I think really do track sentiment in the public, even people who don't necessarily like all of Trump's tweets, et cetera, or his tone -- football and schools. Fall is back to school, and it's usually back to football. And you see a divide, those red states to blue states, with how they're treating both issues. Talk about that cultural touchstone and the educational component."

    {
      "speaker": "BOOTHE",
      "utterance": "I think when you look at certain places, even a state like Wisconsin, they don't want to hear Joe Biden talking about a national mask policy and also further lockdowns. You have a lot of hardworking Americans in states like Michigan and Wisconsin and Pennsylvania who want to go back to work. They want their kids to go back to work. They want life to go on as normal. And I think another aspect, even just the violence we're seeing in places like Kenosha, Wisconsin, it matters. And it matters because when you look at Wisconsin, it's pivotal to whoever is going to end up winning the White House. And Kenosha is a swing county that went to President Trump, a Republican, for the first time in 44 years in 2016 to then candidate Trump. And where Kenosha goes typically the state goes. You also look at Kenosha County and the Milwaukee media markets, and when we're talking about those suburban moms that President Trump needs to win over, they're watching the local news and seeing what's going on in Kenosha. So I don't think -- there should be no downplaying of the impact that that's going to have on the electorate as well. I think that's something people should certainly keep their eye on."

      "utterance": "Absolutely, the riots, the violence. Tom, on the state by state races, with Senate races, David Perdue, of course senator from Georgia, just put out an ad linking his opponents to some of the unrest you're seeing in the streets. Watch."

      "utterance": "We need to send a message that if you indulge this kind of politics, you're not just going to get beaten. You're going to get beaten so bad you can never run or show your face again in public, because we have had enough, absolutely enough of what we are getting from Donald Trump."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Tom, do you expect to see more of that type of ad as we get closer, especially in these key Senate races?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BEVAN",
      "utterance": "Oh, absolutely. Again, as Lisa mentioned, I think this is an issue that is going to move voters in a significant way. You're going to see the president and his team use this on ads in all of the swing states. And you can bet that there will be plenty, all of these Republicans that are running for Senate, whether they're incumbents or whether they're challengers, are also going to be tying their Democratic challengers to it. And quite frankly, look, the Democrats haven't done a very good job of rebutting it. They haven't done a good job of coming out. And that started at the top with Joe Biden in saying this violence and the rioting and rooting is unacceptable and it won't be tolerated. They haven't gotten there. Maybe they will, but they haven't gotten there yet."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Well, riots started at the end of May, little late to be doing it now, but nevertheless we'll see how it plays out. Tom and Lisa, great to see both of you tonight. Thank you so much. And coming up, we have a big announcement about Monday's show. Don't want to miss that. Stay there."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "As we mentioned at the top, President Trump is not taking his foot off the gas. After an incredibly successful RNC, he hit New Hampshire tonight to continue making his case to America, while Joe Biden wallows in his basement, but promises appearances. That continues Monday night, where I'm going to sit down with the president exclusively from the White House. We hope to have him for the entire hour. We're going to work on that. I think we will get that. So be sure to tune in for the entire hour. That's all the time we have tonight. Have an amazing weekend, hug your kids, fly your flag, appreciate the greatness of this country that you saw on full display this week.
