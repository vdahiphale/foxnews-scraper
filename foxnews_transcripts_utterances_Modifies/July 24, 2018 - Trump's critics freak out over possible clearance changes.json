On the flip side, nearly identical numbers see Republicans is out of step, although that's remained constant over the past two years. This comes as political analyst Larry Sabato predicts for the first time Democrats are favorites to retake control of the house in the midterm, November. I think that's totally false. This is the same Larry Sabato who said Hillary Clinton was going to get 322 electoral votes and fell just a wee bit short of that. So, I don't think it's going to happen. I don't see the big blue wave out there. I don't think the Democrats have a leader and I don't think they have a message that's winning. But I think my friend Juan probably disagrees.

This is how you react when he sneezes, so this doesn't mean anything to us. And then you have the Dems saying stuff like, well, the revoking of the security clearances are a deflection. Well, that's the worst deflection ever then because he's responding. He's actually responding to the collusion -- the collusion accusations by saying you're colluding too, and I'm gonna -- like, I'm taking away your clearances. That's not a deflection.

But you have James Clapper, and John Brennan, and James Comey who are hyper partisan. They're the ones -- James Comey stood before congress, as you well remember, Congressman Chaffetz, stood before congress and basically talked about how objective and politically agnostic he was and he's sitting here tweeting, telling people to go vote for Democrats, which is fine. You can have free speech. You can be completely against the president. You can have any political opinion you want, but we know what the surveillance state was capable of.

Like there's a high side and a low side and it's actually quite stark. It doesn't mean you don't have, may be, people you can call in the agency who might tell you something, but that's leaks. And if there was something illegal that happened, maybe we need another inspector general report. But, I do want to talk about the president's ability to change the subject, intensifies the subject.

And I do say -- I always go back to my original theory that it's because he has so much energy because he doesn't drink. It's like, if you don't drink, you're up at 5:00 in the morning.

And I think that's why Paul Ryan said, you know, maybe we do need to look at whether or not someone has continued clearance after they leave government work. But at the same time, he said he's just trolling people. And so, he essentially goes and sees what the hysterical reaction is from the left, and if it is so hysterical, that their heads explode and they're brain bits on the wall, that for the president is a minor victory because we're not talking about Helsinki. We're not talking about Russia."

In a new poll, 56 percent of voters say Democratic candidates are out of step with the mainstream thinking. That's a big increase from two years ago when 42 percent said the same thing, a 14-point swing. On the flip side, nearly identical numbers see Republicans is out of step, although that's remained constant over the past two years. This comes as political analyst Larry Sabato predicts for the first time Democrats are favorites to retake control of the house in the midterm, November. I think that's totally false. This is the same Larry Sabato who said Hillary Clinton was going to get 322 electoral votes and fell just a wee bit short of that. So, I don't think it's going to happen. I don't see the big blue wave out there. I don't think the Democrats have a leader and I don't think they have a message that's winning. But I think my friend Juan probably disagrees.

So they're putting the group before the identity, right? That's probably the big problem. And free speech is no longer a guarantee when you're -- they used to be the champions of free speech.
