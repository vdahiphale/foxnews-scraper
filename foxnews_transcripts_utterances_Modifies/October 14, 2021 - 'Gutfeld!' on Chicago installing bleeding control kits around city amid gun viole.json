      "sentences": "So, did you know that the New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, otherwise known as a walking tree of turds is removing the statue of Thomas Jefferson from City Hall? In case he went to public schools. Jefferson was a founding father, our third president, but also a slave owner. The statue has been there for nearly 200 years. A year for every screw up de Blasio makes in a week. But after all the problems going on in the city it was clear that this putrid piece of marble had to go. I mean, think about it. A woman was beaten brutally on the city streets stopped repeatedly and left for dead. People are dodging bullets in Times Square like Neo in the Matrix. But damn that Thomas Jefferson, you know, he's behind all that. Of course there was the Filipino nurse murdered Saturday afternoon in Times Square by a deranged criminal. That alleged killer had been released after groping another female. But clearly, if there was no Jefferson statue, this never would have happened. There's a huge spike in homicides in major cities. It's getting so bad in places like Chicago. They are installing bleeding control kits in hundreds of city buildings. Each kit contains supplies like tourniquets, gauze, shears, gloves and an instruction manual. I knew the labor shortage was severe, but now you have to fix your own gunshot wounds. But what do you expect when you allow such statues to exist? Now the removal of the statute was suggested by de Blasio's wife, Chirlane McCray. She said I already share a bed with a blockhead. I don't need another one staring at me while I work. But she also heads up the $800 million taxpayer funded program called Thrive, which was designed to treat the mentally ill like the guy who murdered the nurse. But where's the proof that the program actually did anything? The money disappeared faster than Brian Stelter at a donut factory. If you take a casual drive around the city and you don't get carjacked first, you'll see countless destitute zombies. But it's hard to investigate the person in charge of helping them when it's the mayor's wife. So what do you do when you're supposed to treat the sick and deranged and you haven't done squat? And the people you're supposed to be helping are doing squat everywhere, on the sidewalks, in front of businesses, in the parks with dogs. And that's Julie. So, you go after this statues? And why? How does removing the statues make the poor or the elderly currently being picked off in New York any safer? It doesn't. If anything, with you getting shot at statues give you a place to hide behind. In fact, we can use a lot more statues of really fat people. Grover Cleveland, Henry VIII, hell, I'll take a Michael Moore. I'll take anything because increasingly -- oh, it's a cheap (INAUDIBLE) increasingly, the public has fewer places to hide. But the real reason for removing statues is deflection. The activist class, it's a shallow, stupid breed with absurd priorities, and their leaders know that. All you need to do is dangle some performative act of symbolic justice in front of them, and like a hooker in front of Hunter, they'll climb over it. And then you don't need to do any real work at all. Defund the police, bail out thugs and rapists and watch as your city time travels back to the 1970s and then blame the statues. And a mayor and his wife can coast along by shifting the conversation to erasing the past and call that progress. It's not just New York, whether it's San Francisco, where they're closing down drugstores due to crime, or downtown Portland and during another night of mob violence. All you need to do are a few things. Demand changing the problematic name of a grade school, cancel a holiday for a problematic explorer. Remove a statue of a problematic founder. All of the name of equity and anti-racism. As the elderly and working classes continue to get victimized by thugs and maniacs. It's a good grift as long as you go woke, you're immune from criticism for the horrible messes that you leave behind. I wonder what the angry black male thinks.",

The woke brigade cancels the pumpkin parade at the behest of the racial equity team at Seattle Elementary School, cancels Halloween activities because they marginalized students of color. The principal told Fox News: Halloween is a very complex issue, especially for students of color who don't celebrate it. And those who are sensitive to the noise and excitement of the parade. That's me. I'm short. Sure, OK. But let's be clear, it's not a complex issue. Kids dress up as a Teletubbie or Thor something. They ask for candy, they asked for candy, we give them candy. I find it hard to believe any kid of any color, or any culture wouldn't die to do this every year. Free candy. You get costumes. They also argue it's tough on kids who can't afford costumes. Sorry, but not to be that boomer, young-boomer. But remember how easy it used to be -- for my sister, all she needed was a bedsheet and a pair of scissors. And I just threw on my mom's pearls and heels and called it good. Made a few extra bucks on the way, too. So, it's not about a lack of money, it's about a lack of imagination and kids have plenty of it. Let them choose their own damn costumes. It's literally one of the best things they're good at and they don't care about your dumb woke agenda. According to a school newsletter, other options will be offered including, get this: thematic units of study about the fall, and reviewing autumnal -- I've never said that before -- autumnal artwork. Oh, goodie, kids will love that, more homework. Further proof that woke-ism is about murdering fun and having nothing to replace it with. Because they're hopeless humorless losers. Maybe that should be the costume of the year. Go as a woke-ster. You don't even have to get dressed, just be a (BLEEP).

      "utterance": "So, did you know that the New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, otherwise known as a walking tree of turds is removing the statue of Thomas Jefferson from City Hall? In case he went to public schools. Jefferson was a founding father, our third president, but also a slave owner. The statue has been there for nearly 200 years. A year for every screw up de Blasio makes in a week. But after all the problems going on in the city it was clear that this putrid piece of marble had to go. I mean, think about it. A woman was beaten brutally on the city streets stopped repeatedly and left for dead. People are dodging bullets in Times Square like Neo in the Matrix. But damn that Thomas Jefferson, you know, he's behind all that. Of course there was the Filipino nurse murdered Saturday afternoon in Times Square by a deranged criminal. That alleged killer had been released after groping another female. But clearly, if there was no Jefferson statue, this never would have happened. There's a huge spike in homicides in major cities. It's getting so bad in places like Chicago. They are installing bleeding control kits in hundreds of city buildings. Each kit contains supplies like tourniquets, gauze, shears, gloves and an instruction manual. I knew the labor shortage was severe, but now you have to fix your own gunshot wounds. But what do you expect when you allow such statues to exist? Now the removal of the statute was suggested by de Blasio's wife, Chirlane McCray. She said I already share a bed with a blockhead. I don't need another one staring at me while I work. But she also heads up the $800 million taxpayer funded program called Thrive, which was designed to treat the mentally ill like the guy who murdered the nurse. But where's the proof that the program actually did anything? The money disappeared faster than Brian Stelter at a donut factory. If you take a casual drive around the city and you don't get carjacked first, you'll see countless destitute zombies. But it's hard to investigate the person in charge of helping them when it's the mayor's wife. So what do you do when you're supposed to treat the sick and deranged and you haven't done squat? And the people you're supposed to be helping are doing squat everywhere, on the sidewalks, in front of businesses, in the parks with dogs. And that's Julie. So, you go after this statues? And why? How does removing the statues make the poor or the elderly currently being picked off in New York any safer? It doesn't. If anything, with you getting shot at statues give you a place to hide behind. In fact, we can use a lot more statues of really fat people. Grover Cleveland, Henry VIII, hell, I'll take a Michael Moore. I'll take anything because increasingly -- oh, it's a cheap (INAUDIBLE) increasingly, the public has fewer places to hide. But the real reason for removing statues is deflection. The activist class, it's a shallow, stupid breed with absurd priorities, and their leaders know that. All you need to do is dangle some performative act of symbolic justice in front of them, and like a hooker in front of Hunter, they'll climb over it. And then you don't need to do any real work at all. Defund the police, bail out thugs and rapists and watch as your city time travels back to the 1970s and then blame the statues. And a mayor and his wife can coast along by shifting the conversation to erasing the past and call that progress. It's not just New York, whether it's San Francisco, where they're closing down drugstores due to crime, or downtown Portland and during another night of mob violence. All you need to do are a few things. Demand changing the problematic name of a grade school, cancel a holiday for a problematic explorer. Remove a statue of a problematic founder. All of the name of equity and anti-racism. As the elderly and working classes continue to get victimized by thugs and maniacs. It's a good grift as long as you go woke, you're immune from criticism for the horrible messes that you leave behind. I wonder what the angry black male thinks."

There was -- I hate to even say this, but it's true, there was even black slave owners because that's what society was. The good news was that -- or is that we didn't do that and it didn't take us. We move past it in record time, if you look at the other world, other places on this -- on this world how long they dealt with slavery. Centuries, for eons, we got it -- we got our stuff together relatively quick. So I think it's always hilarious that, why are you getting rid of Thomas Jefferson? Well, he owned slaves.

That's me. I'm short. Sure, OK. But let's be clear, it's not a complex issue. Kids dress up as a Teletubbie or Thor something. They ask for candy, they asked for candy, we give them candy. I find it hard to believe any kid of any color, or any culture wouldn't die to do this every year. Free candy. You get costumes. They also argue it's tough on kids who can't afford costumes. Sorry, but not to be that boomer, young-boomer. But remember how easy it used to be -- for my sister, all she needed was a bedsheet and a pair of scissors. And I just threw on my mom's pearls and heels and called it good. Made a few extra bucks on the way, too.
