      "sentences": "And this is a \"Fox News Alert,\" a special \"Hannity\" investigation into the rampant hypocrisy from the left, and of course, the destroy Trump media when it comes to the issue of election interference. Newt Gingrich, Kellyanne Conway, Gregg Jarrett, Geraldo Rivera will all be here with reaction tonight. But first, this may surprise you. For once, I actually agree with the outrage coming from Democrats and the destroy Trump media. It's just pointed in the wrong direction. And that's tonight's \"Opening Monologue.\"  All right, in the middle of yet another destroy Trump propaganda foaming at the mouth feeding frenzy, well, Donald Trump Jr., joined us in an exclusive interview last night to explain the facts behind his meeting back in June of 2016 with a Russian lawyer.  Now, I asked him question after question, frankly, until I couldn't think of any other questions. And Donald Trump Jr., to his credit, he answered everything single one of them.  Now, much to the dismay of Democrats and the leftist media, there was no smoking gun, there was no shocking revelation. What we ended up with is this: that Donald Trump, Jr. was approached about setting up a meeting with the offer of op research on Hillary Clinton. He took the meeting, about 20 minutes. But the Russian lawyer had nothing, and that was the end of it, and they never talked again. Plus, the lawyer says she does not work for the Russian government. Well, now that we have that out of the way, I want to highlight the Democrats and the media's collective outrage over so-called election interference, collusion, fake news, and explain how they are completely wrong and completely misguided.  Now, let's start with the idea of a foreign government interfering in elections and how God-awful it is. Take a look.  RACHEL MADDOX, MSNBC, JULY 11: There is also now direct evidence, uncontested evidence of people in the Trump campaign at the highest levels conspiring with a foreign adversary to influence our election.   SEN. CHRIS COONS, D-DEL., JULY 12, CNN: Colluded with a foreign power, partnering with Russia to try and influence our presidential election certainly raises questions. JOE SCARBOROUGH, MSNBC, JULY 11: Are you concerned about Don Jr., and other members of the Trump campaign meeting with Russian lawyers claiming to be representatives of the Russian government, or claiming to be part of a bigger plan for the Russian government to influence the presidential election?",

      "sentences": "Pay very close attention. If the left, if the media, if they are really so upset about all of that, then they should be morally outraged and hysterical about this very explosive report from Politico January 11, this year. Here's the headline. \"Ukrainian Efforts to Sabotage Trump Backfire. Kiev officials are scrambling to make amends with the president-elect after quietly working to boost Clinton.\" Now, in the article, Politico explains how a DNC operative actually paid and Ukrainian government officials, they worked to aid the DNC and the Hillary Clinton campaign to hurt Donald Trump during the 2016 election. Now, the report details how this Democratic operative, who used to work in the Clinton White House, led this effort, even met with Ukrainian diplomats at the Ukrainian embassy to talk about ways to expose former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort and hurt the campaign. Now, this operative went on to describe those Ukrainian officials as being, quote, \"helpful\" when it came to finding leads to dig up information, dirt on Donald Trump and his campaign. Then there's this stunning quote, collusion, \"She occasionally shared her findings with officials from the DNC and the Clinton campaign.\" So this DNC operative, paid, was working with Ukraine, also sharing potentially damaging information with the DNC and Hillary Clinton's campaign.  Then to top it all off, the DNC operative also said that she would give off-the-record information and guidance to, quote, \"a lot of journalists\" --- you know, those people that suck it all in -- who were trying to write stories about the Trump campaign and Paul Manafort.   But maybe that's why the media doesn't want you, the American people, to know about this story. Now, were they complicit in this foreign plot to damage the Trump campaign? And here's another example that has been completely ignored. A congressional investigation found back in 2014 an Israeli political group used $300,000-plus taxpayer dollars from the Obama State Department in a grant to create a political apparatus. For what purpose? To try and defeat one of our closest allies, defeat the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in his latest reelection.  And next is the media and the Democrats, you know, the ones that are so apoplectic over the idea of collusion. Why have they never reported any of these stories to you? Take a look.  REP. MAXINE WATERS, D-CALIF., MAY 11, MSNBC: I told you that I thought there was a Kremlin plan and these were his allies. I had a resolution back in February that said it should be investigated for collusion.  REP. ADAM SCHIFF, D-CALIF., MARCH 19, MSNBC: I would characterize it this way at the outset of the investigation. There is circumstantial evidence of collusion. SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER, D-N.Y., JULY 11: The claims of the administration for the last six months that collusion is not even on the table has been undone by the president's son's own words.  JAKE TAPPER, CNN, JULY 11: This is evidence of willingness to commit collusion.   UNIDENTIFIED MALE, NBC NEWS, MARCH 5: I think what it means is that a federal judge found that the people in Trump's organization were colluding with the Russians. MADDOW, MARCH 16, \"THE TONIGHT SHOW\"/NBC: What would change the world is if, you know, Russia was interfering in the election and they weren't doing it on their own and he was in on it.",

And of course, I'm talking about the Uranium One deal, which the media never talks about. Here's how that went down. Now, during her tenure as secretary of state, Hillary Clinton approved the transfer of up to 20 percent of America's uranium, the foundational material for nuclear weapons. You know that thing? And anyway, that went to Vladimir Putin and the Russians! And guess what? The people who benefited from that deal, well, they kicked back, they poured as much as $145 million into the Clinton Foundation! And at the same time, Bill Clinton, like he always does trying to enrich himself further, he doubled his speaking fees in Moscow.   Now, you don't have to connect the dots on this one because it's so obvious. That's pay-to-play. Actually, where I grew up, we call it bribery. Now, the Clintons stuffed their pockets while putting America's national security in jeopardy. That's almost as dumb as the uranium deal.  And here's another example of misdirected outrage by the left -- Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, the media, all freaking out over fake news! They are fake news! Watch this.  HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE, MAY 31: Voters who are being targeted with all of this false information are genuinely trying to make up their minds. They've got to help prevent fake news from creating a new reality that does influence how people, you know, think of themselves, see the world, the decisions that they make.   THEN-PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA, NOV. 20, 2016: The general misinformation from all kinds of sources, both domestic, foreign, on social media, that make it very difficult for voters to figure out what's true and what's not.  BRIAN STELTER, CNN SENIOR MEDIA CORRESPONDENT, NOV. 20, 2016: We are entering a terrible new age of information warfare.

      "sentences": "I said in 2008, journalism's dead. Nothing beats the media, the left in this country complaining about fake news, when pretty much every news organization has gotten it wrong when going after President Trump, and all of them had to issue corrections. And of course, they colluded back in the campaign and were exposed to basically working with the Clinton campaign. Remember that? Remember WikiLeaks?  Anyway, and CNN is out on front on most of this stuff. Now, here's the most overlooked aspect of this crusade by the left. When fake news suits their purpose and their goals, they support it, they spread it, they propagandize. Now, check out this headline from The Washington Times. Quote, \"Democrats intentionally used disinformation from Russia to attack Trump in campaign ads.\" Other writers, well-known, Roland (ph) Scarborough, well respected -- he's talking about the fake, the discredited. Remember Christopher Steele, the dossier on Donald Trump? And he points out that Steele's dossier and sources included -- and I'm quoting -- \"a senior Russian foreign ministry figure,\" a top-level Russian intelligence officer, active inside the Kremlin, a senior Russian government official and a senior Kremlin official. So in other words, they were relying and they were spreading information directly sourced to the highest level of the Russian government.  Now, instead of stopping all this and the foreign effort to interfere in our elections, well, the dossier was passed around for months and months and months, eventually published by BuzzFeed, routinely cited by Democrats, who repeated the false claims from the document to attack President Trump. Remember, that was about the Ritz-Carlton and hookers, and I won't go any further. Not to mention, it ended up in the hands of Senator John McCain. He gave it to the FBI. That led to an investigation. Then there's the group behind this phony dossier, Fusion GPS. As The New York Post has reported, it has several ties to the Democrats, including Clinton allies.   So the double standard here is stunning, it's spectacular. And as we have seen time and time again, Democrats are willing to put their party and politics before anything else, even if it means lying to you!  And in the case of Donald Trump Jr., he came on this program last night. He answered every tough question about the meeting. Well, isn't it now time for Hillary Clinton, the Democrats, the media, all these people, the Ukraine, those associated with the Ukraine, those in the DNC, to do the same? Now, here's why. We know the Democrats colluded with Ukraine. It's incontrovertible. We know that a DNC operative met with Ukrainian diplomats and shared information with the DNC and the Clinton campaign. We know that members of the Ukrainian government worked to undermine the Trump campaign, which eventually led to the removal of Paul Manafort when he was the campaign manager. That's all been proven. The questions we need answers to now -- what else took place? And in other words, how far do these people go? And what did Hillary Clinton know and when did she know it and was she directly involved? Now, this double standard, this hypocrisy is despicable, especially when you consider how the media in this country and the Democrats in this country for now almost 11 months have been freaking out nonstop, never-ending black helicopter tinfoil hat conspiracy theories that have been proven to be based on nothing, all while ignoring mountains of evidence in numerous cases that show real election interference and real Russian collusion and Ukrainian collusion!   Joining us now, author of the number one New York Times bestseller, \"Understanding Trump,\" former speaker of the House Newt Gingrich. Mr. Speaker, good to see you.",

And the president is right when he points that out, that so much of this goes back to the election results and the fact that people are trying to BleachBit it and make it go away. Let's review a couple things. You just mentioned the actual coordination and collusion between Ukrainian embassy officials and DNC officials. They actually used that information to try to hurt people on the Trump campaign. That's number one. Number two, Bill Clinton got a half-million dollars in speaking fees from a Russian bank and was personally thanked by Putin for that. Number three, Hillary Clinton allowed 20 percent of our uranium reserves to go to a Russian firm whose investors gave money to the Clinton Foundation. The Clinton campaign chairman's brother lobbied against sanctions on Russia and failed to disclose it. So you're talking about actual evidence, not conjecture. My other impression of your interview is that -- how refreshing to have someone take responsibility, be transparent and earnest, admit that maybe he would have done things differently. I think many people in last year's election should say that they would have done things differently. How about the people saying on election day Hillary Clinton had a 92 percent chance of winning Michigan. It turns out she had a zero percent chance. So many things could be done differently.  The bottom line is, what came out of this 20 minute, brief meeting? Nothing helpful, nothing meaningful, nothing consequential. If that weren't true, there would have been immediate follow-up.

What you described with the Ukrainian embassy officials and the DNC, this Alexandra person, there was damage. They tried to hurt people and they did hurt people on the Trump campaign. So I'm glad you are raising that. No less than a New York Times reporter today tweeted about it, almost exactly what you are saying. Sarah Sangers mentioned it in her White House press briefing today. And this is important information. The biggest response I have heard from the media about that is, oh, but a different person won. You won, she lost.

Newt Gingrich, Kellyanne Conway, Gregg Jarrett, Geraldo Rivera will all be here with reaction tonight. But first, this may surprise you. For once, I actually agree with the outrage coming from Democrats and the destroy Trump media. It's just pointed in the wrong direction. And that's tonight's \"Opening Monologue.\" All right, in the middle of yet another destroy Trump propaganda foaming at the mouth feeding frenzy, well, Donald Trump Jr., joined us in an exclusive interview last night to explain the facts behind his meeting back in June of 2016 with a Russian lawyer. Now, I asked him question after question, frankly, until I couldn't think of any other questions. And Donald Trump Jr., to his credit, he answered everything single one of them."

But the Russian lawyer had nothing, and that was the end of it, and they never talked again. Plus, the lawyer says she does not work for the Russian government. Well, now that we have that out of the way, I want to highlight the Democrats and the media's collective outrage over so-called election interference, collusion, fake news, and explain how they are completely wrong and completely misguided. Now, let's start with the idea of a foreign government interfering in elections and how God-awful it is. Take a look. RACHEL MADDOX, MSNBC, JULY 11: There is also now direct evidence, uncontested evidence of people in the Trump campaign at the highest levels conspiring with a foreign adversary to influence our election. SEN. CHRIS COONS, D-DEL., JULY 12, CNN: Colluded with a foreign power, partnering with Russia to try and influence our presidential election certainly raises questions. JOE SCARBOROUGH, MSNBC, JULY 11: Are you concerned about Don Jr., and other members of the Trump campaign meeting with Russian lawyers claiming to be representatives of the Russian government, or claiming to be part of a bigger plan for the Russian government to influence the presidential election?"

      "utterance": "Pay very close attention. If the left, if the media, if they are really so upset about all of that, then they should be morally outraged and hysterical about this very explosive report from Politico January 11, this year. Here's the headline. \"Ukrainian Efforts to Sabotage Trump Backfire. Kiev officials are scrambling to make amends with the president-elect after quietly working to boost Clinton.\" Now, in the article, Politico explains how a DNC operative actually paid and Ukrainian government officials, they worked to aid the DNC and the Hillary Clinton campaign to hurt Donald Trump during the 2016 election. Now, the report details how this Democratic operative, who used to work in the Clinton White House, led this effort, even met with Ukrainian diplomats at the Ukrainian embassy to talk about ways to expose former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort and hurt the campaign. Now, this operative went on to describe those Ukrainian officials as being, quote, \"helpful\" when it came to finding leads to dig up information, dirt on Donald Trump and his campaign. Then there's this stunning quote, collusion, \"She occasionally shared her findings with officials from the DNC and the Clinton campaign.\" So this DNC operative, paid, was working with Ukraine, also sharing potentially damaging information with the DNC and Hillary Clinton's campaign. Then to top it all off, the DNC operative also said that she would give off-the-record information and guidance to, quote, \"a lot of journalists\" --- you know, those people that suck it all in -- who were trying to write stories about the Trump campaign and Paul Manafort. But maybe that's why the media doesn't want you, the American people, to know about this story. Now, were they complicit in this foreign plot to damage the Trump campaign? And here's another example that has been completely ignored. A congressional investigation found back in 2014 an Israeli political group used $300,000-plus taxpayer dollars from the Obama State Department in a grant to create a political apparatus. For what purpose? To try and defeat one of our closest allies, defeat the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in his latest reelection. And next is the media and the Democrats, you know, the ones that are so apoplectic over the idea of collusion. Why have they never reported any of these stories to you? Take a look. REP. MAXINE WATERS, D-CALIF., MAY 11, MSNBC: I told you that I thought there was a Kremlin plan and these were his allies. I had a resolution back in February that said it should be investigated for collusion. REP. ADAM SCHIFF, D-CALIF., MARCH 19, MSNBC: I would characterize it this way at the outset of the investigation. There is circumstantial evidence of collusion. SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER, D-N.Y., JULY 11: The claims of the administration for the last six months that collusion is not even on the table has been undone by the president's son's own words. JAKE TAPPER, CNN, JULY 11: This is evidence of willingness to commit collusion. UNIDENTIFIED MALE, NBC NEWS, MARCH 5: I think what it means is that a federal judge found that the people in Trump's organization were colluding with the Russians. MADDOW, MARCH 16, \"THE TONIGHT SHOW\"/NBC: What would change the world is if, you know, Russia was interfering in the election and they weren't doing it on their own and he was in on it."

And of course, I'm talking about the Uranium One deal, which the media never talks about. Here's how that went down. Now, during her tenure as secretary of state, Hillary Clinton approved the transfer of up to 20 percent of America's uranium, the foundational material for nuclear weapons. You know that thing? And anyway, that went to Vladimir Putin and the Russians! And guess what? The people who benefited from that deal, well, they kicked back, they poured as much as $145 million into the Clinton Foundation! And at the same time, Bill Clinton, like he always does trying to enrich himself further, he doubled his speaking fees in Moscow. Now, you don't have to connect the dots on this one because it's so obvious. That's pay-to-play. Actually, where I grew up, we call it bribery. Now, the Clintons stuffed their pockets while putting America's national security in jeopardy. That's almost as dumb as the uranium deal. And here's another example of misdirected outrage by the left -- Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, the media, all freaking out over fake news! They are fake news! Watch this. HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE, MAY 31: Voters who are being targeted with all of this false information are genuinely trying to make up their minds. They've got to help prevent fake news from creating a new reality that does influence how people, you know, think of themselves, see the world, the decisions that they make. THEN-PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA, NOV. 20, 2016: The general misinformation from all kinds of sources, both domestic, foreign, on social media, that make it very difficult for voters to figure out what's true and what's not. BRIAN STELTER, CNN SENIOR MEDIA CORRESPONDENT, NOV. 20, 2016: We are entering a terrible new age of information warfare. And it brings to mind that old adage, the first casualty of war is the truth."

      "utterance": "I said in 2008, journalism's dead. Nothing beats the media, the left in this country complaining about fake news, when pretty much every news organization has gotten it wrong when going after President Trump, and all of them had to issue corrections. And of course, they colluded back in the campaign and were exposed to basically working with the Clinton campaign. Remember that? Remember WikiLeaks? Anyway, and CNN is out on front on most of this stuff. Now, here's the most overlooked aspect of this crusade by the left. When fake news suits their purpose and their goals, they support it, they spread it, they propagandize. Now, check out this headline from The Washington Times. Quote, \"Democrats intentionally used disinformation from Russia to attack Trump in campaign ads.\" Other writers, well-known, Roland (ph) Scarborough, well respected -- he's talking about the fake, the discredited. Remember Christopher Steele, the dossier on Donald Trump? And he points out that Steele's dossier and sources included -- and I'm quoting -- \"a senior Russian foreign ministry figure,\" a top-level Russian intelligence officer, active inside the Kremlin, a senior Russian government official and a senior Kremlin official. So in other words, they were relying and they were spreading information directly sourced to the highest level of the Russian government. Now, instead of stopping all this and the foreign effort to interfere in our elections, well, the dossier was passed around for months and months and months, eventually published by BuzzFeed, routinely cited by Democrats, who repeated the false claims from the document to attack President Trump. Remember, that was about the Ritz-Carlton and hookers, and I won't go any further. Not to mention, it ended up in the hands of Senator John McCain. He gave it to the FBI. That led to an investigation. Then there's the group behind this phony dossier, Fusion GPS. As The New York Post has reported, it has several ties to the Democrats, including Clinton allies. So the double standard here is stunning, it's spectacular. And as we have seen time and time again, Democrats are willing to put their party and politics before anything else, even if it means lying to you! And in the case of Donald Trump Jr., he came on this program last night. He answered every tough question about the meeting. Well, isn't it now time for Hillary Clinton, the Democrats, the media, all these people, the Ukraine, those associated with the Ukraine, those in the DNC, to do the same? Now, here's why. We know the Democrats colluded with Ukraine. It's incontrovertible. We know that a DNC operative met with Ukrainian diplomats and shared information with the DNC and the Clinton campaign. We know that members of the Ukrainian government worked to undermine the Trump campaign, which eventually led to the removal of Paul Manafort when he was the campaign manager. That's all been proven. The questions we need answers to now -- what else took place? And in other words, how far do these people go? And what did Hillary Clinton know and when did she know it and was she directly involved? Now, this double standard, this hypocrisy is despicable, especially when you consider how the media in this country and the Democrats in this country for now almost 11 months have been freaking out nonstop, never-ending black helicopter tinfoil hat conspiracy theories that have been proven to be based on nothing, all while ignoring mountains of evidence in numerous cases that show real election interference and real Russian collusion and Ukrainian collusion! Joining us now, author of the number one New York Times bestseller, \"Understanding Trump,\" former speaker of the House Newt Gingrich. Mr. Speaker, good to see you."

I mean, they might have had in June if last year a 20-minute meeting. It's absurd! I've said several times now that this is actually much more like the famous play, \"The Crucible,\" which is about the witchcraft trials in Salem. I mean, you have is a news media elite which wakes up every morning saying, I know Trump did something terrible, I wonder what it was. And then they spend the whole day looking for an excuse to write a bombshell shocking story. I mean, I listened to some reporters this afternoon who were -- Sarah was - - Sanders was doing the briefing. And the one guy said, Look, now that we know that it's a hard fact that there was a meeting and that it involved collusion -- and this reporter is building an entire case that is totally false. And then he springs from that false case to an even more outrageous question. And that's what we're up against.

Let's review a couple things. You just mentioned the actual coordination and collusion between Ukrainian embassy officials and DNC officials. They actually used that information to try to hurt people on the Trump campaign. That's number one. Number two, Bill Clinton got a half-million dollars in speaking fees from a Russian bank and was personally thanked by Putin for that. Number three, Hillary Clinton allowed 20 percent of our uranium reserves to go to a Russian firm whose investors gave money to the Clinton Foundation. The Clinton campaign chairman's brother lobbied against sanctions on Russia and failed to disclose it. So you're talking about actual evidence, not conjecture. My other impression of your interview is that -- how refreshing to have someone take responsibility, be transparent and earnest, admit that maybe he would have done things differently. I think many people in last year's election should say that they would have done things differently. How about the people saying on election day Hillary Clinton had a 92 percent chance of winning Michigan. It turns out she had a zero percent chance. So many things could be done differently. The bottom line is, what came out of this 20 minute, brief meeting? Nothing helpful, nothing meaningful, nothing consequential. If that weren't true, there would have been immediate follow-up.

What you described with the Ukrainian embassy officials and the DNC, this Alexandra person, there was damage. They tried to hurt people and they did hurt people on the Trump campaign. So I'm glad you are raising that. No less than a New York Times reporter today tweeted about it, almost exactly what you are saying. Sarah Sangers mentioned it in her White House press briefing today. And this is important information. The biggest response I have heard from the media about that is, oh, but a different person won. You won, she lost. That does not erase the fact that people may have broken the law and that they colluded with foreign governments to try to damage people in the Trump campaign which by extension would damage Mr. Trump, at the time."

Rowan Scarborough, a very well renowned reporter, Washington Times, and he writes this piece today, Christopher Steele, he's the former British intel guy, he's the one that paid for a lot of the information that he got -- this is where the hooker Ritz story comes in, proven false, all of these things. But he actually says in his piece that Mr. Steele was paid by the Democratic funded opposition research group Fusion GPS with money from a Hillary Clinton backer. So if they are getting information from Russia in that particular case, or you could even add to that the Uranium One deal, she signs off, over $100 million kicked back to the Clinton Foundation. There's something so fundamentally wrong here in terms of fundamental fairness and the media. And at some point it seems like there's got to be more pushback and that these stories have got to also penetrate the consciousness of the American people."

I think people are looking for an alternative because in addition to there being sort of a myopic, lemming-like ants on a sugar cube mentality on this story by many in the media, there's just this culture of sameness. Everybody sounds the same. Do you realize that the president of the United States sat with the president of Russia less than a week ago for two hours and 15 minutes and yet we're talking about this and not that? Do you realize that you've got people in the media now between their lower third chyrons and what comes out of their mouth, they talk more about Russia than America? And thank you for talking about America so often. Do you realize that we basically will come out of this 20 minute brief meeting, same amount of information that comes out of some of these panels where six people are nodding their head at each other discussing the same thing, which is to say zero usable information. So I just want to review in case you run out of time. This is how we see it so far. This is to help all the people at home. What is the conclusion? Collusion, no. We don't have that yet. I see illusion and delusion."

To date they basically set out this Venus flytrap and though one day we will catch something eight months later. And yet we really appreciate the fact that, we being the American people, I have to say, appreciate the fact that Don Jr. released those emails, appeared on your show for all to see. Compare that to the hiding and the furtiveness that we saw all during the last campaign by the other side."

We'll talk about this double standard. Also Geraldo Rivera joins us. And later tonight, devastating news. Liberal Joe announces he's leaving the Republican Party.

We are not at war. It's so stupid for Senator Tim Kaine and others to say it. It's just not. They also say it's collusion. There is no collusion statute except in antitrust. There is one statute that says you can't conspire to obstruct a government function which would be an election. But that requires deceit and dishonesty, and taking information from a Russian lawyer isn't deceit and dishonesty. And finally, I listened this morning to this Democratic congressman saying it's a clear violation of campaign election laws. OK, which one? There isn't any."

This charged word, this conjuring up of someone knifing his nation in the back is what treason is. Treason is Benedict Arnold. Treason is selling your G.I.'s down the tube for money or for some other power. It reveals the shamelessness of their rooting for the 45th president to fail in office. I agree with Gregg's analysis. There is absolutely nothing illegal and what Donald Trump, Jr., did in taking this meeting. Collusion is not a crime. What is a crime is to hack. If the person got the information, they are guilty of a crime."

And also they largely ignore the Uranium One deal, which you pointed out in your opening monologue. Talk about a criminal quid pro quo. There's a plethora of evidence that she and Bill Clinton violated the law by using her office as secretary of state to her benefit in exchange for money.

Everything that he has ever said, anything that anyone associated with him during the campaign, during the transition, it will be gone over by his enemies with a fine tooth comb. To ask the public, or to ask the government to talk about Ukraine, to talk about uranium, they are not going to do it. This is like Watergate in the sense that everybody now is engaged. There are the president's defenders and they are numerically fewer than his attackers now. You have to stand like a rock and you have to defend it as it comes. That's what I set about Don Jr. --"

If you watch this show on a regular basis, you know that I am not a Republican. I am a registered conservative. However, my values, my views, and my viewpoints, they align more with the GOP, certainly more than the socialist Democratic Party. But Liberal Joe Scarborough is much, much different. A former Republican congressman from Florida's panhandle, moved to the northeast. He wanted to make it big. And now it's very clear, he wants to be loved and worshiped and idolized and adored and supported by all his liberal, arrogant, elitist friends in New York City, those people that are filling his head with visions of glory. Now, knowing Joe Scarborough, he thinks that he really could one day be the president of the United States. Yes, he believes it. But calling President Trump a schmuck, a goon, a thug, and mentally unfit, it wasn't enough to please all his liberal friends and colleagues and of course his blushing bride to be, Mika.
