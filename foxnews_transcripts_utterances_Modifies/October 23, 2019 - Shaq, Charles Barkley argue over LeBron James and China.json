GOP Congressmen stormed the impeachment breaches today, and they protest, of course, the Soviet-style proceedings being run by House Democrats. Well Jim Jordan, Steve Scalise, and Bradley Byrne take us inside the mayhem.  Also, as we keep hearing Hillary Clinton well floating for another Presidential run, her name, my “Angle” tonight asks why now, and who would benefit most? That's a little later on in the show.  Plus, the NBA China saga takes another unexpected turn. Some iconic directors take on superhero films. And does GQ actually understand masculinity anymore? Raymond Arroyo has it all in Seen and Unseen.  But first, to today's most dramatic story, Republican House Members, frustrated with the continued secrecy of the process, stormed the ultra- secure conference room or SCIF, during a closed-door impeachment hearing, in a call for transparency.",

So, when we walked in, he was confused. He's looking around and trying to figure out how he can throw us out. He wasn't going to throw us out. We weren't going to leave. We weren't there to disrupt anything. We just wanted to see what was going on.  But what's interesting is as soon as the lights were turned on, so to speak, Adam Schiff took the witness, and ran out of the room. What is Adam Schiff trying to hide in that room that 75 percent of the voting Members of Congress can't go in, can't have access to the documents, can't even read the transcripts? 75 percent, that's 230 million people being denied when they're trying to impeach a President of the United States behind closed doors in secret.

If you remember, the Mueller investigation was their idea, 22 months, 2,800 subpoenas. There was every kind of investigation you can imagine, and it yielded absolutely nothing. The President didn't do anything wrong. There was no collusion. There was no obstruction, and it crushed them. They thought that was going to be their basis for impeachment.  So, what did they do? They don't give up. They go on and looking for something else. This is a witch-hunt. They're meandering around, trying to find something, and the only way they can do it is not through a fair process, where both sides get to call witnesses, which has always been the case in impeachment. Adam Schiff is the Star Chamber, again Soviet-style, like you said. Your friend's going \"This isn't America,\" when only the Chairman gets to call the witnesses.

Well what are the chances that Hillary jumps into the 2020 race? \"It ain't zero. And does she think about it all the time? Absolutely.\" That's what one of Hillary's closest confidants told The Washington Post. Now, just a few months ago, I dismissed the idea of Hillary 2.0, kind of out of hand. She wouldn't be that arrogant and ungracious toward the current field, no way. But then the weakness of the Democrat slate surprised even me. Nothing's working. The walking, talking gaffematic machine known as Joe Biden may have dropped in the polls for a few weeks. But now, he's back on top. And what seems to be the grudging recognition that the other top candidates, Warren and Sanders, are just not going to cut it in key battleground states, where common sense still mean something. Now, Mrs. Clinton may also feel vindicated by the interestingly-timed release of an internal State Department report that somehow managed to exonerate her in the matter of email deletion and handling of classified information, although Hillary staffers, of course, they were faulted. The review certainly gives Mrs. Clinton cover. Plus, I mean who doesn't think that Hillary is a stronger candidate than that goofball Biden? To use one of his favorite phrases, \"Come on, man!\" Like I know what you're saying, you know, though, come on, isn't it too late? It's too late for Hillary. It's too late to get into this already crowded field. Well my answer is it's really up to the party. If the voters aren't jazzed by any of the likely frontrunners, they'd be stupid not to seriously consider another Clinton bid. She has instant name recognition, a massive fundraising apparatus that could be re-activated, and her old campaign team would quickly re- constitute, and key players exit other campaigns the moment she step back in. And let's face it. She's been to the Trump rodeo before, so she knows the show better than anyone. As another Hillary pal told The Washington Post, \"Her view is: I ran against this guy, I know how to do this.\" Another reason I think Hillary is inching toward a rerun is her penchant for dipping into the political conversation uninvited. Most recently, it was her gratuitous swipe at Tulsi Gabbard. While Bernie Sanders gently reproached Hillary for the smear, Elizabeth Warren just seemed nervous about the looming Clinton shadow.",

GOP Congressmen stormed the impeachment breaches today, and they protest, of course, the Soviet-style proceedings being run by House Democrats. Well Jim Jordan, Steve Scalise, and Bradley Byrne take us inside the mayhem. Also, as we keep hearing Hillary Clinton well floating for another Presidential run, her name, my “Angle” tonight asks why now, and who would benefit most? That's a little later on in the show. Plus, the NBA China saga takes another unexpected turn. Some iconic directors take on superhero films. And does GQ actually understand masculinity anymore? Raymond Arroyo has it all in Seen and Unseen. But first, to today's most dramatic story, Republican House Members, frustrated with the continued secrecy of the process, stormed the ultra- secure conference room or SCIF, during a closed-door impeachment hearing, in a call for transparency."

So, 435 Members of the House who represent over 300 million people in this great country, and only one Member of Congress, Adam Schiff knows who the whistleblower is, and who those more than half a dozen U.S. officials, who gave him the information that formed the basis of - of his complaint. Why don't we know? More importantly, why don't you know in the media? Why doesn't the American people know? Adam Schiff is doing this unfair partisan process in secret, and our Members finally said, \"Enough.\" We're - we're so frustrated. They reached a boiling point. And these guys marched in, and said, \"We want to know what's going on because we represent three-quarters of a million people back home in our districts, and they'd like to know what's going on, because you guys are trying to take out a President 13 months before an election.\" That's what happened."

When we walked into the room, it was interesting because they hadn't started the meeting yet, but they were getting ready to. Adam Schiff himself, the Chairman of the Committee, admitted that was not a classified briefing. And so, why were Members, by the way, Members of Congress, shut out from the meeting? So, when we walked in, he was confused. He's looking around and trying to figure out how he can throw us out. He wasn't going to throw us out. We weren't going to leave. We weren't there to disrupt anything. We just wanted to see what was going on. But what's interesting is as soon as the lights were turned on, so to speak, Adam Schiff took the witness, and ran out of the room. What is Adam Schiff trying to hide in that room that 75 percent of the voting Members of Congress can't go in, can't have access to the documents, can't even read the transcripts? 75 percent, that's 230 million people being denied when they're trying to impeach a President of the United States behind closed doors in secret. It's never happened before. We're going to call him out on it. We're going to keep calling him out on it. And let the public see sunshine is the best disinfectant to what is rotten to the core.

If you remember, the Mueller investigation was their idea, 22 months, 2,800 subpoenas. There was every kind of investigation you can imagine, and it yielded absolutely nothing. The President didn't do anything wrong. There was no collusion. There was no obstruction, and it crushed them. They thought that was going to be their basis for impeachment. So, what did they do? They don't give up. They go on and looking for something else. This is a witch-hunt. They're meandering around, trying to find something, and the only way they can do it is not through a fair process, where both sides get to call witnesses, which has always been the case in impeachment. Adam Schiff is the Star Chamber, again Soviet-style, like you said. Your friend's going \"This isn't America,\" when only the Chairman gets to call the witnesses. They don't even let the President have legal counsel. And they're using this as the basis to impeach the President of the United States."

Exhibit A, The New York Times reporting, as I just mentioned, \"Ukraine knew of aid freeze by early August, undermining Trump defense.\" But buried in a story was this interesting and exonerating fact. \"The communications did not explicitly link the assistance freeze to the push by Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani for the investigations.\" Then the AP came out with this on a May 7th meeting in Kiev with the headline \"Ukrainian leader felt Trump pressure before taking office.\" But the article provides no evidence of a quid pro quo.

Hochstein is a former diplomat who advised Biden on Ukraine matters during the Obama administration.\" Gee! I wonder who gave him all this stuff for the article. Here now to connect all the dots, Tom Fitton, President of Judicial Watch, Bob Barr, former Clinton Impeachment Prosecutor. All right, guys.

They were shoveling classified information to the Democrats, in the House and the Senate, to undermine Trump. The State Department bureaucracy was literally helping Christopher Steele write the dossier and send it over to the Justice Department. And then, to this day, that whole gang is defending Hillary Clinton. We're just still fighting with them to get basic information about the cover-up. So, as the State Department is protecting Hillary Clinton, covering up her illegal activity, they're doing their darndest to undermine the President of the United States.

      "utterance": "Well Host Judy Woodruff noted via Twitter that Clinton claims she was joking. But remember, we're talking about the Clintons, so the truth is always a bit elusive. Well what are the chances that Hillary jumps into the 2020 race? \"It ain't zero. And does she think about it all the time? Absolutely.\" That's what one of Hillary's closest confidants told The Washington Post. Now, just a few months ago, I dismissed the idea of Hillary 2.0, kind of out of hand. She wouldn't be that arrogant and ungracious toward the current field, no way. But then the weakness of the Democrat slate surprised even me. Nothing's working. The walking, talking gaffematic machine known as Joe Biden may have dropped in the polls for a few weeks. But now, he's back on top. And what seems to be the grudging recognition that the other top candidates, Warren and Sanders, are just not going to cut it in key battleground states, where common sense still mean something. Now, Mrs. Clinton may also feel vindicated by the interestingly-timed release of an internal State Department report that somehow managed to exonerate her in the matter of email deletion and handling of classified information, although Hillary staffers, of course, they were faulted. The review certainly gives Mrs. Clinton cover. Plus, I mean who doesn't think that Hillary is a stronger candidate than that goofball Biden? To use one of his favorite phrases, \"Come on, man!\" Like I know what you're saying, you know, though, come on, isn't it too late? It's too late for Hillary. It's too late to get into this already crowded field. Well my answer is it's really up to the party. If the voters aren't jazzed by any of the likely frontrunners, they'd be stupid not to seriously consider another Clinton bid. She has instant name recognition, a massive fundraising apparatus that could be re-activated, and her old campaign team would quickly re- constitute, and key players exit other campaigns the moment she step back in. And let's face it. She's been to the Trump rodeo before, so she knows the show better than anyone. As another Hillary pal told The Washington Post, \"Her view is: I ran against this guy, I know how to do this.\" Another reason I think Hillary is inching toward a rerun is her penchant for dipping into the political conversation uninvited. Most recently, it was her gratuitous swipe at Tulsi Gabbard. While Bernie Sanders gently reproached Hillary for the smear, Elizabeth Warren just seemed nervous about the looming Clinton shadow."

And just think, you'll finally, Mrs. Clinton, be able to make history as the first female President of the United States. Don't let the dream die. America is calling you. History is calling you.

You don't think this group would rather go back to the good old days of Clinton again and kiss this entire America First era goodbye? So there you have it, a combination of Hillary's pride, her desire for revenge, a weak Democratic field, and a consultancy class that can sell sand in the desert may be pointing us towards another Trump/Clinton face- off.
