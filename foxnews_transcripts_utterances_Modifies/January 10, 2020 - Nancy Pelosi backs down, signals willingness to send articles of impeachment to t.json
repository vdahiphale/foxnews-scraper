That is the only time I can criticize her for drinking for the whole year. So, I seize on that opportunity and say, my God, look at you. Look at you. Because she does that to me almost once a week. So, it's a -- this is the point. That Trump with this war like behavior is so rare that the media has to jump for it and scream bloody murder. And the problem that they have is they are currently living in the prism of two ideas. It's either nothing or war. Right? We do nothing or it's World War III. That's how they see it.

This is a new chapter on their on-going war against us for the last 40 years. And we, and the globe, have been bullied frankly and to treating them like a country and they're not. It's a cause. It has been a cause this entire time. They don't deserve the respect or the adherence to structure that countries do because that's not them. And you know, people argue and the Democrats have been saying this is the escalation. No, no, no. The escalation came from Iran with their steady and increased targeted attacks on us and oil production fields and the loss of American life. Exactly. We exercise restraint by not responding in kind especially after that drone attack. And you know, when you talk about the battle for information, absolutely that that should always be something -- we should always expect that our intelligence community is being forthright. But I also think the arguments have been both ways in that. Up until now the intelligence community is infallible, right? With the Mueller report?

So, think about that. So, he is the most anti-war leader in four decades. So that explains the hysterical response that you're seeing in the media because they have to capitalize on it because it's a rare event. It doesn't happen very often. So, this is your chance to take your shot. It reminds me -- may I use an analogy -- of when once in a while, maybe once a year my wife might get a little tipsy. That is the only time I can criticize her for drinking for the whole year. So, I seize on that opportunity and say, my God, look at you. Look at you. Because she does that to me almost once a week. So, it's a -- this is the point. That Trump with this war like behavior is so rare that the media has to jump for it and scream bloody murder. And the problem that they have is they are currently living in the prism of two ideas. It's either nothing or war. Right? We do nothing or it's World War III. That's how they see it. Now if that were the case, it would be slaves or Genghis Khan. But Trump, like a sensible person, he operates in the turf between those two prisms and finds a decisive action that creates a positive outcome that is incredibly non-war-like."

Which is, refrain from responding in kind with the defensive, decisive actions for fear of more terroristic actions. Look, this isn't a new war on Iran. This is a new chapter on their on-going war against us for the last 40 years. And we, and the globe, have been bullied frankly and to treating them like a country and they're not. It's a cause. It has been a cause this entire time. They don't deserve the respect or the adherence to structure that countries do because that's not them. And you know, people argue and the Democrats have been saying this is the escalation. No, no, no. The escalation came from Iran with their steady and increased targeted attacks on us and oil production fields and the loss of American life. Exactly. We exercise restraint by not responding in kind especially after that drone attack. And you know, when you talk about the battle for information, absolutely that that should always be something -- we should always expect that our intelligence community is being forthright. But I also think the arguments have been both ways in that. Up until now the intelligence community is infallible, right? With the Mueller report? And then all of sudden why now with Iran when they should trust them to be one step ahead. All of a sudden, they've called into question and now that ascendency of escalation is all of a sudden no, no, no, it's us that escalated it?"

      "speaker": "WATTERS",

There was a missile that we took -- a missile of ours that took down a civilian plane and we claimed responsibility right after that in 1988. So, this is a tragic situation.

One is they made President Trump wait and they prose attention to fall on moderate Republicans in the Senate with regard to whether or not they will support the idea of bringing people like John Bolton who had firsthand knowledge of what took place before them. And, also, I think, you know, if you saw the president last night at the rally, I don't think that he is jumping up and down and screaming about pencil neck -- how crazy. If he wasn't worried about impeachment. He doesn't like being impeached. He thinks this is a big asterisk on his presidency and a negative going into reelection."

I told the Democrats here on this show. I said this. You know how the movie is going to end. He's not getting impeached. His numbers are going to go up and your numbers are going to go down. And that's exactly what happened but they didn't listen. Because their emotional framework prevented them from seeing the facts. Now the Democrats are like Iran. Right? They need operation saving face to get out of a mess that that created. Right.

But Trey Gowdy he has a great point. That the strategy, first of all, it's totally transparent and obviously an impeachment won't work. But the strategy is to neuter the second term which were his language, right? So, to prevent any type of judicial appointments, the SCOTUS justice appointment. And I think the embodiment of how transparent the strategy was on the left is congressman Adam Smith yesterday, he is the twelfth-term member, he is the chair of the House Armed Services Committee and he went on CNN and was like, yes, it's time to pass along the articles of impeachment. Immediately issued a retraction. I'm sorry, I misspoke. Clearly, Pelosi called him. Get in line. The lemmings are so obvious.

It's the 75th anniversary of Iwo Jim. And if one thing is accomplished from this, that it makes people look back and remember these heroes, these stories, the importance of it, to pass these stories on to your children. It all started because I have letters that were written by my uncle who was killed there at the age of 18. And these letters have been moving to me my whole life. And through this journey, I actually found two of the men who were by his side when he was killed. So it's just been an extraordinary experience for me and I hope that you will enjoy it too."
