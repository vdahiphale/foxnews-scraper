In the memo, the lawyers argue the president cannot be compelled to testify and cannot obstruct justice because he has authority over all federal investigations. And new lead lawyer Rudy Giuliani tells ABC News: If Mueller tries to subpoena us, we're going to court.   Joining us now from Manchester, New Hampshire, President Trump's first campaign manager and current advisor, Corey Lewandowski. Corey, is that the president's view that he could not be compelled to testify and that he cannot, as the president, obstruct justice?",

Now, what they are trying to do, Chris, is they are trying to sit down and figure out if the president is going to sit down for an interview and that interview is going to be based on a narrow scope of questions that the team is trying to negotiate right now. What Rudy Giuliani has said as the president's attorney is if the Mueller investigators decide to subpoena this president, they will take it to court and I believe the court is going to be on the president's side on this.",

So, there's the potential to avoid the subpoena entirely if the teams can work together and determined that the questions that will be asked will be relevant to an investigation to prove once and for all there was no collusion.  And it sounds like what Giuliani and his team are saying is, you don't need to subpoena route, but if you do, we will fight it in court. The president has been very clear.

But what they're doing is, Chris, there is a way to avoid all of this. There's a way to avoid a potential constitutional issue on this, which is working with Mayor Giuliani and his legal team and the Mueller investigators. If they can come up to a resolution which is going to ask the president to sit down and have a conversation which is limited in scope, present the interrogatories, then the team will decide if the president is willing to do this.  But, Chris, at the end of the day, what the Mueller investigators can do is they can write a report to Congress and to the Justice Department and show that there was no collusion between the president and the Russians and that's where we are. So, if the president is asked to sit down and discuss this, he's going to say exactly that because I know what to be true, you know it to be true, and the American people know there was no collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians.",

And another part of it basically says the president has the ability to pardon anybody he wants. I want to look back at that because the president has been busy with his pardoning this week. He pardoned Dinesh D'Souza, a conservative author, this week, going around the normal process of going to the Justice Department, the Office of Pardon Attorney, he did it unilaterally. He says he may pardoned Martha Stewart. He may pardon former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich.

And so, people want to make this a political issue. The pardoning of Dinesh D'Souza was a one-off, but this president has pardoned I think 0.7 percent of the applicants in front of him, which is a far lower number than any previous president at this point.  And so, look, is he going to pardon the Marc Riches of the world like the Clintons did? Of course not, right?

I don't know -- I had never met Dinesh D'Souza, so I don't think it was a strong relationship between the president and him.  But if you look in that particular case, saw an injustice that was done, which, by the way, Chris, was selective enforcement by the previous administration for a campaign finance violation, the same exact finance violation I think Roseanne Barr has admitted to, giving too much money to candidates and we haven't seen the prosecution of her for that. And so, the president pardoned Dinesh D'Souza on a one-off opportunity.

Because I can tell you I never spoke to anyone from the FBI as the campaign manager for 18 months of that campaign. Never did they notify me of their concerns about potential Russian meddling. Never did they notify me or anybody else while I was there of a potential spy entering the campaign. Never did they notify anybody that I'm aware of that they have those concerns, and what is more disturbing to me is there was only one campaign that was involved in the general election that took $5 million, went out and hired a former spy to go create a false dossier to spy on American citizens and that was the Clinton campaign and it doesn't sound like they were so concerned that they put a spy into that campaign.  So, this looks like potentially selective enforcement if this took place and if it did take place, Chris, there had better be accountability for sending us spy. Now, Clapper says that's not the term we use anymore and Brennan says we don't use the term spy. You call it what you want, when you have a paid government informant who made a lot of money trying to solicit information from a presidential campaign without notifying that campaign, that's called spying.",

We begin with breaking news. \"The New York Times\" is the first to report a story that President Trump's legal team sent a memo to special counsel Robert Mueller in January accreting broad presidential powers. In the memo, the lawyers argue the president cannot be compelled to testify and cannot obstruct justice because he has authority over all federal investigations. And new lead lawyer Rudy Giuliani tells ABC News: If Mueller tries to subpoena us, we're going to court. Joining us now from Manchester, New Hampshire, President Trump's first campaign manager and current advisor, Corey Lewandowski. Corey, is that the president's view that he could not be compelled to testify and that he cannot, as the president, obstruct justice?"

      "speaker": "COREY LEWANDOWSKI, FORMER TRUMP CAMPAIGN MANAGER",
      "utterance": "Well, Chris, I think -- look, I'm not an attorney, so I want to be very clear about this. But what this memo outlines and what their team has said was if the Mueller team is going to potentially subpoena the president, that is something that they believe is not authorized because of his position. Now, what they are trying to do, Chris, is they are trying to sit down and figure out if the president is going to sit down for an interview and that interview is going to be based on a narrow scope of questions that the team is trying to negotiate right now. What Rudy Giuliani has said as the president's attorney is if the Mueller investigators decide to subpoena this president, they will take it to court and I believe the court is going to be on the president's side on this."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "But -- and this specific issue has never been adjudicated but there was a long history of the courts ordering presidents to do something and presidents agreeing to do it. A subpoena is a court order. Thomas Jefferson had to bow to a court order. Richard Nixon had to bow to the Supreme Court in releasing the Watergate tapes. Bill Clinton had to bow to the Supreme Court when it came to testifying in the Paula Jones civil suit."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LEWANDOWSKI",
      "utterance": "Well, that's exactly right. But you have to remember, look, the Giuliani legal team is trying to negotiate with the Mueller team to decide if it's the right thing to sit down and have this interview and if so, they want to understand what the scope of the questions are. So, there's the potential to avoid the subpoena entirely if the teams can work together and determined that the questions that will be asked will be relevant to an investigation to prove once and for all there was no collusion. And it sounds like what Giuliani and his team are saying is, you don't need to subpoena route, but if you do, we will fight it in court. The president has been very clear. He has offered to sit down with the Mueller investigators but he has said and the Giuliani team has said this, they want to understand what the scope of questions are going to be before they sit down and do that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "I want to just try to narrow this down a little bit. Mueller says -- rather Giuliani says if Mueller gets a subpoena, which is a court order, Giuliani and the president's legal team are going to go to court. What if the court says no, Mr. President, you are wrong. Is the president prepared under his understanding of his powers in the executive branch, is he prepared to defy a court order?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LEWANDOWSKI",
      "utterance": "Look, I don't think so and I haven't spoken to the president about it. That's a question for his legal team, but I think the president clearly respects the rule of law in the country. There's no question about that. But what they're doing is, Chris, there is a way to avoid all of this. There's a way to avoid a potential constitutional issue on this, which is working with Mayor Giuliani and his legal team and the Mueller investigators. If they can come up to a resolution which is going to ask the president to sit down and have a conversation which is limited in scope, present the interrogatories, then the team will decide if the president is willing to do this. But, Chris, at the end of the day, what the Mueller investigators can do is they can write a report to Congress and to the Justice Department and show that there was no collusion between the president and the Russians and that's where we are. So, if the president is asked to sit down and discuss this, he's going to say exactly that because I know what to be true, you know it to be true, and the American people know there was no collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "I want to talk about another part of the memo and we again should point out -- this was a memo that was written by the president's former legal team in January, including John Dowd, was sent to Mueller. Rudy Giuliani was not part of that, but as the president's lead lawyer, he is embracing that January memo. And another part of it basically says the president has the ability to pardon anybody he wants. I want to look back at that because the president has been busy with his pardoning this week. He pardoned Dinesh D'Souza, a conservative author, this week, going around the normal process of going to the Justice Department, the Office of Pardon Attorney, he did it unilaterally. He says he may pardoned Martha Stewart. He may pardon former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich. The top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee said even before these latest pardons, that he's off pattern. Here he is."

      "utterance": "And long-time Trump advisor, Roger Stone, said this: It has to be a signal to Mike Flynn and Paul Manafort and even Robert Mueller, indict people for crimes that don't pertain to Russian collusion and that is what could happen.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "LEWANDOWSKI",
      "utterance": "Well, Chris, the Constitution is very clear in the power of the president as defined by the Constitution allows him to pardon anybody he wants for federal crimes and no one is talking about the pardon of the heavyweight boxing champion Jack Johnson that he pardoned, something the Obama administration had the opportunity to do and others but chose not to. And so, people want to make this a political issue. The pardoning of Dinesh D'Souza was a one-off, but this president has pardoned I think 0.7 percent of the applicants in front of him, which is a far lower number than any previous president at this point. And so, look, is he going to pardon the Marc Riches of the world like the Clintons did? Of course not, right? Those are personal friends of the president back then who had crimes committed against our government that were convicted and they were pardoned for political expediency --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "But, Corey, if he were to pardon -- I got to emphasize if -- he were to pardoned Michael Flynn, or Paul Manafort, people that could conceivably give evidence against him, that's a lot worse than Marc Rich."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LEWANDOWSKI",
      "utterance": "Yes, but, Chris, there's absolutely no evidence whatsoever that the president has ever discussed having a pardon for Mike Flynn or Paul Manafort or anybody else for that matter. And with all due respect to Roger Stone, I don't think he has any idea what he's talking about. This is not a sign. Look, I don't know of the president's relationship with Dinesh D'Souza. I don't know -- I had never met Dinesh D'Souza, so I don't think it was a strong relationship between the president and him. But if you look in that particular case, saw an injustice that was done, which, by the way, Chris, was selective enforcement by the previous administration for a campaign finance violation, the same exact finance violation I think Roseanne Barr has admitted to, giving too much money to candidates and we haven't seen the prosecution of her for that. And so, the president pardoned Dinesh D'Souza on a one-off opportunity. But never, ever, ever has this president said, to the best of my knowledge, he's even thinking about pardoning for Mike Flynn or Paul Manafort or anybody else with him."

Let's turn to spygate, the allegation by you and others and, of course, by President Trump that the FBI inserted a spy into the campaign. Here's what President Trump said and also what Republican Congressman Trey Gowdy said after he got a classified briefing from the Justice Department and the FBI."

      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "Corey, that's Trey Gowdy. He's a conservative Republican. He led the Benghazi investigation and he is undercutting what the president and frankly people like you talk about when you discuss spygate."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LEWANDOWSKI",
      "utterance": "Well, Chris, I'm very concerned. What we don't know unequivocally is did the FBI taken in form and it put them inside the campaign? Because I can tell you I never spoke to anyone from the FBI as the campaign manager for 18 months of that campaign. Never did they notify me of their concerns about potential Russian meddling. Never did they notify me or anybody else while I was there of a potential spy entering the campaign. Never did they notify anybody that I'm aware of that they have those concerns, and what is more disturbing to me is there was only one campaign that was involved in the general election that took $5 million, went out and hired a former spy to go create a false dossier to spy on American citizens and that was the Clinton campaign and it doesn't sound like they were so concerned that they put a spy into that campaign. So, this looks like potentially selective enforcement if this took place and if it did take place, Chris, there had better be accountability for sending us spy. Now, Clapper says that's not the term we use anymore and Brennan says we don't use the term spy. You call it what you want, when you have a paid government informant who made a lot of money trying to solicit information from a presidential campaign without notifying that campaign, that's called spying."
    },

      "speaker": "LEWANDOWSKI",
      "utterance": "Chris, it's a clear reminder to the American people of what happens if the Democrats take control of the House of Representatives and Nancy Pelosi becomes the next speaker. Not one Democratic member of the House or the Senate voted for the historic tax cuts. This president tried to negotiate to get money for the wall and take care of the people that came to this country through no fault of their own and the Democrats didn't want to do it because they want to politicize it. So, this president has to remind the American people of what is at stake in the 2018 election and that is moving our country in the same direction, which is the lowest unemployment for African-Americans and Hispanics ever recorded, or going back to the ways of more money in taxes and increasing your taxes under what would be speaker Pelosi. It's a clear dichotomy and I think the president is on the right track."

FOX News senior political analyst Brit Hume, columnist for \"The Hill\", Juan Williams, and the co-host \"Benson and Harf\", and we have them both, on FOX News Radio, Marie Harf and the aforementioned Guy Benson. Al right. So, Brit, the Roseanne Barr comment clearly hateful but I think you could argue that while the remark by Samantha Bee may not have been more hateful, the circumstances about it were even more disturbing because it was scripted, it was taped and it was run hours later by TBS. Your thoughts about all of this?"

But if you're trying to think of something to say about a woman that would be worse than what she said, the use of the C-word, which I would say is second only to the N- word, the ugliest words in the temporary parlance, you couldn't do any better than what you said. I mean, it was misogynistic, it reduces a woman to a body part. You know, this is a comment someone derived as hate speech and sexist. So, I think the two remarks were basically on par and what's not on par was the disparate treatment by ABC News towards Barr and by TBS toward Samantha Bee.

TBS, the only thing they've said publicly about this is applauding Samantha Bee for apologizing for something that she shouldn't have said. And while Roseanne Barr, her tweet was totally unacceptable and racist, it was a tweet in the middle of the night.

Your thoughts about it?"

The question whether he would have to answer process, that's to say respond to a subpoena I think is another. We do know that the Supreme Court has ruled that Richard Nixon had to produce material evidence which he ultimately did. Whether that would -- whether that would extend to sitting for an interview or being called before a grand jury has never been fully adjudicated, but I think the president may be on not as strong ground there -- his legal team may be not as on strong ground there arguing."

If we charge a country zero to sell their goods and they charge us 25, 50, even 100 percent to sell hours, it is unfair and can no longer be tolerated. It's not free or fair trade, it is stupid trade. An example the White House is pond of offering is that of the auto sector where China charges 25 percent on U.S. cars sold there, the E.U. 10 percent, while the U.S. charges just 2.5 percent in return. The Trump administration has already hit Canada, Mexico and the E.U. with 25 percent's tariffs on steel and 10 percent on aluminum, saying it's in the interest of national security, a notion that left our neighbors to the north gobsmacked."

Everything's on the table during the negotiations. But you can't expect -- you're not going to change Rome in a day. And I think that's a very realistic attitude. The key point is that we're sitting down. And the second key point is that the president has been bolder on this and Korea, and, by the way, on world trade than any other recent president.

I think there was a moment a week or ten days back when the president was concerned about that Chinese sanctions. They seem to have said, no, no, wait a minute, we're still hanging tough. This is tough economic pressure. I think economic sanctions work. I think the president's whole attitude of toughness with respect to North Korea -- and people yelled at him or said this -- now you're too strong, you're saber rattling. Everything's on the table, including military action. That stuff works over a period of time. Now, as we head into the negotiations, I think the president is being very realistic and it's going to take a period of time. I don't think we're going to let up on any of these matters.

Could be Brazil. Could be a lot of different places. The trans shipping effort is something that has been troubling to us. Look, the president has declared our steel industry a national security matter and he hopes through these actions to rebuild it. There's some early signs that that may be possible. But, look, in the communique, in the announcement from the White House, it said very clearly that we still welcome good faith negotiations, and that's why I regard this as more of a family quarrel. This is -- this is a trade dispute, if you will. It can be solved if people work together. But -- but, but, but, Chris, I must say this, this president, from day one, wants to reform the world trading system. It is not working. And there is so much unfair trading and illegal trading practices. There is virtually no reciprocity here. Tariff rates are not equal. Nontariff barriers are not equal. The World Trade Organization, which sets these rules, has been totally ineffectual. It has, in some cases, damaged the American economy, damaged American workers in manufacturing and other businesses. So the president's stepped up to the plate here. And as somebody who is a free trader, I've got to say, if you don't have a level playing field, you can't operate free trade."

Let me put the timeline up on the screen. President Trump first threatened to impose these tariffs on March 1st. This week's action comes after more than a month of negotiation. The E.U. is now imposing tariffs on $3 billion of U.S. goods, Canada on $13 billion of U.S. imports. And, for all of the talk of protecting American jobs, the United Steelworkers Union opposes putting tariffs on Canada, saying that there metal exports to the U.S. are, quote, fairly traded. This isn't the beginning of a family squabble. The family has broken up and has gone into separate rooms."

No one said they can't. Whether they will be, I don't know. But, again, the president's vision here, and it's very important, he's a trade reformer. And, at the end of the day, he would love to see free trade. But these barriers have to be swept away. Unfair trading practices, illegal trading practices, places like China, which are (INAUDIBLE) possible --"

And there are other issues with respect to Canadian-U.S. trade discussions. Other very difficult issues. The president himself has raised the issue of intellectual property and dairy and farming and agriculture, which is very important to our farm folks. So it may be -- it may be worked out. These tariffs may go on for a while or they may not. I don't want many predictions today on the program. I'm just saying, let's talk it through.

      "utterance": "Well, the strong (ph) men (ph) thought that for the president of the United States to sit down with some rogue dictator would confer legitimacy on that person and was therefore not a good idea to do unless it's in exchange for something worthy. But there's a view in this administration, and we don't know if it's right yet, that something really is different with the North Koreans this time. Well, we'll find out. I think the president's seeming eagerness for all of this to go forward is a little troubling because it may look like he wants the deal to badly, which weakens your position. At the same time, though, he does appear to be prepared for the fact that there's not going to be some -- it will not be some staggering breakthrough in this first round of discussions and that it could lead to a long process, which is a realistic way to look at it. And that's what you hope for in a negotiation like this, is that the president has realistic expectations with Mr. Trump from time to time seems not to."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Well, no, if you put it in those terms, Chris. But the -- but Brit makes the wise point, which is you -- you know, you hope that this process leads somewhere. You hope that the administration's faith is rewarded in the end. The problem is that we know historically going back to Kim Jong-un's grandfather, Bill Clinton and Kim Jong-un -- Kim Jong-il in 1994, these people lie, they're deceitful, they'll take the concessions, they'll keep them in their pocket and then they won't deliver. So it looks like the president, President Trump, is saying, well, maybe we can end the Korean War. That will be the big announcement at the summit. Or maybe we can say that we are lessening sanctions in the hope. But that seems like a lengthy process and it does not seem to justify rewarding a brutal dictator with a -- with a position on the international stage."

So I think it is telling and unfortunate from the administration's perspective that you had this lengthy back-and-forth with Larry Kudlow moments ago and the amazing jobs report and state of the U.S. economy almost felt like an afterthought because we are discussing whether or not we should move forward with tariffs against some of our closest friends, which will throw a wet blanket over the positive movement that I think is attributed to Trump policies on deregulation and taxes and so forth. This is a totally needless fight."

    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "Marie, let me pick up on that with you because, you know, international trade is not checkers. It's three-dimensional chess. And you've now got China, as we impose tariffs on some of our allies, China is now reaching out to them and saying, well, you can do business with us and we're going to remove some of the barriers to our markets. MARIE HARF, CO-HOST, \"BENSON & HARF\": Right. We have not put tariffs on more of our allies than we have on China. And the president, I think, sees foreign affairs really as zero sum. There's winners and losers and he doesn't often talk about things that are mutually beneficial. Whether it's trade or whether it's diplomacy, he's really good at tearing things down. He ripped up TPP. He's trying to wrap up NAFTA."

    {
      "speaker": "HARF",
      "utterance": "Yes, the trade deal. He's trying to -- he walked away from the Paris agreement. He walked away from the Iran deal, all in the hopes, he says, that he can negotiate better deals, whether it's on trade or nuclear weapons. So far he's been good at ripping things up and not very good at building things back up or putting new agreements in place. And so that's what will be interesting. As we look at tariffs and trade, as we look at NAFTA, which the Canadians are very upset about, or if we look at North Korean diplomacy, whether he can actually make deals or just tear them up. That is an open question today."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "And what -- I want to pick up on the last thing I discussed with Larry Kudlow, Brit, and that was these astonishing job numbers. Lowest unemployment rate since the '60s in one case, the '50s in another case. Could that be derailed if we get into a trade -- a serious trade dispute, let alone war?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HUME",
      "utterance": "Certainly could. And there's no doubt in my mind that the president, in -- in -- in putting his tariffs in place, the ones just announced against our -- our European friends is playing with fire. They -- they will retaliate and the -- all the parade of horribles may come into being. However, I would caution on that, that this -- I think the president sees all this as a continued negotiation. The troubling thing is, we've been negotiating with some of these countries for some time now in hopes of a better deal and it hasn't materialized. So we'll -- there's a way to go. It's kind of the corollary to foreign policy where you practice diplomacy backed up by the threat of force. Here we're practicing trade negotiations backed up by the threat of tariffs. But tariffs, in and of themselves, are almost always ruinous to both sides, to all sides."
