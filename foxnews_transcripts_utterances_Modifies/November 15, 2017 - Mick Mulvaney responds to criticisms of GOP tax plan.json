Politico, reporting that during the president's trip to Asia he received an urgent call from the Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell urging that he help, jump in, and try to push Moore out of the race. But so far, the president, steering clear of this race altogether. McConnell today saying flatly: if Moore wins on December 12th and then is sworn in, he would face an immediate investigation by the ethics committee that could lead to his expulsion from the Senate Chamber. The majority leader also, again, floated the idea: the party should rally around Attorney General Jeff Sessions as a ride-in candidate. Though, so far, the former senator has shot down the idea he even wants his old seat. More importantly, Moore is showing zero signs of getting out and is doubling down on new threats of potential legal action against media organizations like the Alabama media group that have published allegations of sexual misconduct. The candidate firing off a letter calling this libel, slander, and fraud. Moore painting himself as a man taking on the swamp this afternoon in a tweet.   \"The Republicans and Democrats who did everything they could to stop Donald Trump and elect Hillary Clinton are the very same people who are now trying to take us down with lies and smears,\" that from Moore. Then, his campaign sent a lawyer out, late this afternoon, to suggest the evidence presented by one female accuser last week that Moore signed her high school yearbook might turn out to be a fraud.",

For years, many dismissed her story and the stories of the other accusers. But this week, the tide began to change. Michelle Goldberg wrote a New York Times op-ed titled, \"I Believe Juanita,\" which prompted this from Juanita Broaddrick. Hell has definitely frozen over.

Here's part of what I wrote. Mr. Horsey has no idea what it is like to be part of this network. We work hard, we get our stories right, and we are proud of what we do and the success that we have achieved. We are experienced journalists and reporters. Most of us have been added for a long time. Between us, we worked at all the networks, and most of the prominent newspapers and publications. We are proud that our lineup as he put it is stocked as he put it, but not blonde Barbie dolls, but some of the sharpest, brightest women in the business. Our success is not about hair color or skirts, it is about elbow grease, dedication, and sacrificing time with our families and friends. We are fine with that. It goes with the territory. We live in scary times, though, as evidenced by Mr. Horsey's column. A society where divisiveness leads to crassness that seems to feel it is justified by political bent. Is that really who we want to be? Is that what our nation was built on? Is there a level of respect we could consider the starting point for debate or judgment? Let's hope so. And let's hope with all that's going on in this country with regard to sexism and harassment that we can move to that place of mutual respect. You can read my full piece on Facebook or Twitter.

Though, so far, the former senator has shot down the idea he even wants his old seat. More importantly, Moore is showing zero signs of getting out and is doubling down on new threats of potential legal action against media organizations like the Alabama media group that have published allegations of sexual misconduct. The candidate firing off a letter calling this libel, slander, and fraud. Moore painting himself as a man taking on the swamp this afternoon in a tweet. \"The Republicans and Democrats who did everything they could to stop Donald Trump and elect Hillary Clinton are the very same people who are now trying to take us down with lies and smears,\" that from Moore.

So, I expect as well to see the White House come out, especially now that the entirety of the Republican leadership has come against him. I think that he will make some kind of wishy-washy statement about it to say the truth of the matter is that no matter what happened 40 years ago, Roy Moore will not be able to work in the Senate, we will not be able to pass my agenda, we need this for the American public, we need tax breaks, we need, you know, more affordable health care, or whatever another talking point he's going to use, and try to shy away from calling all the people who still support Roy Moore, \"deplorable,\" as it were.

But at the same time, also sending a signal to Jeff Sessions that, you know, Republicans in the Senate would love to have you back. But I still find -- it might be a little bit kind of clever, too clever by half, and I find it sort of unlikely that Jeff Sessions is going to sort of embark on some kind of venture like that.

What Congressman Duffy said, though, is right. This is muddying the waters and it's muddying the waters in a moment when the president of the United States is still acting in ways that are totally and explicable as it relates to the president of Russia. He is acting like Neville Chamberlain in the face of Vladimir Putin.

The only collusion that we've seen is between Hillary Clinton on the Russians. And by the way, with the FBI, it's concerning that you have this sleazy dossier that James Comey hasn't verified and goes and briefs then-President elected Donald Trump and has it leaked to the media, giving credibility to the sleazy dossier, which in the end gives us this investigation of President Trump. This whole thing -- again, it reeks to high heaven, and I think we need a special counsel to actually take a look at what actually happened, not just with the dossier but also what happened with Uranium One, what happened with the Clinton Foundation.

He's the guy that led the fight against the Sandy relief money that through to New York, he never supported the 9/11 health care bill for New York, and now he seems to use every opportunity to take shots at New York.

The largest tax come from New York, for example, that's put in kiddie by the good people of the state of New York, and they feel like why should they have to take it on the chin by losing the state and local tax deduction, which was in part put in place to kind of balance things out a little bit."

He and I probably agree more than we disagree. He's got a job to do representing his folks, I've got a job to do, which is to try to explain some of the things that the White House perceives in the existing tax code. And one of those things, went to the heart of this decision, at least the position that we have regarding the state and local taxes -- and again, this is really more a House and a Senate thing than anything else. We support what the House did with the state and local deductions, we support what the Senate did -- that sort of then had --"

You live in New Jersey, I live in Kansas, and if everything else about our life is exactly the same, the same about of money, same type house, same type of car, same number of children, shouldn't we pay the same amount to support the federal government? I think you could make the case that you should, that all of the things being equal, we should pay the same amount to support the federal government, the defense of the nation, all of the things the federal government does. And the state and local tax deductions have sort of worked that over the last couple years to the point where states, your state, New York has been able to raise their state and local taxes higher than they might otherwise have been able to, because folks, they're able to deduct that before they pay their federal taxes. The net effect of that is the folks live in Kansas actually pay more, all other things being equal to folks that live in New Jersey."

We're going to get more of that in the moment, but I want to get to some of the other issues that are out there. Ron Johnson, the Senator from Wisconsin said he's a \"no\" on this tax bill the way that it stands right now. He says it's still the buffaloing people, pass-throughs that think they're going to get a 25 percent rate. It is still lost a lot of people. He's talking about small business owners who may believe that they're going to get that pass-through rate and that maybe they won't get it. What would you say to them tonight?"

The treatment of the pass-through entities, S corporations, LLC partnership, is probably the last biggest substantive stumbling block that we have to deal with. The House chose to deal with it in a certain way, I think they took 70 percent of a pass-throughs income and taxed it as actual personal income; 30 percent is the return on capital. I understand that Senate today, I haven't seen the details, came out with another way to do it. Clearly, it didn't meet Senator Johnson's approval. That's fine. That's one of the last details that need to be worked out. I think once you see that worked out, and it will be worked out, then I think everything else sorts of falls into place, but I don't fault Senator Johnson. I think he feels very strongly about this. And it's on the issue that everybody knew it would be a challenge, so we'll work through it."

She says, \"Martha, everyone is forgetting the senior citizens. No medical deduction. I make about 65,000, 25 percent tax bracket, retired, no employer. We will lose. I pay taxes to get a small return. I pay a couple of thousand. I don't have it. I can't work overtime. Help us. Take a look at this group.\" What do you say to her?"

    {
      "speaker": "MULVANEY",
      "utterance": "That I think she's missing a big piece of the puzzle, which is not unusual. A lot of folks, I think, continue to overlook the importance of doubling that standard deduction. Right now, it's $12,700. If she does have, say, some medical expenses beyond what Medicare pays for her, maybe she itemizes today. The chances of her itemizing with a $24,000 standard deduction for her and her husband are probably very, very low. I think folks have really misunderstood the value of that. That is a key tool, a key part of how we're lowering taxes on so many ordinary Americans like her."

      "speaker": "MULVANEY",

I'm not dodging the question, I'm being consistent with what we said from the beginning, both the House and the Senate bill do what we've asked, which is ordinary Americans will pay less and it will be simpler for them to pay, and the corporate tax comes down. Both bills do that, so we support both of those things. When it comes to dealing with the Obamacare repeal mandate, the individual mandate repeal, if it makes it more likely for the bill to pass with that provision in there, we are for it. If it makes it less likely, more likely by taking it out, we're for taking it out. We're in for reforming taxes."

KING: Well, I'm really not. I mean, again, on the personal side with Mick Mulvaney, came in yesterday, talking to New York reporters, and basically saying it's New York's problem, New York's own fault. That is not a good way to be a spokesman for the administration. That hurts all Republicans who are running for office in New York. It makes it sound like the administration is anti-New York. My district is a Democratic district, President Trump carried it. It's going to be hard to keep carrying districts like that if they think the administration is giving up on New York. That's part of why that's what I said. As far as the other argument, the fact is that, he said all things are equal. All things are not equal. We give $48 billion more to the federal government than we get in return. And that's the largest deficit of any state in the country. New Jersey actually, percentage wise, is even worse. They get $0.61 back on every dollar. So that's why this is not if everything was equal, fine. But everything is not equal. Right now if you have states like New York and New Jersey subsidizing the rest of the country and now they are taking away one of the few benefits that we had, that's the (INAUDIBLE)."

Obviously these states are huge contributors to the federal government and Darrell Issa in California says he is a \"no.\" The counties that there are at least 10 Republican senators in New York, New Jersey, California, Illinois who are \"no\" on this bill, do you think that it could go as high as 22? KING: I think it could, but all I can say looking at the body language and the way that the Republican leadership is acting in the House, it appears they think they have the votes. I don't have the vote count, but potentially 20-25. The House leadership must think they have enough votes to pass it. We will keep fighting right to the very end. Dan Donovan (INAUDIBLE) myself (INAUDIBLE), we feel very, very strongly about this."

What is your hope for what might happen in conference to kind of throw something back, and will it -- if the individual mandate is removed, the Obamacare individual mandate, if that happens in the conference when it's all put together, will that give any wiggle room to perhaps kick some of this money back?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Because we know that people who live in these areas may look like they make a lot of money, but when you pay what they pay for their housing, for their transportation, everything in these states, it really does not make you a rich person to make a couple hundred thousand dollars a year.

And I think about the interview with Hillary Clinton and her saying, I'm not someone just standing by my man. All of that, it sort of comes back to -- obviously, you know, there is just so much of it everywhere and I think it is making people look at it very differently."

      "utterance": "Absolutely. I'm not married, I don't know what it's like to have my husband and let alone my husband who was the president of the United States of America be accused of things like that. I think it's incredibly complicated. We have discussed before what a difficult position Hillary has been in that she is kind of hated if she does, hated if she doesn't. If she had walked out of the White House and said, first lady out, I want to accept this behavior, the country would have been in uproar. She stayed and people are in uproar about that. What I do think is important is that we have these conversations and also deal with the fact that, yes, there are comments that there have been mistakes, and I think to some degree she has kind of owned the improper language that was used. I don't know what it feels like to have that happen to me, but at the end of the day, these were Bill Clinton's actions. She has not been accused of sexual assault."

Also tonight, a group of House Democrats have introduced five articles of impeachment against President Trump, which include an obstruction of justice for the decision to fire former FBI Director James Comey. Here now Jonathan Turley, a George Washington University law professor, with our history lesson tonight on whether or not they have a shot at this and what history tells us about it. Hey, Jonathan, welcome."

      "speaker": "JONATHAN TURLEY, LAW PROFESSOR, GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY",
      "utterance": "Thank you very much. I know they have no shot at this at the moment because they don't have any evidence to support it. Some of these counts are clearly outside of the definition of an impeachable offense. They are seeking to impeach the president for undermining the courts and the press. Those counts are ridiculously (INAUDIBLE). They could have been used to impeach half the presidents of the United States. I mean, after all, President Obama, his administration actually investigated a leading journalist from this network in an appalling violation of both tradition, and in my view, good decision-making. So, this idea that you can impeach someone for these types of ambiguous charges is a dangerous precedent to set up."

      "utterance": "And as you point out, the constitution and the framers really did not want it to be easy at all to remove a president. You can't remove a president just because you don't like the way he talks of the way he tweets, or any of the above. You give the example of Andrew Johnson, who you described as a thoroughly obnoxious president."

      "speaker": "TURLEY",
      "utterance": "That's right. Johnson should never have been impeached. He was saved by a person of great courage and principles who cast the deciding vote. He and a couple of other members paid with their careers. He said he looked into his political grave and jumped. But that's the difference between people of that character and some people today. It was once said that politicians look to the next election and statesmen look to the next generation. These counts are written by politicians."

      "speaker": "TURLEY",
      "utterance": "Well, I think that you can't say that you want to investigate any Russian connections with the Trump campaign, totally dismissed the allegations against Clinton. I think that there is not strong evidence on either side to establish a crime. But I think that the American people are not demanding necessarily indictments, they are demanding some type of information, some answers as to the influence over their politics."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "And I think it's undeniable. But these impeachment counts are part of this new political campaign and mantra to impeach Donald Trump, and it's a dangerous precedent to set, you know, when you say that this is going to be the standard by which you are to judge members, if they are willing to toss all of the constitutional language and traditions aside to get at a person that you despise without any thought of how that is going to -- the implications of that for future generations.

      "utterance": "Today I published an editorial responding to a David Horsey piece in the Los Angeles Times. It was provoked by his disparaging comments about Fox News anchors, including labeling us \"blonde Barbie dolls.\" I took issue with that, not surprisingly, and felt the need to respond. Here's part of what I wrote. Mr. Horsey has no idea what it is like to be part of this network. We work hard, we get our stories right, and we are proud of what we do and the success that we have achieved. We are experienced journalists and reporters. Most of us have been added for a long time. Between us, we worked at all the networks, and most of the prominent newspapers and publications. We are proud that our lineup as he put it is stocked as he put it, but not blonde Barbie dolls, but some of the sharpest, brightest women in the business. Our success is not about hair color or skirts, it is about elbow grease, dedication, and sacrificing time with our families and friends. We are fine with that. It goes with the territory. We live in scary times, though, as evidenced by Mr. Horsey's column. A society where divisiveness leads to crassness that seems to feel it is justified by political bent. Is that really who we want to be? Is that what our nation was built on? Is there a level of respect we could consider the starting point for debate or judgment? Let's hope so. And let's hope with all that's going on in this country with regard to sexism and harassment that we can move to that place of mutual respect. You can read my full piece on Facebook or Twitter.
