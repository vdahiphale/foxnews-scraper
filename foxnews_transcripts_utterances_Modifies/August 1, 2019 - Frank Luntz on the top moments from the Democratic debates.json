Mollie Hemingway, Frank Luntz, and our body language expert she's back with everything you might not have initially picked up. Why do folks like Jim Comey and Hillary Clinton continued to get away with saying things that you would never get away with, military men and women never get away with, pretty much no one else would. Joe Digenova, Allen Dershowitz will answers that question.   This is going to fun Cornel West, Niger Innis and Dr. Drew Pinsky are also here. I told you it was packed.

Now Obama is reportedly apparently today is unfazed by they said by these attacks on his legacy. At least that's what the sources told CBS news.   If that is true, it makes some sense because Obama over saw one of the most liberal administrations ever, it was even considered radical a few years ago. Today, a little different - he's a very wealthy man, worth 40 million, 100 million, according to a couple of estimates. He pals around with the global elites, jet sets literally around the world to lavish events.  Critiquing everybody else's carbon footprint I might add. So I can see why he's probably just not too bothered by the criticism between those hot stone massages. Perhaps the party should be, even if Biden gets the nomination in 2020, the trajectory of the party has moved far beyond the radicalism of Obama and even farther away from America. In moments, part two of my ANGLE will explore how Obama has been hoisted on his own petard. But first, I want to bring in Mollie Hemingway, Senior Editor at \"The Federalist\" and Fox News Contributor Co-author of the fantastic new best- selling book \"Justice On Trial\". There it is. Mollie, I actually in the makeup room yesterday before we came on I said for them to really be the radicals that they want, they want radical change, they're going to have to go after Obama and someone I won't reveal make up room confidences, you know we don't do that. That's a very learned person said they will never do that. Literally, I said it like - we comment like oh, my God, they are attacking Obama.",

Mollie Hemingway, Frank Luntz, and our body language expert she's back with everything you might not have initially picked up. Why do folks like Jim Comey and Hillary Clinton continued to get away with saying things that you would never get away with, military men and women never get away with, pretty much no one else would. Joe Digenova, Allen Dershowitz will answers that question. This is going to fun Cornel West, Niger Innis and Dr. Drew Pinsky are also here. I told you it was packed.

A majority of the Democrats on stage trashed the party's most recent standard-bearer Barack Obama. He's one of the most beloved political figures on the planet but he is written off by the Democrats is kind of a cautious technocrat who was unable to deliver the fundamental change, the radicals really wanted and still want. Now AOC +3 have led the Obama reappraisal through their leftist activism.

Now Obama is reportedly apparently today is unfazed by they said by these attacks on his legacy. At least that's what the sources told CBS news. If that is true, it makes some sense because Obama over saw one of the most liberal administrations ever, it was even considered radical a few years ago. Today, a little different - he's a very wealthy man, worth 40 million, 100 million, according to a couple of estimates. He pals around with the global elites, jet sets literally around the world to lavish events. Critiquing everybody else's carbon footprint I might add. So I can see why he's probably just not too bothered by the criticism between those hot stone massages. Perhaps the party should be, even if Biden gets the nomination in 2020, the trajectory of the party has moved far beyond the radicalism of Obama and even farther away from America. In moments, part two of my ANGLE will explore how Obama has been hoisted on his own petard. But first, I want to bring in Mollie Hemingway, Senior Editor at \"The Federalist\" and Fox News Contributor Co-author of the fantastic new best- selling book \"Justice On Trial\". There it is. Mollie, I actually in the makeup room yesterday before we came on I said for them to really be the radicals that they want, they want radical change, they're going to have to go after Obama and someone I won't reveal make up room confidences, you know we don't do that. That's a very learned person said they will never do that. Literally, I said it like - we comment like oh, my God, they are attacking Obama."

I think the real issue is his real legacy was the election of Donald Trump, it makes him extremely angry, but they are unable to talk about that so instead they talk about their disappointment with different policy issues. That's why Joe Biden the only candidate defending the Obama administration, a striking turn from a few years ago."

      "utterance": "And I'm going to get into that a little of my second ANGLE, but what the amazing thing though is it's been a pretty short period of time since he left office two years ago. High personal approval rating, although his policy accomplishments one after the other had fallen into disarray, they couldn't launch the Obamacare website, remember that the Fiasco? Now the party has just gotten so impatient. We aren't messing around on the edges here we want to tear the system down. That's where it is today."

They do not think that Joe Biden would be able to carry this all the way to 2020 so they want to be involved.

Trump went after the Bushes, he took Bushes out really and all these people are upset because they love -and I love the Bush's people but their policies didn't work. He kind of had to do that, Romney wouldn't do that. He wanted to deal with the old Bush party and shoehorn it in; Trump said that was wrong, Iraq was wrong, China policy bad, trade deals bad, immigration bad. I'm going to do it all over again."

Ever since, the party has been riving and venting, buoyed by the 2018 midterms but still vexed by the man who Robert Mueller couldn't take down. Now they are finger-pointing and it's ugly. But Barack Obama shouldn't be surprised at the party has moved to the extremes on issues like the Green New Deal and reparations. He talked a good game but remember when this went down?

The hostility of these Democratic candidates most of them to corporate America, to CEO's to those who have been successful is significant.

This is about changing the structure of the economy in the United States and they are determined to turn it upside down.

So if once you start yesing someone, you tend to yes them indefinitely. And he uses his hand gestures well. Very big gestures we tend to follow those gestures with our eyes. When somebody moves around a lot we follow their hand gestures."

Biden tries to interrupt and Cory Booker does two things, the first thing he does is he touches him, and we've talked about this how touching as a dominant status move. He touches him but he also puts up his hand like a stop sign. He puts up the stop sign, he touches his hand which is a dominant gesture and look he breaks eye contact right there. That's his way of disengaging and saying I still have the floor here, you need to give me a moment and let me finish my statement."

But in addition to that, she tends to show her anxiety or her lack of confidence during certain times. But that mic tough, that is called a displacement activity. So when you do this, what you are trying to do is regain control. So when you feel like you are being taunted or you're online, you need to grab something to regain control of yourself.

So it all begs the question, why do powerful people in government continue to escape accountability, at least if they're Democrats? Joining me now, Alan Dershowitz, Harvard law professor emeritus, and author to the introduction of the published version to the Mueller Report, and former U.S. attorney Joe diGenova.

They decided they didn't have enough to make a case, and so they decided not to bring a prosecution. That's what the Justice Department should do, bring professional decisions. Bill Barr deserves a medal for doing this. But here's the point. Comey is not out of the woods. He is the target, along with a number of other people, of a major criminal conspiracy investigation by John Durham. It doesn't mean he is going to be charged, but this is only one of many --"

He didn't have the courage of his convictions. If he thought it was perfectly OK to release these to the media, he should've gotten on television, held a press conference, and said here, I want everybody to read these memoranda. Instead he laundered them through a law professor. I think it was absolutely wrong what he did. But I think it was right, I agree with Joe, that you don't weaponize the criminal justice system. They applied it to Comey the same standard he applied to Hillary Clinton. Close case, but in this case it said only confidential, and the confidential staff was put on after he leaked the material. So it was not a good case for prosecution. I would like to see disarmament on both sides. I would like to see less criminal prosecution except in extremely clear cases. Runaway prosecutors are a danger to all Americans, and so I join Joe in praising Attorney General Barr in deciding not to prosecute this case even though what Comey did was disgraceful."

So what we need now is accountability through disclosure, accountability, transparency, public reports, the Horowitz report. And if there are serious crimes, like let's say that a group of people got together and said even though we know Carter Page is innocent, we are going to lie to the FISA court so we can listen in and see if we can get stuff on Trump people. If that happened, I'm for prosecuting that."

That would be a terrible mistake, too. In our country, we don't prosecute people who lose elections, that's what happens in banana republics. And I want the Democrats to call that off.

One-party rule in any country, any state, any city, be it from the left or from the right, is unhealthy. And Baltimore has been under a progressive and corrupt reign of terror for over 50 years. And Trump was right when he said the homicide rate is worse in Baltimore than it is in the triangle cities -- triangle countries in Central America that are sending up many of their people to escape economic ruin. Right here at home, right here in the Baltimores, in the Chicagos of our country, we have economic and all types of other crimes and feces, and all types of disgusting depravity that's taking place.

Both parties have been unable to come to terms with unbelievable poverty, social misery, decrepit schools, inadequate housing, and not enough jobs with a living wage. But I think we have to acknowledge, brother Elijah Cummings, he's not a racist. He's a hardworking liberal in a Democratic Party that is still unable to fully deliver when it comes to precious poor people of whatever color, but disproportionately black and brown. But this has to do with the system. And this is something I think, Brother Innis, I think you would agree, too. We're not just talking about parties. We are talking about an economic system that has been unable to deliver when it comes to the least of these, to use the Biblical language. And I think it's very important to note, my dear sister Laura, that as a fellow citizen, as a fellow human being, as a revolutionary Christian, as a democratic socialist, I don't want to destroy America, I don't want to undermine personal liberties, I don't want to eliminate the private sector, I don't want to do away with markets.

      "utterance": "I think one thing we have to recognize is there is a spiritual problem in terms of losing sight of humanity of people so we don't demonize each other across the board. I can be critical of Barack Obama's mixed legacy without in any way demonizing him or thinking he didn't make any contribution. FOX News can't be so tied to Trump the way MSNBC was tied to Obama. We have to have a corporate media that allows for conversation that flows, that focuses on issues of working and poor people, not just the talking points. It's very important for the health of a democracy, my dear sister."

      "utterance": "Nearly half of all the homeless people living in the streets in America happen to live in the state of California. What they are doing to our beautiful California is a disgrace to our country. It's a shame. The world is looking at it, look at Los Angeles with the tents and the horrible, horrible, disgusting conditions."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "There are a lot of tents in D.C. as well, but California certainly has the most. That was the president tonight addressing a topic that the moderators and the 20 Democrats failed to raise over the past two nights, homelessness ravaging cities in California and other cities across the country. Here now to respond is L.A. resident, addiction medicine specialist Dr. Drew Pinsky. Dr. Drew, explain why this should have been a topic at the Democrat debates last night."

      "speaker": "DR. DREW PINSKY, ADDICTION MEDICINE SPECIALIST",
      "utterance": "It was not a topic of debate because, unfortunately, the homeless situation in California is directly the result of failed policies here. This is not a housing problem. The federal government does have a housing structure that they are supporting. This is not a housing problem. This is a mental health crisis. And the federal government does not have specific jurisdiction over mental health in the Constitution. In fact, the Congress occasionally has tiptoed toward the care of the mentally ill. Previous presidents had vetoed that until President Kennedy who passed the Community Mental Health Act which was designed to strangle the state mental health system. Since then, we've had total decay of our mental health provisions for the chronically mentally ill. They are all on the streets. I spent the day there on Sunday. And Laura, 100 percent, other than the criminals I saw preying on the homeless, 100 percent of the people on the streets were either major mental illness or drug addiction, 100 percent. And I talked to dozens of people, and they all told me the same thing. Everybody is on drugs -- no surprise there. But the other thing --"

      "speaker": "PINSKY",
      "utterance": "Right, it's everywhere. But this is the other thing they are not preparing for. They said the same thing over and over again, this never came up multiple times. Fifty percent of the people out here will refuse care no matter what you offer them, no matter how good the service is, no matter how good the housing. That's because this is a mental health issue, and part of having this condition, much like if you had dementia, you lose insight into what is going on and you become attached to the circumstances you are in. You have to expand the definition of gravely disabled, we have to expand conservatorship. We have to modify Prop 47. These are failed policies of our state. We have to modify Prop 47 that moves people out and into care. They are dying on the streets, and my constant refrain to every one of them is, how many bodies, how many bodies on the street before they are willing to change the policy?"

Two blocks from right here, Dr. Drew. when you come to D.C., two blocks from right here, there are people shooting up, out on the street, defecating on -- and people just drive by. It's D.C., though. This is D.C. government. It's local and state governments. And we're almost out of time. And Dr. Drew, I'm going to be out in California, so we're going to try to maybe even film some stuff together."
