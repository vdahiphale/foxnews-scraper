Alleging that FBI agents manipulated the former National Security adviser's statements. Leading him to be charged with lying to investigators and what his lawyers are now calling a case of outrageous government misconduct against their client in the Russia probe. Once again, raising questions about whether bad actors inside the government -- the deep state as President Trump calls them were out to get him from the start. Those fresh allegations come as a criminal investigation has begun now into how the entire Russia probe began.  And as the president today claimed the impeachment probe over Ukraine is also in his words a hoax. The president pushing back on the impeachment testimony of Bill Taylor, the top U.S. envoy to Ukraine who earlier this week seemed to tie the president to a quid pro quo, at least, that's what the Democrats suggested. The president today firing back.",

And I think as a result of that, and also, this, we have a new chairman of the joint chiefs, General Mark Milley who just took over when this crisis began -- and he brought to the president a revised security plan which would cover about 60 percent of eastern Syria and it would have three purposes. One is to deny the oilfields, as you just mentioned, to the Iranians or to the ISIS retaking them. And by the way, so our audience understand, 70 percent of all of Syrian's oilfields are in eastern Syria under the control of U.S.-led coalition forces.

Alleging that FBI agents manipulated the former National Security adviser's statements. Leading him to be charged with lying to investigators and what his lawyers are now calling a case of outrageous government misconduct against their client in the Russia probe. Once again, raising questions about whether bad actors inside the government -- the deep state as President Trump calls them were out to get him from the start. Those fresh allegations come as a criminal investigation has begun now into how the entire Russia probe began. And as the president today claimed the impeachment probe over Ukraine is also in his words a hoax. The president pushing back on the impeachment testimony of Bill Taylor, the top U.S. envoy to Ukraine who earlier this week seemed to tie the president to a quid pro quo, at least, that's what the Democrats suggested.

And then, you move out and you -- and you execute. And so, you know, we were talking about Ambassador Taylor earlier in his testimony, in our pushback on how secretively this is being handled. I've asked for three weeks now as a sitting member of Congress, representing nearly a million Floridians to see Kurt Volker's testimony which apparently told a very different story.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "TOLMAN",
      "utterance": "Well, I look at this as a prosecutor, and Adam Schiff was a prosecutor. And I look at what's happening and it's a scenario in which the congressman is correct. They are getting to control the narrative but at the same time they're trampling on what you and I, Ed, think are very important about are our constitutional protections, and that's the ability to have a fair process. A whistleblower is an individual that has unique information. They can be anonymous when they first come forward. But when you are starting to receive testimony when you're interviewing individuals, the identity and the credibility of that whistleblower is the most important aspect of ensuring that someone has their due process rights."

    {
      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "Yes, now, but on the other hand, you're a good lawyer and you understand that what the Democrats are saying, I want at least give them a fair hearing on this, they're suggesting that Republicans are focusing on process because the facts for President Trump, the idea at the beginning of this that he said it was a perfect phone call with the Ukrainian president that the facts haven't turned out the way the Republicans thought. How do you respond to that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TOLMAN",
      "utterance": "I've never thought the fourth, fifth, and sixth amendments to the Constitution were insignificant. Or that they were something that we didn't worry about because the facts justify trampling them."

      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "Sure."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TOLMAN",
      "utterance": "But let's take their argument. Facts are only important if you have them. And we've heard plenty of facts that suggest that there was no quid pro quo. And we -- but yet, we don't have the nobility to cross- examine, or to observe, or to listen in, and assess for ourselves the credibility. And then, this is the issue that they have -- the Democrats have. Whether you like the president or not, we should all be hoping for and that this process is something that is transparent, something that gives us an ability to say, OK, now I see that fact A and fact B lead me to the conclusion that there was a quid pro quo -- we don't have that."

      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "So --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TOLMAN",
      "utterance": "So, then, I think, process becomes vital."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "So, is it inevitable that Adam Schiff will have to bring transparency in and bring some of this testimony into the public so we can all see it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TOLMAN",
      "utterance": "Only if this is a legitimate inquiry. And so far, they've refused to do that. So, then, it makes me and others that are on the outside of this looking in believe that it's more political than it is an effort to try to get to the facts. And let's face it, Congress oftentimes is one of the most inefficient and least effective venues to try to get to the facts."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "And to get to the bottom of all, that, that might be something that Democrats and Republicans can actually agree on. Brett Tolman, I appreciate you coming in tonight."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TOLMAN",
      "utterance": "Thank you. All right. Next up.

      "speaker": "SALE",
      "utterance": "Hey, it's way overblown. What yesterday was a probe or an inquiry, is today an investigation. I described it as a shortcut or almost a gimmick. Anybody who's the subject of an inquiry, a probe, or so-called criminal investigation, it's not fun. It's not fun to be investigated. And the fact that he now has subpoena power merely means he can compel the production of documents and compel people to come testify."

      "utterance": "It may not be fun though, John, for John Brennan and others, but if they actually sort of cooked a lot of this up and sent us down a road for two and a half years of alleged Russia collusion that wasn't there, isn't it time for them to be held accountable?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SALE",
      "utterance": "It's time for anybody who broke the law to be held accountable. I think you have to look at John Durham, and he's a career prosecutor of over 30 years. He's done high-level investigations for three Attorneys General of different parties. He's going to have the chips fall where they may. If they broke the law, they might face criminal charges. If they didn't, they won't. And I think they enjoy the presumption of innocence as President Trump should have had during the period of the Mueller probe."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "He often did not get that presumption of innocence as you know, the President in this case. It's interesting you mentioned John Durham from somebody who leaders in both parties have praised before but now Democrats seem to be going after him. I've talked to people closely investigation who say he's got Democrats and Republicans on this staff. He's very even-handed. Will that give john dorm credibility if he ends up bringing criminal charges against Obama officials?"
    },

      "speaker": "SALE",

And they both independently told me he was a man of integrity, who called him as he saw them. So if he doesn't have credibility, I mean, then nobody does."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "What about William Barr, the Attorney General? Because what's interesting is, you know, you can see that he's sort of this whipping boy for Democrats now. We suggested that in the lead-in. He says he's just trying to follow the facts. Rachel Maddow last night had this to say. Watch."

According to this conspiracy theory, Russia didn't do that. Russia didn't intervene. What actually happened is that it was the Obama administration that was setting this all up as a frame job."

He's meeting with representatives of other governments, where there are mutual assistance treaties, agreements to assist each other and gathering evidence to see if the evidence is there. People will be held accountable. And I think if the evidence is not there, there'll be no charges filed. Again, let the chips fall where they may."

We have a number of really very strong candidates who are emerging. And it's -- and it's not going to be decided, Ed, by national polls.

His best day was his first day. From that point forward, he has been riddled with gaff after gaff. You look in the campaign finance reports, not too good. In fact today it seems like his campaign signaled that the now open to Super PACs support which is a big no-no in a Democrat field that makes it a big talking point about how they want to have campaign finance reform.

But I would not by any stretch of the imagination, try to determine Super PACs has been the deciding role here. It's going to be the issues that are going to energize Democrats, motivate them. And the biggest issue is ultimately the corruption and competence of the Trump administration.

Clearly, what's happened here, Ed, is we have had seven days of ceasefire and that's a good thing even though it's been sporadic interruption of that and that's enabled the president and his national security team, and also in concert with our allies to take a look at the issues we are facing. And I think as a result of that, and also, this, we have a new chairman of the joint chiefs, General Mark Milley who just took over when this crisis began -- and he brought to the president a revised security plan which would cover about 60 percent of eastern Syria and it would have three purposes. One is to deny the oilfields, as you just mentioned, to the Iranians or to the ISIS retaking them. And by the way, so our audience understand, 70 percent of all of Syrian's oilfields are in eastern Syria under the control of U.S.-led coalition forces. The second thing is, deny ISIS the opportunity to return and we are all interested in that, and the third thing is maintain control of all the airspace in eastern Syria and that's pretty much what the president's decision represents."

The American people's security is make much -- make the right decision based on that premise and your oath of office, you are always going to have some degree of political opposition you got to -- you got to deal with it. What happened here and people seem to forget, we focused on the numbers of U.S. troops but there's an excess of 60,000 Syrian Democratic Forces that are in the area of eastern Syria where, we are providing advice to them and also we coordinate for airpower. So, they are the main force to matter what we are going to do here, they will always be the main force. We still have some problems up north though, Ed. I mean, and you made reference to the Russians. The Russians are not down in main part of eastern Syria, they are up north in this buffer zone that's 20 miles in width that stretches across a 300- mile wide area from the Euphrates River Valley to the Iraqi border. And they're in there. And I think it would be better if all of vested parties that got out there, we brought in international players who are not vested. In other words, get the Russians out, get the Assad regime and get the Turks."

So, he is proposing a fix that might save hundreds, might, and then using the number 40,000 as if it's an epidemic.

So, it's no surprise the boss has had some choice words for President Trump, calling the then candidate dumb in 2016. Then a few months later saying he'd be fearful of him as president, now he's taking aim once again, this time labeling the president, yes, un-American."

I'm not a fan of calling someone especially the president of the United States of America un-American. I am a fan of pointed criticism of policies that I believed to be un-American in spirit. I believe Bruce Springsteen was thinking of as many of us have that kind of immigration policy of this administration has enacted and the betrayal of what it says on the Statue of Liberty. So, I think that would have, perhaps, been a better way to go about this. But also, Bruce Springsteen is not a political pundit. Right? He is talking from his heart. He is seeing the divisiveness and the challenges that our country is facing that a lot of people draw straight line to this president for. And you know, if you have the bully pulpit, use it and there are millions of Americans that agree with him."
