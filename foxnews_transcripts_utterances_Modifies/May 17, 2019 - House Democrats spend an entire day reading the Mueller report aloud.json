We'll take you all through it. We have shocking reports, as we're learning that thousands of illegal immigrants are being dropped off in cities across the country. We're going to tell you where it's happening and what should be done next. Very important information.  Plus, Democrats in the House today, all supported something called - and I put it in quotes, \"The Equality Act.\" It sounds nice on the surface. Well, we'll dig into it. And you'll see what's inside. We'll see how they're pushed for these politically correct results could put young girls and religious organizations at risk.  Plus, Raymond Arroyo is here with a very dirty Friday follies, revealing the body part Americans do not wash and why you should think twice before jumping into that public pool this summer. And wait until you see what Congressional Dems were doing instead of legislating this week.  But first, Attorney General Bill Barr sitting down for a wide-ranging interview with Fox News earlier today and it's driving the critics nuts.",

But I think he was actually pulling his punches a little bit in that particular response, Laura, because it was not appropriate for Bob Mueller to put all of this dirt and smear and negative information out there about the President in this report and then not be able to pinpoint any particular crime. That's the type of smear and report that we used to see with the independent counsel, which has been discontinued and meant to be sort of an impeachment report. And it's not what the Special Counsel report is supposed to be. It's supposed to be something that talks about crime or not crime.  And so, by punting on that and really putting this dirt out there, I think he did a disservice to his reputation, Bob Mueller did. And so Barr doesn't want to touch that.

With Michael Flynn, it was, number one, using threatening the Logan Act, go after him for his contacts, appropriate contacts that the incoming national security advisor should have with foreign officials. And then, secondly, unmasking him and leaking that information, unmasked information to the press. That itself is a crime, the leaking of that classified information.   And there were certainly other time bombs and booby traps the Obama people left behind. For example, the dossier briefing to President Trump, which then was immediately leaked the facts of it to CNN. And of course, when they downgraded top secret information to secret information so more people in the government would have it, and that way, that could leak further embarrassing Donald Trump on the collusion allegations.

It's just not a border state issue anymore, though. It's a national concern. And you just heard, the majority of the illegal immigrants crossing our southern border told me that they're not staying in those border communities. No, they go north. And we have exclusive access inside one of the CBP processing centers and can attest that they are at capacity. Dozens and dozens are packed into facility that is not meant to be permanent. The CBP says it is currently making contingency plans to transport family units to other border patrol locations across the country, specifically in northern and in coastal communities that have the capacity and necessary computers and so forth to handle this processing.  In the meantime, the Trump administration is looking to hire a private contractor to support the transport of some quarter of a million illegal aliens over the next five years to shelters all across the country while they wait for their asylum claims. Now, to be processed is complicated. You don't just put someone's fingerprint in the system. Think about it. We'll have 250,000 illegals just deposited into cities and towns across the country. Now the fact is, most of the family units illegally crossing our borders are released into local communities where they're eventually caught. Now, they're given a notice to appear in court and they're dropped at a central location nearby. Now, take the State of New Mexico, for instance. A lot of people aren't covering New Mexico, but it's a big story. Just this week, the small city of Deming declared a state of emergency after, in the small little place, 170 migrants were sent there and released. Last week and in response, Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham paid $4,000 out of state money to transport 55 illegals to neighboring Colorado. Well, illegal immigration is crippling New Mexico. It's a border state. And again, it rarely gets talked about when we discussed this immigration crisis. And by the way, the Colorado Governor wasn't thrilled because he wasn't even told that these 55 asylum seekers were being sent to his state. And we've just learned a week ago that border patrol agents in Laredo intercepted a truck containing 120 illegals who were trying to enter the United States. 11 of them were juveniles, all from Central America. And finally, it keeps getting more shocking. A potential serial killer who's in the country illegally has been arrested in Texas. Police say Billy Chemirmir of Kenya, who was previously arrested in the death of an 81-year- old woman, has also now been charged with killing at least 11 more elderly women. Even more frightening, police said then that investigators were reviewing about 750 unattended deaths of elderly women for possible links to this illegal immigrant. We'll continue to follow this story. And despite all of what we just told you, Democrats for months have been saying there's no border crisis or Trump caused the border crisis. Nancy Pelosi yesterday somehow forgot all of the things that we talked about and had the gall to say this.",

Now suddenly she seems to say there is a crisis. So, how can you resolve this contradiction? I think there's only one way to do it. And that is that there are actually two separate crises at the border. There is Trump's crisis and then there's Pelosi's crisis. Now, Trump's crisis is that the border is too porous. People are pouring in. Illegals are getting in. MS-13 gang members are getting in. Now, Nancy Pelosi denies that that's a crisis. She - when she says that there's no crisis, she means that Trump's crisis does not exist.  Now, what is Pelosi's crisis? Pelosi's crisis is the exact opposite. Her crisis is that there is - that the border is not porous enough, not enough illegals are pouring in. so when she says that there's a humanitarian crisis, she means that there are hungry, sick, starving people at the border, we need to let more of them in. So that's - that's I think the way to resolve this apparent contradiction. She actually wants to see more illegals.",

The Congress doesn't want to give HHS, which takes care of these unaccompanied minors, they don't want to give them money. So they complain about, well, look at how these people are. And then they won't - they won't admit there's a real problem, do anything about it, stem the problem, or even say, yes, we have to either have semi-permanent structures or permanent structures until these people get their immigration hearings.

In other words, it's not that Nancy Pelosi wants to share her wealth or the wealth of America with India and China. Not at all. The reason that the Democrats have a special interest in the illegals is they want to sort of transform the demographics of America, even though illegals can't vote.

Republican Congressman Virginia Fox said of the bill, \"If the devil is in the details, we're in for a lot of devilish surprises.\" Let me tell you about this bill. It sets out to prohibit LGBTQ discrimination across the country, including in federally funded education programs, and many believe that it would result in horrible outcomes, especially for girls participating in sports who will be put at a gross athletic disadvantage. And then there's the concern about religious organizations who, because of their conscience concerns, well, they can't fully participate in the new concerns about LGBTQ, and that they will then be sued into submission by, well, of course, greedy trial lawyers. So this may create a huge mess. But let's focus tonight on one group that the bill seeks to protect, and the medical consequences of subjecting young bodies to hormonal treatments and even surgery. Dr. Paul Hruz is an endocrinologist and wrote that these treatments for gender dysphoric youth are drastic and experimental. Dr. Hruz, there's a lot of politics involved in the passage of this legislation today. But I have a question after reading a lot about this, why is the medical community so afraid of considering the impact of hormone treatment and surgeries and so forth for the young?",

And this is a normal process that we see in children. One of the concerns of that is about this particular approach to treating these individuals that have a gender identity that is not in accord with their biology is that it will actually influence how they're able to make that normal integration, and really subject them to the need of medical intervention that has potential very serious harms to their bodies throughout the rest of their life.

We'll take you all through it. We have shocking reports, as we're learning that thousands of illegal immigrants are being dropped off in cities across the country. We're going to tell you where it's happening and what should be done next. Very important information. Plus, Democrats in the House today, all supported something called - and I put it in quotes, \"The Equality Act.\" It sounds nice on the surface. Well, we'll dig into it. And you'll see what's inside. We'll see how they're pushed for these politically correct results could put young girls and religious organizations at risk. Plus, Raymond Arroyo is here with a very dirty Friday follies, revealing the body part Americans do not wash and why you should think twice before jumping into that public pool this summer. And wait until you see what Congressional Dems were doing instead of legislating this week. But first, Attorney General Bill Barr sitting down for a wide-ranging interview with Fox News earlier today and it's driving the critics nuts."

And he did preview how the investigation into the investigators might play out and why. Well, let's unpack each of the significant takeaways one-by-one. Now it's important for all of you tonight to understand every bit of this. First, here's why Barr initiated this investigation."

      "speaker": "WILLIAM BARR, ATTORNEY GENERAL",
      "utterance": "No one has really looked at it. I think there's a misconception out there that we know a lot about what happened. The fact of the matter is, Bob Mueller did not look at the government's activities. He was looking at the - whether or not the Trump campaign had conspired with the Russians. But he was not going back and looking at the counterintelligence program."

      "utterance": "This was handled at a very senior level of these departments. It wasn't handled in the ordinary way that investigations or counterintelligence activities are conducted.

Ari, I want to start with you. I want to hit that last bit of the video we just played. Barr seems to almost - he kind of almost welcomes all these partisan barbs, and they're really nasty being thrown at him. So how important is it that these new investigations unfold without any other interference?"

      "speaker": "ARI FLEISCHER, FORMER WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY",

And if the Democrats hold themselves to the same standards they tried to hold the Trump administration too, they'd be guilty of obstruction of justice themselves the way they're going after the Attorney General. Laura, you played that long clip of the Democrats criticizing Barr. Do you remember when Eric Holder, Barack Obama's Attorney General, called himself Barack Obama's wingman? Those were his words. He called himself his wingman. Do you recall, I mean, people going nuts saying how can he say that, he's supposed to be independent? Bill Barr is a seasoned, experienced Attorney General, and that's exactly what we need now to figure out what, if anything, was done improperly when they authorized all these wiretaps and surveillance techniques to be used against Trump."

If there are bad facts, show us, or search for them professionally and then tell us what you found. An AG must act like the leader of the Department of Justice, an organization based on truth. Donald Trump has enough spokespeople.\" Boy, they're all singing from the same hymnal. John?"

The facts we do know, Hillary Clinton and the DNC illegally laundered money to Fusion GPS to pay for a dossier with Russian intelligence sources, part of it, we learned that this last week. And they did that in order to authorize spying on the opposition political campaign. I mean, this is a scandal of historic proportions. And I'm pleased that Attorney General Barr is finally willing to get to the bottom of it."

He doesn't look like someone who has anything to hide. He's not worried about stonewalling the Democrats for information. He's like \"Go ahead.\" HARMEET DHILLON, MEMBER OF THE TRUMP 2020 ADVISORY COUNCIL: Right. I mean, he is unflappable in the face of this type of histrionic demagoguery calling him a KGB agent and so forth. But I think he was actually pulling his punches a little bit in that particular response, Laura, because it was not appropriate for Bob Mueller to put all of this dirt and smear and negative information out there about the President in this report and then not be able to pinpoint any particular crime. That's the type of smear and report that we used to see with the independent counsel, which has been discontinued and meant to be sort of an impeachment report. And it's not what the Special Counsel report is supposed to be. It's supposed to be something that talks about crime or not crime. And so, by punting on that and really putting this dirt out there, I think he did a disservice to his reputation, Bob Mueller did. And so Barr doesn't want to touch that. He's leaving Mueller to fend for himself on that, which I think is appropriate, but it does--"

New Special Counsel records are showing that former National Security Advisor, Mike Flynn, reported multiple instances before and after his guilty plea where he or his lawyers got calls from individuals connected to the administration or Congress. Now, his brother, Joe Flynn, told Fox's Catherine Herridge, he was set up."

      "speaker": "FLEISCHER",
      "utterance": "I don't know. I think you've got to have the - let that story play on and find out exactly what they're talking about, who the people are. But what concerns me the most, Laura, just in terms of good government, is the transition by the Obama people to the Trump people was full of booby traps and time bombs, and two of them went off against Michael Flynn. With Michael Flynn, it was, number one, using threatening the Logan Act, go after him for his contacts, appropriate contacts that the incoming national security advisor should have with foreign officials. And then, secondly, unmasking him and leaking that information, unmasked information to the press. That itself is a crime, the leaking of that classified information. And there were certainly other time bombs and booby traps the Obama people left behind. For example, the dossier briefing to President Trump, which then was immediately leaked the facts of it to CNN. And of course, when they downgraded top secret information to secret information so more people in the government would have it, and that way, that could leak further embarrassing Donald Trump on the collusion allegations. All of this was the handwork of Obama's people. And so, Laura, I've always asked the question, what did President Obama know and when did he authorize it? And too needs to be found out."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Yes. I think there are a lot of people there raising questions in their minds and also now publicly about the former President of the United States himself, given his closeness with the Attorney General at the time. John, I want to ask you, as a professor of law at Chapman - we had an interesting moment. Nancy Pelosi appeared at a Georgetown Law School event and decided to chime in on impeachment in this issue. Let's watch."

    {
      "speaker": "REP. NANCY PELOSI, D-CALIF., HOUSE SPEAKER",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "EASTMAN",
      "utterance": "That's right. Almost every president objects to broad subpoenas because there's a thing called executive privilege. Congress has oversight authority. They don't have the authority to interfere with the operation of the executive. And that's why we have executive privilege. But, look, there's an old adage, the best defense is a strong offense. And I think the Democrats, because they lost the election and lost control over hiding the secrets of what went on back in 2016, are going on offense to try and make it look like everything that they actually did was Trump did himself. And when the real collusion comes out, we have been hearing so much over the last couple of years of Trump's collusion falsely, that it will kind of take the sting out of what really happened, which is the Hillary Clinton campaign colluded with the Russians. I mean, there's no doubt about it now."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Yes. Well, by the way, the President tweeted tonight. We're almost out of time, but here's his tweet just a short while ago. \"My campaign for President was conclusively spied on. Nothing like this has ever happened in American politics. A really bad situation. Treason means long jail sentences, and this was treason.\" Harmeet, we're almost out of time. But treason? Yes or no?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DHILLON",
      "utterance": "Well, it could be. I don't think we have enough facts there, but even The New York Times is beginning to say what Professor Eastman just said, which is that it was the Clinton campaign that willingly took information from Russians and then unfortunately duped even the Deputy Attorney General to signing off on putting that in front of a court to spy on Americans. That is illegal. Whether it constitutes willing treason, I think we have to suspend judgment until we find out more."

    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Well, “The Ingraham Angle” has been on the front lines of the illegal immigration crisis in this country. We showed you that last week. It's just not a border state issue anymore, though. It's a national concern. And you just heard, the majority of the illegal immigrants crossing our southern border told me that they're not staying in those border communities. No, they go north. And we have exclusive access inside one of the CBP processing centers and can attest that they are at capacity. Dozens and dozens are packed into facility that is not meant to be permanent. The CBP says it is currently making contingency plans to transport family units to other border patrol locations across the country, specifically in northern and in coastal communities that have the capacity and necessary computers and so forth to handle this processing. In the meantime, the Trump administration is looking to hire a private contractor to support the transport of some quarter of a million illegal aliens over the next five years to shelters all across the country while they wait for their asylum claims. Now, to be processed is complicated. You don't just put someone's fingerprint in the system. Think about it. We'll have 250,000 illegals just deposited into cities and towns across the country. Now the fact is, most of the family units illegally crossing our borders are released into local communities where they're eventually caught. Now, they're given a notice to appear in court and they're dropped at a central location nearby. Now, take the State of New Mexico, for instance. A lot of people aren't covering New Mexico, but it's a big story. Just this week, the small city of Deming declared a state of emergency after, in the small little place, 170 migrants were sent there and released. Last week and in response, Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham paid $4,000 out of state money to transport 55 illegals to neighboring Colorado. Well, illegal immigration is crippling New Mexico. It's a border state. And again, it rarely gets talked about when we discussed this immigration crisis. And by the way, the Colorado Governor wasn't thrilled because he wasn't even told that these 55 asylum seekers were being sent to his state. And we've just learned a week ago that border patrol agents in Laredo intercepted a truck containing 120 illegals who were trying to enter the United States. 11 of them were juveniles, all from Central America. And finally, it keeps getting more shocking. A potential serial killer who's in the country illegally has been arrested in Texas. Police say Billy Chemirmir of Kenya, who was previously arrested in the death of an 81-year- old woman, has also now been charged with killing at least 11 more elderly women. Even more frightening, police said then that investigators were reviewing about 750 unattended deaths of elderly women for possible links to this illegal immigrant. We'll continue to follow this story. And despite all of what we just told you, Democrats for months have been saying there's no border crisis or Trump caused the border crisis. Nancy Pelosi yesterday somehow forgot all of the things that we talked about and had the gall to say this."

Dinesh, it appears that Pelosi is attempting to gaslight Americans here. What do you think? DINESH D'SOUZA, CONSERVATIVE AUTHOR & FILMMAKER: Well, I've been scratching my head, because on the face of it, there's a blatant contradiction. She has repeatedly said that there's no crisis. Now suddenly she seems to say there is a crisis. So, how can you resolve this contradiction? I think there's only one way to do it. And that is that there are actually two separate crises at the border. There is Trump's crisis and then there's Pelosi's crisis. Now, Trump's crisis is that the border is too porous. People are pouring in. Illegals are getting in. MS-13 gang members are getting in. Now, Nancy Pelosi denies that that's a crisis. She - when she says that there's no crisis, she means that Trump's crisis does not exist. Now, what is Pelosi's crisis? Pelosi's crisis is the exact opposite. Her crisis is that there is - that the border is not porous enough, not enough illegals are pouring in. so when she says that there's a humanitarian crisis, she means that there are hungry, sick, starving people at the border, we need to let more of them in. So that's - that's I think the way to resolve this apparent contradiction. She actually wants to see more illegals."

They're pouring out of these processing centers, children and adults, and they're being held in places where they're not meant to be held because those are processing centers, they're not permanent detainment areas where people are detained for days and days and days. The Congress doesn't want to give HHS, which takes care of these unaccompanied minors, they don't want to give them money. So they complain about, well, look at how these people are. And then they won't - they won't admit there's a real problem, do anything about it, stem the problem, or even say, yes, we have to either have semi-permanent structures or permanent structures until these people get their immigration hearings. So everyone is pointing fingers at one another, but you have to have a solution to stop this madness because it's endangering the lives of kids and frankly the American people."

In other words, when you think about people who are sick or starving, that's happening in India, that's happening in Thailand, in China. So you have to ask why the particularly solicitude for this particular group of starving people in Mexico. And the answer is political. In other words, it's not that Nancy Pelosi wants to share her wealth or the wealth of America with India and China. Not at all. The reason that the Democrats have a special interest in the illegals is they want to sort of transform the demographics of America, even though illegals can't vote. Over time, illegals have children, their children are American citizens, they grow up, they can vote.

Republican Congressman Virginia Fox said of the bill, \"If the devil is in the details, we're in for a lot of devilish surprises.\" Let me tell you about this bill. It sets out to prohibit LGBTQ discrimination across the country, including in federally funded education programs, and many believe that it would result in horrible outcomes, especially for girls participating in sports who will be put at a gross athletic disadvantage. And then there's the concern about religious organizations who, because of their conscience concerns, well, they can't fully participate in the new concerns about LGBTQ, and that they will then be sued into submission by, well, of course, greedy trial lawyers. So this may create a huge mess. But let's focus tonight on one group that the bill seeks to protect, and the medical consequences of subjecting young bodies to hormonal treatments and even surgery. Dr. Paul Hruz is an endocrinologist and wrote that these treatments for gender dysphoric youth are drastic and experimental. Dr. Hruz, there's a lot of politics involved in the passage of this legislation today. But I have a question after reading a lot about this, why is the medical community so afraid of considering the impact of hormone treatment and surgeries and so forth for the young?"

And it's very unique compared to this particular condition in comparison to other diseases that we care for as physicians."

That's what I've been reading in the medical literature today."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HRUZ",
      "utterance": "That is true. And, in fact, aspects of both physical development and emotional development, we tend to equate everything that goes on related to puberty, but there's the entity called adolescence as well. And there's a normal developmental process that goes on in children where as they're trying to come to terms with changes going on in their body are also struggling to identify themselves in relation to their peers. And this is a normal process that we see in children. One of the concerns of that is about this particular approach to treating these individuals that have a gender identity that is not in accord with their biology is that it will actually influence how they're able to make that normal integration, and really subject them to the need of medical intervention that has potential very serious harms to their bodies throughout the rest of their life. Without even considering whether there are alternative options to help them, and even recognizing that a large number of children that question their gender identity are going to, if merely left alone, are going to realign their identity with their biological sex."

      "utterance": "The estimates vary, but it's the majority -- all of the studies that have been done, and there's been over a dozen studies and many of the earlier studies were small studies, have all consistently shown the same effect. One of the most concerning observations was, however, if one tries to interfere with that normal pubertal development to stop normally timed puberty in children, that all of the children in the small study that was done looking at the effect of that, all went on to persist in that transgender identity, really changing that statistic drastically from the normal trajectory that we normally see."

But the reality medically is something that to me is just being completely overlooked. I read that there are 45 centers that have cropped up across the country, major medical institutions, that are devoted a lot of resources to the treatment of transgender -- transgenderism and reassignment surgery and so forth. That is an explosive growth in the treatment, and it's big money, is it not?"

    {
      "speaker": "HRUZ",
      "utterance": "Well, it's actually over 50 now. And really the amazing concern about the growth of this particular approach to dealing with children that have this transgender identity is to adopt a single intervention that's based on very, very poor quality science. And even those that are advocating for this intervention that are involved in this intervention for children will acknowledge that the science really has not been done to really establish what the long-term effects are, and already the data that's coming forward raises serious concerns not only in how these children are going to normally move through the developmental stages and their identity, but the effects of the hormonal treatment having effects on the body that are going to be --"

But we know quite a bit, and this gets back to the point of really clouding the difference between when we're talking about gender identity and the biological reality of sex.
