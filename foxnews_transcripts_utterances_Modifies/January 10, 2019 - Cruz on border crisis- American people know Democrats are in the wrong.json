We're going to bring that you interview in full. That's coming up tonight.  Now, of course, we are here in Texas covering the president's very important trip to the southern border. And today, he toured border facilities. He met with officers at a border patrol station. He attended a security briefing and he sat down with the victims of illegal immigration.  And meanwhile, Democratic lawmakers, they were 1,800 miles away in the comfort of their Capitol Hill offices where they still refuse to reopen the government and even negotiate all because President Trump had the audacity to try to improve border security, something they supported just a few years ago. Think about it.  In order to obstruct the president's agenda, the hate Trump Democrats, hate Trump media, they actually have to pretend that border security doesn't matter. That walls are somehow immoral. Walls they voted for in the past. And that is, of course, one big manufactured crisis. And they keep saying it again and again and again. Take a look.",

Ninety percent of which comes across the southern border?  Now, these are the facts that the mainstream media and the Democratic Party, they refuse to show you. They are all in sink together. They're just an extension of each other: 4,000 criminal aliens were arrested for homicide, 30,000 criminal aliens were arrested for sex crimes, over 100,000 for violent assaults. And last year, 800 gang members were apprehended at our border. That's a 50 percent increase over 2017. There were also 122 percent increase in fentanyl. And that's being smuggled across the border as well. Ninety percent of the heroin, that's smuggled across the border. That's in every small town and big city in America.  And keep in mind, every seven days, 300 Americans are dying. Seventeen thousand individuals with criminal records were apprehended trying to cross the border. Sixty thousand inadmissible or illegal immigrants are turned away from our borders every single month. And over the last 30 days, 20,000 children, they were smuggled or trafficked right here into the United States. On the other side of the border, the crisis is also very real. One out of three migrant women who make this treacherous, dangerous, arduous journey to our southern border are sexually assaulted. We need to protect people on both sides of the border.  Seven in 10 migrants have reported being victims of violence during that dangerous trek, and an average of 50 children every day require emergency medical care after they arrive at the southern border. Now, Speaker Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, this is not a manufactured crisis. These are real statistics, real people, real lives and many deaths. This is about life and death.  And as you can clearly see, this is humanitarian and a national security crisis of epic proportions. And it's a national security emergency that has now been brewing for years. Somehow in 2014 when Obama was president, well then the mainstream media well they weren't saying it was manufactured then. And they highlighted the crisis.  \"The Washington Post\" has reported, quote: White House requests 3.7 billion in emergency funds for border crisis. Now, look at this headline from fake news CNN. Daniel's journey: how thousands of children are creation a crisis in America. Even \"The Huffington Post\" weighed in with a featured story about the southern border being a crisis. And the mainstream media on TV did not refer to this as a manufactured crisis. As a matter of fact, we went back to our archives.

We're going to bring that you interview in full. That's coming up tonight. Now, of course, we are here in Texas covering the president's very important trip to the southern border. And today, he toured border facilities. He met with officers at a border patrol station. He attended a security briefing and he sat down with the victims of illegal immigration. And meanwhile, Democratic lawmakers, they were 1,800 miles away in the comfort of their Capitol Hill offices where they still refuse to reopen the government and even negotiate all because President Trump had the audacity to try to improve border security, something they supported just a few years ago. Think about it. In order to obstruct the president's agenda, the hate Trump Democrats, hate Trump media, they actually have to pretend that border security doesn't matter. That walls are somehow immoral. Walls they voted for in the past. And that is, of course, one big manufactured crisis. And they keep saying it again and again and again. Take a look."

And last year, 800 gang members were apprehended at our border. That's a 50 percent increase over 2017. There were also 122 percent increase in fentanyl. And that's being smuggled across the border as well. Ninety percent of the heroin, that's smuggled across the border. That's in every small town and big city in America. And keep in mind, every seven days, 300 Americans are dying. Seventeen thousand individuals with criminal records were apprehended trying to cross the border. Sixty thousand inadmissible or illegal immigrants are turned away from our borders every single month. And over the last 30 days, 20,000 children, they were smuggled or trafficked right here into the United States. On the other side of the border, the crisis is also very real. One out of three migrant women who make this treacherous, dangerous, arduous journey to our southern border are sexually assaulted. We need to protect people on both sides of the border. Seven in 10 migrants have reported being victims of violence during that dangerous trek, and an average of 50 children every day require emergency medical care after they arrive at the southern border. Now, Speaker Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, this is not a manufactured crisis. These are real statistics, real people, real lives and many deaths. This is about life and death. And as you can clearly see, this is humanitarian and a national security crisis of epic proportions. And it's a national security emergency that has now been brewing for years. Somehow in 2014 when Obama was president, well then the mainstream media well they weren't saying it was manufactured then. And they highlighted the crisis. \"The Washington Post\" has reported, quote: White House requests 3.7 billion in emergency funds for border crisis. Now, look at this headline from fake news CNN. Daniel's journey: how thousands of children are creation a crisis in America. Even \"The Huffington Post\" weighed in with a featured story about the southern border being a crisis. And the mainstream media on TV did not refer to this as a manufactured crisis. As a matter of fact, we went back to our archives. Here is how they portrayed this in the media when Obama was president."

Now, that's why fake news CNN's Jim Acosta, he took a selfie stick and literally headed down to the border wall. In an attempt to prove that there is no crisis at our southern border.

There are no migrants trying to rush towards this fence here in the McAllen, Texas area. As a matter of fact, there are some other businesses behind me along this highway. There's a gas station, Burger King and so on, but no sign of the national emergency that the president has been talking about. As a matter of fact, it's pretty tranquil down here."

Now, the wall south of San Diego, that resulted around 92 percent less in terms of illegal traffic. The wall in El Paso, Texas, resulted in a significant drop of trafficking. So did the walls in Tucson, Huma, Arizona, went down 95 percent when it went from 5 miles of barrier to literally 64 miles a barrier. And it's important to note that every American understand what is at stake in all of this -- thousands of real American lives. That's the bottom line. That's who we're fighting for. That's what this whole argument should be about. It's about the safety and security for every single American living in this country -- and, by the way, for people on the other side of the border. Now, it's your government's responsibility to protect these borders. We all must demand our lawmakers do their job. Put politics aside. Take it seriously. How many more Americans have to die? How many more Americans have to get drugs that will brought in from our southern border? We are going to lose 300 Americans a week? How many innocent people get killed like Officer Singh? Or Pierce Corcoran whose parents were on the show the other night? Now, today, I had the honor of interviewing the president of the United States who is fighting his hardest to secure these borders.

It really is when you think of it, whether you are in to the world of law enforcement like these incredible folks behind us that understand the wall so easily, I mean it would make their job so much better. And they could also go to other areas because we have the wall, you don't need so many people. We would probably pay for that many times in one year if you think about it. Just many times.

To the migrants themselves who get raped, robbed and murdered in the hands of some of the criminal cartels, I don't think people fully comprehend it.

And the Democrats, they masquerade, they try to cloak their support for open borders by saying it's compassionate. Sean, it is not compassionate to want even a single little boy or single little girl in the custody of human traffickers. Nobody - look at you and I both have kids, no one wants to see teenage girls in the custody of human traffickers that do unspeakable things. You know what the compassionate thing to do is?

You cannot move through the McAllen into McAllen without paying either the Gulf Cartel or Los Zetas who are in Reno right now.
