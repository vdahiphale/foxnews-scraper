How dare us rubes ask our more sophisticated allies to chip in on the bill especially in public. It's like when the dinner bill comes, it's always that know-it-all at the table who darts to the restroom, leaving you to be the jerk to call him on it because he knows you won't. But he never expected that Trump would be at the table who would do it to his face because, frankly, he's our jerk. Germany spends only 1.24 percent of its GDP on NATO, which was created to curb Soviet expansion. Meanwhile, Germany is pipelining with Putin. Talk about Soviet expansion. Since America is always left with the bill, maybe we can call Germany out for hiding in the john doing dirty deals when the check drops. Now, Trump wants defense spending at 4 percent GDP, twice with these countries already fail to meet. Why would he do that? Maybe to get them to meet the initial target. Could he be a stable genius?",
