So, let's take a look at the July numbers behind the 9.5 percent overall unemployment rate. Let's put them up on the screen: As you can see -- 143,000 census jobs that ended, temporary jobs and were ended as expected. Private employers added just 71,000 jobs. Overall, 131,000 jobs lost last month. Steve, what is all of that tell you about the state of this recovery?",

I think this is going to be an interesting election because it really is over ideas. Look, normally, any administration will suffer if the economy is bad. That's a given. But here, you can make a very strong argument that it's been made worse or the recovery is slower than it would be otherwise. It's going to be about ideas. The administration sold the program on the idea, a very Keynesian idea, we're going to stimulate, we're going to spend, we're going to intrude into the economy with a lot of regulation and to try to create a green economy -- all of this from Washington with experts. And what we know is the numbers are crushingly consistent, the economy is sluggish.  It contrasts with the last really serious recession, '81-'82, the Reagan recession, from which we had a tremendous rebound, the growth of 6 or 7 percent, huge amount of re-employment. It's not happening.  And I think the argument is clear that it's result of the policies of this administration, regulation, higher taxes, which are inevitable as a result of the spending and the debt. We have a $2 trillion of corporate cash sitting on the sidelines. Corporate earnings are good. The market is doing well, the economy is sluggish. All the money is on that -- on the sideline, it's not being invested, and the reason is, uncertainty high taxes, and all of that as a result of the policies of this administration.",

You have these numbers, he picks out a thin sliver of good news and, you know, couches it correctly in all the bad news. And it doesn't add up to very much, right? And the White House realizes that they have before them is a very hard sell, which is it's not as bad as it could be. That's not the kind of slogan that wins elections and they realize that that's a really tough thing for him to go out and say. What they're hoping is that he can continue to talk about what little bits of good news there is and talk about the things that could have happened that didn't and his ideas for trying to create more jobs. Some of which are being opposed by Republicans and that that will be --"

Republicans are, you know, stonewalling and they have their ideological reasons for doing that. And they have economic arguments that they make and can make for the positions they're taking on the economy. But it is -- it is a starkly different position on how to pull us out of this, the president likes to say, this ditch. And I think the president and his team have settled on their message. Democrats on the Hill are happy to hear that he has a consistent message now that he's giving pretty much at every stop he makes. And we'll just have to see."

      "utterance": "Look, if you blame it on Bush after a year-and-a-half to two years, it smacks of desperation. They have no other argument. I think this is going to be an interesting election because it really is over ideas. Look, normally, any administration will suffer if the economy is bad. That's a given. But here, you can make a very strong argument that it's been made worse or the recovery is slower than it would be otherwise. It's going to be about ideas. The administration sold the program on the idea, a very Keynesian idea, we're going to stimulate, we're going to spend, we're going to intrude into the economy with a lot of regulation and to try to create a green economy -- all of this from Washington with experts. And what we know is the numbers are crushingly consistent, the economy is sluggish. It contrasts with the last really serious recession, '81-'82, the Reagan recession, from which we had a tremendous rebound, the growth of 6 or 7 percent, huge amount of re-employment. It's not happening. And I think the argument is clear that it's result of the policies of this administration, regulation, higher taxes, which are inevitable as a result of the spending and the debt. We have a $2 trillion of corporate cash sitting on the sidelines. Corporate earnings are good. The market is doing well, the economy is sluggish. All the money is on that -- on the sideline, it's not being invested, and the reason is, uncertainty high taxes, and all of that as a result of the policies of this administration."

And liberals are saying, you didn't spend enough money, you didn't have a big enough stimulus."

It's about -- it's about a difference in ideas, a difference in ideology. And somebody could make a perfectly good argument that the Obama administration is right and Charles is wrong, that the numbers would be much worse had they not poured this money, had they not done the intervention into the auto industry that they did and it was unpopular. That they didn't take the bank bailout forward. You know, and the public has to decide who they believe. But, ultimately, they're going to decide based on what their family budget feels like, what their life feels like. And that doesn't look very good."

It's not as if, you know, they're falling short of standards that right-wingers set for them. This is what the Obama administration said themselves. And if they charge that Republicans are blocking the agenda, I think the answer from the public at this point at least is: good."

What should we do? What -- is this a good idea? The correct answer is: Great idea but if it were a statue, I'd repeal it tomorrow. But it's not. It's in the Constitution. It's in a kind of a sacred amendment since the Civil War Amendment. And it's also a side issue. The main issue here is illegal immigration, out of control, even though on principle, I would repeal it. I say, let's not spend all of our time changing the Constitution. Let's get immigration reform; meaning, control of the border."

It's good that we have a national consensus against these leaks of military stuff in wartime. I wish we'd had it when we had a Republican administration and those who leaked weren't excoriated as they are now. But instead, were honored with Pulitzer Prizes."

It's hard for me as a reporter to feel that the government has the ability, has the standing to order somebody to give back documents that they have.
