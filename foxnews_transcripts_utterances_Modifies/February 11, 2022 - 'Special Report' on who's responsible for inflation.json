Firefighters form the Maryland Heights Fire Protection District had just wrapped up their rescue training exercises for the day when they saw these two. They were able to pull the pair out in what officials called a very timely fashion. I would say. And here is a heartwarming scene at the San Diego International Airport. Take a look at this, Marine Corps Captain Mo Mills had been deployed for several months during which he learned that he and his wife were expecting a child. Over the weekend Captain Mills returned home with very little advance notice. Hi wife, Dr. Morgan Davis, met him at the airport with a sign that read \"Just in time to be my Valentine.\" We love those, especially ahead of Valentine's Day. Remember guys, Valentine's Day. Think about it. Tomorrow on SPECIAL REPORT, Democrats embrace gerrymandering ahead of a tough election cycle. Just been talking about the polls. Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight. That's it for this SPECIAL REPORT, fair, balanced, and still unafraid, a little different show format. Jesse Watters is coming up next.

Finally tonight, a SPECIAL REPORT salute, dramatic aerial footage captures the moment two teenagers were picked up from an icy lake in St. Louis, Missouri. Firefighters form the Maryland Heights Fire Protection District had just wrapped up their rescue training exercises for the day when they saw these two. They were able to pull the pair out in what officials called a very timely fashion. I would say. And here is a heartwarming scene at the San Diego International Airport. Take a look at this, Marine Corps Captain Mo Mills had been deployed for several months during which he learned that he and his wife were expecting a child. Over the weekend Captain Mills returned home with very little advance notice. Hi wife, Dr. Morgan Davis, met him at the airport with a sign that read \"Just in time to be my Valentine.\" We love those, especially ahead of Valentine's Day. Remember guys, Valentine's Day. Think about it. Tomorrow on SPECIAL REPORT, Democrats embrace gerrymandering ahead of a tough election cycle. Just been talking about the polls. Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight. That's it for this SPECIAL REPORT, fair, balanced, and still unafraid, a little different show format. Jesse Watters is coming up next. He's got this who called \"PRIMETIME.\""
