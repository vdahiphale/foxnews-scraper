North Korea reportedly threatening pull out of the June summit with President Trump after canceling planned talks with South Korea. The State Department, in fact, saying tonight the Singapore sit down is going ahead as planned.  I'm going to explain tonight what the media won't explain, why poor Little Rocket Man is just showing now his ego is bruised and meanwhile, while those in the left-wing media are going nuts, well, President Trump, watch and learn. He's had the upper hand the entire time.  Also breaking right now, President Trump's attorney, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani is now telling NBC News that a potential presidential interview with Robert Mueller is in a, quote, \"holding pattern.\" Plus, the president is demanding that Congress do something, keep their promises for once, build of the southern border wall.  And also tonight, the Russia collision hoax continues to unravel. The House Intel Committee Chairman Devin Nunes is now saying there was never credible evidence for the FBI to even launch an investigation into Trump camping associates. And also brand-new tonight, more monumental setbacks for Robert Mueller's imploding witch hunt and new evidence that the DOJ is, in fact, installing it stonewalling even further. The DOJ meeting with House Chairman Devin Nunes, Trey Gowdy, to review classified Russia probe material is no longer happening tomorrow. It's been rescheduled for next week. More obstructionism.  All of that, plus another major win for the Trump administration. The American hero, Gina Haspel, has now secured the votes needed. She will be the next CIA director.   And we'll call out the mainstream media's lies about what's really going on between Israel and the Palestinians. That and even more in tonight's breaking news opening monologue.",

      "sentences": "The media and the left, they are going insane tonight over reports that the North Korean dictator, little rocket man Kim Jong Un, is threatening to pull out of the planned June 12th summit with President Trump over U.S. and South Korean military drills. Kim Jong Un also reportedly canceled preplanned talks with South Korea.   Before all of you left-wing liberal activists work yourselves into a frenzy, let me give you the truth and some facts. The State Department and Heather Nauert is saying that this summit in Singapore is going on as planned. That's one. And the Pentagon is adding that these military exercises are going to continue. The big takeaway that the left refuses to understand is this: President Trump is already winning without giving anything up in return. So, you idiot ideologues and the destroy-Trump media, you need to watch, learn, how to negotiate. Let's see, the president got three American hostages out and he didn't have to send over cargo planes full of cash and other currencies like Barack Obama did with the mullahs. New satellite images are now showing North Korea is already dismantling their nuclear test site. And as we have told you, Kim Jong Un is inviting the Western media to watch as he decommissions that nuclear facility.  Also, Kim Jong Un, guess what, wow, he's no longer firing missiles over Japan, he is not threatening Guam, he's not threatening the continental U.S. and the rest of the world. And yes, you saw it with your own eyes, well, little rocket man walked across the DMZ to greet South Korea's president.   And what did President Trump give up in return for all of this? Nothing. President Trump is not naive, like Bill Clinton, Barack Obama. They tried to bribe these despots and dictators with billions and hundreds of billions of dollars. What we are seeing here is typical, quintessential Reagan. Trust but verify, in action, before your very eyes.  Kim Jong Un wants to come to the table, then fine. We know the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, he has laid out all the details, all the terms for a possible agreement and that includes complete and total denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. And if little rocket man doesn't want to comply, well, then he has to face the consequences. And President Trump has made clear, North Korea is not going to get away with threatening the world and he will never be able to fully develop a nuclear weapon.  Here's my prediction tonight: Kim Jong Un, well, he's being a little petulant. He's posturing. He's doing a little saber-rattling before he ultimately capitulates, goes to the table.  Even more breaking news to tell you about tonight: President Trump's attorney Rudy Giuliani, former New York City mayor, he's telling NBC News that he has spoken with Mueller and his partisan team of witch hunters in the past 24 hours. He's now saying that a potential presidential interview is being put in a holding pattern, which is great news. Mueller has no business ever questioning the president of the United States. There is no such thing as collusion. Although there might be with Mueller and that oligarch guy. I'll explain.  Remember the leaked special counsel question, asking Trump what he thought, how he felt, how did you feel? Well, those are ridiculous questions. Mueller is clearly setting in that case a perjury trap. No good lawyer would let the president to be interviewed under those conditions. And also tonight, the president, he's continuing to keep his promises to you, the American people, the forgotten men and women that the media never thought would show up in November of 2016. And he's now calling on Congress to do their job, secure the border, do it now.   Take a look.",

The president's poll numbers, the highest he's had in his presidency. And there is the promises that have kept on the Iranian deal, on the embassy in Jerusalem, on tax cuts, on killing the ObamaCare individual mandate. And there are positive results all over the place and, by the way, it hasn't even been two years. Also tonight, this is major, the Russia collusion hoax is unraveling as we predicted right before our eyes. The House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, he is offering up a new proof that the entire thing has always been a witch hunt. Chairman Nunes is now saying that there was never any credible evidence for the FBI to begin probing the Trump campaign.  We know there was a spy supposedly on top of the FISA abuse. He never had any right to do this in the first place. Take a look.  REP. DEVIN NUNES, R—CALIF., CHAIRMAN, HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE: We have yet to see any credible evidence or intelligence that led to the opening of this investigation. I believe they never should have opened a counterintelligence investigation into a political party. Counterintelligence investigations are -- very rarely do they happen, and when they do happen, you have to be very careful because you are using the tools of our intelligence services and relationships with other countries in order to spy on a political campaign, probably not a good idea.",

And that's on top of, of course, the FBI, the DOJ lying, misleading FISA judges, multiple times in order to get a FISA warrant to spy on a Trump campaign associate in the weeks leading up to an election and for an entire year, four judges lied to, they never would have told the truth, they never were told it was a bought and paid for Clinton dossier that was not verified, not corroborated.

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "sentences": "That is an amazing statement. We have been saying that this scandal is the biggest abuse of power scandal and corruption scandal in American history. And that we have been uncovering this, peeling back the onion, this is only the beginning. You got to sit tight and buckle up because everything that the media, the Democrats have been telling you for well over a year is now getting flipped on its head, and all of it, as we told you at the beginning of this year, is boomeranging back on them. While the real Russia scandal is expanding, Robert Mueller's witch hunt is crumbling. It's reaching embarrassing levels. Let's run through some of the recent headlines. 'At Mueller's probe's first trail, expect more blunt lectures from the bench.' That judge, T.S. Ellis III, already smacked down in epic fashion Mueller's team, calling them out for trying to flip Paul Manafort on an effort unrelated. It had to do with the Ukraine and tax fraud from 2005. What does that have to do with Trump and Russia collision?   \"The Washington Times\": Indicted firm, 'Mueller trying to justify his own existence and indict a Russian, any Russian.' These court transcripts reportedly show Robert Mueller indicted a Russian company. It didn't exist at the time they said. Now, this is now showing that Mueller's original indictment was nothing more than an allusion to make it seem like there was some sort of Russia collusion. Mueller never anticipated that the Russians were going to call his bluff. This is a huge embarrassment for him. There are the special counsel, they look foolish, because the team was never prepared, as Andy McCarthy said. It was all for show.   Byron York out with this piece: 'One year down and it's still Mueller time.' And he writes that the Russia probe has been going on for almost three years and there is not one indication what this entire investigation is really about.  Here's what we do know. After all of this time, there is zero evidence of Trump-Russia collusion. It's been a witch hunt, it is a witch hunt, and it is a total sham. And for the sake of the country, it needs to end. And then we have key updates to John Solomon's explosive report that we brought you last night about the FBI Director Mueller actually working with a Russian billionaire, Oleg Deripaska, is his name, now part of the investigation. He was working with them.  There is absolutely nothing wrong -- I'm going to defend Robert Mueller on this. He and other FBI agents, they were trying to free a former FBI retiree, a CIA operative. His name is Robert Levinson from Iran. He was being held hostage. I'm happy that he was working with a Russian billionaire, the oligarch that he somehow convinced the oligarch to give him $27 million to help save an American being held hostage. I have no problem with that at all.  The government should do everything possible in that situation. I'll give Mueller credit. It was the right thing to do.  Here's the issue: it's just a massive conflict of interest rate and that is what we are calling Mueller's Russia collusion here. You know what? If you are going to talk about a guy in the Manafort case that you worked with, that you secured $25 million from, I think you need to reveal something like that.  John Solomon reporting that Russian oligarch was one of the first people of the FBI actually interviewed when they began investigating the Clinton bought and paid for dossier. And as Solomon and others are now exposing, the Russian actually told the FBI the idea of Russian collusion was false. So, now the question is, did the FBI tell the FISA courts that a former trusted source of the heirs told them that there was nothing to this Russia collusion when they were applying for those four FISA warrants? The original application and three subsequent applications, all using the bulk of information from the Clinton bought and paid for unverified dossier with Russian lies. They lied about it to the FISA court, to spy an American citizen, an opposition party campaign member. Another developing story to tell you about tonight. The meeting between the DOJ and the House Committee Chairman Devin Nunes and Trey Gowdy that was reportedly scheduled for next week -- well, that's not happening. Why? Nunes and Gowdy were again supposed to see the $1.2 million classified documents and information that they have been requesting about the Russia investigation.  At this hour, it's unclear why this meeting is no longer happening. But what is clear is that Rod Rosenstein, the Department of Justice, they have been stonewalling Congress every single step of the way and the DOJ is also trying to sabotage the work that people like Nunes, Goodlatte, Gowdy are doing with anonymous leaks. They want to slow roll this until the midterms, hoping Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats take over the House, so then they want to of this. Also tonight, Fox News is learning that Congress has received information from the DOJ that it requested regarding Comey's buddy. Remember, that professor over at Columbia University, now his attorney, Daniel Richman. Remember, he was a special government -- he had special government employee status. Former Obama deep state DOJ official Sally Yates, she -- interestingly, she is going after the president, claiming that he's, quote, tearing down the legitimacy of the DOJ. Sally, you're probably watching. But you and the rest of your deep state cronies, you have already done enough damage. And the sad part is, the rank and file FBI, CIA intelligence, their reputations are smeared because of deep state operatives at the upper echelon and the misdeeds that they did in all of those that we have now proven on this show. And maybe, Sally, you are forgetting you were emailing with Mueller's pitbull, Andrew Weissmann.  And Yates is also one of the corrupt officials that signed off on at least one of the FISA warrants that was unverified, uncorroborated.  So, congratulations, Sally. You've done enough damage to the DOJ, more than any president ever could. One more thing tonight, Trump-hating former CIA director John Brennan is being called out by two of his former colleagues over his public statements about the Clinton bought and paid for dossier. Paul Sperry reporting that two former top officials are actually contradicting Brennan's claim that the dossier did not play a role in the intelligence community's assessment of Russian election meddling. Sperry is pointing out that former NSA Director Mike Rogers told Congress for dossier did in fact play a role in the intel assessments. Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper admitted something similar to CNN. We know Clapper and John Brennan both lied. So it looks like Brennan once again is caught lying.  I guess this isn't surprising from a guy who once voted for the communist for president of the United States. How he ever got that position is beyond any understanding I have. Anyway, finally, tonight, last thing, President Trump is on the verge of another huge victory. This is good news for all of us. Gina Haspel now has the votes to be the next CIA director and the fact that it took this long, just a few weeks ago, Democrats, for them to support her, now, it's pretty disgraceful on their part. Gina Haspel was an American hero. She helped keep us safe after 9/11. She helped get the intelligence to find bin Laden. And here's another fact the left will never admit to. Enhanced interrogation of the three people under medical supervision worked. It gave us the valuable intel, allowed us to get to the courier, which took us right to bin Laden.   Democrats should have been praising Haspel. Actually, they were at the time, because she's more than qualified. Here with reaction, we have columnist for \"The Hill,\" investigative reporter John Solomon, Fox News contributor, investigative reporter Sara Carter, the author of this soon number one \"New York Times\" best seller, soon to be released \"The Russia Hoax,\" Fox News -- what's the rest of the book?

If Deripaska had this interaction with the FBI, it is almost 100 percent certain he called Russia when he got back home and said, hey, the FBI thinks you're colluding. That would give Russian intelligence a chance to have fun with John Brennan CIA and tried to feed them misinformation.

North Korea reportedly threatening pull out of the June summit with President Trump after canceling planned talks with South Korea. The State Department, in fact, saying tonight the Singapore sit down is going ahead as planned. I'm going to explain tonight what the media won't explain, why poor Little Rocket Man is just showing now his ego is bruised and meanwhile, while those in the left-wing media are going nuts, well, President Trump, watch and learn. He's had the upper hand the entire time. Also breaking right now, President Trump's attorney, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani is now telling NBC News that a potential presidential interview with Robert Mueller is in a, quote, \"holding pattern.\" Plus, the president is demanding that Congress do something, keep their promises for once, build of the southern border wall. And also tonight, the Russia collision hoax continues to unravel. The House Intel Committee Chairman Devin Nunes is now saying there was never credible evidence for the FBI to even launch an investigation into Trump camping associates. And also brand-new tonight, more monumental setbacks for Robert Mueller's imploding witch hunt and new evidence that the DOJ is, in fact, installing it stonewalling even further. The DOJ meeting with House Chairman Devin Nunes, Trey Gowdy, to review classified Russia probe material is no longer happening tomorrow. It's been rescheduled for next week. More obstructionism. All of that, plus another major win for the Trump administration. The American hero, Gina Haspel, has now secured the votes needed. She will be the next CIA director. And we'll call out the mainstream media's lies about what's really going on between Israel and the Palestinians. That and even more in tonight's breaking news opening monologue."

Kim Jong Un also reportedly canceled preplanned talks with South Korea. Before all of you left-wing liberal activists work yourselves into a frenzy, let me give you the truth and some facts.

Let's see, the president got three American hostages out and he didn't have to send over cargo planes full of cash and other currencies like Barack Obama did with the mullahs. New satellite images are now showing North Korea is already dismantling their nuclear test site. And as we have told you, Kim Jong Un is inviting the Western media to watch as he decommissions that nuclear facility. Also, Kim Jong Un, guess what, wow, he's no longer firing missiles over Japan, he is not threatening Guam, he's not threatening the continental U.S. and the rest of the world. And yes, you saw it with your own eyes, well, little rocket man walked across the DMZ to greet South Korea's president. And what did President Trump give up in return for all of this? Nothing. President Trump is not naive, like Bill Clinton, Barack Obama. They tried to bribe these despots and dictators with billions and hundreds of billions of dollars. What we are seeing here is typical, quintessential Reagan. Trust but verify, in action, before your very eyes. Kim Jong Un wants to come to the table, then fine. We know the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, he has laid out all the details, all the terms for a possible agreement and that includes complete and total denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. And if little rocket man doesn't want to comply, well, then he has to face the consequences. And President Trump has made clear, North Korea is not going to get away with threatening the world and he will never be able to fully develop a nuclear weapon."

There is no such thing as collusion. Although there might be with Mueller and that oligarch guy. I'll explain. Remember the leaked special counsel question, asking Trump what he thought, how he felt, how did you feel? Well, those are ridiculous questions. Mueller is clearly setting in that case a perjury trap. No good lawyer would let the president to be interviewed under those conditions. And also tonight, the president, he's continuing to keep his promises to you, the American people, the forgotten men and women that the media never thought would show up in November of 2016.

The president's poll numbers, the highest he's had in his presidency. And there is the promises that have kept on the Iranian deal, on the embassy in Jerusalem, on tax cuts, on killing the ObamaCare individual mandate. And there are positive results all over the place and, by the way, it hasn't even been two years. Also tonight, this is major, the Russia collusion hoax is unraveling as we predicted right before our eyes. The House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, he is offering up a new proof that the entire thing has always been a witch hunt. Chairman Nunes is now saying that there was never any credible evidence for the FBI to begin probing the Trump campaign. We know there was a spy supposedly on top of the FISA abuse. He never had any right to do this in the first place. Take a look. REP. DEVIN NUNES, R—CALIF., CHAIRMAN, HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE: We have yet to see any credible evidence or intelligence that led to the opening of this investigation. I believe they never should have opened a counterintelligence investigation into a political party. Counterintelligence investigations are -- very rarely do they happen, and when they do happen, you have to be very careful because you are using the tools of our intelligence services and relationships with other countries in order to spy on a political campaign, probably not a good idea."

      "utterance": "The powerful tools of intelligence used to spy on an opposition party candidate and to those powerful tools used against Americans -- no, that can't happen here. So, there was never any actual credible evidence to launch this investigation. And, of course, Rod Rosenstein conflicted. This is a stunning statement by Devin Nunes. And that's on top of, of course, the FBI, the DOJ lying, misleading FISA judges, multiple times in order to get a FISA warrant to spy on a Trump campaign associate in the weeks leading up to an election and for an entire year, four judges lied to, they never would have told the truth, they never were told it was a bought and paid for Clinton dossier that was not verified, not corroborated. And now, there is a new dynamic to this massive scandal. The possibility of an FBI mole that was inside the Trump campaign? Chairman Nunes is now investigating this huge development. Take a look."

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "That is an amazing statement. We have been saying that this scandal is the biggest abuse of power scandal and corruption scandal in American history. And that we have been uncovering this, peeling back the onion, this is only the beginning. You got to sit tight and buckle up because everything that the media, the Democrats have been telling you for well over a year is now getting flipped on its head, and all of it, as we told you at the beginning of this year, is boomeranging back on them. While the real Russia scandal is expanding, Robert Mueller's witch hunt is crumbling. It's reaching embarrassing levels. Let's run through some of the recent headlines. 'At Mueller's probe's first trail, expect more blunt lectures from the bench.' That judge, T.S. Ellis III, already smacked down in epic fashion Mueller's team, calling them out for trying to flip Paul Manafort on an effort unrelated. It had to do with the Ukraine and tax fraud from 2005. What does that have to do with Trump and Russia collision? \"The Washington Times\": Indicted firm, 'Mueller trying to justify his own existence and indict a Russian, any Russian.' These court transcripts reportedly show Robert Mueller indicted a Russian company. It didn't exist at the time they said. Now, this is now showing that Mueller's original indictment was nothing more than an allusion to make it seem like there was some sort of Russia collusion. Mueller never anticipated that the Russians were going to call his bluff. This is a huge embarrassment for him. There are the special counsel, they look foolish, because the team was never prepared, as Andy McCarthy said. It was all for show."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Byron York out with this piece",
      "utterance": "'One year down and it's still Mueller time.' And he writes that the Russia probe has been going on for almost three years and there is not one indication what this entire investigation is really about. Here's what we do know. After all of this time, there is zero evidence of Trump-Russia collusion. It's been a witch hunt, it is a witch hunt, and it is a total sham. And for the sake of the country, it needs to end. And then we have key updates to John Solomon's explosive report that we brought you last night about the FBI Director Mueller actually working with a Russian billionaire, Oleg Deripaska, is his name, now part of the investigation. He was working with them. There is absolutely nothing wrong -- I'm going to defend Robert Mueller on this. He and other FBI agents, they were trying to free a former FBI retiree, a CIA operative. His name is Robert Levinson from Iran. He was being held hostage. I'm happy that he was working with a Russian billionaire, the oligarch that he somehow convinced the oligarch to give him $27 million to help save an American being held hostage. I have no problem with that at all. The government should do everything possible in that situation. I'll give Mueller credit. It was the right thing to do."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Here's the issue",
      "utterance": "it's just a massive conflict of interest rate and that is what we are calling Mueller's Russia collusion here. You know what? If you are going to talk about a guy in the Manafort case that you worked with, that you secured $25 million from, I think you need to reveal something like that. John Solomon reporting that Russian oligarch was one of the first people of the FBI actually interviewed when they began investigating the Clinton bought and paid for dossier. And as Solomon and others are now exposing, the Russian actually told the FBI the idea of Russian collusion was false. So, now the question is, did the FBI tell the FISA courts that a former trusted source of the heirs told them that there was nothing to this Russia collusion when they were applying for those four FISA warrants? The original application and three subsequent applications, all using the bulk of information from the Clinton bought and paid for unverified dossier with Russian lies. They lied about it to the FISA court, to spy an American citizen, an opposition party campaign member. Another developing story to tell you about tonight. The meeting between the DOJ and the House Committee Chairman Devin Nunes and Trey Gowdy that was reportedly scheduled for next week -- well, that's not happening. Why? Nunes and Gowdy were again supposed to see the $1.2 million classified documents and information that they have been requesting about the Russia investigation. At this hour, it's unclear why this meeting is no longer happening. But what is clear is that Rod Rosenstein, the Department of Justice, they have been stonewalling Congress every single step of the way and the DOJ is also trying to sabotage the work that people like Nunes, Goodlatte, Gowdy are doing with anonymous leaks. They want to slow roll this until the midterms, hoping Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats take over the House, so then they want to of this. Also tonight, Fox News is learning that Congress has received information from the DOJ that it requested regarding Comey's buddy. Remember, that professor over at Columbia University, now his attorney, Daniel Richman. Remember, he was a special government -- he had special government employee status. Former Obama deep state DOJ official Sally Yates, she -- interestingly, she is going after the president, claiming that he's, quote, tearing down the legitimacy of the DOJ. Sally, you're probably watching. But you and the rest of your deep state cronies, you have already done enough damage. And the sad part is, the rank and file FBI, CIA intelligence, their reputations are smeared because of deep state operatives at the upper echelon and the misdeeds that they did in all of those that we have now proven on this show. And maybe, Sally, you are forgetting you were emailing with Mueller's pitbull, Andrew Weissmann. And Yates is also one of the corrupt officials that signed off on at least one of the FISA warrants that was unverified, uncorroborated. So, congratulations, Sally. You've done enough damage to the DOJ, more than any president ever could. One more thing tonight, Trump-hating former CIA director John Brennan is being called out by two of his former colleagues over his public statements about the Clinton bought and paid for dossier. Paul Sperry reporting that two former top officials are actually contradicting Brennan's claim that the dossier did not play a role in the intelligence community's assessment of Russian election meddling. Sperry is pointing out that former NSA Director Mike Rogers told Congress for dossier did in fact play a role in the intel assessments. Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper admitted something similar to CNN. We know Clapper and John Brennan both lied. So it looks like Brennan once again is caught lying. I guess this isn't surprising from a guy who once voted for the communist for president of the United States. How he ever got that position is beyond any understanding I have. Anyway, finally, tonight, last thing, President Trump is on the verge of another huge victory. This is good news for all of us. Gina Haspel now has the votes to be the next CIA director and the fact that it took this long, just a few weeks ago, Democrats, for them to support her, now, it's pretty disgraceful on their part. Gina Haspel was an American hero. She helped keep us safe after 9/11. She helped get the intelligence to find bin Laden. And here's another fact the left will never admit to. Enhanced interrogation of the three people under medical supervision worked. It gave us the valuable intel, allowed us to get to the courier, which took us right to bin Laden. Democrats should have been praising Haspel. Actually, they were at the time, because she's more than qualified. Here with reaction, we have columnist for \"The Hill,\" investigative reporter John Solomon, Fox News contributor, investigative reporter Sara Carter, the author of this soon number one \"New York Times\" best seller, soon to be released \"The Russia Hoax,\" Fox News -- what's the rest of the book? That's the best part."

Robert Mueller then FBI director was able to convince the Russian oligarch to hand over $25 million in an effort to release this American hero, I applaud him for that. It's the hypocrisy, as this oligarch is at the center of the Manafort case in many ways and this oligarch wasn't mentioned, nor was the connection mentioned. How important is that?"

I think the first is, Donald Trump recently sanctioned Oleg Deripaska as part of the Russia sanctions. Did his State Department, did his Treasury Department, tell him this was the man that helped the FBI? Did they also tell him this was a man that tried to clear Donald Trump's name in September 2016 when he told the FBI there is no collusion between Russia and Donald Trump campaign?"

Second thing that's very important, you hit it in your monologue -- did they tell the FISA court that they had a trusted Russian source that was weaving them off collusion before they went and got the search warrant? Here's the third and most interesting thing that intelligence people told me tonight, Sean. If Deripaska had this interaction with the FBI, it is almost 100 percent certain he called Russia when he got back home and said, hey, the FBI thinks you're colluding. That would give Russian intelligence a chance to have fun with John Brennan CIA and tried to feed them misinformation. And that is something that a couple members of Congress told me they are looking at. Did Deripaska actually tip off the Russians enough so that they could feed the U.S. intelligence a false narrative and create doubt in our country? Those are three --"

Any source that does leak out this information is putting themselves in a little bit of jeopardy and I think that's why Congress has been so careful as to not release his name publicly yet.

And Chairman Nunes brought this up and it's very important. They opened a counterintelligence investigation, the special counsel, and remember, it was Comey and Rod Rosenstein, was the one that wrote the letter to President Trump asking for Comey to be fired. And then he appoints a special counsel to investigate why Comey was fired by President Trump. A pattern here that I see --"

So, in response, all the White House has said is that it is aware of that report, while the State Department says it is continuing to go ahead, it is continuing to prepare and plan for next month's summit in Singapore, Sean.

You know for, listen for the liberals out there, the things that go boom, and kill people they were warned multiple times and when the Israelis engaged to defend the border by the way, they established after they gave the land back to Hamas which to these Palestinians which they properly used to shoot rockets into Israel.
