I'm Neil Cavuto, and this is \"Your World.\"  We have got coming up Kentucky Republican Senator Rand Paul on a general who has to wait another few months to find out his fate and whether he's going to do any prison time at all.  And then Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland on if a deal to avoid a government shutdown might be closer than you think, that they actually might agree on something.  First, FOX team coverage with Ashley Webster market rally that looked like it was winding out of gas, until it wasn't, and Catherine Herridge on a Russian probe that could be getting more steam, even though a lot of folks are wondering exactly where it's going. We connect, you decide.  First with Ashley on why stocks were doing a 180 and back again, I think something like that -- Ashley.",

Wall Street continues to battle plenty of volatility; 2,000 stocks have hit that lowest levels in a year. So the question is, what is spooking investors? What's it all about? Well, there are persistent fears that a struggling global economy could indeed wash up on U.S. shores, dragging us down right along with it. There are also persistent fears, jitters over a trade war with China. And underneath all of this is the prospect of the Fed raising interest rates, making borrowing costs more expensive. That in turn has fueled many tweets from the president urging the Fed not to raise rates.   Now, critics say, he shouldn't be doing that. But the administration says, guess what? He has every right.

      "sentences": "Well, that's right, Neil.  The former national security adviser arrived with his wife by his side and his legal team earlier today. The federal Judge Emmet Sullivan laid down on marker at the outset, telling the core -- quote -- \"I cannot recall any incident where the court has ever accepted the plea of someone who has maintained he wasn't guilty. And that's not going to start today.\"  On multiple occasions, federal Judge Sullivan asked Flynn and his legal team whether he wanted to withdraw his guilty plea of lying to federal agents or challenge the circumstances surrounding the January 2017 FBI interview where Flynn was discouraged from having a lawyer and not formally warned that false statements could be prosecuted. A key moment came when Flynn told the court that he knew when the FBI asked him about the Russian ambassador and a December 2016 conversation about sanctions that his lies would be criminal and punishable.   After confirming the guilty plea, the judge seemed to chastise Flynn for making false statements in the West Wing, including lies about the conversation to members of the transition team, the vice president, as well as the FBI. He said -- quote -- \"You sold out your country,\" the judge said, adding he could not rule out incarceration.  The judge also questioned the basis of the case, asking the special counsel lawyer the Flynn phone call with the Russian ambassador was in fact criminal. And after a long pause, the government lawyer said it might be a violation of the Logan Act, which the judge seem to laugh, saying, isn't that the act that no one has been charged with?  So there will be a status report in this case, Neil, in 90 days. And this will give Flynn an opportunity to cooperate further with the special counsel in an effort to mitigate any jail time that he may face. But the judge said today that he wouldn't rule out incarceration. As a final note, separately, in the last hour, we have had the transcript released from the former FBI Director James Comey's testimony on Capitol Hill yesterday. One of the interesting headlines that I have identified is an exchange with Congressman Jim Jordan asking him when he felt that he had concerns about the national security adviser, Mike Flynn, and why he didn't share that information with the president. That's important because of one of the jobs for the FBI director is to be looking out for the national security interests of the Cabinet, as well as senior political appointees. But, in this case, Director Comey chose not to advise the president and allow it to mature into a criminal investigation.   And folks can home can decide what they think the motivation there may have been, Neil.",

And it really seems to care big time ahead of what I consider to be one of the biggest Fed meetings we have seen in many, many years, all the way back to say when a young Janet Yellen was raising interest rates for the first time, after keeping them at zero.

Wall Street continues to battle plenty of volatility; 2,000 stocks have hit that lowest levels in a year. So the question is, what is spooking investors? What's it all about? Well, there are persistent fears that a struggling global economy could indeed wash up on U.S. shores, dragging us down right along with it. There are also persistent fears, jitters over a trade war with China. And underneath all of this is the prospect of the Fed raising interest rates, making borrowing costs more expensive. That in turn has fueled many tweets from the president urging the Fed not to raise rates. Now, critics say, he shouldn't be doing that. But the administration says, guess what? He has every right.

    {
      "speaker": "CATHERINE HERRIDGE, CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Well, that's right, Neil. The former national security adviser arrived with his wife by his side and his legal team earlier today. The federal Judge Emmet Sullivan laid down on marker at the outset, telling the core -- quote -- \"I cannot recall any incident where the court has ever accepted the plea of someone who has maintained he wasn't guilty. And that's not going to start today.\" On multiple occasions, federal Judge Sullivan asked Flynn and his legal team whether he wanted to withdraw his guilty plea of lying to federal agents or challenge the circumstances surrounding the January 2017 FBI interview where Flynn was discouraged from having a lawyer and not formally warned that false statements could be prosecuted. A key moment came when Flynn told the court that he knew when the FBI asked him about the Russian ambassador and a December 2016 conversation about sanctions that his lies would be criminal and punishable. After confirming the guilty plea, the judge seemed to chastise Flynn for making false statements in the West Wing, including lies about the conversation to members of the transition team, the vice president, as well as the FBI. He said -- quote -- \"You sold out your country,\" the judge said, adding he could not rule out incarceration. The judge also questioned the basis of the case, asking the special counsel lawyer the Flynn phone call with the Russian ambassador was in fact criminal. And after a long pause, the government lawyer said it might be a violation of the Logan Act, which the judge seem to laugh, saying, isn't that the act that no one has been charged with? So there will be a status report in this case, Neil, in 90 days. And this will give Flynn an opportunity to cooperate further with the special counsel in an effort to mitigate any jail time that he may face. But the judge said today that he wouldn't rule out incarceration. As a final note, separately, in the last hour, we have had the transcript released from the former FBI Director James Comey's testimony on Capitol Hill yesterday. One of the interesting headlines that I have identified is an exchange with Congressman Jim Jordan asking him when he felt that he had concerns about the national security adviser, Mike Flynn, and why he didn't share that information with the president. That's important because of one of the jobs for the FBI director is to be looking out for the national security interests of the Cabinet, as well as senior political appointees. But, in this case, Director Comey chose not to advise the president and allow it to mature into a criminal investigation. And folks can home can decide what they think the motivation there may have been, Neil."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "He said that he didn't deal it was proper and right to share that information with the president. I'm just wondering, for those who like to see something potentially festering beyond Flynn and whether the president had knowledge of it, this shows, at least at that stage, we're going back to the spring of 2017, the president didn't seem to have any idea, because it was something that Comey then, still technically the FBI director, didn't share."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HERRIDGE",
      "utterance": "He didn't share. And what I would say -- and this was certainly a criticism of the inspector general and the actions of the FBI director -- was this tendency to keep things on close hold with the bureau that in the case of some of these investigations should have been shared with the Justice Department. And folks at home can reach their own conclusions over whether he should have notified the president he had concerns on a national security basis. He decided not to do that. And then it matured into the criminal investigation and prosecution, if you will, or guilty plea for Flynn."

We don't know what's going to happen to Michael Flynn come three months from now, when he's back before presumably the same judge on sentencing. Markets abhor uncertainty, which is why they were kind of all over the map today, and all of this is playing on your money and your pocketbook in more ways than you know. Let's go to market watcher Scott Martin. We got Ted Weisberg, Danielle DiMartino Booth. Ted Weisberg, to you.

Inflation's under control. Wages are rising. That's all a positive. And the markets should be reacting positively to all that. The problem we have is tariffs, good cop, bad cop. What are we doing? The Fed. The Fed seems to have lost its way. We will probably get a little more direction from them tomorrow, and it'll be the message, not so much what they do. But it comes down to uncertainty and there's just so much uncertainty in so many quarters, that, quite frankly, the market just has trouble dealing with it."

So that's why I tend to look at intraday chart of the markets. And I found it interesting that with the delay in finding out whether Michael Flynn was going to be sentenced -- and ultimately he wasn't sentenced and it was put until March -- on top of the back and forth on a government shutdown, it was as if the markets just were sort of saying, we don't know. We don't know how to deal with this."

      "utterance": "Yes. Neil, these days, you don't have to find one event, because you can find many. I mean, really any given day, like Teddy pointed out, the market is finding ways, Neil, to be angry about things or less sanguine, let's say, than we were just a couple months ago, when, frankly, a lot of these things were out there already. I mean, the China wars were going on. The Democrats were going after Trump. We had some slowing economic data. But now the market seems to care. And it really seems to care big time ahead of what I consider to be one of the biggest Fed meetings we have seen in many, many years, all the way back to say when a young Janet Yellen was raising interest rates for the first time, after keeping them at zero. So, to me, this is a big like headwind potentially now with what the Fed is going to do tomorrow, because I think the market is telling them to take a pause."

The Fed notwithstanding, I have a theory -- and I could be wrong -- and you know I have been wrong on many such theories -- that it used to be that the Mueller probe, what would happen to Flynn, where is it going, was just outside noise to these guys. They didn't pay much attention because they didn't think it was amounting to much. Then the mystery and intrigue builds up, and then a canceled sentencing hearing, on top of the government shutdown stuff and whether the Fed's overdoing it. And all of a sudden, the Mueller thing gets a little bit more influence than we have given it before. Is it among the things you worry about? Or is it just a variable that you just factor in?"

It makes a difference for the markets. Obviously, the economy and the market are so intertwined at this juncture.

And I would like to bring up something about what President Trump tweeted out this morning. He's recognizing that the Federal Reserve is not just raising interest rates, but that it is also pulling liquidity out of the system to the tune of $50 billion a month. There are many things that are buttressing these markets. And everything - - yes, everything does matter."

But, as you have reminded me, underneath that, a lot of these issue stocks are well into bear market territory, and then some.

So now we have gone through this normalization period, which has been well- telegraphed by the previous Fed and the current Fed. And so you had a stock market that went from the trading lows, if you want to use that, of March of 2009, when we were 6500 on the Dow, to, what, 26000. And so, yes, we're giving a little back.

And the fact that the Federal Reserve is so involved in -- with determining what the interest rate is, inevitably, it leads to misallocation in the marketplace. I think the whole real estate boom had to do with the Federal Reserve keeping interest rates below market. But also quantitative easing and control of the interest rates, I think, has led to the stock market boom. So I think there will be a correction. It's always been, to my -- to my mind, a question of -- that it's taken this long for the marketplace to decide that, as quantitative easing gets less of an easing, that there will be a correction. And I think that's where we are now."

Is there an ultimate underpinning that is eroding away for the whole country, when we accumulate a $22 trillion debt, when we borrow more than a million-and-a-half dollars a minute? So I think both -- both are a problem. We shouldn't willy-nilly shut the government down, but we also shouldn't just keep it open and keep spending money like there's no tomorrow."

Regardless of what you think of the Mueller probe, are you worried this drags on and on and on?"

    {
      "speaker": "PAUL",
      "utterance": "Yes. And I think the interesting thing about the Mueller probe and about -- with General Flynn in particular, is, I have always been a critic of the idea that you can listen to someone's phone call without a warrant. And that's what they did to General Flynn. I think it basically was entrapment. I think what they did should be illegal, if it isn't already illegal, what they did to him. But then, on the other issue, the other issue to me is a little unseemly, the idea of people lobbying for foreign governments. In fact, I'm toying with the idea and contemplating and in discussions of whether, well, we should just make a law that you can't do lobbying for foreign governments, because it really does appear to be divided loyalty. Whether you're in government or not, I don't like the idea that Saudi Arabia spend tens of millions of dollars every year hiring people for their interests. Their ambassador should come to our capital and tell us what the interests of Saudi Arabia are, but we shouldn't have people -- think about Ukraine. You got pro-Western Ukraine, pro-Russian Ukraine."

What we do know that was inappropriate, by own self-admittance of James Comey, is that the FBI broke standard protocol in the way that they came in and ambushed General Flynn, and in the way that they questioned him, and in the way that they encouraged him not to have White House Counsel's Office present."

But I -- but I do know that it was a trap for the unwary. And I do know if someone like Jim Comey had pulled a stunt like that in my administration, that would have been cause to get rid of him."

    {
      "speaker": "JOHN ROBERTS, CORRESPONDENT",

And also, as James Comey has admitted, they didn't follow the typical protocols when the FBI wants to interview a White House official. And they didn't do that because they thought that the Trump White House in the early going was in such a chaotic mess that they could probably get away with just -- quote -- \"sending a couple of guys over.\" But the White House is surprised as everybody else about this 90-day delay in the sentencing, but seemingly unconcerned about the potential implications of it, because the three months that Flynn got in abeyance of his sentencing is to allow him to cooperate in a case involving two of his former business partners in the Eastern District of Virginia and has nothing to do with the president.

Again, Sarah Sanders."

And when he was asked by Judge Sullivan today if he wished to retract his guilty plea, he said, no, let's -- let's go ahead with it.

Now, they would still have to move this through the House and the Senate, and the president would have to sign it. Now, here's the big question right now. Why would Nancy Pelosi, the incoming House speaker, want to accommodate that? Mitch McConnell says there isn't going to be a government shutdown.

One of the things bills that's already been passed into law is the military construction VA bill. And what you could do, with a blessing by Congress, is move money from the Army Corps of Engineers and ask them to basically pay for the wall.

This is not about whether we need border security. We need border security. It's about not wasting a lot of taxpayer money on something most people think is ineffective.

One is, earlier in this appropriations process, there was agreement between Republican and Democratic senators not to spend money on a wall -- that was clearly agree that that was effective -- but on a funding level. But the president has rejected that. He says he wants this additional slush fund. There was -- there were talks, as you know, about six months ago that would have addressed immigration reform more comprehensively, would have put a path toward legalization and eventually citizenship for dreamers who played by all the rules."

      "speaker": "VAN HOLLEN",
      "utterance": "Well, what's happened is, the president now has just said it's his way or the highway, it's his way or he's going to shut down the government. The reality is, during the summer, the president, I think people remember, had that meeting at the White House. He said he wanted a -- quote -- \"bill of love\" to address the problems and challenges with the dreamers. People went to work on Capitol Hill. We got a bipartisan agreement here. It got over 55 votes. But it didn't get to the magic number of 60, largely because, after asking Congress to come up with a bipartisan agreement, when they did, the president pulled the rug out from under that proposal. So now we just want to focus on trying to resolve this issue, not shut down the government. One way to do it would be to have a short-term continuing resolution."

This is very low on their priority list, maybe because we have gotten so used to this. Look at this under various presidents, from Gerald R. Ford, who had them. Jimmy Carter had five shutdowns. Ronald Reagan had eight. George Bush Sr. had one. Of course, this would be the third under this president. The fact of the matter is, they're not unprecedented. The one with Bill Clinton, of course, during the Gingrich era was a very different one and went on for a while. And it caused a political tumult. But the fact of the matter is, we have gotten used to this. Now, we just talked to Democratic Senator Van Hollen, who says, this is avoidable and we -- and there's still a way we can all enjoy your holiday. Let's get the read from his Republican counterpart, the incoming Senate majority whip, John Thune, who joins us right now. Senator, it seemed, from what Senator Van Hollen was saying, that this -- this is avoidable, because there might be more common ground than we appreciate. Is there?"

      "utterance": "My hope would be that, by this end of the week on Friday -- and, of course, the government funding resolution runs until midnight on Friday -- that sometime between now and then, that cooler heads will prevail. But, at the moment, we are at an impasse. And we're at an impasse because the Democrats have rejected and blocked funding for border security, for a border wall, something that the president has been very committed to and passionate about, and that there is widespread support for among Republicans in both the House and the Senate. So..."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "But is the $5 billion figure ironclad to you, Senator? In other words, the president says $5 billion for that wall, or I'm shutting the government down. Are you of same mind-set, that it's $5 billion or bust?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "THUNE",
      "utterance": "Well, I don't think that the president has -- has even said that. Now, the president wants $5 billion. And, frankly, the Department of Homeland Security, that's what they need. And that's what we ought to be approving. But, earlier today, I think, as you know, the president and the Republican leadership advanced a proposal that would use the $1.6 billion that's already been approved by the Senate Appropriations Committee, and then another, a billion or so, that would -- that would go toward border security, not to include a wall, very reasonable. I mean, the White House, in my view, on this has been eminently reasonable. And I think what you're getting from the Democrats right now is a very cold reaction because they're under so much pressure from their political base not to agree to any funding for border security. But it does contradict..."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, so this is -- this issue that Van Hollen was raising with us, Senator, was whether that represents funding partly through a slush fund, which he was dead set against. You're saying that wouldn't be the case. Are you of the mind-set that reallocating funds from another department, let's say Defense, is a wise strategy, or would that be rejected out of hand?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "THUNE",
      "utterance": "I'm not a big fan of moving money. I think Defense ought to -- we ought to be building airplanes and ships and all the things that we need to do to defend the country. But there are -- there are always dollars in budgets that you can move on around, and in the Homeland Security budget, for example. And that's the way that the appropriators came up with a mechanism that would allow another roughly billion dollars to be used for border security, but limited to border security measures other than a fence, other than a border wall, which is what the Democrats have been advocating for."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

    {
      "speaker": "THUNE",
      "utterance": "So, it seems to me, at least right now, that they are being entirely unreasonable in this discussion, Neil. I hope that they will come back around, because they have all voted for this stuff in the past. You go to back to 2013."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, now, they have a distinction with that. And I don't know who is right, Senator. You follow this stuff more closely than I. That, in the past, they have agreed to comprehensive reform that would also call for tightening security the border, not, as Van Hollen was just telling us, for building a wall, per se. It all might be semantics at this point, but is it your sense that the $5 billion figure isn't ironclad, that it could be a lesser amount, as long as it stays within rough budgetary guidelines?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "THUNE",
      "utterance": "Correct. And I think that's exactly the -- what, again, Republicans, I think, and the president have been very reasonable in advancing ideas that they view as being middle ground."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "But the president hasn't always said that. Earlier on, he was pretty stuck on that $5 billion. And you're arguing now -- and my interpretation might be wrong -- that he is flexible, and that $5 billion isn't a drop-dead figure?"

      "speaker": "THUNE",

And just to your point, I mean, the Democrats did vote in 2013, every Senate Democrat, Neil, voted for 700 miles of wall, so -- as part of the immigration bill that was considered that year. So, this -- when they say that this can't be for the wall, and we have never voted for the wall, that's not true. They have those votes in the past."

      "utterance": "All right, Michael Flynn leaving a courthouse in Washington today. He was supposed to be sentenced. That ended up not happening. He is still going to cooperate with the Mueller probe. That could take a final sentencing decree some time in March, next March, to decide whether he goes to jail or what. Former DOJ official Berkeley Law Professor John Yoo. Professor, the one thing that occurs to me is whether his own legal team hurt him. What do you think?>"

    {
      "speaker": "JOHN YOO, FORMER DEPUTY ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL",
      "utterance": "Well, could see why you might think that, because they tried to make the case, in order to justify that he shouldn't serve any jail time, that General Flynn had somehow been tricked into trying to the FBI. And if you look at the transcript of the former FBI Director Jim Comey before the House, the House members, Republican members, were trying to press the same idea in their questioning. Was General Flynn somehow set up? Because he wasn't really testifying in any kind of criminal investigation. He was advised that he didn't need to have a lawyer present. He wasn't told he was a subject or a target of any kind of crime."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "But, bottom line, he willingly and willfully lied, right? So I mean, we can talk about whether someone's set up or not. And I understand where you're going there, Professor. But what I would like to know is, when the judge came around and asked him if he -- to explain his presence there and whether he believed -- did he lie, he lied, he said, yes, I lied and all and I'm OK with it and move on, but that he was pinned into a corner, ironically, this time by his own legal team, where -- making it impossible for the judge to sentence him, right? Or no?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "YOO",
      "utterance": "Well, first, I think the judge overreacted. He said several things in the hearing which I think are just flatly untrue."

    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "The treasonous thing was over the top. And he even had to dial that back afterwards, right?"

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "YOO",
      "utterance": "The worst he did was, he didn't register as a foreign agent for the Turkish government, which I think was wrong. And he also -- but you look at the transcripts of all these hearings, General Flynn did not -- there's a good question whether he was willingly trying to deceive these FBI agents or not in a criminal investigation. But I do think you're right. I think General Flynn's lawyers might have gone too far trying to pretend the General Flynn didn't really lie and that he was set up. But he did -- as you say, he still did tell a lie to the FBI agents."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "So, what I'm asking, I guess, Professor, is now, come March, I mean, is there anything that -- bad seeds planted here that would get the judge say, next time I see you in March, and I know you're talking about cooperating with the Mueller probe and all, you are going to spend some time in jail?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "YOO",
      "utterance": "Well, I think that's not clear. I think the judge, as you pointed out, he realized he went too far. He pulled back and he retracted several of his statements. But several things the judge -- I think, if I were General Flynn, I would be worried because this judge is clearly against him. He said, I'm disgusted with you. I have disdain for you."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "YOO",
      "utterance": "That's very rare for a trial judge to actually say to someone in sentencing, a retired decorated general like General Flynn. So if you were Flynn, you're his lawyers, you would say, you better cooperate a lot with Mueller and hope the Mueller investigation comes to the court and says a lot of great things about your cooperation."

    {
      "speaker": "YOO",
      "utterance": "Well, first, I think President Trump may be hurting General Flynn's case, more hurting it than helping it by tweeting about it at all, because every time President Trump tweets about it, this judge, given what we have seen of him already, he's going to be suspicious."

    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "But it doesn't indicate any involvement on the part of the president of the United States prior, though, right? So that's still an open question. It just means that Flynn, in the meantime, has to stew a while, right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "YOO",
      "utterance": "Well, that's right, Neil. If you look at the documents, President Trump's not involved at all. In fact, what Jim Comey says is, the reason we sent the agents over to talk to Flynn in the first place is, we thought Flynn was lying to Vice President Pence, might have been lying to the president."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "True."
    },

      "speaker": "YOO",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right. So, that, we won't know until next March, right, what happens to General Flynn. What if I told you there is something we will know, like, tomorrow, having nothing to do with that, having everything to do with interest rates and the cost it takes you to borrow money? Tomorrow, the Federal Reserve will announce by mid-afternoon whether it's going to hike interest rates yet again. The betting seems to be that, if it doesn't hike, the markets will panic; if it does hike, the markets will panic. It's weird. \"The Five\" is now.
