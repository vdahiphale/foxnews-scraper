No longer are we going to allow other countries to break the rules, steal our jobs, and drain our wealth.  We must lower the tax on business, one of the highest in the world, and we must repeal job-killing Obamacare. We have to do that.  We hope John McCain gets better very soon because we miss him. He's a crusty voice in Washington, plus we need his vote.",

The question is when he will be back on that health care vote. This as we get some new polls about the president's job approval rating, Bloomberg poll on the approval rating, approve 40 percent, disapprove, 56 percent disapprove. You can see the change from September, 2016. Monmouth out with a new poll, approval at 39 percent, 52. Interesting poll from \"The Wall Street Journal.\" They looked at the counties that voted for Donald Trump and the approval, disapproval. And then the flip counties, these are counties that went for President Obama and flipped to President Trump in this election. And there you see the disapprove, 51-44 and the surge counties, these are ones that surged to big numbers for Donald Trump. And you can see he's holding strong mayor, 56-40.  Let's bring in our panel to look at all the elements today: Michael Crowley, senior foreign affairs correspondent for Politico; Julie Pace, White House correspondent for the Associated Press, and Matthew Continetti, editor in chief of The Washington Free Beacon.   OK, Julie, today's push was buy and sell American. How much is that getting through?",

Really they've been in this position where every time they feel like they found her footing, every time they feel like they've had a positive message, something on the Russia investigation overtakes it. This is their attempt to be proactive. This is going to be a series of three weeks where they are going to be rolling out a theme. They have done this previously, I will say. There was an infrastructure week that was much maligned because we didn't really care much about infrastructure. And I think it's important to note that every time the White House has one of these theme weeks and something is overtaken, it's often because the president himself is throwing other issues on the table. So this will be a big challenge for them, not just whether they can stay on message in the press shop and whether they can hold events every day, but whether the president can restrain himself on Twitter in particular and keep other messages from overtaking it.",
