As for what's being called the compromise bill drafted by the Republican leadership, the vote on that is being delayed until tomorrow to try to shore up more support.

He has, obviously, this issue which is on a tremendous amount of political attention. You've got midterm elections coming up. You know he campaigned on getting things done and making sure that he was going to make positive changes. He's somebody who is very good at getting deals done. So, you know, I'm optimistic and that he's going to get involved in this and try very hard to push on it. He's got to get the votes.

I don't even think after the midterms it's ever going to get done. And the Democrats when they had a super majority under Barack Obama they did nothing on immigration. The Democrats just want to blame Republicans for the issue and score political point. But I don't think this whole separating families thing is a big winner for the Democrats. I think they've overplayed their hands. They've exposed themselves as complete open borders advocates. The president completely shut the deal down. He's keeping families together. Now they're complaining that they're abusing children. Melania goes down and now they're complaining about the jacket. You're never going to get a win on this issue. I think like a normal issue like gas prices, healthcare, jobs, those are the things that actually affect the lives of everyday Americans. Yes, migrant families will tug at your heart strings and makes you feel sad and you want to find a solution, but it's not going to be a driving issue for regular voters in the midterm elections.",

It's about elections. We know that what Trump does will never be enough. It will be seen as even less humane than what was before. So, the liberal opinion is this. If you split up families you're a Nazi, whether the family is pretend or not you're a Nazi. But if you keep them together you're worse than a Nazi. So they actually have no solution. Liberals become paralyzed when faced with having to solve a problem. And the media puts some notion before facts so they just contribute to it. So now you're having critics of Trump actually arguing against their own wishes. So, now, OK, we're going to keep the families together, or the pseudo families together, or whatever, you should be happy that they're now detained. Now that's awful. I have to give credit to CNN because I always bash CNN. But I said yesterday that a lot of these problems existed under Obama and they were really, really bad problems, but the media never talks about it.

So, for the bias-impaired here's news: Trump just reduced the risk of nuclear war. He also got remains of 200 U.S. soldiers back from North Korea just a week after the issue was raised. He's bringing in record-low unemployment, helping women and minorities most. He's addressed trade imbalances as our GDP climbs higher. So, if he's monster, he might be the worst monster ever -- meaning, not a monster at all. That's why optimism is high: 95 percent of manufacturers have a positive company outlook. It's good news.

So something is happening there. But a couple other things I think that the Republicans should be concerned about. One is that I just watched an ad by M.J. Hegar. She's a Democrat running against a congressman, an incumbent congressman in Texas. It's one of the best ads I have ever seen. And she's a -- it's not a progressive bunch of thing. She's a veteran. She took on the Defense Department for women in combat. She's now running against a congressman, that was her congressman that said that they didn't want to meet with her, because she was not a donor. So, they're not, like, running on really progressive issues in some of these competitive districts. So the Democrats have been really smart on that. The other thing that I think that's interesting is that a new Pew poll that also was today, Republicans trusted on the economy by plus 9 over Democrats. So that's really good. Only plus 1 on trade. I think that's what's happening. But what are people talking about today, this past week, and who knows what we'll talk about next week? Immigration. And I was really surprised by this number, that Democrats have a 14-point advantage over Republicans on immigration. And I was really surprised about that.",

That was a huge rejection of Obamacare. Or in 2006, when the Democrats swept in under President Bush, that was a rejection of all those scandals, you know, Foley and all that stuff. And a little bit of the Iraq War. I don't see an issue right now in the country where the Republicans have overreached or blown it or done something so awful that the rest of the country has to say, \"Smack you in the face, and we need the Democrats to come in and take over.\" With the roaring economy and record-breaking consumer confidence.

However, I think it might be a little bit of a struggle because there is some pretty, you know, differing opinions and viewpoints and he also has his base he's thinking about. He has, obviously, this issue which is on a tremendous amount of political attention. You've got midterm elections coming up. You know he campaigned on getting things done and making sure that he was going to make positive changes. He's somebody who is very good at getting deals done. So, you know, I'm optimistic and that he's going to get involved in this and try very hard to push on it. He's got to get the votes.

And we're not going to get any help from the Democrats at all. So, there's just no consensus and there's nothing that's ever going to be done on immigration. I don't even think after the midterms it's ever going to get done. And the Democrats when they had a super majority under Barack Obama they did nothing on immigration. The Democrats just want to blame Republicans for the issue and score political point. But I don't think this whole separating families thing is a big winner for the Democrats. I think they've overplayed their hands. They've exposed themselves as complete open borders advocates. The president completely shut the deal down. He's keeping families together. Now they're complaining that they're abusing children. Melania goes down and now they're complaining about the jacket. You're never going to get a win on this issue. I think like a normal issue like gas prices, healthcare, jobs, those are the things that actually affect the lives of everyday Americans. Yes, migrant families will tug at your heart strings and makes you feel sad and you want to find a solution, but it's not going to be a driving issue for regular voters in the midterm elections."

If you split up families you're a Nazi, whether the family is pretend or not you're a Nazi. But if you keep them together you're worse than a Nazi. So they actually have no solution. Liberals become paralyzed when faced with having to solve a problem. And the media puts some notion before facts so they just contribute to it. So now you're having critics of Trump actually arguing against their own wishes. So, now, OK, we're going to keep the families together, or the pseudo families together, or whatever, you should be happy that they're now detained. Now that's awful. I have to give credit to CNN because I always bash CNN.

I think that's what we're seeing writ large today. Republicans can't get it together and they have people literally fighting on the house floor.

So it's long lasting change from a legislative perspective versus an executive order like Jesse points out that can be undone? Yes. He's at a rally. He's not demonizing anybody. I mean, let's not sugar coat the issue. You're not supposed to break the law and come into the country illegally. Nevertheless, we have to deal with this issue and with children coming over in a compassionate way but still enforce the law. This nation, this country has a right to have its laws upheld and have them observed, and there's policies and procedures in place. We welcome immigrants. All of us have background as immigrants, and family members that have come over here, great. God bless, OK? We embrace people. This is a country that is very humanitarian.

Because there's a Republican. And it wouldn't matter if it's Trump. If it was Marco Rubio, if it was Jeb Bush, they'd still be demonizing and it's not the same. Both sides are not politicizing it. It's on the same level. It is so out of proportion on the left's side because they have ignored the suffering of children for so long until now. But they don't care about Chicago.

      "utterance": "Well, it's certainly like even three months ago the Democrats looked to be in a much better position for the midterm elections. That has pretty much been erased. New poll today, I can't remember which poll it was, but it was a legit one showing the congressional ballot now just 6 points, where it was 15 points for Democrats in March. So something is happening there. But a couple other things I think that the Republicans should be concerned about. One is that I just watched an ad by M.J. Hegar. She's a Democrat running against a congressman, an incumbent congressman in Texas. It's one of the best ads I have ever seen. And she's a -- it's not a progressive bunch of thing. She's a veteran. She took on the Defense Department for women in combat. She's now running against a congressman, that was her congressman that said that they didn't want to meet with her, because she was not a donor. So, they're not, like, running on really progressive issues in some of these competitive districts. So the Democrats have been really smart on that. The other thing that I think that's interesting is that a new Pew poll that also was today, Republicans trusted on the economy by plus 9 over Democrats. So that's really good. Only plus 1 on trade. I think that's what's happening. But what are people talking about today, this past week, and who knows what we'll talk about next week? Immigration. And I was really surprised by this number, that Democrats have a 14-point advantage over Republicans on immigration. And I was really surprised about that."

      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Well, maybe that's depressed conservatives who are upset that the wall hasn't been built fast enough. You could see that, obviously. And on another note, the economy, if you have a good committee in a midterm election, it's going to help you. And a lot of the rejections that you've seen, I think it was 2010 with Barack Obama. That was a huge rejection of Obamacare. Or in 2006, when the Democrats swept in under President Bush, that was a rejection of all those scandals, you know, Foley and all that stuff. And a little bit of the Iraq War. I don't see an issue right now in the country where the Republicans have overreached or blown it or done something so awful that the rest of the country has to say, \"Smack you in the face, and we need the Democrats to come in and take over.\" With the roaring economy and record-breaking consumer confidence. And safety. I mean, ISIS has been defeated. People feel safe. And the Republicans are evaluated very highly on national security. Safety and prosperity, I think, are really going to help Republicans in November."

So that's why a lot of this stuff isn't sticking anymore. And it's amazing to watch the left, you know, immerse in all this good news. They're like gold panners in 1849 with a little pan.

Why? Because like last night in Minnesota. Here he is talking about trade, but, guess what? A place like Duluth, they're going to lose about 1,800 jobs, I should say, because of trade wars with, guess who? Canada, their neighbor to the north.

And this week, Tehran's Provisional Council made a last-minute decision allowing women to attend the screening of the game in Tehran's largest stadium. It's the first time they've been allowed to do that since 1979. Iran lost to Spain 0-1, so not a high scoring game. But women still celebrated. Many hope this will lead to permanently reversing their ban. So glad to see them get to go."

She becomes only the second world leader to give birth while in office. The first, Pakistan's Benazir Bhutto in 1990. And in an interesting twist of fate, today is also Bhutto's birthday. Ardern is not married. Her partner, a TV news presenter, plans to be a stay-at-home dad. One Kiwi commentator said it was a historic moment, because the birth shows that pregnant women can do their jobs. Ardern is taking a six-week maternity leave. Congratulations to all."
