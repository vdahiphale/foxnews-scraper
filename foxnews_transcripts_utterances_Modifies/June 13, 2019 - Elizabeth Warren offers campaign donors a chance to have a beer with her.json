So, during the 2016 election, apparently, it was OK to reach out with cash and money to pay foreign actors to get research from Russian adversarial sources to then bring it to the FBI. But Nancy Pelosi today is saying that if someone reaches out to you as a Republican, that is unethical. That is a criminal cover-up and that is not allowed.  When it comes to the dossier, when the left was exposed as being behind the funding for that, the Clinton campaign and the DNC, they claimed it was just opposition research. It doesn't matter that it came from a foreign source or who the source was. We were doing our job as a campaign to get information. But when the president uses the same argument from the Oval Office saying he might call the FBI but he's going to listen to the information, then all of a sudden, they are calling for more impeachment on the basis that he's a criminal. Well, there's a double standard here. Do we want foreign interference in our elections? No. There are reasons why we have laws about foreign donations and foreign money being used for campaigns. But if are going to talk about this, there's going to be a whole lot of people in Washington, D.C., who were guilty of colluding or using information from foreign governments, including Democrats, to interfere in elections and legislation.",

And I think that he realizes because it pulls terribly, especially with reliable senior citizens who are voters or baby boomers or even the silent generation and part of generation x who says, no, obviously, that's a failed system. It has failed all around the world. But I think what they really want is not socialism and that the government is running the industries and deciding things. What they really want is a much larger welfare state. They might have to find a different word to explain what that means because welfare -- larger welfare state probably is going to sell either. But their argument is that if people think that they have their health care taken care of and they are not going to be buried in college education debt, then that -- then it'll be fine. The thing that conservatives have to think about is that people are becoming much more willing to think that the government can solve these problems for them.",

Impeach! I mean, you have to be kidding me. Trump gets word that Bernie stiffed a waitress he has to call the FBI? There are thousand different hypothetical scenarios that you could be talking about. What did the president say? I'd listen. Maybe I would call the FBI. That's all he said. The left is freaking out over a hypothetical but they are not looking at the reality. Hillary actually did this. Hillary paid a foreign agent to get Russian dirt and then she used it to wiretap President Trump. Or what about warrants foreign interference? How about all those foreign governments paid millions of dollars to Clinton Foundation when she was running for president? Or little Adam Schiff. Remember he was on the phone call. We have the audio. We have naked Trump. He was all ears. He didn't call the FBI. The whole thing is so stupid and it goes back to the Trump tower meeting where Don Jr. thought he was going to get dirt on Hillary, didn't get it, they didn't have it.

But Nancy Pelosi today is saying that if someone reaches out to you as a Republican, that is unethical. That is a criminal cover-up and that is not allowed. When it comes to the dossier, when the left was exposed as being behind the funding for that, the Clinton campaign and the DNC, they claimed it was just opposition research. It doesn't matter that it came from a foreign source or who the source was. We were doing our job as a campaign to get information. But when the president uses the same argument from the Oval Office saying he might call the FBI but he's going to listen to the information, then all of a sudden, they are calling for more impeachment on the basis that he's a criminal. Well, there's a double standard here. Do we want foreign interference in our elections? No. There are reasons why we have laws about foreign donations and foreign money being used for campaigns. But if are going to talk about this, there's going to be a whole lot of people in Washington, D.C., who were guilty of colluding or using information from foreign governments, including Democrats, to interfere in elections and legislation."

You want to make sure that housing isn't punishing for working people, that they can afford a place to live. And he went on in this way. But I just want to speak to your point, Katie, about taxes. Because we have polls here at Fox News and we had a poll in January, 70 percent of the people we polled said yes, raise taxes especially on people who make over $10 million a year. Raise 65 percent. Raise taxes on people making more than a million. And when it comes to wealth, and wealth is, you know, not just earned income but income that you have sitting and growing exponentially because it's in the markets. Guess what? Sixty percent of the millionaire said we should be paying more taxes. So, this is not some crazy idea. Most Americans think yes, the rich should pay more."

It has failed all around the world. But I think what they really want is not socialism and that the government is running the industries and deciding things. What they really want is a much larger welfare state. They might have to find a different word to explain what that means because welfare -- larger welfare state probably is going to sell either. But their argument is that if people think that they have their health care taken care of and they are not going to be buried in college education debt, then that -- then it'll be fine. The thing that conservatives have to think about is that people are becoming much more willing to think that the government can solve these problems for them."

She shouldn't have gone in to the school to confront the kids. Maybe do it outside the school. Maybe talk to the kids parents, maybe set up a parent-teacher conference or go talk to the administration. But it's a problem and the school sounded soft, like they weren't doing enough about it.

And if you're a friend who jumps in to defend someone who's being bullied, you are also punished and expelled or suspended from school. And the bullies don't care right about their behavior.
