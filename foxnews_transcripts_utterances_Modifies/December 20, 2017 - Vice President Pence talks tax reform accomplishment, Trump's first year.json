      "sentences": "And welcome everybody to \"The Ingraham Angle\" from Washington. It isn't just a Merry Christmas, it's a truly historic one. Epic tax cuts cleared both houses of Congress and were sent to the president's desk today. I sat down with Vice President Mike Pence earlier this evening to get the White House take on this major achievement, that's coming right up.  This massive overhaul of the tax code is the biggest in 30 years. It's going to benefit 80 percent of the American taxpayers and is a major victory for businesses and for workers.  In fact, a slate of major corporations announced today that they will be giving out special bonuses to hundreds of thousands of employees as a result of the new tax field. Why, it's like Christmas day at George Bailey's House, kind of except for the caroling.  The tax bill also delivers another huge achievement to the president, a repeal of Obamacare's individual mandate. He did what Congress wouldn't do, which may be the death knell for a program that has been a drag on the U.S. economy. The president promises, by the way that this is just the beginning. In a tweet congratulating Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Trump proclaimed, \"Our team will go one to many more victories.\"  Of course, the Democrats with the help of some in the media used a constant drumbeat of dire sky is falling predictions to drive down the popularity of the tax bill. But as South Carolina Senator Tim Scott said today, this victory is for all Americans.",

The swipe comes from actor Tom Hanks who has given us so many iconic moments on the screen, the big screen, but he kind of flops as a political commentator and pundit. Hanks informed \"The Hollywood Reporter\" that he doesn't think he would screen his new film called \"The Post\" at the White House if he was asked. Why not? \"Imagine a world,\" Hanks explained, \"where president treats papers like \"The Washington Post\" as purveyors of fake news.\" Hey Gump, maybe he treats them that way because half the time they are. The actor stars in Steven Spielberg's new flick \"The Post,\" about the paper's decision in the 70s to publish the top-secret details about the Vietnam War and the Pentagon Papers. The difference is Ben Bradley, the editor of \"The Washington Post\" at the time, actually had the Pentagon Papers. Today \"The Post\" routinely uses anonymous sources in all of its reporting, in most of it, at least when it's damning against Trump, and all too often gets things totally wrong that they then have to backtrack on or modify. By the way, Tom Hanks needn't worry. As Daily Variety pointed out, President Trump has not asked to screen the film \"The Post\" at the White House, so no worries. Maybe it's time to, I don't know, cast away Tom Hanks. I kind of like him better by the way on the deserted island talking to that volleyball. That was cute.

This massive overhaul of the tax code is the biggest in 30 years. It's going to benefit 80 percent of the American taxpayers and is a major victory for businesses and for workers. In fact, a slate of major corporations announced today that they will be giving out special bonuses to hundreds of thousands of employees as a result of the new tax field. Why, it's like Christmas day at George Bailey's House, kind of except for the caroling. The tax bill also delivers another huge achievement to the president, a repeal of Obamacare's individual mandate. He did what Congress wouldn't do, which may be the death knell for a program that has been a drag on the U.S. economy. The president promises, by the way that this is just the beginning. In a tweet congratulating Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Trump proclaimed, \"Our team will go one to many more victories.\" Of course, the Democrats with the help of some in the media used a constant drumbeat of dire sky is falling predictions to drive down the popularity of the tax bill.

For a president who ran on a populist agenda, the forgotten man and woman, to give a tax cut, 83 percent of the benefit by 2023 go to the top 1 percent. That's a big problem in the middle-class tax cuts expire over time.

I understand the Democrats messaging, they will say it doesn't mean anything. It means that Trump is not a populist. I reject that because we know the top income earners pay the lion share of taxes so obviously they will get more numerically in tax cuts if you are going to do this kind of tax reform. But business is made up of individuals. Is it not? Aren't individuals through 401(k)s, pension funds, they need business to do well.

And I think the president and I truly believe that being in the most powerful economy in the world that only grew by 1.8 percent every year on average for the last eight years has created a level of frustration. When the president coined that phrase, the forgotten men and women of America, he tapped into a frustration in the American people that they were feeling, and they knew it could be better if they knew the economy could be stronger. They knew we could be standing again and commanding the respect of nations around the world, which is needed new leadership to do it, and I truly do believe that as we go forward, and we tell that story and the American people see those results.

The Huffington Post contributor apologized on Twitter, which is nice. It's identity politics though. You got right to, OK, there's a black guy who happens not to be a liberal, let's trash them.

The only thing he could corroborate was that Carter Page actually went to Moscow. Beyond that, everything else that was in that dossier they had no evidence of. Now, why is this important? I think you know, Laura, that this was probably used as a FISA, this was probably used to get those FISA warrants to continue to investigate members of the Trump campaign. And what now congressional members want to know is if you used this dossier for the FISA and you weren't able to corroborate anything in it, that's a big problem. And if other people are coming forward and your testimony is not matching those other people, we need to re-question them again. So we're going to need to send out more subpoenas.

And Bruce Ohr at the FBI, was that disclosed when he was working on these cases? Was it disclosed when Fusion GPS became so important? We don't know that, correct? We don't know if Mueller ever learned about it. He was removed."

      "utterance": "That's right. But according to the sources he did not disclose that, and that's what's really fascinating here. Another thing that was apparently not disclosed was the fact that he had met with Christopher Steele and he had met with Glenn Simpson, the owner of Fusion GPS. And remember Christopher Steele was the British former MI6 spy that they used to investigate the Trump campaign. So this is what's really fascinating here. Why was Bruce Ohr meeting with Christopher Steele before and then Glenn Simpson after? Why was he meeting them, and what was he discussing? And the fact that his wife was a part of Fusion GPS, that's a huge conflict of interest and that's a problem. Another problem, which an FBI agent brought up to me tonight, was actually Robert Mueller. And they were talking about Robert Mueller, special counsel, and they were saying if you look at McCabe, now going back to Andy McCabe, his history, he was promoted all the way up to the number three when Mueller was still in charge of the FBI. So there's another potential conflict there."

There's a lot of information that was done classified or behind closed doors that hasn't been released publicly yet. I know they are going to want to talk to Lisa Page. That's very important. Remember she was having the affair with Peter Strzok. With the FBI Rybicki, I've heard many things about Rybicki. I've also heard that he could easily be promoted to deputy director. So he may be somebody to replace Andrew McCabe."

A jaw-dropping report from Politico says his administration forced the DEA to lay off a massive drug and weapons smuggling operation by the terror group, all in the name of securing the Iran nuclear deal. Now Obama foreign policy flacks are coming out in force to try to discredit the story as a rightwing hit job by \"Politico.\" Joining me now to make sense of all of this is John Bolton, Fox News contributor, former U.S. ambassador to the U.N. Politico rightwing, that's a new one."

It was an act of appeasement. And the notion that we toned down a drug and money laundering investigation against the terrorist group Hezbollah for any reason is just incredible. So the Obama spokespeople can say all they want. Let's have a congressional investigation about it. The Wall Street Journal is calling for that tonight. I think that's great. Let's interview everybody. Let's get it all out there, I can't wait."

Egypt, the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas said they are not going to meet with Pence when he visits the region. And Trump says good, we will save money.

So I think not only can we save some foreign aid, the time now to look at dealing with the forum in which these abuses take place, we had to veto a Security Council resolution earlier in the week. I think U.N. funding should be on the table. I think we should be looking at moving away from assessed contributions, taxation, to voluntary contributions, withdrawing from some U.N. organizations. The only time they really pay attention to us is when money is at stake. So you will see this interest in the Jerusalem capital issue disappearing when our contributions start drying up."

No such luck. Instead one of America's favorite actors is insulting the president just to sell his movie. The swipe comes from actor Tom Hanks who has given us so many iconic moments on the screen, the big screen, but he kind of flops as a political commentator and pundit. Hanks informed \"The Hollywood Reporter\" that he doesn't think he would screen his new film called \"The Post\" at the White House if he was asked. Why not? \"Imagine a world,\" Hanks explained, \"where president treats papers like \"The Washington Post\" as purveyors of fake news.\" Hey Gump, maybe he treats them that way because half the time they are. The actor stars in Steven Spielberg's new flick \"The Post,\" about the paper's decision in the 70s to publish the top-secret details about the Vietnam War and the Pentagon Papers. The difference is Ben Bradley, the editor of \"The Washington Post\" at the time, actually had the Pentagon Papers. Today \"The Post\" routinely uses anonymous sources in all of its reporting, in most of it, at least when it's damning against Trump, and all too often gets things totally wrong that they then have to backtrack on or modify. By the way, Tom Hanks needn't worry. As Daily Variety pointed out, President Trump has not asked to screen the film \"The Post\" at the White House, so no worries. Maybe it's time to, I don't know, cast away Tom Hanks. I kind of like him better by the way on the deserted island talking to that volleyball. That was cute. That's the dialogue that I enjoy from Tom Hanks. Riveting. I almost thought it was a basketball, I had forgotten."
