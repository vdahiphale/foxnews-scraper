DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz facing off with the Senate Judiciary Committee over his findings. The IG says there was no bias at the start of the FBI probe into the Trump campaign, but there were numerous mistakes during the investigation. Horowitz was also asked about Attorney General Barr saying the Trump campaign was spied on."

      "speaker": "Michael Horowitz",
      "utterance": "The Crossfire Hurricane team obtained information from Steele’s primary sub-source in January 2017 that raised significant questions about the reliability of the Steele report, and this was particularly noteworthy because the FISA applications relied entirely on information from the Steele -- I’m sorry, from the primary sub-source’s reporting to support the allegation that Page was coordinating with the Russian government on 2016 U.S. presidential election activities."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Dana Perino",

      "speaker": "Jesse Watters",
      "utterance": "And that’s the precise moment this became an unconstitutional violation of Carter Page’s rights. Once they know that the probable cause is bogus and the dossier is junk, and they continue the surveillance and lie to continue the surveillance, that’s when it becomes illegal, and that’s why Carter Page should sue. The whole thing was a lie. The investigation started on a lie. There’s no Trump-Russia collusion, and there never was. It was continued by a lie in the Steele dossier; then the FBI agents lied to the judge about it, and then Comey lied to Congress and said everything was fine when it wasn’t. If you have the guy named Clinefeld [sic] who’s this FBI lawyer who doctored the document to make Carter Page look dirty --"

    {
      "speaker": "Jesse Watters",
      "utterance": "Exactly. So, that’s like planting a gun on a suspect and then telling the judge the guy was armed. This wasn’t just a field agent. This was an FBI lawyer. What else is the FBI doing? This is so scary. This was a handpicked team. McCabe ran it; Strzok ran it. They all hated Trump. We see the text messages. They had the insurance policy. This was the insurance policy. You start a counterintelligence investigation to protect the country from a foreign threat, but they didn’t protect the country. They investigated the Trump campaign, and that’s what this was about: a justification to investigate Trump. Now, great analogy. Don’t need permission; we’ll make it anyway. I’m going to steal it from Lindsey Graham. Remember when Dianne Feinstein -- they caught her with a Chinese spy –"

      "speaker": "Jesse Watters",

      "utterance": "Yeah, it’s an interesting point. Juan, we’re going to get to you in a moment, but I do want this play this also, because there was some great sound today. In case you didn’t catch up, we are going to catch you up right here. There was a -- this was Sean [spelled phonetically] about the Grassley comments in regard to the Trump campaign and the Clinton campaign as candidates now getting a briefing from the FBI. If we could play that really quickly."

      "speaker": "Michael Horowitz",
      "utterance": "They were treated differently in that the agent wrote it up to the file and put the information in the file. The briefings were identical, but the net result was one was for investigative purposes, and one was purely for the intelligence briefing."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Dana Perino",

      "speaker": "Katie Pavlich",
      "utterance": "Well, the big question has always been -- and the media is running with this, and so are Democrats on this committee today, saying there was no political bias in the investigation. Well, clearly that is not true if the same -- the process was covered for both the Clinton and the Trump campaigns, and one was used a different way to go after people in the campaign, and the other was simply used as a protective briefing. I think the bigger question here is what’s going to be done about this. The exchange with Joni Ernest and Michael Horowitz with -- there -- the FBI agents who were still working on this project are still at the FBI. There have been no consequences for them. And the question also is, you know, if there was really non-bias, and there was no partisanship here -- this was a handpicked team -- why were there no whistleblowers saying, “Look, we're doctoring information?” Why did nobody go to the inspector general that and say, “There's a lot of information that we are using that is garbage, that is made up, that is fraudulent, that has been altered” --"

      "speaker": "Greg Gutfeld",
      "utterance": "-- in the media who mocked Devin Nunes. I think even people here -- we were kind of like, “Oh, what does he know? What does he know?” Turns out, he was right. He was completely right, and everybody looks kind of silly. People in the media bought that dossier because they wanted to buy it. The story, when you think about it, was absurd on its face, but we shelved our adult, you know, sense of BS detection because we wanted to believe it, because we thought there were actually hookers in a room reenacting the Obamas or something, and then -- I won't engage in what -- I won’t explain what they engaged in. But the media does -- the media loves to play what-ifs with Trump, right? So, what is the pee tape led to the conclusion that Trump was compromised and then removed from office, which would then trigger civil disturbances among people who voted for him? You might see actions that you hadn't seen since the late ‘60s. Buildings might burn; people might die. Another country might see this time as a distraction to take advantage of us, all because of a fake story which was pushed by power-mad Democrats and embraced by the media. This has to go back to Adam Schiff. At some point, he's going to have to pay for this because he knew this wasn't true, and yet he used it. He used it to initiate a process that would cleave a country, and I don't know if anybody has done anything as bad as that. He knew this wasn’t true and tried to split a country apart. You know, people implode over Trump's words because he's so mean, but these deeds are pretty dangerous."

      "speaker": "Dana Perino",

      "speaker": "Greg Gutfeld",
      "utterance": "Somewhere in a parallel universe, there's a huge news story going on. It's about a terror attack on a Florida naval base in which a Saudi national kills three sailors. The terrorists embrace radical Islamic ideology. Years before he came here to train, he expressed extremist thoughts on social media. According to reports, the night before, he and pals allegedly watched mass shooting videos and two of the other Saudis investigated in connection to this attack, filmed it. Now, this event should raise key questions about among our facts, seeking media. Why are we training so many Saudis? Have we ever reconciled the fact that the large majority of 9/11 hijackers were Saudi nationals? And where was armed security in this attack? Yep. This would matter in a parallel universe, but not this one because we're too busy filling space with a sham impeachment. It's a double whammy of destruction. Not only does impeachment add false outrage to exhaust your brain, it also replaces information that you need to know so you know less about reality while carrying more media generated garbage in your brain. We now know how fake the impeachment circus was, all predicated on a comically fake dossier, but in the Trump era, all stories must be about how evil he is. Perhaps if we could blame this shooting on Trump, the media would pay attention to it. You see that word pay? Attention is currency. When you pay it to one thing, you don't pay it to another. And you only have so much. And the media every day continues to rob you blind. So why, Katie? This is this happened in a gun free zone."

And in the aftermath of this, soldiers, again, after this happening multiple times, the Fort Hood shooting as another example of soldiers saying we are trained people and have all the people in America who should be able to carry firearms, we are them and they continually are refused that ability and not right. The other thing about this I find extremely interesting and also enraging is that, look, if we have a travel ban on people coming to America from countries that support terrorism and we can't vet them properly, we should certainly not allow them to be purchasing firearms in America. The Second Amendment, as the Florida governor said, is reserved for American citizens, is an American right. And if you want to be able to purchase a firearm legally, you should have to become an American to be part of our society and embrace that you know what we believe in. But this idea that they now have this loophole is pretty ridiculous and something that Congress should change."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "Katie Pavlich",
      "utterance": "Yeah. I can just say one more thing, though, about the gun free zone issue. You know, they always disarm people in gun free zones, whether it's on military bases or in schools or wherever else. And 99% of the time they do not provide security. So, they tell you that you can't protect yourself, but then they don't provide the proper and adequate security for them to protect you. And I'm wondering when there will be some question about the legal liability of that. You're taking away someone's ability to protect themselves, putting them in a vulnerable situation. Something happens then everyone walks away and tries to come up with all the solutions in the aftermath. Right? So I think that's a very serious question that people should be thinking about."

And then secondly, I'm you know, given the murder of The Washington Post columnist in which the president did not respond aggressively and now this I don't understand. I just don't understand why the president doesn't say, which is what Greg said in his monologue. I can draw a line from 9/11 to this event and say, boy, is a lot going on here with the Saudis and anti-American sentiment. And why would I be training Saudis with American military equipment?"

      "speaker": "Jesse Watters",

There's obviously a problem we're dealing with. We have to shut this down. They shouldn't be buying guns. But I think Saudi Arabia this week, I think it was the biggest IPO of all time.

It serves -- it also serves as bait to entice critics to go after a child. So, if you criticize, and you say, “She’s doing nothing but getting attention for herself.

A child -- that precious child can falsely call people a murderer, with a mob egging her on, but if you go, “No, she’s being exploited,” they come after you. There are people on this planet that are doing real work and saving real lives. We’re watching it right now. Golden Rice is one of them; look at Bill Pulte, raising a lot of money. Bill Gates is doing amazing stuff. We’re watching AIDS. The AIDS -- there’s a revolution in AIDS drugs. We’re going to see that cured in our lifetime.

But I remember just going, you know, of course, he's guilty. Look at him he's like the security guard that's looking to be something more than he is. I completely wrote him off.
