      "sentences": "Well, one of the most interesting developments comes out of reporting by another one of our colleague, Bret Baier. We were able to get information that in the spring of this year, FBI director James Comey testified in the closed door session that his agents has concluded that Flynn made some sort of bad decisions or didn't remember things properly, seemed kind of confused about the timeline of events in December, but they didn't believe he had deliberately misled them. That's significant because if you fast forward to today, about seven months later, the special counsel investigators under Robert Mueller had concluded something very different, that there was a deliberate effort by Flynn to mislead the FBI about Flynn's contacts with the Russian ambassador and Flynn agreed in court today. What I would say about his appearance in court today is that he was very composed, he seems to really reached inside himself and have that soldier's discipline, and that 33 years of service in the military allowed him to hold it together as he made that guilty plea which is a felony.  The other interesting thing we're looking at tonight is that in the court records there were unsealed, the references to what appears to be two members of the Trump transition team, a more junior person who received information from Flynn at Mar-a-Lago in December about these conversations with the Russian ambassador. We believe that to be K.T. McFarland at this point. And then a more senior person who was directing Flynn to reach out to a number of countries including Russia, and we believe that to be Jared Kushner. But I would give you this caveat, we were told that it wasn't like Kushner was saying to Flynn you go out and just talk to the Russians. It was a kind of divvying up of the phone calls. There were different teams for different countries. And they were all tasked with a certain amount of outreach at that time. So it's not quite as sinister sounding perhaps as it is in the black-and-white of the court documents. But we believe the very senior person was Jared Kushner and that he testified to that in his session with the special counsel in November, Dana.",

GREG GUTFELD, \"THE FIVE\" CO-HOST: Well, I always like to focus on the media. And the media they remind me of a contestant on Price is Right. They're expecting a brand new car which was Russian collusion, and instead they got a crock pot, which is a lie. A single crime committed by pleading guilty to it. Single isolated event that has nothing to do with Russian collusion because it happened after the election. So the ecstatic media is going to be ecstatic for a few days, but then it's going to wear off. And they're going to realize that this is a far cry from what they really wanted and they're actually seeding turf on this. But this is far from what they dreamt. What really bugs me about this is if you look at why the meeting took place. Why was the contacts made? Was it anything nefarious? No, it was something noble -- in my opinion, noble and correct, was to get Russia involved in fighting terror and fighting ISIS. Actually, their version of a reset button that actually made kind of sense, which we may or may not have happened, I don't know. But that's what this was about in my opinion.

I understand there are some police officers and especially the sheriff's association the things that sanctuary cities are actually better for them for crime fighting purposes. If that is really what they believe, then they need to do a much better job of convincing the rest of America that that is the case. That's not universal agreement with those associations, but certainly there are police officers that say that.

      "utterance": "Well, one of the most interesting developments comes out of reporting by another one of our colleague, Bret Baier. We were able to get information that in the spring of this year, FBI director James Comey testified in the closed door session that his agents has concluded that Flynn made some sort of bad decisions or didn't remember things properly, seemed kind of confused about the timeline of events in December, but they didn't believe he had deliberately misled them. That's significant because if you fast forward to today, about seven months later, the special counsel investigators under Robert Mueller had concluded something very different, that there was a deliberate effort by Flynn to mislead the FBI about Flynn's contacts with the Russian ambassador and Flynn agreed in court today. What I would say about his appearance in court today is that he was very composed, he seems to really reached inside himself and have that soldier's discipline, and that 33 years of service in the military allowed him to hold it together as he made that guilty plea which is a felony. The other interesting thing we're looking at tonight is that in the court records there were unsealed, the references to what appears to be two members of the Trump transition team, a more junior person who received information from Flynn at Mar-a-Lago in December about these conversations with the Russian ambassador. We believe that to be K.T. McFarland at this point. And then a more senior person who was directing Flynn to reach out to a number of countries including Russia, and we believe that to be Jared Kushner. But I would give you this caveat, we were told that it wasn't like Kushner was saying to Flynn you go out and just talk to the Russians. It was a kind of divvying up of the phone calls. There were different teams for different countries. And they were all tasked with a certain amount of outreach at that time. So it's not quite as sinister sounding perhaps as it is in the black-and-white of the court documents. But we believe the very senior person was Jared Kushner and that he testified to that in his session with the special counsel in November, Dana."

So I'm just waiting to see what else is going to happen out of this. I don't think that we know the full story yet. What do you think, Greg? GREG GUTFELD, \"THE FIVE\" CO-HOST: Well, I always like to focus on the media. And the media they remind me of a contestant on Price is Right. They're expecting a brand new car which was Russian collusion, and instead they got a crock pot, which is a lie. A single crime committed by pleading guilty to it. Single isolated event that has nothing to do with Russian collusion because it happened after the election. So the ecstatic media is going to be ecstatic for a few days, but then it's going to wear off. And they're going to realize that this is a far cry from what they really wanted and they're actually seeding turf on this. But this is far from what they dreamt. What really bugs me about this is if you look at why the meeting took place. Why was the contacts made? Was it anything nefarious? No, it was something noble -- in my opinion, noble and correct, was to get Russia involved in fighting terror and fighting ISIS. Actually, their version of a reset button that actually made kind of sense, which we may or may not have happened, I don't know. But that's what this was about in my opinion.

The America people still wants all the things that Trumps want to do. They still want those policies and those ideas to come forward. So whether all of this Russia stuff happens or not I think it leads to Democrats again down this little street off of what they need to do.

I'm actually waiting for all of the facts to come out, so that over and over again.

It's Sally Yates who goes to them at the -- goes to the White House and the justice department and said I think you have a problem here. She gets fired. The president is calling for Comey to go easy on Flynn. That's how they ended up with the special counsel. I don't know how all of this falls together, but it's certainly not nothing. And by the way, I agree -- nothing here when you're calling to Russia to say, hey, we want to establish contact, no problem. Somebody like Mike Flynn who is a seasoned patriot, 33 years in the military, why lie about that? That's the thing that I don't understand, but he pled guilty to it today."

The jury sided with the defense which argued the shooting was accidental. The jury only found Jose Zarate guilty of being a felon in possession of a firearm. The jury was not told about the 7 felonies he had been convicted of, or the fact he was deported 5 times. President Trump calls that verdict disgraceful, and yet another reason to build a wall. The president predicts Democrats will pay a big political price for it in the next two elections for the weaknesses on crime and immigration.

We need all three of those things together. And I think the idea to say that, you know, immigration reform is just amnesty is wrong. This guy shouldn't be in the country. I agree there.

That eternal truth exists. Independent of what ever happened in that courtroom. One of the problems with this case is that we talk about justice for month, but we were talking about immigration reform. We were not actually talking about the case. In October when we brought up the case here on this table, I said there was a possibility of an acquittal because of the whole ricocheted bullet thing. People said, no, that's impossible.

But this one I think is for good reason. Sometimes you have a case that is a flash point for additional action. That's been true for some of the black lives matter situations. But this one in particular I think makes those cities that are sanctuary cities have to answer to citizens to say why are we doing this? Why does this make sense? I understand there are some police officers and especially the sheriff's association the things that sanctuary cities are actually better for them for crime fighting purposes. If that is really what they believe, then they need to do a much better job of convincing the rest of America that that is the case. That's not universal agreement with those associations, but certainly there are police officers that say that. And so, I think this will come to a head, and I would imagine that Kate Steinle might get justice if the federal charges that were just announced right before we came to air are successful and make perhaps that prosecution will be better."
