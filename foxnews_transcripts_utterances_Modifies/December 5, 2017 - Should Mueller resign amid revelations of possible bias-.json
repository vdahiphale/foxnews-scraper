      "sentences": "And good evening from New York. Welcome to \"The Ingraham Angle.\" Explosive and exclusive new information will put further pressure on special prosecutor Bob Mueller to resign. That's the focus of tonight's angle.  Last night, we brought you a disturbing and revealing report about FBI investigator Peter Strzok, who was relieved of his duties in the Mueller office after it was revealed that he texted anti-Trump messages during the 2016 presidential debate.  Previously, Strzok had been a top investigator on the Hillary Clinton email probe and was responsible for watering down the language. Then-FBI Director Comey use to describe Mrs. Clinton's handling of classified information on her private email server, isn't that neat?  The original language called her grossly negligent, which by the way can be a criminal violation of the applicable statute. But it was changed by Strzok to merely extremely careless. Once again, Hillary ends up skating for conduct that would have put any of us behind bars. You see, Strzok was kind of a Forrest Gump of the FBI but without any of the endearing qualities. Why do I say that? He was present during Hillary's one and only interview with the FBI. He was an agent who interviewed Hillary's longtime aids, Huma Abedin and Cheryl Mills. And then he helped grill former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn on January 24th.  So I have a question, what the heck was Strzok's magic touch? Why have all of the hundreds of lawyers in the FBI, was he always so lucky to get these plum assignments? Well, I think we all know why. As a weird aside to this whole fiasco, if you go to Strzok's Wikipedia page, it reads that the website is considering his whole page for deletion. That's a bit odd, don't you think? As far as the media go, well, they spent the day either ignoring or downplaying Strzok's conflict of interest.",

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "sentences": "OK, I have a question, will the media be able to downplay all of Mueller's other tainted investigators? The conflicts in the Mueller shop don't stop with Strzok. According to documents obtained by Judicial Watch, former head of DOJ's criminal fraud division Andrew Weissmann emailed acting attorney general Sally Yates praising her for refusing to enforce Trump's travel ban in court. On January 30th, shortly after Trump fired her, Weissmann wrote, \"I'm so proud and in all. Thank you so much. All of my deepest respect, Andrew Weissmann.\" Oh, isn't that sweet?  So naturally when the time came to choose his deputy, special counsel Mueller chose Weissmann, who was also his former partner at the law firm Wilmer Cutler. Think about it. Weissmann chosen to be the number two guy on an investigation that could lead to the impeachment of the President of the United States given those statements, when he was on the record celebrating Yates.   Remember, she was an instant hero of the left because she refused to enforce that same President's lawful executive order. My friends, we are talking willful defiance of the chief executive officer of the United States. Trump is their boss. It's simple, folks. Weissmann must be removed from the Mueller team because of the apparent and real conflict of interest his presence represents. And finally, our exclusive report on yet another Mueller prosecutor who's compromised, this time because of her alliances to the Obama White House. Meet Jeannie Rhee. She was hired by Mueller in early June and also a partner of Weissmann and also of Mueller's old law firm Wilmer Cutler.  Previously, she was a deputy assistant AG in the Office of Legal Counsel for Obama and that meant she gave official legal advice to the Obama White House on policy. But that's not even the most interesting part of the story. We've learned exclusively from sources on Capitol Hill that just weeks before joining the special prosecutor's team, Rhee was the personal attorney of former deputy Obama national security advisor Ben Rhodes and was in fact his point of contact with the House Intel Committee in its investigation into Russia. Now, she didn't actually appear with Rhodes at his closed-door interview last spring, but that was only because by then she was already working with Mueller.  And did I forget to mention that she also represented the Clinton Foundation and donated about $9,000 to Hillary and her fellow Democrats? Once again, another member of the Mueller team has been exposed for brazen partisanship, which at the very least, very least, represents the appearance of a conflict of interest if not an actual one.  Let's face it. What we're seeing here is a pattern and practice of Mueller hiring known Clinton and Obama political insiders and boosters, supporters, to undo a presidential election. That was the election of Donald Trump. But what's the common denominator of the three amigos here? Well, they all hate Trump. But more than that, they're political adversaries. Given the gravity of the situation, given all that is at stake for America, Robert Mueller needed to assemble a team of unassailable professionals. They needed to run that investigation professionally and without any question. Instead, as we're documenting night after night, what Mueller did, he hired a pedigree team of obvious partisans, a revolving door from working for political opponents of Trump to working on the investigation into Trump and his supposed Russian ties.  What a total travesty. They should all step aside. They should all go back to their old law firm, their old buddies there, including Bob Mueller. And that's the angle.   Joining us now for reaction in Raleigh, North Carolina Sol Wisenberg, who is number two attorney on the Bill Clinton Whitewater investigation, and in Washington, Democratic strategist Richard Goodstein. All right, Sol, let's start with you. I had fairly harsh words tonight after we learned more about Jeannie Rhee and her association -- her past association with Ben Rhodes, the personal attorney for Rhodes, representing him in these contacts with the House Intel Committee. Obviously, Andrew Weissmann, Peter Strzok, the list seems to go on and on, every day we learn more. What's your take?",

It looks like CNN's Jeff Zucker, that bastion of honesty. David Sutton tweets \"I say the man walking with socks on the train is Chris Stirewalt.\" He would never, he's very proper. Cathy writes \"Bruce Willis' next filming of the Diehard movie.\" Zach, replies, \"Ari Fleischer.\" And finally Kathy E. says \"looks like Brian Stelter,\" CNN. Well, Kathy, pat yourself on the back for knowing your media figures. I will figure out a way to get you \"Billionaire at the Barricades.\" It was in fact CNN's Brian Stelter. At first I was worried he was not amused by my ribbing because he tweeted out, \"Hey, I will admit to having sore feet if Laura admits to taking creep shots.\" For the record, I did not take that shot, but someone on the train did and they forwarded it to me. To be fair to Mr. Media, you've got to be fair to him, he did tell one Twitter user that he thought it was funny. So thanks for being a good sport, Brian.

      "utterance": "And good evening from New York. Welcome to \"The Ingraham Angle.\" Explosive and exclusive new information will put further pressure on special prosecutor Bob Mueller to resign. That's the focus of tonight's angle. Last night, we brought you a disturbing and revealing report about FBI investigator Peter Strzok, who was relieved of his duties in the Mueller office after it was revealed that he texted anti-Trump messages during the 2016 presidential debate. Previously, Strzok had been a top investigator on the Hillary Clinton email probe and was responsible for watering down the language. Then-FBI Director Comey use to describe Mrs. Clinton's handling of classified information on her private email server, isn't that neat? The original language called her grossly negligent, which by the way can be a criminal violation of the applicable statute. But it was changed by Strzok to merely extremely careless. Once again, Hillary ends up skating for conduct that would have put any of us behind bars. You see, Strzok was kind of a Forrest Gump of the FBI but without any of the endearing qualities. Why do I say that? He was present during Hillary's one and only interview with the FBI. He was an agent who interviewed Hillary's longtime aids, Huma Abedin and Cheryl Mills. And then he helped grill former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn on January 24th. So I have a question, what the heck was Strzok's magic touch? Why have all of the hundreds of lawyers in the FBI, was he always so lucky to get these plum assignments? Well, I think we all know why. As a weird aside to this whole fiasco, if you go to Strzok's Wikipedia page, it reads that the website is considering his whole page for deletion. That's a bit odd, don't you think? As far as the media go, well, they spent the day either ignoring or downplaying Strzok's conflict of interest."

    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "OK, I have a question, will the media be able to downplay all of Mueller's other tainted investigators? The conflicts in the Mueller shop don't stop with Strzok. According to documents obtained by Judicial Watch, former head of DOJ's criminal fraud division Andrew Weissmann emailed acting attorney general Sally Yates praising her for refusing to enforce Trump's travel ban in court. On January 30th, shortly after Trump fired her, Weissmann wrote, \"I'm so proud and in all. Thank you so much. All of my deepest respect, Andrew Weissmann.\" Oh, isn't that sweet? So naturally when the time came to choose his deputy, special counsel Mueller chose Weissmann, who was also his former partner at the law firm Wilmer Cutler. Think about it. Weissmann chosen to be the number two guy on an investigation that could lead to the impeachment of the President of the United States given those statements, when he was on the record celebrating Yates. Remember, she was an instant hero of the left because she refused to enforce that same President's lawful executive order. My friends, we are talking willful defiance of the chief executive officer of the United States. Trump is their boss. It's simple, folks. Weissmann must be removed from the Mueller team because of the apparent and real conflict of interest his presence represents. And finally, our exclusive report on yet another Mueller prosecutor who's compromised, this time because of her alliances to the Obama White House. Meet Jeannie Rhee. She was hired by Mueller in early June and also a partner of Weissmann and also of Mueller's old law firm Wilmer Cutler. Previously, she was a deputy assistant AG in the Office of Legal Counsel for Obama and that meant she gave official legal advice to the Obama White House on policy. But that's not even the most interesting part of the story. We've learned exclusively from sources on Capitol Hill that just weeks before joining the special prosecutor's team, Rhee was the personal attorney of former deputy Obama national security advisor Ben Rhodes and was in fact his point of contact with the House Intel Committee in its investigation into Russia. Now, she didn't actually appear with Rhodes at his closed-door interview last spring, but that was only because by then she was already working with Mueller. And did I forget to mention that she also represented the Clinton Foundation and donated about $9,000 to Hillary and her fellow Democrats? Once again, another member of the Mueller team has been exposed for brazen partisanship, which at the very least, very least, represents the appearance of a conflict of interest if not an actual one. Let's face it. What we're seeing here is a pattern and practice of Mueller hiring known Clinton and Obama political insiders and boosters, supporters, to undo a presidential election. That was the election of Donald Trump. But what's the common denominator of the three amigos here? Well, they all hate Trump. But more than that, they're political adversaries. Given the gravity of the situation, given all that is at stake for America, Robert Mueller needed to assemble a team of unassailable professionals. They needed to run that investigation professionally and without any question. Instead, as we're documenting night after night, what Mueller did, he hired a pedigree team of obvious partisans, a revolving door from working for political opponents of Trump to working on the investigation into Trump and his supposed Russian ties. What a total travesty. They should all step aside. They should all go back to their old law firm, their old buddies there, including Bob Mueller. And that's the angle. Joining us now for reaction in Raleigh, North Carolina Sol Wisenberg, who is number two attorney on the Bill Clinton Whitewater investigation, and in Washington, Democratic strategist Richard Goodstein. All right, Sol, let's start with you. I had fairly harsh words tonight after we learned more about Jeannie Rhee and her association -- her past association with Ben Rhodes, the personal attorney for Rhodes, representing him in these contacts with the House Intel Committee. Obviously, Andrew Weissmann, Peter Strzok, the list seems to go on and on, every day we learn more. What's your take?"

And incidentally, if you and people watching here think that Donald Trump did nothing wrong, this is exactly the kind of team headed by Mueller that you should want to stay there. And as far as this -- incidentally, I worked at Wilmer Cutler some time ago. I happen not to know them. I'd left before they were there. Look, if we're going to somehow impute every lawyer what their client may or may not have did, look again, Ben Rhodes could be interviewed by the House.

Every two legal immigrants that have green cards so forth citizen bring in seven. Every two seven Mexican six. This has exploded the number of immigrants into the United States, which is not a merit-based system. The idea that you can bring in adult children because you came in on an H-1B is preposterous.

      "utterance": "I know you've been waiting for this all show, an answer to last night's burning question. Who was this well-known shoeless member of the media I spotted on the train up to New York yesterday? I asked for your guesses and they came pouring in. Paul Boone, right? It looks like CNN's Jeff Zucker, that bastion of honesty. David Sutton tweets \"I say the man walking with socks on the train is Chris Stirewalt.\" He would never, he's very proper. Cathy writes \"Bruce Willis' next filming of the Diehard movie.\" Zach, replies, \"Ari Fleischer.\" And finally Kathy E. says \"looks like Brian Stelter,\" CNN. Well, Kathy, pat yourself on the back for knowing your media figures. I will figure out a way to get you \"Billionaire at the Barricades.\" It was in fact CNN's Brian Stelter. At first I was worried he was not amused by my ribbing because he tweeted out, \"Hey, I will admit to having sore feet if Laura admits to taking creep shots.\" For the record, I did not take that shot, but someone on the train did and they forwarded it to me. To be fair to Mr. Media, you've got to be fair to him, he did tell one Twitter user that he thought it was funny. So thanks for being a good sport, Brian. A polite request, though, for the sake of social order, please, even with those cute little orange socks of yours, please keep your shoes on in public, OK? It's not your bedroom. We will be back in a moment."

      "utterance": "Kate Steinle Park, sure has a nice ring to it, doesn't it. My suggestion on \"The Ingraham Angle\" last night was that President Trump should rename San Francisco's Maritime National Park in honor of Kate Steinle who was shot and killed in 2015 by an illegal immigrant. What do you think? What do you think the president should do on this? Keep your responses coming. They've been overwhelming. And we are going to stay on this. We want that park named after Kate Steinle. It's the least we could do. That's all the time we have tonight. Shannon Bream is up next, and I hope she has her shoes on. Do you, Shannon?
