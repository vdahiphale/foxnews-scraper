You, the queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, a personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long, have finally come out from behind the curtain. From the day I announced my candidacy there has been a concerted campaign to destroy my reputation. We wondered who was behind it and why. Now we know. It was always you through your proxies and powerful allies in the corporate media and war machine, afraid of the threat I pose. It's now clear that this primary is between you and me. Don't cowardly hide behind your proxies. Join the race directly.\" We will start directly there with this late-breaking news. Let's bring in our panel, \"Washington Post\" columnist Marc Thiessen, Johanna Maska, former aide to President Barack Obama, and Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at \"The Federalist.\" Marc, this was a shock.

So Hillary has all sorts of things. But it also shows how unserious they are about the Russia threat. It's all a political game for them. After the Mueller report came out, if they really cared about the threat from Russia, they would have said OK, Donald Trump didn't collude with the Russians, but this is a real threat. Let's do something together, Republicans and Democrats, to protect our democracy. And instead they dropped it because, well, if it's not going to help impeach Donald Trump they are not interested. But on what Mollie said is, John Durham is doing his investigation. We still may get some responsibility, people held to account for what happened."

And I remember the positive feedback we got from world leaders who got that intimate feeling at Camp David, which is an extraordinary site. So to throw that under the bus and say that it wasn't a good summit, when literally the U.K. duplicated that summit with Lough Erne the next year, it was just factually inaccurate. I knew he was thrown out there without much information, but it seems like he was put up for a very long time and said things he probably regrets."

Each finding out that people care about when we give $400 million in taxpayer aide, we want it to go to a country that doesn't have corruption problems is not a high crime and misdemeanor.
