The first objective is to oppose the Iranians, the Shiite threat to fight the civil war within Islam with the Shiites and the Sunni's, between the Persians and the Arabs. But there was a secondary message, and that is to fight the Sunni radicals among them. Al Qaeda and ISIS are Sunni radicals. They are not Iranian. They're not Shiite. And I think it's time, after 50 years of the Saudis using their wealth to spread their Wahhabi radical ideology through the madrassas throughout the Muslim world, and thereby radicalizing people throughout the world, we're now seeing the fruits a generation later of that. The Saudis understand the irony of what they've done.
