President Trump not backing down from his efforts to fund the ever-important wall on our southern border.  Today, he tweeted, let's quote here, we will be forced to close the southern border entirely if the obstructionist Democrats do not give us the money to finish the wall and also change the ridiculous immigration laws that our country is saddled with. Hard to believe there was a Congress and president who would approve. But the president is also threatening to cut off all U.S. aid to Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, the three Central American countries that are refusing to prevent migrant caravans from forming and mobilizing to our southern border.  As shutdown negotiations continue, President Trump has canceled his trip to Florida. He will remain at the White House.  In the meantime, soon-to-be speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, is getting some rest and relaxation at a luxury resort in beautiful Hawaii. Incoming chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, is blaming her and other Democrats for the ongoing shutdown. Watch this.",

I think what the president is trying to do and rightly so, is shed some light on what's happening here. In all fairness, I think that having worked with the vice-president and I met with leader Schumer last Saturday, the last time we sat down face to face. And my gut was that he was really interested in doing a deal and coming to some sort of compromise. But the more we are hearing this week, is that Nancy Pelosi is preventing that from happening.",

Steve, the tragic shooting of the California police officer by an illegal immigrant, known gang affiliations, doesn't that underscore that there are legitimate safety and national security concerns at risk here, which is why there needs to be, not just border security, but a wall? STEVE ROGERS, TRUMP 2020 ADVISORY BOARD MEMBER: It certainly proves president Trump's point, Gregg. Look, President Trump has been very consistent. He is making decisions based on national security, two words that are not in the vocabulary of the Democrats. We have a president saying, we are going to do everything we can to stop the influx of weapons and drugs and those things that threaten national security.  And let's keep one thing in mind, too. He went to the border. He talked to police officers. He talked to border agencies. He got their recommendations, management, by walking around. That is what Abe Lincoln did.

We've had some pretty good collaboration with them, we need to hit the cartels pretty hard so we can reduce the drug flow into the United States. And then, separately, we need e-verify so that illegal aliens can't work here and a visa tracking system because roughly 40 percent of illegal aliens are overstaying their visas.

The secretary's visit also comes on the heels of hundreds of immigrants being released onto the streets of El Paso this week by immigration and customs and forward enforcement agents. They say they are constrained by law or for how long they can detain immigrant families. Secretary Nielsen, by the way, Gregg, is also due to visit border facilities in Yuma, Arizona, tomorrow -- Gregg.",

Joining us with more reaction is author of \"How Do I Tax Thee?\", Kristen Tate, along with the author of \"Dark Winter\", Retired Brigadier General Tony Tata, and Fox News contributor Robert Jeffress. Good to have you both, all three of you with us. Kristin, let me start with you. The president's critics have long accused him of exaggerating the threat and now, of course, we see the tragic shooting of a police officer the day after Christmas by an illegal immigrant. And the sheriff said this was preventable but California's sanctuary laws made the tragedy possible. He's right, isn't he?  KRISTIN TATE, \"HOW DO I TAX THEE?\" AUTHOR: The sheriff is absolutely right. This cop killing migrant had been in the country illegally for years, has been arrested numerous times in the past, and was a member of a gang that is notorious for murders and human smuggling. He should not have been here in the first place, and California's sanctuary laws would prevent local officials from turning illegals over to federal officials. He was still here. Had he been deported, this cop would be alive today. Gregg, how many more Americans need to lose their lives before sanctuary states like California start enforcing federal laws? And I place the blame for this chaos and devastation right at the feet of the Democrats like Nancy Pelosi, who demand open borders, while living in gated communities where they are completely separated from the devastation that their policies are bringing into this country.",

In other words, we're reading minds now at this point in terms of the President's motive around that and three finally, the bias of omission. Rarely have I seen in any reports or it's been buried, that the first lady whose footwear was actually Maca, she wore Timberlands and I wear Timberlands what else you supposed to wear to a warzone, they're boots but no one really talks about the fact that first lady Melania Trump is the first First Lady to visit a war conflict zone since 1969 Lady Bird Johnson.

And I think the most important thing would be to say you know Mr. President, everyone previous to you have gone in and they've given all of these speeches and what-have-you. Why don't you just go over there and sit and talk with our troops? Just serve them some chow for Christmas dinner and just sit and get to know them.

Today, he tweeted, let's quote here, we will be forced to close the southern border entirely if the obstructionist Democrats do not give us the money to finish the wall and also change the ridiculous immigration laws that our country is saddled with. Hard to believe there was a Congress and president who would approve. But the president is also threatening to cut off all U.S. aid to Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, the three Central American countries that are refusing to prevent migrant caravans from forming and mobilizing to our southern border. As shutdown negotiations continue, President Trump has canceled his trip to Florida. He will remain at the White House. In the meantime, soon-to-be speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, is getting some rest and relaxation at a luxury resort in beautiful Hawaii. Incoming chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, is blaming her and other Democrats for the ongoing shutdown. Watch this."

I think what the president is trying to do and rightly so, is shed some light on what's happening here. In all fairness, I think that having worked with the vice-president and I met with leader Schumer last Saturday, the last time we sat down face to face.

They do not want him to get a victory. They want to impeach the guy. So there is no way they want to give him a political victory right before they are going to open up impeachment hearings and further investigations on President Trump. And that's what this is. So, they are willing to put politics above national security. And this has always been a national security issue.

Right here on this show, we have long emphasized that open borders have serious national security implications. Joining us now with analysis, retired CIA senior intelligence officer Daniel Hoffman, former member of the FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force, Steve Rogers. Steve, the tragic shooting of the California police officer by an illegal immigrant, known gang affiliations, doesn't that underscore that there are legitimate safety and national security concerns at risk here, which is why there needs to be, not just border security, but a wall? STEVE ROGERS, TRUMP 2020 ADVISORY BOARD MEMBER: It certainly proves president Trump's point, Gregg. Look, President Trump has been very consistent. He is making decisions based on national security, two words that are not in the vocabulary of the Democrats. We have a president saying, we are going to do everything we can to stop the influx of weapons and drugs and those things that threaten national security. And let's keep one thing in mind, too. He went to the border. He talked to police officers. He talked to border agencies. He got their recommendations, management, by walking around. That is what Abe Lincoln did. So, President Trump goes down, get the recommendations of those who are being confronted and challenged by criminals. And he made the decision that's what has to be done, the wall."

There's other things we need to do. From my experience at the CIA, I think we need to get out front of this and work with our Mexican partners. We've had some pretty good collaboration with them, we need to hit the cartels pretty hard so we can reduce the drug flow into the United States. And then, separately, we need e-verify so that illegal aliens can't work here and a visa tracking system because roughly 40 percent of illegal aliens are overstaying their visas. What I don't understand, Gregg, as a citizen, I'm chagrined at the breakdown of the legislative process. If the cost of comprehensive reform is about $5 billion. I don't understand why we can't get it done and I think as Pam Bondi said, do a little compromise."

No. Is it going to stop all illegal immigration? No. But it's going to reduce it and make it harder for illegal immigration to take place in our country. And that will de-incentivize people from making what is an arduous journey, where many of them risk and sometimes lose their lives."

I remember quite well when the late Senator John McCain was grilling DHS undersecretary for intelligence, Francis Taylor, back in 2015 about transnational criminals crossing the border and whether there have been terrorists who were detected crossing that border. And honestly, Undersecretary Taylor really didn't do a whole lot to convince me that DHS was able to detect whether terrorists were crossing the border, or whether they in fact had at some point in the past detected them. And regardless, terrorists are always looking for the soft spots to exploit, the vulnerabilities to exploit. We know that from 9/11. And so, if we see a vulnerability, best to shut it down before someone exploits it to their advantage. And again, we don't want those threats visited on our shores."

Another point Dan made, if you could get a strong door, there will be a burglar who could be able to get into the door, but it buys time, it buys time for the police to respond and to do what they are trained to do."

With immigration and border issues at the heart of the current government shutdown, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen today visit to the border area near El Paso, Texas. Her visit, we are told, was primarily to get a firsthand look at the medical screening facility at the border stations in the wake of the death this month of two young Guatemalan children who had crossed the border and were taken into custody by Customs and Border Patrol agents. The secretary's visit also comes on the heels of hundreds of immigrants being released onto the streets of El Paso this week by immigration and customs and forward enforcement agents. They say they are constrained by law or for how long they can detain immigrant families. Secretary Nielsen, by the way, Gregg, is also due to visit border facilities in Yuma, Arizona, tomorrow -- Gregg."

Joining us with more reaction is author of \"How Do I Tax Thee?\", Kristen Tate, along with the author of \"Dark Winter\", Retired Brigadier General Tony Tata, and Fox News contributor Robert Jeffress. Good to have you both, all three of you with us. Kristin, let me start with you. The president's critics have long accused him of exaggerating the threat and now, of course, we see the tragic shooting of a police officer the day after Christmas by an illegal immigrant. And the sheriff said this was preventable but California's sanctuary laws made the tragedy possible. He's right, isn't he? KRISTIN TATE, \"HOW DO I TAX THEE?\" AUTHOR: The sheriff is absolutely right. This cop killing migrant had been in the country illegally for years, has been arrested numerous times in the past, and was a member of a gang that is notorious for murders and human smuggling. He should not have been here in the first place, and California's sanctuary laws would prevent local officials from turning illegals over to federal officials. He was still here. Had he been deported, this cop would be alive today. Gregg, how many more Americans need to lose their lives before sanctuary states like California start enforcing federal laws? And I place the blame for this chaos and devastation right at the feet of the Democrats like Nancy Pelosi, who demand open borders, while living in gated communities where they are completely separated from the devastation that their policies are bringing into this country."

And I cited it many times before, there is a felony federal statute that says that you cannot harbor or shield illegal aliens and if you do, it's five years behind bars. If somebody is killed because of what you did, you can serve up to life behind bars. Don't we need to start prosecuting some of these people who are aiding and abetting?"

    {
      "speaker": "TONY TATA, RETIRED BRIGADIER GENERAL",

And then we also need to rewind the clock and we need to get these people out of the country, we need to deport these criminals that are being caught. The sanctuary cities need to be done away with. This is a real problem. And, you know, all the crocodile tears that the left are crying over children at the border and so forth, they are not crying today over this officer's child that is not going to live without a father, Officer Singh's child and wife. And, you know, it's a travesty what is happening at the border and in the sanctuary cities. And border security is every bit as important to national security as anything that we do overseas. And so, we got to fight the enemy on their front 5-yard line, and our 5-yard line as well."

But I remind people that in the bible, God is the one who commanded Nehemiah to build a wall around the city of Jerusalem to protect the citizens. The bible even says heaven is going to have a wall around it, not everybody is going to be allowed in. I think, Gregg, it's wrong to demonize President Trump for doing what the bible commands them to do as the leader of government and that is to protect our citizens. He is doing the right thing.

These people are roaming the streets with nowhere to go and nothing to do. This has become a real crisis. And the question is, what do we do now? Are we supposed to just build a bunch of low-income housing for every migrant in the world who wants to come here? I mean, there are tons of homeless veterans already in this country.

It is just despicable the way the left champions these people to come across the border and undermine our laws. We are a nation of laws and we have to enforce those laws and we have national security issues. And in these caravans, there are known terrorists. When Vice President Pence comes out and says, you know, there are several hundred known terrorists and criminals in the caravan.

And any President, whether that be Republican, Democrat, they've been afforded very positive coverage in those situations, rallying around the flag, rallying around the troops. Instead here Gregg, I see three themes and I'll go through them quickly. The first are mistakes, you just talked about it. NBC says that President Trump is going to be the first President since 2002 not to visit the troops at Christmastime. They post it before Christmastime is even over and then end up making that mistake. Now they backtracked, yes but as you know, the accusation always has seemed a hundred times more than the exoneration."

    {
      "speaker": "CONCHA",
      "utterance": "Right? Then there's the pivot so when the first narrative fell apart, Trump not visiting the troops then it went to what the rap was talking about, what ‘The Washington Post' which is, let's call into question his motive, let's put in a news story that he bowed to public pressure to go because the media covered it so much about him not visiting the troops so therefore that's why. In other words, we're reading minds now at this point in terms of the President's motive around that and three finally, the bias of omission. Rarely have I seen in any reports or it's been buried, that the first lady whose footwear was actually Maca, she wore Timberlands and I wear Timberlands what else you supposed to wear to a warzone, they're boots but no one really talks about the fact that first lady Melania Trump is the first First Lady to visit a war conflict zone since 1969 Lady Bird Johnson. You don't read about that I can guarantee. If it was Michelle Obama or whether any Bush, that absolutely would have been covered so those are your three themes there."

You're just seeing a media that's going to pick apart anything that President Trump does but having been a person that's been in Operation Desert Shield, Desert Storm, Iraq and Afghanistan. I think it would have been wise for the President to find someone that had been deployed into a combat zone, someone that could advise him and say, you know what would you like to see from me if I were to visit to a combat zone? And I think the most important thing would be to say you know Mr. President, everyone previous to you have gone in and they've given all of these speeches and what-have-you. Why don't you just go over there and sit and talk with our troops? Just serve them some chow for Christmas dinner and just sit and get to know them. And don't allow the media to turn this into some type of circus and I think that's what's very important about having someone within your inner circle. A good counsellor, a good advisor that can talk to you from the perspective of someone that's been deployed into these zones. How to do something different, how to do something unique and then you turn the tables on the media, which we know is going to try to find anything wrong with President Trump's actions."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CONCHA",
      "utterance": "Well, of course and look, if that's in the opinions section then we're not talking right now, right? This was the Page One story that people are reading for news, for facts, not for people's feelings on what they think may be happening or what the motive is as we talked about before. And ‘The Wall Street Journal' then took them the task and suddenly ‘The Washington Post' had had to edit some things but you know, that one CNN story, I just can't get over it, in terms of going after military members who are presenting ‘Make America Great Again' hats to the President to sign. Well, gee, I mean if you're going to attack military members, you've got a problem but the bigger problem really there is the fact that a, the Air Force then came forward and said no, that doesn't break protocol and again the bias of omission. Obama, President Obama who was candidate Obama at the time, July 2008, went to Kuwait, visited American base there and signed memorabilia. And I don't have any problem with that, any President doing that to do that for the troops if that makes them happy and this was omitted from CNN's report this time around that previous Presidents have done this before. Again the bias of omission Gregg."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "WEST",
      "utterance": "No, you're absolutely right. The President of the United States of America as the commander-in-chief, he was not over there having any type of election rally. He was not over there talking about who should be supporting him and voting for him. He was not asking the troops to go out and take a stand for him one way shape form or the other. But if you're a troop and you have something that is representative of the President of the United States of America which is what the ‘Make America Great' hat is and you have the President sign it for you, guess what? Maybe you had some of the relatives back home sent those hats over to them or anything that they have signed. That is just one of the things as Joe said, keep these troops happy, keep their morale up but to attack them you know and they're the ones that are away from their family members at this time, that's shameful."

That is ludicrous, isn't it?"

All of them have been what I call the chicken little legal strategy, which is we keep saying the sky is falling, the sky is falling, that Trump should be impeached. Eventually they're going to have to prove it. What I say is, it's like you think you are going to see the aliens on Independence Day and all of a sudden, elf walks out. And I think that's the problem that they're going to have. Why? You know this Gregg, you understand what Watergate's about and it really is disappointing that Drew didn't seem to understand it. In Watergate, we had a special prosecutor Leon Jaworski, he put 62 pages together with his grand jury called the road to Watergate. It was a, a third grader could see that President Nixon did something wrong there. Do we think that Mueller's going to be able to get something done that's less than war and peace when he does his report and that anyone is going to understand it? I think that this type of stuff is going to ultimately backfire on Mueller."

But as you've already pointed out, that's not a reason to file for impeachment. But I think we already know what's going to happen, the House probably will file for impeachment. And I think that's a great strategy for Donald Trump going into 2020. Let the Democrats run themselves into the ground in this, if this is how they want to run, if this is the platform that they're going to run on which is simply hating Donald Trump, Donald Trump can leverage that madness to continue his agenda, to continue carrying out the things that the American people want. It's going to be very difficult for Americans in 2020 to make the choice for the party that simply does not have a platform besides beating the current President."

You know as a lawyer like me, the worst type of client we have is the one that won't tell you anything and hides and is secretive. That was Richard Nixon, I mean , the guy actually taped himself in secret. This President tweets every day. Now I know a lot of people don't like his tweets but his tweets are out there for the entire public to see. He is fully transparent. I think as a lawyer, I think that's part of what drives people nuts. They are not used to his transparency. I do think ultimately though for a legal reason, and what Allie says is absolutely accurate, this is never going to get to high crimes and misdemeanors and I really think our audience should be interested in what Mueller's report looks like and compare it to the Road to Watergate report, compare it to the Ken Starr report.
