Welcome, everyone. I'm Jackie DeAngelis, in for Neil Cavuto. And this is a  special edition of \"Your World.\" The big question, of course, where do we go from here? Our market pros are  going to weigh in on that in just a moment. But, first, let's get to FOX Business' Gerri Willis with a closer look at  Wall Street's big finish.   Three straight years of gains, Gerri. This is pretty phenomenal.",

      "sentences": "It is phenomenal, Jackie. Great to see you.   And, of course, what we're seeing today is a little sell-off at the end of today, markets finishing lower on this final trading day of 2021. Let's take a look back, though, at what the tumultuous year in the markets had to  offer, 2021, the year of the retail trader, crypto, meme stocks, but also   another year of big gains, as the S&P 500 set 70 record closes, more than double the pace of 2020.  Leading the way with the strongest performance was the energy sector, as oil climbed to seven-year highs from $50 a barrel at the beginning of the  year to $70, sparking analyst calls for $100-a-barrel oil in 2022.  Now, some stocks even doubled in value this year, Moderna, a leader in mRNA vaccine innovation, Ford, which set ambitious goals for producing electric  vehicles, and chipmaker Nvidia benefiting from semi-shortages caused by   supply chain disruptions. Now, as we saw life briefly return to normal, stay-at-home stocks that had performed so well throughout the pandemic, like the streaming services,  Peloton and Zoom, came falling back to earth. As lockdowns eased, a surge  in consumer spending fueled gains in retail stocks, like bed, bath and body works.   And as we head into the new year, the meme stocks, although much lower than they were at their highs in January, have still posted eye-watering gains  on the year, like AMC, with returns of more than 1200 percent.  So, a strong year for sure and one that may not be repeated given the storm clouds on the horizon, like rising interest rates, more inflation, the midterm elections, and the continuing COVID threat. Bottom line, stocks,   especially U.S. stocks, continue to be the most attractive play for  investors in 2021. And, well, they may be that all over again in 2022, Jackie.",

Let's bring in our market pros, trader Ted Weisberg at Seaport Securities, economist Steve Moore, and Slatestone Wealth chief strategist Kenny   Polcari.  Kenny, you and I have been having this conversation all week. Really strong finish to the year. 2022, though, there are quite a few unknowns. Gerri mentioned them. Inflation certainly is one. We're expecting to see it creep   higher from here. Fed could be raising interest rates. A lot of things to think about, slowing growth as well. Your thoughts on how we're going to kick the year off?",

I think the focus is here is going to be completely on the Fed, on rates and on inflation, and the pace at which they stop the taper and the pace at  which they raise interest rates, right? The market is expecting three 25- basis-point rate increases. There's talk of a 50-basis-point rate increase  somewhere in there.  Will it be the first one? Will it be the last one? Will it be the middle  one? And that is what I think the market is not pricing in at the moment, right? And the only way we're going to know if that happens is to see what  happens with inflation. And we're going to get more macro data in the weeks and the months ahead. And so that's going to dictate. I think the Omicron thing and the virus thing is going to be behind us. Most people assume that it's now more endemic vs. pandemic. And we will  just learn to live with that.",

Markets clearly have been climbing a wall of worry, not just this year, but for the last couple of years. But I do think that it's a third good year. I  have a feeling that a lot of folks have basically pushed their gains into next year. I mean, that's a technical reason to do that. So I think that allowed the averages to kind of levitate these last two or three weeks of the year. By pushing the gains into 2022, you basically don't have to deal with the tax consequences until the spring of 2023. So it's quite possible we're going to see some selling in January and into February. But, going forward, I think, Kenny, you hit the nails on the  head. It's inflation, it's the Fed, it's corporate earnings. In my opinion, the Fed continues to be trapped and to a large degree behind the curve.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Jackie, I'm not maybe quite as bullish as my friends here.  I think that the inflation issue is going to get worse before it gets better. I think the Fed has been incredibly irresponsible for the last six to nine months. They continued to say inflation was either not a problem and that it was transitory. And it isn't transitory. And they have been way behind the curve. So I think the Fed has -- should have taken action six months ago, but they certainly have to take action immediately. But I want to mention another  couple of risks in addition to inflation. By the way, when you get inflation, if you look back at it in the 1970s, which was obviously the decade of high inflation, the worst decade since the 1930s for the stock market, Jackie. Stocks lost about 40 percent of the value in real terms in that decade because inflation was so high. So inflation in the long term is not a good thing for stocks. Now, the other thing to worry about that's keeping me up at night, Jackie,  and something you and I have talked about many times, is, what is the fate of this Build Back Better bill? It is, in my opinion, horrific for the markets if it passed. Now, right now, it appears to be dead. But there are a lot of talks between the two Joes, Joe Manchin and Joe Biden, about trying to revive it. And I'm really worried about the tax increases, because if those tax increases are to pass, you're talking about the United States having some of the highest  tax rates in the world, and that is just not good for American companies and it's not good for the economy generally.",

And, by then, it may be close to or beyond $4. But this year is going to be front and loaded, meaning that the highest prices are going to be in the first six months of the year.

Think about the amnesty provisions in that bill and a lot of those entitlement programs that they want to create that are costly and new and completely unaffordable or unsustainable. And they also want to open that up to those who are in the country illegally. So that's really the main objection that Republicans have to this bill, is that it spends an enormous amount of money at a time when we cannot afford it on things that we shouldn't be implementing in this country. So, I think that -- I think most people in America are actually happy that the build back broke is dead, because it was a disastrous policy that was moving us more towards socialism. At the end of the day, people want to secure our borders. They want to make sure that we get this economy back on track. If we continue to disincentivize people to work, like these welfare- without-work requirements that would be in this new bill, that would only expand the problems that we're facing right now. We need to work and produce. And we need -- that's what's going to drive down inflation. That's what's going to bring the supply chain back into where it needs to be. So, I disagree with my colleague there. That's why Republicans unanimously voted against this bill. And we're happy to see it fall off the table this year, in 2021.",

Three straight years of gains, Gerri. This is pretty phenomenal."

      "speaker": "GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "It is phenomenal, Jackie. Great to see you. And, of course, what we're seeing today is a little sell-off at the end of today, markets finishing lower on this final trading day of 2021. Let's take a look back, though, at what the tumultuous year in the markets had to offer, 2021, the year of the retail trader, crypto, meme stocks, but also another year of big gains, as the S&P 500 set 70 record closes, more than double the pace of 2020. Leading the way with the strongest performance was the energy sector, as oil climbed to seven-year highs from $50 a barrel at the beginning of the year to $70, sparking analyst calls for $100-a-barrel oil in 2022. Now, some stocks even doubled in value this year, Moderna, a leader in mRNA vaccine innovation, Ford, which set ambitious goals for producing electric vehicles, and chipmaker Nvidia benefiting from semi-shortages caused by supply chain disruptions. Now, as we saw life briefly return to normal, stay-at-home stocks that had performed so well throughout the pandemic, like the streaming services, Peloton and Zoom, came falling back to earth. As lockdowns eased, a surge in consumer spending fueled gains in retail stocks, like bed, bath and body works. And as we head into the new year, the meme stocks, although much lower than they were at their highs in January, have still posted eye-watering gains on the year, like AMC, with returns of more than 1200 percent. So, a strong year for sure and one that may not be repeated given the storm clouds on the horizon, like rising interest rates, more inflation, the midterm elections, and the continuing COVID threat. Bottom line, stocks, especially U.S. stocks, continue to be the most attractive play for investors in 2021. And, well, they may be that all over again in 2022, Jackie."

      "utterance": "They just might be. Gerri Willis, great to see you and happy new year. All right, so where do we go from here? Let's bring in our market pros, trader Ted Weisberg at Seaport Securities, economist Steve Moore, and Slatestone Wealth chief strategist Kenny Polcari. Kenny, you and I have been having this conversation all week. Really strong finish to the year. 2022, though, there are quite a few unknowns. Gerri mentioned them. Inflation certainly is one. We're expecting to see it creep higher from here. Fed could be raising interest rates. A lot of things to think about, slowing growth as well. Your thoughts on how we're going to kick the year off?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KENNY POLCARI, SLATESTONE WEALTH",
      "utterance": "So, I think that that's exactly it. I think the focus is here is going to be completely on the Fed, on rates and on inflation, and the pace at which they stop the taper and the pace at which they raise interest rates, right? The market is expecting three 25- basis-point rate increases. There's talk of a 50-basis-point rate increase somewhere in there. Will it be the first one? Will it be the last one? Will it be the middle one? And that is what I think the market is not pricing in at the moment, right? And the only way we're going to know if that happens is to see what happens with inflation. And we're going to get more macro data in the weeks and the months ahead. And so that's going to dictate. I think the Omicron thing and the virus thing is going to be behind us. Most people assume that it's now more endemic vs. pandemic. And we will just learn to live with that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DEANGELIS",
      "utterance": "It seems to be how the market is looking at things right now, essentially pricing in this surge in Omicron and saying, we're going to get through it within a few weeks. Ted, I want to get to you, because a lot of investors look at this market and they say, wow, three straight years of gains, even during a pandemic time. We're at or near highs when it comes to the market. They're nervous. They're a little bit nervous about trying to get in or figuring out what their strategy should be."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TED WEISBERG, PRESIDENT, SEAPORT SECURITIES CORPORATION",
      "utterance": "Well, no matter what the sentiment, no matter what the levels, Jackie, this is a risk business. And so people have a right to be nervous. There's plenty to be nervous about. Markets clearly have been climbing a wall of worry, not just this year, but for the last couple of years. But I do think that it's a third good year. I have a feeling that a lot of folks have basically pushed their gains into next year. I mean, that's a technical reason to do that. So I think that allowed the averages to kind of levitate these last two or three weeks of the year. By pushing the gains into 2022, you basically don't have to deal with the tax consequences until the spring of 2023. So it's quite possible we're going to see some selling in January and into February. But, going forward, I think, Kenny, you hit the nails on the head. It's inflation, it's the Fed, it's corporate earnings. In my opinion, the Fed continues to be trapped and to a large degree behind the curve."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DEANGELIS",
      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WEISBERG",
      "utterance": "If inflation persists, the Fed is going to have their hands forced. And they have already indicated interest rates are going to move higher next year, which at some point will be a negative for the markets. But I think, initially, a lot of that might be priced in. But if inflation really continues to be a problem, then the Fed is going to have to get much more aggressive."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DEANGELIS",
      "utterance": "Aggressive, right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WEISBERG",
      "utterance": "And that's going to be a big question mark for the markets going forward."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DEANGELIS",
      "utterance": "Steve, I want to get more of a macro view from you, because we talk about inflation all the time, right? And the experts are saying we're going to go higher before we go lower. Part of that inflation isn't just coming from the stimulus that the Fed has pumped into the market, but it's coming from all of this spending. And the Democrats are saying, no, we're going to try to go forward with Build Back Better in January, no matter what."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STEPHEN MOORE, FORMER DONALD TRUMP CAMPAIGN ADVISER",
      "utterance": "Yes, Jackie, I'm not maybe quite as bullish as my friends here. I think that the inflation issue is going to get worse before it gets better. I think the Fed has been incredibly irresponsible for the last six to nine months. They continued to say inflation was either not a problem and that it was transitory. And it isn't transitory. And they have been way behind the curve. So I think the Fed has -- should have taken action six months ago, but they certainly have to take action immediately. But I want to mention another couple of risks in addition to inflation. By the way, when you get inflation, if you look back at it in the 1970s, which was obviously the decade of high inflation, the worst decade since the 1930s for the stock market, Jackie. Stocks lost about 40 percent of the value in real terms in that decade because inflation was so high. So inflation in the long term is not a good thing for stocks. Now, the other thing to worry about that's keeping me up at night, Jackie, and something you and I have talked about many times, is, what is the fate of this Build Back Better bill? It is, in my opinion, horrific for the markets if it passed. Now, right now, it appears to be dead. But there are a lot of talks between the two Joes, Joe Manchin and Joe Biden, about trying to revive it. And I'm really worried about the tax increases, because if those tax increases are to pass, you're talking about the United States having some of the highest tax rates in the world, and that is just not good for American companies and it's not good for the economy generally."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DEANGELIS",
      "utterance": "You're absolutely right. And, of course, Ted made the point that we might see people deferring their gains into next year, and they're going to get hit even harder. It might keep you up at night, Steve. It gives me nightmares."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MOORE",
      "utterance": "Exactly."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "DEANGELIS",
      "utterance": "All right, well, it's not just stocks that we're watching, of course. The price of gas has surged 46 percent this year. If my next guest is right, that could even go higher in 2022. Patrick De Haan is with GasBuddy, which tracks prices at the pump across the country. AAA fuel gauge says the average today, Patrick, is $3.29. A year ago, it was $2.25. So we have come down 10 cents, but we're still relatively high and people are talking about $4."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PATRICK DE HAAN, GASBUDDY",
      "utterance": "Yes, that's right, Jackie. We're closing out the year. Gas prices are starting to inch up. That's going to be a segue into what we expect for 2022. The yearly national average this year ended up being at $3.02 a gallon. Next year, it's going to be even higher, nearly 40 cents, we forecast, the national yearly average in the year, ahead of $3.41, with the potential that the national average could reach -- or could reach $4 a gallon. For those in California, they could see $5, even into the mid-$5 gallon range."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DEANGELIS",
      "utterance": "What kind of timeline are we looking at here? Because we were having this conversation yesterday about gas prices, how it's impacting the average consumer in America. They're paying more to fill up. There could be more pain ahead. Of course, we have got midterm elections next year. The peak of the season is usually July 4. So is that the way you're looking at this?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DE HAAN",
      "utterance": "Well, generally, what we see in a normal year, gas prices peak right around the same time we transition to summer gasoline. There's a lot of pinch points between refinery maintenance and the switch- over to EPA mandated-summer gasoline. We expect a peak at some point late May, early June. And, by then, it may be close to or beyond $4. But this year is going to be front and loaded, meaning that the highest prices are going to be in the first six months of the year. And I believe it's because of those higher prices that the second half of the year, we will see additional oil production. And consumers could see the end of 2022 with the national average that's back down closer to $3 a gallon."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DEANGELIS",
      "utterance": "But you and I also follow these prices really closely. And we know one thing, Patrick. They seem to go up very quick. And when it's time for them to come down, wow, it takes a lot longer to come down."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DE HAAN",
      "utterance": "No better example than what we have been seeing after Omicron. Prices for oil plummeted. But it took the national average a couple of weeks to really start seeing those, reflecting those lower oil prices, and only a week or two did we see those low prices. And now the national average is starting to head back up as oil prices have climbed."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DEANGELIS",
      "utterance": "All right, well, we will be talking to you in 2022 to get your forecast. Thank you so much for that. Always great to see you, Patrick."

    {
      "speaker": "DEANGELIS",
      "utterance": "You too. All right, coming up, the countdown to 2022 is on. With Omicron surging, should you call those parties off this year, though? We're going to ask a doctor coming up."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DEANGELIS",
      "utterance": "Well, welcome back. Democrats vowing to move forward with that nearly $2 trillion social spending bill in the new year, but as the party's hopes remain high, so does inflation. Ikea is the latest to say that it's raising prices over supply chain issues. So, is right now the time to keep pushing for more spending? Let's ask Illinois Democratic Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi. Congressman, good to be with you. Want to get your take on this, because it's a hot topic right now. Inflation is crippling a lot of budgets here in America. And many people say this is not the time to be spending more. Your thoughts."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REP. RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI (D-IL)",
      "utterance": "First of all, happy New Year's Eve, Jackie."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DEANGELIS",
      "utterance": "Thank you."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KRISHNAMOORTHI",
      "utterance": "You're absolutely right. My constituents are very worried about inflation, there's no doubt about it. You just have to look at the gas pump. At the same time, they want components of that Build Back Better plan, such as lower prescription drug prices and help with child care, which has become so unaffordable across the country."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DEANGELIS",
      "utterance": "When it comes to the no-vote, essentially, killing the bill, at least for now, and Joe Manchin, some of his concerns, why is it that the parties couldn't come together and sort of bring him on board? I mean, he is for some spending. He's not for everything that's in that bill."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KRISHNAMOORTHI",
      "utterance": "Yes, after his FOX News interview, he went on to West Virginia radio. I read the transcript of it. And it seems like he supports some vital components of that bill, such as help with child care, help with universal pre-K, which he signed into law as governor in West Virginia, as well as some renewable energy provisions. So I think that we talked about BBB, Jackie, but we should also talk about GGG, get governance going. So, let's pick up the piece parts that we can agree on, pass them, and get them signed into law to help people right now."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DEANGELIS",
      "utterance": "Yes, I mean, what you're saying makes sense. And what he's been saying makes sense. But there are things included in this bill, for example, tree -- provisions made for tree equity, I mean, there are certain things that can definitely go, especially at a time right now where, you said, gas prices are rising, food prices are rising, and people are feeling that pinch."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KRISHNAMOORTHI",
      "utterance": "We have to be very practical right now, Jackie. And whatever we can get done, let's get it done. Let's help the American people, because, yes, my constituents are concerned about a lot of things. But, for instance, women, a lot of them have dropped out of the work force because child care is so unaffordable. Millions of women have. So to help them to get back into the work force become more productive and to make the economy more prosperous has got to be job number one for Congress right now."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DEANGELIS",
      "utterance": "Some people would say another way to look at it is, you can stimulate the economy this way with this kind of spending, cutting some of these costs for people, but you could also leave child care, for example, to be a competitive industry, let people pay for their own child care. But let's stimulate the economy. Let's open it up. Let's get over the coronavirus and get everybody back to work."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KRISHNAMOORTHI",
      "utterance": "I totally agree we have to get everyone back to work. And that is incredibly important, because if we can get more people back to work, especially women who've dropped out in droves during COVID, then they can be more productive. We can produce more goods and services. And, ultimately, that leads to less inflation."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DEANGELIS",
      "utterance": "Last question, do you think the progressives in your party are pushing too hard on this president with policies and things that are unpopular with American voters, because when it comes to President Biden's approval rating, it's at a new all-time low?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KRISHNAMOORTHI",
      "utterance": "Well, I made a New Year's resolution, which is I don't like to criticize my fellow Democrats. But, at the same time, we have to be very practical right now. And we have to get something done. As for what the future holds, I just remember what Yogi Berra said, which is I never make predictions, especially about the future."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KRISHNAMOORTHI",
      "utterance": "But I hope that we can come together. And, by the way, that bipartisan infrastructure bill that Republicans and Democrats came together on is going to be so important for dealing with inflation..."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DEANGELIS",
      "utterance": "Yes. Yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KRISHNAMOORTHI",
      "utterance": "... because we can direct a lot of that short-term spending to unwind the bottlenecks that exist and create supply chain disruptions."

      "utterance": "Happy new year."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DEANGELIS",
      "utterance": "All right, well, fair and balanced, we want to get the read on all of this now from New York Republican Congresswoman and House Republican Conference Assistant Whip Nicole Malliotakis. Congresswoman, great to see you. You heard what the congressman had to say. I want to get your response."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REP. NICOLE MALLIOTAKIS (R-NY)",
      "utterance": "Yes, I mean, he didn't name like half of the stuff that's in that bill that's just awful, expanding the IRS by doubling the force, so they can go after regular people, anybody who makes a transaction over $600. Think about the amnesty provisions in that bill and a lot of those entitlement programs that they want to create that are costly and new and completely unaffordable or unsustainable. And they also want to open that up to those who are in the country illegally. So that's really the main objection that Republicans have to this bill, is that it spends an enormous amount of money at a time when we cannot afford it on things that we shouldn't be implementing in this country. So, I think that -- I think most people in America are actually happy that the build back broke is dead, because it was a disastrous policy that was moving us more towards socialism. At the end of the day, people want to secure our borders. They want to make sure that we get this economy back on track. If we continue to disincentivize people to work, like these welfare- without-work requirements that would be in this new bill, that would only expand the problems that we're facing right now. We need to work and produce. And we need -- that's what's going to drive down inflation. That's what's going to bring the supply chain back into where it needs to be. So, I disagree with my colleague there. That's why Republicans unanimously voted against this bill. And we're happy to see it fall off the table this year, in 2021."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DEANGELIS",
      "utterance": "Yes, when it comes to what's happened over the course of the last two years with the pandemic, the Democrats like to place a lot of blame for the problems in the country on the coronavirus specifically. And they continue to do that when they talk about people not getting back to work. And it's a chicken-or-egg question, right, for example, with child care. Are women staying home because they don't have child care because of the pandemic, because kids are doing virtual learning, or is it time to say enough of this, Omicron is very contagious, but not as many people are dying from it, let's open this economy, open the floodgates, get people back to work, and cut those programs, or not implement them at all at a time like this?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MALLIOTAKIS",
      "utterance": "There's no doubt that Democrats have, sadly, used this pandemic to implement more government control. And the build back broke agenda is exactly an example of that, how they tried to add bureaucracy and continue that. And whatever -- whatever they're giving out with one hand, they take with another. So if you get a stimulus check, now we're seeing inflation paying for that. And it's coming back with the other hand. Households all across America are paying so much more in terms of energy costs, gas prices. If they went on a little vacation, they paid more for the hotel or to rent a car."

And that's why I say we have got to focus on treatments and we have got to focus on therapeutics, because COVID is here to stay. We need to adapt to it. And we need to make sure that we're protecting people. The vaccine is one tool in the arsenal."

Some estimate that the clock on the winds was as high as 105 miles per hour. More than 500 homes have been destroyed. And officials say they would not be surprised if that number was closer to 1,000, just given the vast footprint of this wildfire. First responders didn't even have time to fight the fire for the first couple of hours. Really, their focus was on getting everyone out safe. Tens of thousands had just a few moments to get whatever they could and evacuate to that safe spot to escape the flames. So far, only a few minor injuries have been reported. And officials here say, if it stays that way, that would be incredibly fortunate. Now, there is some confusion about the cause of this fire. At first, they kind of thought that maybe it was from a downed power line. Officials say that there was some confusion over whether they were power lines or commercial lines. Again, it's going to take a long time for them to figure out how this massive wildfire started. And it's going to take a long time for this community to get back on its feet -- Jackie."

Where are they going to live nearby while they rebuild their homes? We still have electricity out in a lot of the affected areas. And there's areas that are still smoldering and too dangerous to return to. So, hopefully, folks will be -- who have homes left will be able to return to those in the next few days.

What was the logic behind that decision?"

Countless more were injured. What we did is, we looked at what were the types of punishments for this kind of reckless driving, the kind of poor decisions that the driver made that led to the death of others, and there's -- what we essentially did is, we reduced the 110-year sentence, because we found no precedents for -- I mean, people -- whether you agree with it or not, I mean, they -- when the people commit murder, it's not a 110-year sentence. And so what we commuted that to is a 10-year sentence, which is the type of sentence, that's the range that is really commensurate with the damage that he caused.

And those who do want to be here and ring in the new year in one of the most iconic spots on the planet are going to have to follow some pretty strict rules, though, if they want to participate. Let's tell you about what some of those are. This is a scaled-back celebration, as you mentioned, tonight, with only 15,000 screened revelers allowed to take part in this historic event. That number is down from the usual 58,000 head count that we have seen in years past. Now, in addition to being checked for weapons, New Year's partiers will have to show proof of full vaccination, a photo I.D., and wear a mask to make it through the screening process tonight."

City officials say they are also dealing with a record number of first responders calling out sick ahead of the big ball drop. Now, while many cities are pulling back their plans, others are following New York's lead. The show will go on in hot spots like cities like Las Vegas and Chicago, in fact, the Las Vegas Strip prepping its fireworks show, and estimates 300,000 people will be there to celebrate. So, you want to catch it all, right? You don't want to miss a minute of all the cameras around the entire country. Well, tune in FOX News at 10:00 p.m. Eastern. We will have our All-American New Year's Eve show. We have got a show live in Nashville and here in New York. And, of course, we're going to be bouncing around checking out what's going on.

Joining me now with some advice, infectious disease specialist Dr. Amesh Adalja. Doctor, always great to see you. Dr. Fauci saying don't go to parties with 40 or 50 people, but you could have small gatherings. Your thoughts on how people should celebrate tonight and how they should stay safe if they are gathering together?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DR. AMESH ADALJA, INFECTIOUS DISEASES SOCIETY OF AMERICA",
      "utterance": "The best way to stay safe is to make sure that everybody there is fully vaccinated. The smaller the party, the less risk there is going to be. You can also do things like, for example, if you're in a place where it's warm outside, have the party outside. Open windows. And you can use rapid tests just before the event if you have them to minimize the risk. But know that you can't get the risk down to zero. There's always going to be some level of risk, especially with the Omicron variant. And we kind of have to find a way to navigate through this. And I think, if you're fully vaccinated, when you get any kind of infection, it's going to be mild, not something that you need to call the doctor for. And I think that's a win in general when it comes to this pandemic."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DEANGELIS",
      "utterance": "That does appear to be a win. And another win potentially in the new year could be those rapid tests arriving, even though they have been delayed, ramping up therapeutics. We have been talking about that for the last couple of weeks or so, and also just how quickly this virus has spread. As you mentioned, it's very, very transmissible. You're going to add another layer of natural immunity to the landscape too."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ADALJA",
      "utterance": "I do think that, after Omicron has its way with this country, we're going to have a lot of people that are immune to this infection, either through vaccines and a combination of Omicron, which will give us kind of hybrid immunity, which was probably the best type of immunity on the planet. But a lot of people are going to get infected. I think this is not something that's avoidable. And those who are unvaccinated, especially if they're high-risk, that's the worry that we have, that, in the wake of Omicron, that we may see hospitals get crushed, hospitals that are already dealing with a lot of Delta patients. And that's what we have to kind of navigate. While Omicron seems less severe, and there's hope in the future, we still have a couple of weeks to months ahead where we have to really think about hospital capacity in some parts of the country."

Joining me now to remember, Internet radio host Mike Gunzelman. Mike, great to see you.

I'm in my early 30s, Jackie, and Betty White transcended across generations. Where, if somebody passes away, they might be 70, 80, or 90 if they're an actor and an actress, the younger generations might have just heard of them. But, with Betty White, we all felt that we knew her, even if we didn't fully get to see her during the \"Mary Tyler Moore\" days or anything like that. But she was the epitome of being cool. Of course, the accolades for her acting career speak for themselves, eight-time Emmy Award winner, three Screen Actors Guild Awards. She also holds the Guinness World Record for longest-running television entertainer for being a female, and Hollywood -- star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, all of it.

Of course, she was on television and everything, but you felt that you really got to know her. And, of course, in her 80s, she hosted \"Saturday Night Live\" because of a viewer poll, the people wanting to see Betty White. And then, of course, she was on commercials.

And just seeing her and, like you said, the timing, but also just being that hilarious, funny person that you just wanted to maybe have a drink with, or if you saw her, you just wanted to high-five and give her a hug, that was Betty White. And it is -- the timing is just really unfortunate, because, of course, 2020-2021, it's like, really, you're going to throw this at us right on New Year's Eve, of all days? We're going to lose Betty White? It's like, please, can we finally get out of this year? But People magazine had a huge celebratory issue for her, because she was about to set -- to turn 100 in just a couple of weeks, on January 17. That came out two days ago. There was also supposed to be a movie event celebrating her life across 900 theaters. And they were also going to do her birthday party live as well, and livestream that in just a couple of weeks. So it's just -- it's just truly sad. But there's a couple things to remember Betty White, besides, of course, everything that we have seen of her on the screen, is, when she was speaking with People magazine earlier this year, she mentioned that the key to -- the key to a long life was having a sense of humor."
