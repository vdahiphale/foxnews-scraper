      "sentences": "Happy, happy Wednesday, everyone. Or as I like to call it Hump Day. A new report claims that Hunter Biden shared bank accounts with his dad, which might be the least harmful thing Hunter could share with his dad. But it's still nuts. Think about it. The V.P. shared a bank account with Hunter. That's like sharing a blow up doll with Charlie Sheen. No disinfectant will save you, you just burn it all down. Normally this might be big news. But Biden's last name is Biden, not Trump. And the media only response to corruption when it's involving an orange Republican with a hot wife. And even then that corruption doesn't have to be real. But this latest news means the President must become part of the FBI investigation in dish Hunter's shady deals. If the government wants to go after rich people by tracking everything over 600 bucks, then Hunter's anonymous 75 grand checks should warrant some scrutiny. Fact is, like my luxurious hair. The list of Hunter's outrageous indiscretions keep growing. But when there's a Democrat in charge with a Democrat media, you can get away with anything except telling the truth. From Ted Kennedy's driving to Ilhan Omar's husband and or brother. It's all water and bodies under the bridge. I almost wish I was a Democrat. Why didn't I become a Democrat? Why didn't I work at CNN? Could you imagine what I could get away with? I could grab my producers butt, pal around with my corrupt governor brother. Accidentally expose myself on Zoom and still I could show up for work. I could also put (INAUDIBLE) in Stelter's grand a mocha latte. All eight of them. Not that I would want that life. I prefer to keep my perversions where they belong in the sauna room at Planet Fitness. The Democrats never need to worry about their since. Hell Justice Coach Gruden loses his job for racist comments in private e-mails. The media still gives a pass to Hunter for throwing around the N-word like it was Jimmy Kimmel and his Snoop Dogg skit. So why was that OK? Well, when your last name is Biden, everything's OK. If you're a Hunter, you can make six figures for paintings that look like an old Janis Joplin tie dye t-shirt that James Taylor threw up on. These are paintings where he uses a straw coming from his mouth, not his nose for once. Still, his paintings literally blow. And what have you bring this up to the White House?",

      "sentences": "I know this is your favorite topic. Yes. Forgive us if we actually do give (BLEEP) about authentic corruption and collusion. But you go on and continue chasing down parents for criticizing mask mandates you hack. Meanwhile, as we told you yesterday, right before Hunter sold that crap, the gallery hosting him received a half million and pandemic relief funds. Far more than any other art gallery in similar circumstances. Now why in hell does a gallery need all that green? To rent a room? To hire a half asleep security guard? To get a velvet rope to separate gawkers from the Rottweiler turd? That is Hunter's art. Meanwhile, all around the same town businesses that have tons of employees are shut tighter than the Botox scan on Joe's forehead. Yet Hunter's gallery was saved by you and me, the taxpayer. Talk about tax-funded abortions. But like Tyrus said, we all know people whose businesses have closed permanently, thanks to lock downs. If only their dads had connections. Instead, those people are screwed under life under Joe. We've got worthless money. Bare shelves and elites who gets special treatment. It's like the Soviet Union, but without the great literature. Meanwhile, we're told that all of these so-called art transactions would remain anonymous. As if less transparency reduces corruption. But that's how we got to $3.5 trillion spending spree that somehow cost zero. For them ignorance is strength. Anyway, how long before we find out that whoever bought those paintings is on some board for a company that pays their employees in bat meat? All of this is happening on the year anniversary of the Hunter laptop expose. A true scandal that revealed how Hunter had sold influence while his pop was V.P. and that his dad knew it. Joe got more kickbacks than a horse proctologist. Allegedly. But much like my latest unicorn tattoo, the story would not see the light of day. Media, the Dems, the big tech buried it in order to change an election. Wonder what his dad has to say.",

Or you can hate both because there is no game without players. But Hunter is just another political crony living off connections. Sponging off taxpayers, cruising from one grift to the next.

      "utterance": "Happy, happy Wednesday, everyone. Or as I like to call it Hump Day. A new report claims that Hunter Biden shared bank accounts with his dad, which might be the least harmful thing Hunter could share with his dad. But it's still nuts. Think about it. The V.P. shared a bank account with Hunter. That's like sharing a blow up doll with Charlie Sheen. No disinfectant will save you, you just burn it all down. Normally this might be big news. But Biden's last name is Biden, not Trump. And the media only response to corruption when it's involving an orange Republican with a hot wife. And even then that corruption doesn't have to be real. But this latest news means the President must become part of the FBI investigation in dish Hunter's shady deals. If the government wants to go after rich people by tracking everything over 600 bucks, then Hunter's anonymous 75 grand checks should warrant some scrutiny. Fact is, like my luxurious hair. The list of Hunter's outrageous indiscretions keep growing. But when there's a Democrat in charge with a Democrat media, you can get away with anything except telling the truth. From Ted Kennedy's driving to Ilhan Omar's husband and or brother. It's all water and bodies under the bridge. I almost wish I was a Democrat. Why didn't I become a Democrat? Why didn't I work at CNN? Could you imagine what I could get away with? I could grab my producers butt, pal around with my corrupt governor brother. Accidentally expose myself on Zoom and still I could show up for work. I could also put (INAUDIBLE) in Stelter's grand a mocha latte. All eight of them. Not that I would want that life. I prefer to keep my perversions where they belong in the sauna room at Planet Fitness. The Democrats never need to worry about their since. Hell Justice Coach Gruden loses his job for racist comments in private e-mails. The media still gives a pass to Hunter for throwing around the N-word like it was Jimmy Kimmel and his Snoop Dogg skit. So why was that OK? Well, when your last name is Biden, everything's OK. If you're a Hunter, you can make six figures for paintings that look like an old Janis Joplin tie dye t-shirt that James Taylor threw up on. These are paintings where he uses a straw coming from his mouth, not his nose for once. Still, his paintings literally blow. And what have you bring this up to the White House?"

      "utterance": "I know this is your favorite topic. Yes. Forgive us if we actually do give (BLEEP) about authentic corruption and collusion. But you go on and continue chasing down parents for criticizing mask mandates you hack. Meanwhile, as we told you yesterday, right before Hunter sold that crap, the gallery hosting him received a half million and pandemic relief funds. Far more than any other art gallery in similar circumstances. Now why in hell does a gallery need all that green? To rent a room? To hire a half asleep security guard? To get a velvet rope to separate gawkers from the Rottweiler turd? That is Hunter's art. Meanwhile, all around the same town businesses that have tons of employees are shut tighter than the Botox scan on Joe's forehead. Yet Hunter's gallery was saved by you and me, the taxpayer. Talk about tax-funded abortions. But like Tyrus said, we all know people whose businesses have closed permanently, thanks to lock downs. If only their dads had connections. Instead, those people are screwed under life under Joe. We've got worthless money. Bare shelves and elites who gets special treatment. It's like the Soviet Union, but without the great literature. Meanwhile, we're told that all of these so-called art transactions would remain anonymous. As if less transparency reduces corruption. But that's how we got to $3.5 trillion spending spree that somehow cost zero. For them ignorance is strength. Anyway, how long before we find out that whoever bought those paintings is on some board for a company that pays their employees in bat meat? All of this is happening on the year anniversary of the Hunter laptop expose. A true scandal that revealed how Hunter had sold influence while his pop was V.P. and that his dad knew it. Joe got more kickbacks than a horse proctologist. Allegedly. But much like my latest unicorn tattoo, the story would not see the light of day. Media, the Dems, the big tech buried it in order to change an election. Wonder what his dad has to say."

But I cut him down with one of my karate chops."

      "utterance": "So, we live in a world where parents are targeted by the FBI for wanting to give their kids a decent education. Hunter however, enjoys a carefree life violating more laws than Kat at Oktoberfest. The people -- the regular people get screwed, the elites don't that's the lesson from Hunter and it's not -- maybe it's not his fault. Don't hate the player, hate the game. Or you can hate both because there is no game without players. But Hunter is just another political crony living off connections. Sponging off taxpayers, cruising from one grift to the next. I'd say I'm disgusted. Maybe I'm just jealous."

But whenever anybody talks about his time as President, they say, oh, well, he was a drunk, he was corrupt. They had all these scandals. They did, he trusted a lot of people. And they took advantage of them. But he was also really consequential in two terms, he, he fought the KKK, he got the 14/15 amendment through giving, you know, blacks have the right to vote and citizenship. And he was really instrumental in kind of holding the country together at a time when we were tipping back to a civil war. So, there's a lot of stories and nuggets in here that tell you Grant is kind of a humble guy. He didn't really care about being braggadocious. He wore old rattled uniforms and like an old hat. But he was really going to be one of the better presidents as history looks back."

And reconstruction was, you know, the fallout from that, for years, led to the civil rights, issues and problems and marches.

He was away from his, his love, and he drank and he got busted. And that became the storyline and when people were going after Lincoln's choice of him as commander, they said, he's drunk where we had no evidence that he was a big drinker in the White House."

That's pretty good."

He goes to see his kids in New Jersey at school, and then learns of the assassination. And he is bereft with guilt because he thinks he could have saved Lincoln at the theater."
