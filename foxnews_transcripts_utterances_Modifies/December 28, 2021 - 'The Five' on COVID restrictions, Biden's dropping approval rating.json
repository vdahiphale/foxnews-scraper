Joe Biden is giving up and going to the beach. The president has no events today and instead is in Delaware for a holiday getaway while omicron spikes all across the country. Now back when he was a candidate, Biden promised to shut down the virus. Then once he was president he bashed GOP governors for not doing enough.",

      "sentences": "Well, Rachel, first of all, out of all the global data from South Africa, U.K., Scotland, others including the United States, there is a lot of information that is suggesting that the virulence of omicron is much less with the much lower hospitalization rate. Anywhere from 40 to 80 percent less than we saw with delta and preceding earlier variants. Now, it doesn't mean that it's not as contagious. It's actually much more contagious, much more transmissible which is why we're seeing such a high rise of cases right now, but you know, in terms of should we just let it rip, it's a fine line, Rachel. First of all, you know, by doing that and by letting things just go unchecked in the population you will have preventable illness, preventable hospitalizations, and preventable death. However, I wrote a piece on foxnews.com a couple of weeks ago that was met with criticism because I said at this point in the pandemic we have the vaccines, we have boosters, we have a large amount of natural immunity, and we finally have a variant that, yes, is highly contagious but seems to be more mild especially more mild in people who are fully vaccinated and people who are boosted. So people have the tools at this point to prevent infection and if they do get infected it tends to be more mild, less serious, and now we finally have treatments that are proving effective. So, yes, getting that hybrid immunity, that vaccine-induced immunity, plus a breakthrough infection so some level of natural immunity, that is by far the strongest wave of protection that we could have moving forward. And this could be our step into making this virus become endemic and that is how the mindset needs to change. I'm glad President Biden has finally realized that it will not be a black and white federal solution. I remember -- I'm old enough to remember when President Trump said a couple of years ago this needs to be on the onus, needs to be on the states. It is the federal government's job to secure these private public partnerships and get out of the way. And that is exactly what \"Operation Warp Speed\" did. They allowed people to get that private public partnership, get things to the market and unfortunately we're not seeing the same urgency under the Biden administration.",

Number one, I do think that it has to be a mixture of both the federal government and the state government working together to ensure that people get supplies, folks get ventilators, which you saw at the beginning of the pandemic when hospital -- when states were searching for ventilators. It was on the federal government to make sure they had those ventilators. But with that being said, what I really hate is these the president's on vacation headlines, right? We saw this -- this is this headline rears its ugly head every single year. It happened under George W. Bush. It happened under Barack Obama. It happened under Donald Trump. It happened under the White House. And I think the American people are smarter than that. They know wherever the president goes, so goes the White House. Both the White House communications office, all the necessary advisers the president needs to have on hand to make decisions, the nuclear football, military, everything moves when the president moves.

It's up -- it's up to the governors and state. And I'm kind of, at least give me that, because we've heard nothing but nonsense coming out of the federal government under this administration since they came in. They were going to do all this other stuff. And here's the part that drives me absolutely mad is they've wanted all of us to act like we're in -- remember, when we were kids it was like code orange and code red, and it was -- it's been code orange COVID pretty much since the administration took over, but they still ran out of test, which means that on the surface you're telling us it's terrible. But in the closed doors you're saying don't worry about it we can go on vacations. We can -- we'll just lower the CDC, you know, from 10 days to five days so we can make up for not having testing because federal workers can't go back to work unless they have a negative test on their on their COVID test if they get COVID. So, they continually changing -- it's like a Rubik's cube where someone peels the stickers off. That's what this administration is doing. They just put new stickers around saying look we solved the Rubik's cube, and no, you didn't. It's a hot mess. Get it together.",

I brought that up in the last segment because I think it was just so emblematic, but there is nothing that has gone right. For me personally, I think the biggest issue is the loss of freedom that we've experienced over the last couple of years. It's this normalization of the government taking control of our lives whether it's when and if we can go to church, when we can open our businesses, if our kids can go to school. This is outrageous. And frankly, look, I think there's going to be a huge wave for Republicans. There's no doubt in my mind. The question is do they deserve it and what will they do with that power because with just a few exceptions, Rand Paul, Senator Ron Johnson who's been a hero in the Senate, Jim Jordan. I don't hear Republicans talking enough about our loss of freedom, about the road that we're on, I believe, to a Chinese -- communist Chinese credit score system. All of these things that are happening that are so scary and so un- American, these are the things I want to hear Republicans talk about for them to deserve our vote. Of course, I'd vote for them over what I see here, which is absolute failure on the part of the Democrats.

People heard that. They got behind that and they believed in that. This administration, you know, they all -- their entire thing was to undo everything he did. The only thing I would tell him you want to undo maybe just don't like undo a like on one of his tweets because his deeds, the deeds ladies and gentlemen of the jury, the deeds outweigh the tweets.

Now that Democrats are actually getting breakthrough infections, you even have \"Washington Post\" saying no, no, we shouldn't be shaming people for getting COVID. Well, we shouldn't have been shaming anybody all along. They catered to the teachers unions that kept children out of school. They've completely flubbed the booster roll out which caused two high-level FDA administrators to actually leave. And now that we have omicron here that we have the high amount of immunity in the population, a milder variant, and now is the time that we should say hey, it's time to move forward, but Fauci and Biden just can't get out of the way. The best thing that they could do coming into the midterms is to remove these federal mandates because as we know we have COVID circulating in the vaccinated, the unvaccinated, and even the boosted. The message needs to be do what you can to protect yourselves, protect your families, but we're going to get out of the way. We're going to remove that OSHA mandate.

She promised to be a candidate that would unite the city and deal with income inequality, and deal with the disparities that exist in the south and west side of the city, and she's failed at that miserably. She failed to implement a testing and contact tracing policy even though the Biden administration gave her over $1.8 billion in our public schools in the city of Chicago. And as a result of that there was a school just a couple of weeks ago in the city of Chicago, Jensen Elementary that witnessed an outbreak that caused two mothers to die of COVID-19. And this is all happening on the mayor's watch. And she has admitted that she has failed when it comes to implementing a policy to decrease the spread of COVID-19 in her cities.

But the biggest failure is keeping them out of school. The fact that this is even an option at this point is a continued failure of us from a federal level, a state level, and a local level. Under no circumstances should these schools switch to remote learning unless there is a very specific need. And it is -- it is about -- yes, it is about the teachers getting COVID-19, it's about the children getting sick, it is about them bringing home the virus to those around them. But time after time, we have now been able to prove that there is a low amount of transmission in schools no more than normal flu in cold season. We need to stop stigmatizing normal seasonal respiratory viruses. RSV and flu are very severe in children. So, yes if you have a low -- or a high absentee where you have enough children who are out sick, oftentimes they will close down a classroom so that they can sanitize and give children time to recover and get back to the classroom. But they shouldn't preemptively be going to remote learning in anticipation of positive cases coming back from the holidays. There is no reason for that. We have now gone to a place where you have an entire generation of children who have been -- have poor performers when it comes to education. They have not had adequate education, they have had poor socialization, and that has been a complete hindrance to their mental and physical development. It is far more dangerous to keep them out of school than bringing them into school when we know at this point these again continue to be the lowest risk population when it comes to COVID-19. High-risk children and those that live in homes with high-risk individuals have the ability to be vaccinated, have the ability to be boosted. And from there, it is time to move forward and let this mild illness in children otherwise circulate so that they can get that immunity and we can continue keeping them in school because that is what's best for them long term.",

The members are, but the leaders are not. The leaders are bureaucrats. The leaders are corrupt individuals who now serve to satisfy themselves and the entity. And I don't mean that to attack teachers' unions. That's what unions have become in a place where we have communication. It's a lot harder to take advantage of workers which is what started the idea of a union to begin with. That's one of the problems in this country. What we need to do is be less selfish. What we haven't learned in two years is how coronavirus affects children. What we have learned in about a year is how badly being out of school affects children. So, if I'm looking at those two things, face to face, I'm going to do the unselfish thing, put my kids in a classroom, and make sure they have the social and learning opportunities that every American needs to survive in this life.

We've taken away their extracurriculars. We've crushed sports dreams for so many kids. We've isolated them. We've caused them to lose years of learning. Our special needs kids by the way are suffering um the most. And by the way, we're torturing them. We're masking them as they go to school. This is outrageous and it shows that we don't care or prioritize our children as a society. If you look at China, 94 million Chinese have been going to school since the pandemic started.

And masks in the school really hurt younger children's development because you don't realize how much children develop by mimicking the teachers, watching the teacher phrase words, how they say things, interactions. Those things, those movements that we need -- it also has to do with comfort -- the kids aren't getting that.

      "sentences": "Well, Rachel, first of all, out of all the global data from South Africa, U.K., Scotland, others including the United States, there is a lot of information that is suggesting that the virulence of omicron is much less with the much lower hospitalization rate. Anywhere from 40 to 80 percent less than we saw with delta and preceding earlier variants. Now, it doesn't mean that it's not as contagious. It's actually much more contagious, much more transmissible which is why we're seeing such a high rise of cases right now, but you know, in terms of should we just let it rip, it's a fine line, Rachel. First of all, you know, by doing that and by letting things just go unchecked in the population you will have preventable illness, preventable hospitalizations, and preventable death. However, I wrote a piece on foxnews.com a couple of weeks ago that was met with criticism because I said at this point in the pandemic we have the vaccines, we have boosters, we have a large amount of natural immunity, and we finally have a variant that, yes, is highly contagious but seems to be more mild especially more mild in people who are fully vaccinated and people who are boosted. So people have the tools at this point to prevent infection and if they do get infected it tends to be more mild, less serious, and now we finally have treatments that are proving effective. So, yes, getting that hybrid immunity, that vaccine-induced immunity, plus a breakthrough infection so some level of natural immunity, that is by far the strongest wave of protection that we could have moving forward. And this could be our step into making this virus become endemic and that is how the mindset needs to change. I'm glad President Biden has finally realized that it will not be a black and white federal solution. I remember -- I'm old enough to remember when President Trump said a couple of years ago this needs to be on the onus, needs to be on the states. It is the federal government's job to secure these private public partnerships and get out of the way. And that is exactly what \"Operation Warp Speed\" did. They allowed people to get that private public partnership, get things to the market and unfortunately we're not seeing the same urgency under the Biden administration.",

It was on the federal government to make sure they had those ventilators. But with that being said, what I really hate is these the president's on vacation headlines, right? We saw this -- this is this headline rears its ugly head every single year. It happened under George W. Bush. It happened under Barack Obama. It happened under Donald Trump. It happened under the White House. And I think the American people are smarter than that. They know wherever the president goes, so goes the White House. Both the White House communications office, all the necessary advisers the president needs to have on hand to make decisions, the nuclear football, military, everything moves when the president moves.

It's up -- it's up to the governors and state. And I'm kind of, at least give me that, because we've heard nothing but nonsense coming out of the federal government under this administration since they came in. They were going to do all this other stuff. And here's the part that drives me absolutely mad is they've wanted all of us to act like we're in -- remember, when we were kids it was like code orange and code red, and it was -- it's been code orange COVID pretty much since the administration took over, but they still ran out of test, which means that on the surface you're telling us it's terrible. But in the closed doors you're saying don't worry about it we can go on vacations. We can -- we'll just lower the CDC, you know, from 10 days to five days so we can make up for not having testing because federal workers can't go back to work unless they have a negative test on their on their COVID test if they get COVID. So, they continually changing -- it's like a Rubik's cube where someone peels the stickers off. That's what this administration is doing.

The question is do they deserve it and what will they do with that power because with just a few exceptions, Rand Paul, Senator Ron Johnson who's been a hero in the Senate, Jim Jordan. I don't hear Republicans talking enough about our loss of freedom, about the road that we're on, I believe, to a Chinese -- communist Chinese credit score system.

Under no circumstances should these schools switch to remote learning unless there is a very specific need. And it is -- it is about -- yes, it is about the teachers getting COVID-19, it's about the children getting sick, it is about them bringing home the virus to those around them. But time after time, we have now been able to prove that there is a low amount of transmission in schools no more than normal flu in cold season. We need to stop stigmatizing normal seasonal respiratory viruses. RSV and flu are very severe in children. So, yes if you have a low -- or a high absentee where you have enough children who are out sick, oftentimes they will close down a classroom so that they can sanitize and give children time to recover and get back to the classroom. But they shouldn't preemptively be going to remote learning in anticipation of positive cases coming back from the holidays. There is no reason for that. We have now gone to a place where you have an entire generation of children who have been -- have poor performers when it comes to education. They have not had adequate education, they have had poor socialization, and that has been a complete hindrance to their mental and physical development. It is far more dangerous to keep them out of school than bringing them into school when we know at this point these again continue to be the lowest risk population when it comes to COVID-19. High-risk children and those that live in homes with high-risk individuals have the ability to be vaccinated, have the ability to be boosted. And from there, it is time to move forward and let this mild illness in children otherwise circulate so that they can get that immunity and we can continue keeping them in school because that is what's best for them long term.",

What we haven't learned in two years is how coronavirus affects children. What we have learned in about a year is how badly being out of school affects children.

Joe Biden is giving up and going to the beach. The president has no events today and instead is in Delaware for a holiday getaway while omicron spikes all across the country.

We need to scale up testing. So anyone who needs one can get a test. After 10 months of the pandemic, we still don't have enough testing. It's a travesty.

They finally got an emergency use authorization, but was stalled in front of the FDA under the Biden administration.

He's going to go to -- he's going to go on vacation and some governors are going to step in and do the right thing, I hope. It really is amazing. I mean, can you imagine the billboards that will pop up in places like my hometown in Dalton, Georgia where it says it'd be Joe Biden's big face that's going to say there is no federal solution. There is nothing President Joe Biden can do by his own words to help in any of these any of these things we're struggling with, from inflation to like you said what happened in Afghanistan, to what's happening at the border, and now coronavirus. I just don't know how -- I don't know how you work for this man and not just hang your head in shame when he sits up there and he says something like that. I mean, he's got a staff there that's working every day. I think they they're honest in their work and he really has just taken the air out of their -- out of their balloon. I don't know how they keep going to work every day at this point."

I have a question about omicron that's just on my mind as I see all this play out. Omicron is very virulent and it spreads rapidly, but it appears to not be deadly. So, explain to me why this wouldn't be a great opportunity to kind of let it rip through the population and get herd immunity?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "NICOLE SAPHIER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Well, Rachel, first of all, out of all the global data from South Africa, U.K., Scotland, others including the United States, there is a lot of information that is suggesting that the virulence of omicron is much less with the much lower hospitalization rate. Anywhere from 40 to 80 percent less than we saw with delta and preceding earlier variants. Now, it doesn't mean that it's not as contagious. It's actually much more contagious, much more transmissible which is why we're seeing such a high rise of cases right now, but you know, in terms of should we just let it rip, it's a fine line, Rachel. First of all, you know, by doing that and by letting things just go unchecked in the population you will have preventable illness, preventable hospitalizations, and preventable death. However, I wrote a piece on foxnews.com a couple of weeks ago that was met with criticism because I said at this point in the pandemic we have the vaccines, we have boosters, we have a large amount of natural immunity, and we finally have a variant that, yes, is highly contagious but seems to be more mild especially more mild in people who are fully vaccinated and people who are boosted. So people have the tools at this point to prevent infection and if they do get infected it tends to be more mild, less serious, and now we finally have treatments that are proving effective. So, yes, getting that hybrid immunity, that vaccine-induced immunity, plus a breakthrough infection so some level of natural immunity, that is by far the strongest wave of protection that we could have moving forward. And this could be our step into making this virus become endemic and that is how the mindset needs to change. I'm glad President Biden has finally realized that it will not be a black and white federal solution. I remember -- I'm old enough to remember when President Trump said a couple of years ago this needs to be on the onus, needs to be on the states. It is the federal government's job to secure these private public partnerships and get out of the way. And that is exactly what \"Operation Warp Speed\" did. They allowed people to get that private public partnership, get things to the market and unfortunately we're not seeing the same urgency under the Biden administration."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAMPOS-DUFFY",
      "utterance": "Well, you're so right doctor because President Trump said from the very beginning that states should be allowed to do what they think is right for their state. So Richard, now it seems like the Biden administration is agreeing with Trump on this. Do you agree that this is no -- this should have always been a state solution?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RICHARD FOWLER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Well, a couple things here. Number one, I do think that it has to be a mixture of both the federal government and the state government working together to ensure that people get supplies, folks get ventilators, which you saw at the beginning of the pandemic when hospital -- when states were searching for ventilators. It was on the federal government to make sure they had those ventilators. But with that being said, what I really hate is these the president's on vacation headlines, right? We saw this -- this is this headline rears its ugly head every single year. It happened under George W. Bush. It happened under Barack Obama. It happened under Donald Trump. It happened under the White House. And I think the American people are smarter than that. They know wherever the president goes, so goes the White House. Both the White House communications office, all the necessary advisers the president needs to have on hand to make decisions, the nuclear football, military, everything moves when the president moves. So this headline that news of outlets continue to put out there, it's just so misleading and it's so ridiculous."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAMPOS-DUFFY",
      "utterance": "Yes. I actually agree with you, Richard. I think that, you know, with technology the president can go wherever he's at. Now, if the president's not in good shape mentally that's another issue. It doesn't matter where he's at in that case. Tyrus, let me go to you because the president's top COVID advisor is Dr. Fauci as we know, and he's saying we need to cancel New Year's. I'm hosting New Year's for Fox News. We're not canceling. What do you think?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TRYUS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Well, as someone who gets to stay home for New Year's, cancel away. No, I'm just kidding. It's wrong. You know, the only thing that is refreshing is that the president finally did throw his hands up and said we dropped the ball. There's nothing we can do on the federal level. It's up -- it's up to the governors and state. And I'm kind of, at least give me that, because we've heard nothing but nonsense coming out of the federal government under this administration since they came in. They were going to do all this other stuff. And here's the part that drives me absolutely mad is they've wanted all of us to act like we're in -- remember, when we were kids it was like code orange and code red, and it was -- it's been code orange COVID pretty much since the administration took over, but they still ran out of test, which means that on the surface you're telling us it's terrible. But in the closed doors you're saying don't worry about it we can go on vacations. We can -- we'll just lower the CDC, you know, from 10 days to five days so we can make up for not having testing because federal workers can't go back to work unless they have a negative test on their on their COVID test if they get COVID. So, they continually changing -- it's like a Rubik's cube where someone peels the stickers off. That's what this administration is doing. They just put new stickers around saying look we solved the Rubik's cube, and no, you didn't. It's a hot mess. Get it together."

The sad state of affairs for the White House is a major boon for the GOP with Republicans becoming increasingly bullish on the prospect of a red wave in next year's midterms. You know, Rachel, I want to come to you first on this. Do you think its inflation or maybe the crisis at the border or maybe just the inability to set an agenda and pass it that Americans can get behind. Why are Americans so down on President Biden and Kamala Harris for that matter?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAMPOS-DUFFY",
      "utterance": "Well, first of all, I just want to comment on Jimmy Fallon. How nice he is to Joe Biden? Remember he had to apologize for humanizing Donald Trump when he had him on. It's so interesting. Look, he is wildly unpopular. I think the first thing that happened that really made people stand up and go no more was what happened in Afghanistan. I brought that up in the last segment because I think it was just so emblematic, but there is nothing that has gone right. For me personally, I think the biggest issue is the loss of freedom that we've experienced over the last couple of years. It's this normalization of the government taking control of our lives whether it's when and if we can go to church, when we can open our businesses, if our kids can go to school. This is outrageous. And frankly, look, I think there's going to be a huge wave for Republicans. There's no doubt in my mind. The question is do they deserve it and what will they do with that power because with just a few exceptions, Rand Paul, Senator Ron Johnson who's been a hero in the Senate, Jim Jordan. I don't hear Republicans talking enough about our loss of freedom, about the road that we're on, I believe, to a Chinese -- communist Chinese credit score system. All of these things that are happening that are so scary and so un- American, these are the things I want to hear Republicans talk about for them to deserve our vote. Of course, I'd vote for them over what I see here, which is absolute failure on the part of the Democrats. I don't see one thing that Biden is doing right, but I would like to see more from Republicans in terms of speaking up for the liberties that we've lost over the last two years."

Tyrus, I remember 2019 sitting there going, you know, only Donald Trump could lose this next election for Donald Trump. Then we got hit with a virus and things kind of changed and I think the virus was a big part of why he lost the election in 2020. Can Republicans, you know, what can they do to prevent themselves from hitting this red wave because the map sure looks good for them?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TYRUS",
      "utterance": "Well, I mean, first of all, yes, I don't -- it doesn't matter who was president during a pandemic. You're not going to see that through even though I thought President Trump did an outstanding job in terms of getting the vaccinations going and getting people an opportunity to get better faster and his focus was always on getting America back to work. People heard that. They got behind that and they believed in that. This administration, you know, they all -- their entire thing was to undo everything he did. The only thing I would tell him you want to undo maybe just don't like undo a like on one of his tweets because his deeds, the deeds ladies and gentlemen of the jury, the deeds outweigh the tweets. And now we're seeing no deeds and no tweets. So we can't even get entertained while we're being treated miserably. Here's the thing though, to be fair, to be fair, President Joe is more like neck and neck with V.P. You know what I'm saying? It's like within an area of one or two points. I can tell you right -- here's some -- here's something free. You want to get 10 points right now, 10 points right now on those polls? Simple. All you got to do is go to the camp. When you're on vacation, sit up at the beach, and be like hey, previous administration, whoever was in charge was running since we got rid of you guys, we're going to bring you back, we're going to pick your brain about the border, bring back some of your old -- some of the things that you were doing right and we're going to get it right. We are bad. We're going to stick with that. We got the border lock down. That in itself is accountability, knowing what's right, and you're going to get some points back for that. Try that. Deeds.

Here we are a year into it, we know exactly where we sit. We're in boxes. We're not sitting at a table in New York City right now. Has President Biden done anything to validate that narrative from the 2020 election in this last year?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SAPHIER",
      "utterance": "Well, Joey, the reason that he is now below and I guess Tyrus sees neck and neck, but he is technically below V.P. Harris, and that is because the way that he's handled the pandemic and in that it has been he completely has politicized the virus. He blamed the unvaccinated for spreading it. Now that Democrats are actually getting breakthrough infections, you even have \"Washington Post\" saying no, no, we shouldn't be shaming people for getting COVID. Well, we shouldn't have been shaming anybody all along. They catered to the teachers unions that kept children out of school. They've completely flubbed the booster roll out which caused two high-level FDA administrators to actually leave. And now that we have omicron here that we have the high amount of immunity in the population, a milder variant, and now is the time that we should say hey, it's time to move forward, but Fauci and Biden just can't get out of the way. The best thing that they could do coming into the midterms is to remove these federal mandates because as we know we have COVID circulating in the vaccinated, the unvaccinated, and even the boosted. The message needs to be do what you can to protect yourselves, protect your families, but we're going to get out of the way. We're going to remove that OSHA mandate. We're going to pull back on a lot of these lawsuits and let states take for -- take accountability for their people and get people back to work because these mandates caused the worker shortages which is what is causing this complete spiral out of control right now."

And that means he has to deliver on the promises he made to those voters. He made a promise to fix student loan debt in this country. He made a promise to ensure and secure voting rights for African-Americans, the people of color all across this country. He made a promise that he was going to have a conversation with the base that got him to the game which were African-American voters. \\ And now more than ever the president needs to talk to his base. If he's talking to his base he will have a good midterms. If he stops talking to his base he won't and I thought what was very interesting in this poll was this.

Several of my officers who texted me, okay, and said that they were scared. They're tired of this nonsense. They have no backing and they're scared of being out there by themselves.

It's like being in a foxhole under fire and you're calling for helicopter support and there's just nothing coming back. In your experience when you -- when you look at these cities, can you -- is there any advice you can give these men and women who are in these situations, were basically left.

And for any cop out there, veteran or not, remember why you took the job. Remember why you put the badge on. It wasn't for the pay. It obviously wasn't for the glory. It was because you felt like you could do something to make your community better. And if every single one of the cops out there that believe that and join for that reason and act that way, I don't think politicians will have the opportunity to continue to undermine them because communities will support them.

Not only do we have an increase in crime, but she's also failed to talk to members of the north and -- the south and west side of the city. She promised to be a candidate that would unite the city and deal with income inequality, and deal with the disparities that exist in the south and west side of the city, and she's failed at that miserably. She failed to implement a testing and contact tracing policy even though the Biden administration gave her over $1.8 billion in our public schools in the city of Chicago. And as a result of that there was a school just a couple of weeks ago in the city of Chicago, Jensen Elementary that witnessed an outbreak that caused two mothers to die of COVID-19. And this is all happening on the mayor's watch. And she has admitted that she has failed when it comes to implementing a policy to decrease the spread of COVID-19 in her cities. So, shame on Mayor Lori Lightfoot. And big ups to all the people who are fighting against her on the southwest side of Chicago."

And you know, public safety is a fundamental responsibility of the local government. And so, when you see cities like Chicago that is high in crime, this is a direct failure of the elected officials and the policies being implemented. And people are starting to see that elections have consequences. So, when you have a city like this high in crime and low in health because you have police officers, because of under-funding, that are retiring or they are quitting, you know this puts people in a very precarious situation and you are going to see more violent violence. Perhaps President Biden, Dr. Fauci, et al, should start focusing on this public health crisis because this is the one that is rapidly expanding that there is no end in sight to, and spend a little less time on COVID."

Dispatchers get the calls, the 911 calls, and have to make the heartbreaking decisions, you know, to send out responders. And then, if there's not enough cops, they have to let those people in distress know. So, this man knows what he's talking about and that's why he's out there. And it's really powerful that he is. I lived in third-world countries. My father was in the military. And when I was in those countries, there wasn't enough funding for law enforcement there. And it was rich people who were able to you know have their own private security and their own basically fortresses around their house. We're seeing that now in cities like Chicago and Los Angeles, rich people, you know, mitigating -- you know, basically covering their bases, their houses with private security, and then it's the poor people who are left to deal with this crime. We are turning our country -- our biggest cities into third-world countries. And it's done deliberately, it doesn't have to be this way, the funding is there, she's just choosing not to give it to law enforcement and safety."

      "utterance": "So, listen, every time i hear headlines about teachers' unions, I always take the time out to remember that teachers' unions are made up of workers, and public sector workers, and educators. And I've done some time interviewing educators and what you see them saying is that we want to be back in our classrooms but we're also trying to balance that with the safety of ensuring that our students don't get COVID and bring it home to their parents or to grandma. So, Dr. Saphier, my question for you is how do we help both parents and educators bridge this balance of the importance of having in-person learning while also ensuring that these children aren't spreading COVID-19 to their loved ones back at home?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SAPHIER",
      "utterance": "Yes, that's a great question. And I can tell you, one of the biggest failures of our entire response throughout the pandemic is taking children out of school. But the biggest failure is keeping them out of school. The fact that this is even an option at this point is a continued failure of us from a federal level, a state level, and a local level. Under no circumstances should these schools switch to remote learning unless there is a very specific need. And it is -- it is about -- yes, it is about the teachers getting COVID-19, it's about the children getting sick, it is about them bringing home the virus to those around them. But time after time, we have now been able to prove that there is a low amount of transmission in schools no more than normal flu in cold season. We need to stop stigmatizing normal seasonal respiratory viruses. RSV and flu are very severe in children. So, yes if you have a low -- or a high absentee where you have enough children who are out sick, oftentimes they will close down a classroom so that they can sanitize and give children time to recover and get back to the classroom. But they shouldn't preemptively be going to remote learning in anticipation of positive cases coming back from the holidays. There is no reason for that. We have now gone to a place where you have an entire generation of children who have been -- have poor performers when it comes to education. They have not had adequate education, they have had poor socialization, and that has been a complete hindrance to their mental and physical development. It is far more dangerous to keep them out of school than bringing them into school when we know at this point these again continue to be the lowest risk population when it comes to COVID-19. High-risk children and those that live in homes with high-risk individuals have the ability to be vaccinated, have the ability to be boosted. And from there, it is time to move forward and let this mild illness in children otherwise circulate so that they can get that immunity and we can continue keeping them in school because that is what's best for them long term."

So, how do you balance educators who want to be with their -- with their students when you have government failure when it comes to testing, contact tracing, ensuring that folks have access to the vaccine?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JONES",
      "utterance": "Well, you know, maybe you say get parents to the school board to advocate for their children, but I guess that's a cardinal sin now too. You'll have the FBI breathing down your back I guess. The problem now is that we have the -- you talk -- you opened the segment talking about how school union -- teachers unions are made up of the worker, the person in there with the kids. The members are, but the leaders are not. The leaders are bureaucrats. The leaders are corrupt individuals who now serve to satisfy themselves and the entity. And I don't mean that to attack teachers' unions. That's what unions have become in a place where we have communication. It's a lot harder to take advantage of workers which is what started the idea of a union to begin with. That's one of the problems in this country. What we need to do is be less selfish. What we haven't learned in two years is how coronavirus affects children. What we have learned in about a year is how badly being out of school affects children. So, if I'm looking at those two things, face to face, I'm going to do the unselfish thing, put my kids in a classroom, and make sure they have the social and learning opportunities that every American needs to survive in this life. Nothing affects socioeconomically, underprivileged kids worse. Nothing bridges that gap wider than this at-home learning. Because kids with rich parents and attentive parents won't have the same problems that other kids who need to be in classroom should have the opportunity and attention."

      "speaker": "CAMPOS-DUFFY",
      "utterance": "Well, let's start with what Joey was talking about with the unions. Public school teachers don't work for the unions. They work for us the taxpayers. We pay their salaries and that's who they work for. It is very clear when you have mental health just skyrocketing, mental health problems among children as young as 4 or 5 years old. You have a 50 percent increase in suicide attempts among teenage girls. The pandemic is really -- the epidemic is mental health among our kids and it's all been orchestrated by people with political motives. We have absolutely destroyed their childhoods. We've taken away their extracurriculars. We've crushed sports dreams for so many kids. We've isolated them. We've caused them to lose years of learning. Our special needs kids by the way are suffering um the most. And by the way, we're torturing them. We're masking them as they go to school. This is outrageous and it shows that we don't care or prioritize our children as a society. If you look at China, 94 million Chinese have been going to school since the pandemic started. This is a culture that values education and clearly values their future. We are not and we're allowing political actors very bad and corrupt political actors run the lives of our children and ruin them."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "TYRUS",
      "utterance": "Well, you can never really compare United States to any other country because we are a country of freedoms and we have choices. They don't have a choice in necessarily in China to homeschool or whatever. But I will say this as a parent and a former educator. Homeschooling your own children and teaching your own children is the toughest job in the world because it's just -- it's just really difficult. And masks in the school really hurt younger children's development because you don't realize how much children develop by mimicking the teachers, watching the teacher phrase words, how they say things, interactions. Those things, those movements that we need -- it also has to do with comfort -- the kids aren't getting that. So, you know, a lot of things go wrong when you're not in the classroom because you're just not getting in that environment and you're not getting the stuff that you need. And it puts a lot of burden on mom and dad who are working two jobs trying to play catch up for when they couldn't pay rent and et cetera. So, in school -- in-home learning is a really bad idea. We need our schools open. And of course, the teachers always get the brunt of it, but it's the administrators who need to get their act together."

We need to scale up testing. So anyone who needs one can get a test. After 10 months of the pandemic, we still don't have enough testing. It's a travesty.

He's going to go to -- he's going to go on vacation and some governors are going to step in and do the right thing, I hope. It really is amazing. I mean, can you imagine the billboards that will pop up in places like my hometown in Dalton, Georgia where it says it'd be Joe Biden's big face that's going to say there is no federal solution. There is nothing President Joe Biden can do by his own words to help in any of these any of these things we're struggling with, from inflation to like you said what happened in Afghanistan, to what's happening at the border, and now coronavirus. I just don't know how -- I don't know how you work for this man and not just hang your head in shame when he sits up there and he says something like that. I mean, he's got a staff there that's working every day. I think they they're honest in their work and he really has just taken the air out of their -- out of their balloon.

I have a question about omicron that's just on my mind as I see all this play out. Omicron is very virulent and it spreads rapidly, but it appears to not be deadly. So, explain to me why this wouldn't be a great opportunity to kind of let it rip through the population and get herd immunity?"

    {
      "speaker": "NICOLE SAPHIER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Well, Rachel, first of all, out of all the global data from South Africa, U.K., Scotland, others including the United States, there is a lot of information that is suggesting that the virulence of omicron is much less with the much lower hospitalization rate. Anywhere from 40 to 80 percent less than we saw with delta and preceding earlier variants. Now, it doesn't mean that it's not as contagious. It's actually much more contagious, much more transmissible which is why we're seeing such a high rise of cases right now, but you know, in terms of should we just let it rip, it's a fine line, Rachel. First of all, you know, by doing that and by letting things just go unchecked in the population you will have preventable illness, preventable hospitalizations, and preventable death. However, I wrote a piece on foxnews.com a couple of weeks ago that was met with criticism because I said at this point in the pandemic we have the vaccines, we have boosters, we have a large amount of natural immunity, and we finally have a variant that, yes, is highly contagious but seems to be more mild especially more mild in people who are fully vaccinated and people who are boosted. So people have the tools at this point to prevent infection and if they do get infected it tends to be more mild, less serious, and now we finally have treatments that are proving effective. So, yes, getting that hybrid immunity, that vaccine-induced immunity, plus a breakthrough infection so some level of natural immunity, that is by far the strongest wave of protection that we could have moving forward. And this could be our step into making this virus become endemic and that is how the mindset needs to change. I'm glad President Biden has finally realized that it will not be a black and white federal solution. I remember -- I'm old enough to remember when President Trump said a couple of years ago this needs to be on the onus, needs to be on the states. It is the federal government's job to secure these private public partnerships and get out of the way. And that is exactly what \"Operation Warp Speed\" did. They allowed people to get that private public partnership, get things to the market and unfortunately we're not seeing the same urgency under the Biden administration."

      "speaker": "RICHARD FOWLER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",

Number one, I do think that it has to be a mixture of both the federal government and the state government working together to ensure that people get supplies, folks get ventilators, which you saw at the beginning of the pandemic when hospital -- when states were searching for ventilators. It was on the federal government to make sure they had those ventilators. But with that being said, what I really hate is these the president's on vacation headlines, right? We saw this -- this is this headline rears its ugly head every single year. It happened under George W. Bush. It happened under Barack Obama. It happened under Donald Trump. It happened under the White House. And I think the American people are smarter than that. They know wherever the president goes, so goes the White House. Both the White House communications office, all the necessary advisers the president needs to have on hand to make decisions, the nuclear football, military, everything moves when the president moves. So this headline that news of outlets continue to put out there, it's just so misleading and it's so ridiculous."

Tyrus, let me go to you because the president's top COVID advisor is Dr. Fauci as we know, and he's saying we need to cancel New Year's. I'm hosting New Year's for Fox News. We're not canceling.

You know, the only thing that is refreshing is that the president finally did throw his hands up and said we dropped the ball. There's nothing we can do on the federal level. It's up -- it's up to the governors and state. And I'm kind of, at least give me that, because we've heard nothing but nonsense coming out of the federal government under this administration since they came in. They were going to do all this other stuff. And here's the part that drives me absolutely mad is they've wanted all of us to act like we're in -- remember, when we were kids it was like code orange and code red, and it was -- it's been code orange COVID pretty much since the administration took over, but they still ran out of test, which means that on the surface you're telling us it's terrible. But in the closed doors you're saying don't worry about it we can go on vacations. We can -- we'll just lower the CDC, you know, from 10 days to five days so we can make up for not having testing because federal workers can't go back to work unless they have a negative test on their on their COVID test if they get COVID. So, they continually changing -- it's like a Rubik's cube where someone peels the stickers off. That's what this administration is doing. They just put new stickers around saying look we solved the Rubik's cube, and no, you didn't. It's a hot mess. Get it together."

The sad state of affairs for the White House is a major boon for the GOP with Republicans becoming increasingly bullish on the prospect of a red wave in next year's midterms. You know, Rachel, I want to come to you first on this.

It's so interesting. Look, he is wildly unpopular. I think the first thing that happened that really made people stand up and go no more was what happened in Afghanistan. I brought that up in the last segment because I think it was just so emblematic, but there is nothing that has gone right. For me personally, I think the biggest issue is the loss of freedom that we've experienced over the last couple of years. It's this normalization of the government taking control of our lives whether it's when and if we can go to church, when we can open our businesses, if our kids can go to school. This is outrageous. And frankly, look, I think there's going to be a huge wave for Republicans. There's no doubt in my mind. The question is do they deserve it and what will they do with that power because with just a few exceptions, Rand Paul, Senator Ron Johnson who's been a hero in the Senate, Jim Jordan. I don't hear Republicans talking enough about our loss of freedom, about the road that we're on, I believe, to a Chinese -- communist Chinese credit score system. All of these things that are happening that are so scary and so un- American, these are the things I want to hear Republicans talk about for them to deserve our vote. Of course, I'd vote for them over what I see here, which is absolute failure on the part of the Democrats. I don't see one thing that Biden is doing right, but I would like to see more from Republicans in terms of speaking up for the liberties that we've lost over the last two years."

Then we got hit with a virus and things kind of changed and I think the virus was a big part of why he lost the election in 2020.

You're not going to see that through even though I thought President Trump did an outstanding job in terms of getting the vaccinations going and getting people an opportunity to get better faster and his focus was always on getting America back to work. People heard that. They got behind that and they believed in that. This administration, you know, they all -- their entire thing was to undo everything he did. The only thing I would tell him you want to undo maybe just don't like undo a like on one of his tweets because his deeds, the deeds ladies and gentlemen of the jury, the deeds outweigh the tweets. And now we're seeing no deeds and no tweets. So we can't even get entertained while we're being treated miserably. Here's the thing though, to be fair, to be fair, President Joe is more like neck and neck with V.P. You know what I'm saying? It's like within an area of one or two points. I can tell you right -- here's some -- here's something free. You want to get 10 points right now, 10 points right now on those polls? Simple. All you got to do is go to the camp. When you're on vacation, sit up at the beach, and be like hey, previous administration, whoever was in charge was running since we got rid of you guys, we're going to bring you back, we're going to pick your brain about the border, bring back some of your old -- some of the things that you were doing right and we're going to get it right. We are bad. We're going to stick with that. We got the border lock down. That in itself is accountability, knowing what's right, and you're going to get some points back for that. Try that. Deeds.

Harris, and that is because the way that he's handled the pandemic and in that it has been he completely has politicized the virus. He blamed the unvaccinated for spreading it. Now that Democrats are actually getting breakthrough infections, you even have \"Washington Post\" saying no, no, we shouldn't be shaming people for getting COVID. Well, we shouldn't have been shaming anybody all along. They catered to the teachers unions that kept children out of school. They've completely flubbed the booster roll out which caused two high-level FDA administrators to actually leave. And now that we have omicron here that we have the high amount of immunity in the population, a milder variant, and now is the time that we should say hey, it's time to move forward, but Fauci and Biden just can't get out of the way. The best thing that they could do coming into the midterms is to remove these federal mandates because as we know we have COVID circulating in the vaccinated, the unvaccinated, and even the boosted. The message needs to be do what you can to protect yourselves, protect your families, but we're going to get out of the way. We're going to remove that OSHA mandate. We're going to pull back on a lot of these lawsuits and let states take for -- take accountability for their people and get people back to work because these mandates caused the worker shortages which is what is causing this complete spiral out of control right now."

And that means he has to deliver on the promises he made to those voters. He made a promise to fix student loan debt in this country. He made a promise to ensure and secure voting rights for African-Americans, the people of color all across this country. He made a promise that he was going to have a conversation with the base that got him to the game which were African-American voters. \\ And now more than ever the president needs to talk to his base. If he's talking to his base he will have a good midterms. If he stops talking to his base he won't and I thought what was very interesting in this poll was this.

It's like being in a foxhole under fire and you're calling for helicopter support and there's just nothing coming back.

She promised to be a candidate that would unite the city and deal with income inequality, and deal with the disparities that exist in the south and west side of the city, and she's failed at that miserably. She failed to implement a testing and contact tracing policy even though the Biden administration gave her over $1.8 billion in our public schools in the city of Chicago. And as a result of that there was a school just a couple of weeks ago in the city of Chicago, Jensen Elementary that witnessed an outbreak that caused two mothers to die of COVID-19.

      "utterance": "So, listen, every time i hear headlines about teachers' unions, I always take the time out to remember that teachers' unions are made up of workers, and public sector workers, and educators. And I've done some time interviewing educators and what you see them saying is that we want to be back in our classrooms but we're also trying to balance that with the safety of ensuring that our students don't get COVID and bring it home to their parents or to grandma. So, Dr. Saphier, my question for you is how do we help both parents and educators bridge this balance of the importance of having in-person learning while also ensuring that these children aren't spreading COVID-19 to their loved ones back at home?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SAPHIER",
      "utterance": "Yes, that's a great question. And I can tell you, one of the biggest failures of our entire response throughout the pandemic is taking children out of school. But the biggest failure is keeping them out of school. The fact that this is even an option at this point is a continued failure of us from a federal level, a state level, and a local level. Under no circumstances should these schools switch to remote learning unless there is a very specific need. And it is -- it is about -- yes, it is about the teachers getting COVID-19, it's about the children getting sick, it is about them bringing home the virus to those around them. But time after time, we have now been able to prove that there is a low amount of transmission in schools no more than normal flu in cold season. We need to stop stigmatizing normal seasonal respiratory viruses. RSV and flu are very severe in children. So, yes if you have a low -- or a high absentee where you have enough children who are out sick, oftentimes they will close down a classroom so that they can sanitize and give children time to recover and get back to the classroom. But they shouldn't preemptively be going to remote learning in anticipation of positive cases coming back from the holidays. There is no reason for that. We have now gone to a place where you have an entire generation of children who have been -- have poor performers when it comes to education. They have not had adequate education, they have had poor socialization, and that has been a complete hindrance to their mental and physical development. It is far more dangerous to keep them out of school than bringing them into school when we know at this point these again continue to be the lowest risk population when it comes to COVID-19. High-risk children and those that live in homes with high-risk individuals have the ability to be vaccinated, have the ability to be boosted. And from there, it is time to move forward and let this mild illness in children otherwise circulate so that they can get that immunity and we can continue keeping them in school because that is what's best for them long term."

    {
      "speaker": "FOWLER",
      "utterance": "Thanks Dr. Saphier. So, Joey, I guess my question to you is this. I mean, because there is this prevailing balance that I think that Dr. Saphier laid out there, right? So, how do you balance educators who want to be with their -- with their students when you have government failure when it comes to testing, contact tracing, ensuring that folks have access to the vaccine?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JONES",
      "utterance": "Well, you know, maybe you say get parents to the school board to advocate for their children, but I guess that's a cardinal sin now too. You'll have the FBI breathing down your back I guess. The problem now is that we have the -- you talk -- you opened the segment talking about how school union -- teachers unions are made up of the worker, the person in there with the kids. The members are, but the leaders are not. The leaders are bureaucrats. The leaders are corrupt individuals who now serve to satisfy themselves and the entity. And I don't mean that to attack teachers' unions. That's what unions have become in a place where we have communication. It's a lot harder to take advantage of workers which is what started the idea of a union to begin with. That's one of the problems in this country. What we need to do is be less selfish. What we haven't learned in two years is how coronavirus affects children. What we have learned in about a year is how badly being out of school affects children. So, if I'm looking at those two things, face to face, I'm going to do the unselfish thing, put my kids in a classroom, and make sure they have the social and learning opportunities that every American needs to survive in this life. Nothing affects socioeconomically, underprivileged kids worse. Nothing bridges that gap wider than this at-home learning. Because kids with rich parents and attentive parents won't have the same problems that other kids who need to be in classroom should have the opportunity and attention."

    {
      "speaker": "CAMPOS-DUFFY",
      "utterance": "Well, let's start with what Joey was talking about with the unions. Public school teachers don't work for the unions. They work for us the taxpayers. We pay their salaries and that's who they work for. It is very clear when you have mental health just skyrocketing, mental health problems among children as young as 4 or 5 years old. You have a 50 percent increase in suicide attempts among teenage girls. The pandemic is really -- the epidemic is mental health among our kids and it's all been orchestrated by people with political motives. We have absolutely destroyed their childhoods. We've taken away their extracurriculars. We've crushed sports dreams for so many kids. We've isolated them. We've caused them to lose years of learning. Our special needs kids by the way are suffering um the most. And by the way, we're torturing them. We're masking them as they go to school. This is outrageous and it shows that we don't care or prioritize our children as a society. If you look at China, 94 million Chinese have been going to school since the pandemic started. This is a culture that values education and clearly values their future. We are not and we're allowing political actors very bad and corrupt political actors run the lives of our children and ruin them."

    {
      "speaker": "FOWLER",
      "utterance": "So, Tyrus, to Rachel's point there, I mean, how do we sort of compete with the global world when we see that in countries like China, India, and South Korea, their investment in public education and making sure their students have the best education is far outpaces America?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TYRUS",
      "utterance": "Well, you can never really compare United States to any other country because we are a country of freedoms and we have choices. They don't have a choice in necessarily in China to homeschool or whatever. But I will say this as a parent and a former educator. Homeschooling your own children and teaching your own children is the toughest job in the world because it's just -- it's just really difficult. And masks in the school really hurt younger children's development because you don't realize how much children develop by mimicking the teachers, watching the teacher phrase words, how they say things, interactions. Those things, those movements that we need -- it also has to do with comfort -- the kids aren't getting that. So, you know, a lot of things go wrong when you're not in the classroom because you're just not getting in that environment and you're not getting the stuff that you need. And it puts a lot of burden on mom and dad who are working two jobs trying to play catch up for when they couldn't pay rent and et cetera. So, in school -- in-home learning is a really bad idea. We need our schools open. And of course, the teachers always get the brunt of it, but it's the administrators who need to get their act together."

I'm going to adopt that tradition if I can. And wow, what kind -- what kind of Christmas spirit don't you have unless there's something going on in their life? Maybe the Chick-fil-A role of empathize with people that are mean, but man, that was just terrible. How can you -- how can you do that? That's terrible."
