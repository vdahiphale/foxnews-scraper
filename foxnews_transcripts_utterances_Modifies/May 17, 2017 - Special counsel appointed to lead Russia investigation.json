The Justice Department announced this evening that a special counsel has been appointed to investigate the allegations that the Russian government attempted to influence the 2016 presidential election. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed FBI Director Robert Mulder to oversee the probe. President Trump quickly reacted saying, quote, \"A thorough investigation will confirm what we already know. There was no collusion between my campaign in any foreign entity.\"  Joining us now live from the White House is FOX News Chief National Correspondent Ed Henry.",

      "sentences": "Well, here's the problem for the White House tonight, Jesse which is that, this is now a wide open investigation. The press release from the Justice Department makes it very clear that Bob Mueller, a highly respected former director of the FBI, wide support in both parties now has a vast power to investigate Russian influence in the last presidential election and, quote-unquote, \"other matters.\" And so, what does that mean? Does that mean he'll also investigate General Mike Flynn? Will he investigate the President's dinner with James Comey? Another former FBI director.  And so, if you think back to the Clinton days and Ken Starr, a special counsel, a special prosecutor can start as one thing and become quite another, and to be very, very difficult for a White House. On the other hand, what is good news for this White House tonight is the fact that the President now perhaps can get back focused on taxes and health care and the other things he was elected to do while a highly regarded special counsel is now focused on the Russia matter. So, to your question and to your point, if this president has nothing to worry about here, he will now have a highly respected investigator who will look at this and if there is nothing there at the end of it, the American people can have confidence that we can finally move on from this. Obviously if Bob Mueller though, now with this wide open investigation, does find a crime or crimes, that's a whole another matter and it's going to get very difficult for this president because of the fact that Mueller is known as someone with great integrity.",

      "sentences": "It did seem like a surprise, because as you know, this president, his top aides have been resisting calls for a special counsel to be named. But the fact of the matter is that our own John Roberts, our chief White House correspondent is telling us tonight that from a senior administration official, when Don McGahn whose the White House counsel got the official call from the Justice Department that this is the way they were going to go with Bob Mueller, a special counsel, McGahn did went to the President in the Oval Office and they convened a meeting, Reince Priebus, the chief-of- staff, Kellyanne Conway, Steve Bannon, all kinds of top aides. And what I find interesting in this reporting is that we are hearing that the President seemed measured in his response. You know that President Trump's critics are waiting for him tonight or tomorrow morning early, tomorrow, get on social media stop ripping either in the Bob Mueller or his critics on the hill. But instead we're hearing a much different portrait from the President senior advisors tonight that in the Oval Office, the President basically told his top aides, okay, this is the hand we've been dealt, let's move forward.   And so, to Jesse's point, this may give on the positive side, this White House some breathing space to get back to the business of the nation, you saw the markets, reacting it in negative way today, to all of this uncertainty in Washington. Okay. Now, it's going to be investigated, let's get back to business. And the President realizes there's nothing he can do at this point, a special counsel has vast power, there is no more resisting the calls. And in some ways, that's good for this White House instead of the drip drip of not just Democrats but now slowly some Republicans on The Hill saying, yes, we need a special counsel and the White House, you know, what, that's over now, Kimberly. There is a Special Counsel, they have to dealt with it.",

We're going to stay away from that. We have a Special Counsel, Bob Mueller is looking at that. I'm going to talk about health care. I'm going to talk about taxes.  So, instead of that drip, drip you mentioned and the pounding that Sean Spicer and the President himself had been taking and others here at the White House, I'm not saying this is good news, there's a special counsel now investigating this. And so, Katie Bardador (ph), if there was, and I underline the word if, there were a crime or crimes here, Bob Mueller is respected and as a lawyer, is a former FBI director.   If there were crimes here he's likely to find them. But, so I'm not spinning this as good news but at the end of the day, you are absolutely right that this is a chance for the White House to insulate themselves and say that is going on over there, we're focused on the business of the country.",

What is the difference with Bob Mueller taking over here? And also, I do think they were sort of missing one other point. This is not just an investigation into possible collusion in between the Trump campaign and Russia. It's actually much bigger than that.  And I see this almost like a Rob Silverman report on WMD. Because it's about the overall Russia attempt to influence, it may be had nothing to do with the Trump campaign. But when you look at some of the things that Russia was doing to hack into twitter and social media and create fake news stories and all of that -- I actually think this could be very, very useful overall for not just America but for the civilized world to basically push back against this entity Russia in some sort of like a Robert Silverman type report that would be accepted in its conclusion.",

      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "sentences": "Correct. Because I think as you lay that out without a special counsel, President Trump could have been dealing with this, maybe not for weeks or months, but maybe years. On the other hand now, you could get a vast investigation to look at everything John McCain last night as a Republican, a senior Republican said this is becoming something like Watergate, drip, drip. The American people are not going to have respect for the investigation if it's done by people who are seen as close to the President, it must be some sort of independent probe. So, to your point, I think, yes, this could be important for this White House to have some sort of good housekeeping seal of approval that this is not a crony of President Trump who was looking at this. On your question about a special counsel, special prosecutor, the law has changed. Remember the special prosecutor laws I recall several years ago, expired. And so now, the Justice Department has the ability to call a special counsel, what will that mean for Bob Mueller? We don't know tonight.   He then now has to hire lawyers, he has to have investigators. We're told that he's going to build on the current investigation with FBI agents but he's going to have to get office space here in Washington. He's going to get investigators. This could be a sprawling investigation. Does he just look at it as a, quote-unquote, \"special counsel\" that investigates and then recommends to the Justice Department whether or not there's a prosecution if there are crimes. Final point, you are right. There is an important point everyone has to remember, which is that, this is not just about Russia influencing the election. When the Justice Department statement says, they'll be investigating the special counsel, other matters, that could mean the President's dinner with James Comey, the President's meeting in the Oval Office with James Comey, General Flynn and the money he accepted, there are all kinds of things that this can open the door to that could be very painful for this White House.",

So, you're desperately trying to find all these little things, but that's not what I want to talk about. I swear I can hear Hillary Clinton cackling in her makeshift shed out in the woods. Because I think this is maybe for her a minor victory, a participation trophy after being just slaughtered by Trump in the election. If you remember in the book \"Shattered,\" they detailed about right after she lost, the narrative that she wanted out, was that she lost because of Russia. And so, ever since then it has been about Russia, Russia, Russia, and now, that's what she got. The media is on board, everybody is doing her bidding, it's like she's never went away.",

And so, I think directly to your question, the fact of the matter is Hillary Clinton has not gotten over the result, maybe she gets some measure of justice tonight that this is all going to be looked at, but I think it's very interesting that remember Donald Trump and his advisors in the campaign encouraged this whole lock her up refrain and so now you have a very in serious investigator in Robert Mueller looking at whether or not there were crimes on the Trump side. We don't have any evidence that there was or is but now they are investigating it and they are looking at it very closely -- Greg.",

The Justice Department announced this evening that a special counsel has been appointed to investigate the allegations that the Russian government attempted to influence the 2016 presidential election. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed FBI Director Robert Mulder to oversee the probe. President Trump quickly reacted saying, quote, \"A thorough investigation will confirm what we already know. There was no collusion between my campaign in any foreign entity.\" Joining us now live from the White House is FOX News Chief National Correspondent Ed Henry."

      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "All right. You too, Ed, so the Feds have been investigating Russia and the election and Donald Trump's campaign probably for about a year, it seems like. I haven't heard anything solid. Everyone is, you know, running around crazy in Washington on cable tonight. There's a difference between a scandal and a conspiracy. So, tell me, what exactly would this special counsel be investigating in terms of a crime?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "Well, here's the problem for the White House tonight, Jesse which is that, this is now a wide open investigation. The press release from the Justice Department makes it very clear that Bob Mueller, a highly respected former director of the FBI, wide support in both parties now has a vast power to investigate Russian influence in the last presidential election and, quote-unquote, \"other matters.\" And so, what does that mean? Does that mean he'll also investigate General Mike Flynn? Will he investigate the President's dinner with James Comey? Another former FBI director. And so, if you think back to the Clinton days and Ken Starr, a special counsel, a special prosecutor can start as one thing and become quite another, and to be very, very difficult for a White House. On the other hand, what is good news for this White House tonight is the fact that the President now perhaps can get back focused on taxes and health care and the other things he was elected to do while a highly regarded special counsel is now focused on the Russia matter. So, to your question and to your point, if this president has nothing to worry about here, he will now have a highly respected investigator who will look at this and if there is nothing there at the end of it, the American people can have confidence that we can finally move on from this. Obviously if Bob Mueller though, now with this wide open investigation, does find a crime or crimes, that's a whole another matter and it's going to get very difficult for this president because of the fact that Mueller is known as someone with great integrity."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Yes. So, like you said it could really give the President some breathing room to enact his agenda in the next couple years or however long this takes. Let's take it around the horn, Kimberly Guilfoyle."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, CO-HOST",
      "utterance": "All right. Thank you, Jesse. So, Ed, does this come really though as a surprise, that this was the direction that they were leaning in, it seems like they tried to get out in front of it in terms of saying, they wanted to have this happen to make sure to show that there was nothing improper, no kinds of impropriety going on here."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "It did seem like a surprise, because as you know, this president, his top aides have been resisting calls for a special counsel to be named. But the fact of the matter is that our own John Roberts, our chief White House correspondent is telling us tonight that from a senior administration official, when Don McGahn whose the White House counsel got the official call from the Justice Department that this is the way they were going to go with Bob Mueller, a special counsel, McGahn did went to the President in the Oval Office and they convened a meeting, Reince Priebus, the chief-of- staff, Kellyanne Conway, Steve Bannon, all kinds of top aides. And what I find interesting in this reporting is that we are hearing that the President seemed measured in his response. You know that President Trump's critics are waiting for him tonight or tomorrow morning early, tomorrow, get on social media stop ripping either in the Bob Mueller or his critics on the hill. But instead we're hearing a much different portrait from the President senior advisors tonight that in the Oval Office, the President basically told his top aides, okay, this is the hand we've been dealt, let's move forward. And so, to Jesse's point, this may give on the positive side, this White House some breathing space to get back to the business of the nation, you saw the markets, reacting it in negative way today, to all of this uncertainty in Washington. Okay. Now, it's going to be investigated, let's get back to business. And the President realizes there's nothing he can do at this point, a special counsel has vast power, there is no more resisting the calls. And in some ways, that's good for this White House instead of the drip drip of not just Democrats but now slowly some Republicans on The Hill saying, yes, we need a special counsel and the White House, you know, what, that's over now, Kimberly. There is a Special Counsel, they have to dealt with it."

    {
      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "Yes. Because you have the number two official who helped write that memo that helped the President decide that he's going to fire at James Comey, he has the power to appoint a special counsel because remember the number one official at the Justice Department the Attorney General of the United States, the chief law enforcement officer Jeff Sessions has recused himself from all matters related to this Russia investigation because he was part of the campaign. So, the White House had no control over it. And their Attorney General had no control of it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BECKEL",
      "utterance": "Yes. But it's a little unusual that they don't even know that this is going on. But I think it's good for them. I think Jessie made a good point. You know, up to now, they have so screwed up the communication on this stuff on the drip, drip, drip, and they could never get on the same page, this White House."

      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "Yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BECKEL",

      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BECKEL",
      "utterance": "If you can't screw that up, well, maybe they could, but it would be hard-pressed to do it. But this White House might pull it off."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "Well, Bob, you know, previous administrations in both parties, whether you had a special counsel, or you had Congressional investigation, it's an effective tool and effective weapon as you suggest to say, when you are asked at the White House podium, Sean Spicer, what's the latest on the Russia investigation? We're going to stay away from that. We have a Special Counsel, Bob Mueller is looking at that. I'm going to talk about health care. I'm going to talk about taxes. So, instead of that drip, drip you mentioned and the pounding that Sean Spicer and the President himself had been taking and others here at the White House, I'm not saying this is good news, there's a special counsel now investigating this. And so, Katie Bardador (ph), if there was, and I underline the word if, there were a crime or crimes here, Bob Mueller is respected and as a lawyer, is a former FBI director. If there were crimes here he's likely to find them. But, so I'm not spinning this as good news but at the end of the day, you are absolutely right that this is a chance for the White House to insulate themselves and say that is going on over there, we're focused on the business of the country."

      "utterance": "Well, Ed, you were in the White House briefing room, I was the deputy press secretary at the time when the Valerie Plame investigation was going on, and there was a special prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald who was a U.S. attorney at the time in prosecuting attorney. What is the difference with Bob Mueller taking over here? And also, I do think they were sort of missing one other point. This is not just an investigation into possible collusion in between the Trump campaign and Russia. It's actually much bigger than that. And I see this almost like a Rob Silverman report on WMD. Because it's about the overall Russia attempt to influence, it may be had nothing to do with the Trump campaign. But when you look at some of the things that Russia was doing to hack into twitter and social media and create fake news stories and all of that -- I actually think this could be very, very useful overall for not just America but for the civilized world to basically push back against this entity Russia in some sort of like a Robert Silverman type report that would be accepted in its conclusion."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "Correct. Because I think as you lay that out without a special counsel, President Trump could have been dealing with this, maybe not for weeks or months, but maybe years. On the other hand now, you could get a vast investigation to look at everything John McCain last night as a Republican, a senior Republican said this is becoming something like Watergate, drip, drip. The American people are not going to have respect for the investigation if it's done by people who are seen as close to the President, it must be some sort of independent probe. So, to your point, I think, yes, this could be important for this White House to have some sort of good housekeeping seal of approval that this is not a crony of President Trump who was looking at this. On your question about a special counsel, special prosecutor, the law has changed. Remember the special prosecutor laws I recall several years ago, expired. And so now, the Justice Department has the ability to call a special counsel, what will that mean for Bob Mueller? We don't know tonight. He then now has to hire lawyers, he has to have investigators. We're told that he's going to build on the current investigation with FBI agents but he's going to have to get office space here in Washington. He's going to get investigators. This could be a sprawling investigation. Does he just look at it as a, quote-unquote, \"special counsel\" that investigates and then recommends to the Justice Department whether or not there's a prosecution if there are crimes. Final point, you are right. There is an important point everyone has to remember, which is that, this is not just about Russia influencing the election. When the Justice Department statement says, they'll be investigating the special counsel, other matters, that could mean the President's dinner with James Comey, the President's meeting in the Oval Office with James Comey, General Flynn and the money he accepted, there are all kinds of things that this can open the door to that could be very painful for this White House."

I mean, when you can't focus and instead you're saying, it could be this, it could be this, it could be this, it's because there is no this. So, you're desperately trying to find all these little things, but that's not what I want to talk about. I swear I can hear Hillary Clinton cackling in her makeshift shed out in the woods. Because I think this is maybe for her a minor victory, a participation trophy after being just slaughtered by Trump in the election. If you remember in the book \"Shattered,\" they detailed about right after she lost, the narrative that she wanted out, was that she lost because of Russia. And so, ever since then it has been about Russia, Russia, Russia, and now, that's what she got. The media is on board, everybody is doing her bidding, it's like she's never went away."

As Sean Spicer said from the podium here behind me at the White House, the day after, he said if they had finished the Super Bowl at halftime, the Atlanta Falcons would have one. October 27th was ridiculous, that had nothing to do with it. It was not Election Day. And so, I think directly to your question, the fact of the matter is Hillary Clinton has not gotten over the result, maybe she gets some measure of justice tonight that this is all going to be looked at, but I think it's very interesting that remember Donald Trump and his advisors in the campaign encouraged this whole lock her up refrain and so now you have a very in serious investigator in Robert Mueller looking at whether or not there were crimes on the Trump side. We don't have any evidence that there was or is but now they are investigating it and they are looking at it very closely -- Greg."

And another thing, it takes the Democratic messaging away that Trump is above the law and he's the king and he's stopping everything from going on, he's assaulting democracy and it says something very interesting.

After the election, the first word out of Hillary's mouth wasn't goodbye, it was resist and now they're all onboard doing her job. But what does it really change? Nothing. It only makes the game more interesting. Our government has always done stuff that the public doesn't see. Problem is, Donald Trump doesn't hide it making him a leaker's dream. And so, we have this orgy of cable news air burning. But how is this worse than the IRS scandal? You think Obama never slow-walked anything? You think he didn't tell the Russians to chill until he won? You think you didn't give Manning a pass? Give me a break, that's so much worse. Oh, but Greg, that shouldn't excuse Donald Trump! Yes, it does. When those drooling defenders of Obama's errors now scream for Trump's head you bet it does. So, it's a pure media play like a 24 hour Super Bowl and it would end until there's a loser which won't be the media or the pollsters because like roaches they survive everything. So, electing Trump, a disruptive force, was revolutionary. So now, what you are seeing is the counterrevolution led by a frantic force that slept through the last nine years.

I don't believe that they're going to be able to impeach this president. Based on what evidence? Certainly nothing that has been put forward thus far. So they are doing this and they are hyping it and hyping it because they like the sound of it, they like the idea of it, they like the sound of the fund raising dollars and how it sounds back to their constituents. But they're not actually thinking about what's in the best interest of the country to try to undermine the presidency. The other problem is it's not just that the mainstream media and the Dems and the liberals, there are people within the president's own party and I believe in his own administration that aren't really serving him the best way that they could, perhaps they're not all on board with his policies and his proposals and his agenda. If I were him, I would tighten up the ranks and make sure that he has a real strong loyalty with him like President Reagan did, they called at Reagan's army, when he came in and he dismissed the people that weren't his people and brought in his own to go forward."

If your boss or somebody on behalf of your boss is asking you or pressuring you to defend that person or this person, that is actually actionable.

But, the media has called Donald Trump a clan member, a sexual deviant, Hitler, (inaudible), a bigot, they've ridiculed his son, his grandson, his wife. They smeared his business accomplishment, his books, his empire, his taxes. They've done everything they could to stop his presidency from going forward. So I can see why he's a little testy and I think it works for him because I think when he does this and he plays the victim, it really rallies the base because he is seeing despite the fact that he's a billionaire, he's a little bit of an underdog taking on the establishment (inaudible) dynasty."

Trashing the media does keep people in your corner but that's about it. Right now they have got to use President Trump's persuasive abilities at the bully pulpit to help try to get his agenda through. I've heard today that the new polling coming in on the American health care is politically toxic for the Republicans. His voice is actually needed to try to explain to people why that bill makes sense, why tax reform makes sense. He also has a great concept for his foreign trip. They've done almost nothing to lay that out. It would have been great at (inaudible) university or the coast guard to do that.

Well, after our report and a little behind-the-scenes pressure, we can tell you the U.S. attorney's office in San Diego on Friday did the right thing and charged him with Illegal reentry, the first time he's been charged with that crime. We were able to talk with the mother of the young boy, he's still in the hospital.
