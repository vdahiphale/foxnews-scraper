You had multiple people pulling the cards and figuring out which candidate would be on what night, so absolutely ridiculous.   But on the substance, what I'm interested in looking at for the debate is how badly diminished Biden and Bernie are by product of who they are on the stage with. Because remember last time, Harris did some -- Kamala Harris did some major damage to Joe Biden. And then, also, if you have Bernie on the stage with Elizabeth Warren, someone who basically has the exact same policy decisions but who's younger and more interesting, and you can see how that could hurt them significantly.",

And you want to know what's gonna happen. He said he wasn't prepared last time. Let's see if he's prepared this time. But he's also going to have Cory Booker on that stage, and if you really look at it, Booker has been far more critical of Biden for saying, not about busting, but for saying that he can cross the partisan line, do business, and prove I did business with segregationist in the past. That open a big door. Guess what? Cory Booker did not benefit when Kamala Harris went up in the poll? So, does he sees this now as his opportunity?

You had multiple people pulling the cards and figuring out which candidate would be on what night, so absolutely ridiculous. But on the substance, what I'm interested in looking at for the debate is how badly diminished Biden and Bernie are by product of who they are on the stage with. Because remember last time, Harris did some -- Kamala Harris did some major damage to Joe Biden. And then, also, if you have Bernie on the stage with Elizabeth Warren, someone who basically has the exact same policy decisions but who's younger and more interesting, and you can see how that could hurt them significantly."

To me it was obvious, you know, that the real news here is, as Lisa was saying, you're going to have Kamala Harris once again up against Joe Biden. So it's gonna be the redo in Detroit, right? And you want to know what's gonna happen. He said he wasn't prepared last time. Let's see if he's prepared this time. But he's also going to have Cory Booker on that stage, and if you really look at it, Booker has been far more critical of Biden for saying, not about busting, but for saying that he can cross the partisan line, do business, and prove I did business with segregationist in the past. That open a big door. Guess what? Cory Booker did not benefit when Kamala Harris went up in the poll? So, does he sees this now as his opportunity?

They're doing it because they're committed to the cause. They're putting it on their resumes, the kind of thing where how do you qualify that compensation that we've seen in a lot of different industries as well.

Because he knows when you raise the wages, to your question, you have to reduce the number of jobs, because the pie doesn't grow. You have -- then you have like -- you know, you have four slices of pie instead of six, so two people go. The purpose of the minimum wage is that it's -- the first rung on the employment ladder. To have a lower minimum wage means you have more first rungs with the intention that you don't stay there and you move on. The problem with the left of Bernie Sanders is they see the first rung as the last rung because you're not economically competent. If you raise those wages, you remove those rungs, and that is bad for the country, it's bad for young kids, minorities, women. People get on that ladder early and faster the better it is for everybody. And you know what? If it's $10 an hour, you're only going to be there for three months, four months."

Just watch this little sucker. That's a honey glider. Watch him fly and then land in - look at that smile on his face. I could just - what I say. Oh, honey glider and sugar glider are the same thing."

We don't know his name, but as you can see, this young man climbed down 15 stories. That's 200 feet down the side of a high rise building in Philadelphia to escape a fire. Firefighters got calls from the trapped residents of the 19-story apartment building. But as they arrived, this young man, so brave had already taken matters into his own hands. Fortunately, no fatalities from the fire, which took an hour to put out. One thing for sure, this young man in the green shirt and blue jeans. My goodness. He deserves a superhero's cape.
