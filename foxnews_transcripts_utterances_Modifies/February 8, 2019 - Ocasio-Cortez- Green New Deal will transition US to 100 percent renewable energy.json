It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is “The Five.” Major breaking news out of scandal plague Virginia, a defiant Ralph Northam just telling top aides he will not resign as governor despite mounting pressure to do so. This comes less than 24 hours after all of the state's Democratic congressman demanded he step aside.  And just moments ago, a second woman has come forward accusing Lieutenant Governor Justin Fairfax of sexual assault. Let's go to Trace Gallagher with the latest developments, putting it all of this together for us. Trace?",

      "sentences": "Hi, Dana. Breaking right now, the second accuser is a woman name Meredith Watson who said this happened back in 2000 while they were both undergraduates at Duke University, and she claims at the time she share the account with several classmates who had apparently provided statements to authorities willing to back up that claim.  Now, her lawyer also says she shared the story with friends in a string of e-mails on Facebook. And if that's the case, they would clearly be a fairly significant social media footprint on this story. The woman calls this -- excuse me -- a premeditated aggressive assault. She's not offering details, but she says the details of her attack are similar to the one described by Vanessa Tyson. Remember that's the first accuser. And that case, Tyson say they were at a DNC convention back in Boston in 2004, and that Fairfax asked Tyson to go to his hotel room to get documents and then began kissing. They say the kissing was consensual, and then, she alleges that he put his hand behind her neck and forcefully pulled her head towards his crotch forcing her to perform oral sex on him. He says, in turn, that relationship, that whole thing was consensual.  The new accuser is now calling for him to resign as lieutenant governor and she now claims that she was upset to learn that he did this again to a second woman, being in 2004, four years after her allegations. Her attorney -- and I want to read you the statement -- just release and saying, and I'm quoting here, \"at this time, Ms. Watson is reluctantly coming forward out of a strong sense of civic duty, and her belief that those seeking or serving in public office should be of the highest character. She has no interest in becoming a media personality or reliving the trauma that has greatly affected her life. Similarly, she is not seeking any financial damages.\"  And you mentioned at the top, this is all, kind of, important because Governor Ralph Northam still maintains that he will not step down over whether or not he was involved in a racist picture in his medical school yearbook back in 1984. Fairfax will be second in line. She wants him to step down as lieutenant governor. We're still waiting to hear from the Fairfax camp about this allegation. Dana?",

Juan, let me ask you about this that it was a week ago that we were here where we -- it was almost like to be sure that Governor Northam was going to resign. He has lost the support of all the Democrats within his own party. They're in Virginia, even in national level, the presidential candidate level. And we all believe that Justin Fairfax, lieutenant governor, could then step into his shoes.

But I think the larger story here has to do with the governor refusing, as you say, to resign at this point, which seems incredible because it's not just a few small people who are thinking, oh, we're going to stick a finger in his eye and make fun of him, and it certainly not Republicans. I'm talking about Tim Kaine and Mark Warner. I'm talking about the entire congressional delegation -- Democratic delegation for the state of Virginia saying this man has to go. In addition to which the poll numbers have plummeted, his moral authority given that awful performance when he went before the press and said, oh, you know, it seems to be that I should apologize, and, oh, no, maybe it's not me in the picture. Oh, I'm going to have an investigation. It's just so duplicitous and not believable.  He has made this all about himself, Dana. And so, to that extent, if it's just him and his wife, the suggestion is that the wife has been encouraged to stay. Then, of course, he can stay for as long as he wants. He could possibly, I guess, be impeached or something like that. I don't know what the mechanism would be. But that's separate.   At this moment, he has made it all about himself. It's a very selfish act damaging not only to the Democratic Party in the state but to the state.",

So, Tim Kaine and Mark Warner get together and they go, listen, let's -- you've got to leave. And he's like, I'm not going to leave. In fact, his buddy, Richard Stewart, who is a Republican, says Northam is not going to leave. He understands he has to stand up and face this, but has to explain a few things. For example, what is the name coon man mean? Who was that who you choose to put in your picture? And as the attorney general, believe it or not, Mark Herring, being that he went right to the Virginia Black Caucus and threw himself and said I'm guilty, I apologize, this is what I was thinking.

Right now, that was stopped because Republicans have a very slight majority in the Virginia House of Delegates. If those dynamics change, that bill may get pass.  That's the same thing that happened in the state of New York when the Republicans lost the majority in the Virginia state -- sorry, New York Senate, and then Democrats are able to move forward with that third trimester abortion bill.

Bezos released an email that he says backs up his blackmail claim.

      "utterance": "Hello, everyone. I'm Dana Perino along with Lisa Boothe, Juan Williams, Brian Kilmeade, and Greg Gutfeld. It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is “The Five.” Major breaking news out of scandal plague Virginia, a defiant Ralph Northam just telling top aides he will not resign as governor despite mounting pressure to do so. This comes less than 24 hours after all of the state's Democratic congressman demanded he step aside. And just moments ago, a second woman has come forward accusing Lieutenant Governor Justin Fairfax of sexual assault. Let's go to Trace Gallagher with the latest developments, putting it all of this together for us. Trace?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TRACE GALLAGHER, CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Hi, Dana. Breaking right now, the second accuser is a woman name Meredith Watson who said this happened back in 2000 while they were both undergraduates at Duke University, and she claims at the time she share the account with several classmates who had apparently provided statements to authorities willing to back up that claim. Now, her lawyer also says she shared the story with friends in a string of e-mails on Facebook. And if that's the case, they would clearly be a fairly significant social media footprint on this story. The woman calls this -- excuse me -- a premeditated aggressive assault. She's not offering details, but she says the details of her attack are similar to the one described by Vanessa Tyson. Remember that's the first accuser. And that case, Tyson say they were at a DNC convention back in Boston in 2004, and that Fairfax asked Tyson to go to his hotel room to get documents and then began kissing. They say the kissing was consensual, and then, she alleges that he put his hand behind her neck and forcefully pulled her head towards his crotch forcing her to perform oral sex on him. He says, in turn, that relationship, that whole thing was consensual. The new accuser is now calling for him to resign as lieutenant governor and she now claims that she was upset to learn that he did this again to a second woman, being in 2004, four years after her allegations. Her attorney -- and I want to read you the statement -- just release and saying, and I'm quoting here, \"at this time, Ms. Watson is reluctantly coming forward out of a strong sense of civic duty, and her belief that those seeking or serving in public office should be of the highest character. She has no interest in becoming a media personality or reliving the trauma that has greatly affected her life. Similarly, she is not seeking any financial damages.\" And you mentioned at the top, this is all, kind of, important because Governor Ralph Northam still maintains that he will not step down over whether or not he was involved in a racist picture in his medical school yearbook back in 1984. Fairfax will be second in line. She wants him to step down as lieutenant governor. We're still waiting to hear from the Fairfax camp about this allegation. Dana?"

      "utterance": "All right, Trace, thank you so much. And so that's an important point that Trace just made. This news literally breaking while we were in the green room before we came out here. So, we haven't heard from the lieutenant governor yet. Juan, let me ask you about this that it was a week ago that we were here where we -- it was almost like to be sure that Governor Northam was going to resign. He has lost the support of all the Democrats within his own party. They're in Virginia, even in national level, the presidential candidate level. And we all believe that Justin Fairfax, lieutenant governor, could then step into his shoes. And now that looks possibly to be in doubt as well because Northam is not resigning and now you have the second accuser."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUAN WILLIAMS, HOST",
      "utterance": "Breaking news right here. You know, as you said as we were coming out the stuff about Justin Fairfax, the second accusation. But I think the larger story here has to do with the governor refusing, as you say, to resign at this point, which seems incredible because it's not just a few small people who are thinking, oh, we're going to stick a finger in his eye and make fun of him, and it certainly not Republicans. I'm talking about Tim Kaine and Mark Warner. I'm talking about the entire congressional delegation -- Democratic delegation for the state of Virginia saying this man has to go. In addition to which the poll numbers have plummeted, his moral authority given that awful performance when he went before the press and said, oh, you know, it seems to be that I should apologize, and, oh, no, maybe it's not me in the picture. Oh, I'm going to have an investigation. It's just so duplicitous and not believable. He has made this all about himself, Dana. And so, to that extent, if it's just him and his wife, the suggestion is that the wife has been encouraged to stay. Then, of course, he can stay for as long as he wants. He could possibly, I guess, be impeached or something like that. I don't know what the mechanism would be. But that's separate. At this moment, he has made it all about himself. It's a very selfish act damaging not only to the Democratic Party in the state but to the state."

      "utterance": "Well, I mean, we had one block who is going to be about 15 minutes, we're going to talk about Virginia. That's how important to us talking about the news cycle, but now it's number one. I guess the feeling is why is Northam in a rush to start his exile? So where am I going to go? I can't go back to the medical field. It's going to be tough to line up that -- to fill up my waiting room. And I can't really go back to politics because I'm done. So he knows -- I finish up the term, there's no grounds to the other way. Virginia law reads to impeach him so I can wait this out. He actually placed a call, I understand, to Fairfax to say, you know, hang in there, buddy. You know, it will get better. That was yesterday. So, Tim Kaine and Mark Warner get together and they go, listen, let's -- you've got to leave. And he's like, I'm not going to leave. In fact, his buddy, Richard Stewart, who is a Republican, says Northam is not going to leave. He understands he has to stand up and face this, but has to explain a few things. For example, what is the name coon man mean? Who was that who you choose to put in your picture? And as the attorney general, believe it or not, Mark Herring, being that he went right to the Virginia Black Caucus and threw himself and said I'm guilty, I apologize, this is what I was thinking. They were thinking we could get Northam to step up, and then let Herring step up because we'll forgive him because it was one thing dressing like a rapper as opposed to a medical page. He was in his 20's, and Herring is just 19."

      "utterance": "I don't think so -- I'm just kidding. No, none of this. Nothing like this. No, no. But to Brian's point, the reason why Northam is not going to step down is he has nowhere to go. In Virginia you serve one term so he's not going to go to run for reelection. Democrat senators, Tim Kaine and Warner aren't going anywhere, so he has nowhere else to run, politically, when he's done serving his term. And then you have the two guys under you that are facing, you know, their own public relations disaster and own scandal."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOOTHE",
      "utterance": "So, why would he step down considering those things? And the reason -- everyone keeps talking about this in the context of 2020 election, but you also have statewide legislative races that are up this November and those are important. And the reason why -- I'll tell you is you look -- even that bill that Virginia Democrat -- delegate trend (ph) introduced regarding third term abortion. Right now, that was stopped because Republicans have a very slight majority in the Virginia House of Delegates. If those dynamics change, that bill may get pass. That's the same thing that happened in the state of New York when the Republicans lost the majority in the Virginia state -- sorry, New York Senate, and then Democrats are able to move forward with that third trimester abortion bill. So this is important stuff. Elections have consequences. And perhaps this ends up to bite Democrats this November."

      "speaker": "PERINO",

      "utterance": "OK. I don't know the details of that story. But I would say that those initial person, the professor from out west, never filed criminal charges and she has no intent to file criminal charges. And I think we're hearing the same thing from the woman who is making the allegations about his behavior at Duke University. The question then becomes -- so there's no criminal record, and you have, of course, varying accounts or memories. And again, we get into this this thing where, you know, forget Republican, Democrat, all that, it's just like, what -- how do you negotiate, navigate these very tricky waters? You don't want to be unfair to Fairfax in the way that we have wanted to be unfair on the Republican side to Kavanaugh."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOOTHE",
      "utterance": "But do you think there's a difference in a sense where Justin Fairfax has, at least, said that they were at the same place at the same time and something went down between the two of them? Now, he says, obviously, it's consensual. Vanessa Tyson said that it was not. But it's very different than the Kavanaugh situations where -- the sense that he is admitting that something happen with this woman. They were at the same convention in 2004, and so there's at least something that happened. One is saying consensual, the other is not. Whereas with Kavanaugh, he said this never happened. I don't even remember what this woman is talking about."
    },

      "speaker": "GUTFELD",

They -- you know, you have a game on Sunday, and then accusation comes out on Thursday, and they say, hey guys, you've got to act because this just happened. How could you let them play? Well, let the process play out when there's no video and there's an accuser in a situation like this. Well, how can you let it play? Well, you don't know if he is guilty right now. How could you close circumstantial it seems obvious he is guilty. No, we have to wait. That's what the problem with sports all the time."

Claims of extortion, blackmail coming from the world's richest man, Jeff Bezos the CEO of Amazon and the owner of the Washington Post, says the publisher of the National Enquirer threatened to release explicit pictures of him that Bezos had apparently sent to his mistress. Bezos said the tabloid offered to hold off publishing the pictures if he stop investigating how the Enquirer obtain text messages that he exchanged with his lover. Bezos released an email that he says backs up his blackmail claim. One part reads, and here I'm quoting, in the interest of expediting this situation, and with the Washington Post poised to publish unsubstantiated rumors of the National Enquirer's initial report, I wanted to describe to you the photos obtain during our newsgathering, end quote. The email then goes on to describe the salacious photos and ends with this, this line, it would give us -- it would give no editor pleasure to send this email. I hope common sense can prevail and quickly, end quote. The National Enquirer's parent company said it acted lawfully and will investigate the claims.

And when it gets to the general election, yes probably, but this to me was not about environmentalism, it's about progressivism because you add in all the other things, health care, education, et cetera. And it's not, the taxes aren't the problem, physics are the problem, because if you could figure out a way to not have fossil fuels, we would have done that by now. The physics just aren't there yet.

This is a fantasy that requires an army, because you're going to have to enforce this on people. I think the plan will work by the way, all you need is the Iron Man suit of armor, the Star Trek transporter, and the invisible cloak from Harry Potter, and I think this could work. But this is what you said, it's not about the climate, it's about a power grab, and it's about taking it away from the individual. You can't drive, you can't fly, but guess who still has the power, that's people in charge. They'll still fly, they'll still drive because they're more important than the public, so they'll take it from everybody.
