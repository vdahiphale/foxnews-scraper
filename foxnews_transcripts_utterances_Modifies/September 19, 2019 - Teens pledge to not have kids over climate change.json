      "sentences": "Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson tonight. So the Canadian Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, got caught wearing blackface and a lot of people are pretending to be very, very surprised. But were you really surprised? In fact, you probably could have guessed it actually. It's a little like finding out that your super sensitive brother-in-law, the one who tells you he is a feminist, the one who is always scolding you for your sexism is in fact hitting on the babysitter. Of course, he is hitting on the babysitter.  The virtue is always a cover for the sin. That's the key to understanding the modern left, whatever they're accusing you of doing, they are doing themselves but more enthusiastically, and that's definitely the story of Justin Trudeau.  Like your brother-in-law with the ponytail, Trudeau brags about being a feminist. You use the wrong word in his presence, and he'll launch into a self-righteous lecture.  Justin Trudeau maybe the most sanctimonious head of state on planet Earth. So of course, he was leading a secret life as a racist. That's why he's so sanctimonious, so you won't notice. It turns out there now at least three separate instances of Justin Trudeau wearing blackface. And as he conceded today, there could absolutely be more.",

Therefore -- and this is the key -- therefore, I need to keep telling you how to live your life. It's not a confession. It's a justification.

The more sanctimonious you are, the more you're hiding. You want to know who is up to no good? Look at the people who are tugging their chin and, oh, I would never do that. And yet suddenly Don Lemon went from that -- I wonder how much diversity she has on her staff -- to, oh, I'm so glad that Justin said sorry.   Did Don Lemon have a change of heart? Is he now a forgiving man? Or could it be that because Justin Trudeau is a powerful leader on the left, he gets a pass no matter what he does? I think you know the answer because, of course, you've seen it before. Earlier this year, the governor of Virginia Ralph Northam was caught wearing blackface, actually it was a Klan hood. He still won't tell us which it was. But whatever it was, he was wearing -- blackface or a Klan hood, Northam, a liberal Democrat decided he didn't need to resign over it.  The left pretended to care for a few minutes, oh, we're so upset, and then they forgot the whole thing ever happened. Northam himself said that the incident showed and I'm quoting, \"deep wounds in Virginia.\" What he did showed deep wounds in the whole Commonwealth of Virginia.  In other words, Northam himself wasn't guilty of anything, blackface or a Klan hood. It was the people of Virginia who are responsible. They had the collective guilt and that guilt can only be expiated by giving Ralph Northam more power. Because that's what it's always about -- always. It's about power. When you make a mistake, it means you're a sinner and you must be damned. You probably don't have enough diversity in your offices, says Don Lemon. But when they screw up, it's society's fault, meaning it's your fault. So they've got you coming and going. It's pretty nice, actually. It's a good trick. Being woke means never having to say you're sorry. Dave Rubin hosts \"The Rubin Report\" on YouTube, and is one of the -- probably the world's reigning experts on sanctimony and a great opponent of sanctimony to his great credit, and he joins us tonight.

I was a Rastafarian when I was in like sixth grade, I didn't do it in blackface, but I did have dreadlocks, which that's cultural appropriation, right? I was a Jedi multiple times. I'm not really a Jedi in real life, as far as I know, although I would like to be. But look, the point here is that these are the rules they have set. And we know -- we know without question, that if this was someone on the right, they would be going for blood. The knives would be out and they'd be trying to take them down.  I thought there was a really brilliant comment by Maxime Bernier who is running against Justin Trudeau actually in the Canadian elections. He is from the People's Party of Canada.

For instance, you get the thing where there are there are gay people who are conservative and therefore denounced by the gay press is no longer gay. I, by the way, had that again this week in America. Then you get women who have the wrong politics, i.e. conservative and they've said to no longer be feminists. You have, you have black Americans who have conservative politics and they are denounced as no longer black, and this keeps happening. And at those points you see, that's just naked politicking. You are using identity groups to batter down a political point, and that's undoubtedly the case of a lot of people. There are other things going on here, too. One of them, I show in the book, is just a continuation of an old Marxist idea. You know, there were from the 70s and 80s onwards, a group of people, Marxists and post-Marxists for whom the working class have let them down.

      "sentences": "Over the past couple of weeks, there's been an acrimonious debate over the President's Afghanistan policy. President Trump has decided that after 18 years, 2,400 deaths and a trillion U.S. dollar spent -- enough is enough. He wants to end the war and bring American troops back to the United States. But the permanent war lobby in Washington is outraged by this idea. Trump's plan caused his final break with National Security adviser, John Bolton who basically stormed out over it. Some think Trump is a traitor for trying to negotiate with the Taliban. Others say, a withdrawal would betray Afghan women. They insist on staying until Afghanistan is modern and peaceful like Belgium, when it's currently a medieval society that has known only endemic warfare for its entire history. Harry Flashman could have told you that. None of these debates about Afghanistan policy are taking place in reality. They are imagining facts that don't exist in a war effort that isn't actually being waged, and the experts know it very well. Early this month, the Center for Strategic International Studies -- that's a top think tank here in Washington -- published a draft report that lays out the truth about what is happening in Afghanistan and has been for 18 years. America has likely already lost the war there. But our military leaders are hiding the truth of that. The Afghan central government is quote, \"corrupt, ineffective, weak and deeply divided.\" Despite billions spent on training and equipment, the Afghan National Army is essentially useless. It remains completely dependent on American forces to do anything. Think about that for a minute, after all these years. It's disgusting. Despite immense economic aid, the economy of Afghanistan is in shambles and it's not getting better. In fact, if we say despite aid, maybe because of aid, because that's the nature of aid. It keeps people dependent and inefficient. It never works. Instead of telling the truth about any of this, though, our leaders bury the truth. All the details, all the facts. In 2018, official estimate show that the Afghan government was losing control of the country, while the Taliban was gaining territory that's bad. So the U.S. government simply stopped providing official estimates. You don't like the statistics, stop collecting them. So that's the truth about the war in Afghanistan. We aren't winning. Don't listen to what Max Boot says, buffoons like Bill Kristol, and John Bolton. The only way we could win this war is by sending tens or hundreds of thousands of additional troops over there, spending hundreds of billions of dollars and in all likelihood killing hundreds of thousands Afghans. Would it be worth it? In effect, we would have to restart the war there from scratch and nobody is willing to do that, despite the posturing. But instead of accepting that reality, and that is the reality. In ending the war, Washington continues to pretend that we're trying to win when everyone knows we're not. Every year thousands of American soldiers continue to be torn away from their loved ones for months on end at great cost to them and their families fighting a war that our leaders aren't willing to win and are too prideful to end. Seventeen American troops have died in Afghanistan just this year. Why? If we stay in war, we will continue to die and every single one of them will be an American life wasted, thrown away again, for the vanity of morons like John Bolton, Max Boot and Bill Kristol. That's not a good reason to stay. That's it for us tonight. A whole hour has slipped through our fingers. We hope you'll join us tomorrow night and every weeknight at 8:00 p.m. The show that is the sworn and totally sincere enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and groupthink.

So the Canadian Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, got caught wearing blackface and a lot of people are pretending to be very, very surprised. But were you really surprised? In fact, you probably could have guessed it actually. It's a little like finding out that your super sensitive brother-in-law, the one who tells you he is a feminist, the one who is always scolding you for your sexism is in fact hitting on the babysitter. Of course, he is hitting on the babysitter. The virtue is always a cover for the sin. That's the key to understanding the modern left, whatever they're accusing you of doing, they are doing themselves but more enthusiastically, and that's definitely the story of Justin Trudeau. Like your brother-in-law with the ponytail, Trudeau brags about being a feminist. You use the wrong word in his presence, and he'll launch into a self-righteous lecture. Justin Trudeau maybe the most sanctimonious head of state on planet Earth. So of course, he was leading a secret life as a racist. That's why he's so sanctimonious, so you won't notice. It turns out there now at least three separate instances of Justin Trudeau wearing blackface. And as he conceded today, there could absolutely be more."

Try not to be judgy here or anything, but even adjusting for youthful indiscretion -- three times on camera. That's a lot. It's an awful lot, actually. What's going on with Justin Trudeau? Well, it turns out -- and he explained this today -- that Justin Trudeau suffers from an especially virulent case of something called privilege."

If you're not listening carefully, it might sound like Justin Trudeau just took responsibility for what he did. Oh, but no, just the opposite. He transferred it. When Trudeau blames privilege, he is moving responsibility for what he did from himself to the rest of us. In other words, I did something awful because society itself is rotten. Therefore -- and this is the key -- therefore, I need to keep telling you how to live your life. It's not a confession. It's a justification. And the only people dumb enough to buy it, or the news media, of course, the dumbest people in the world. Over at CNN, for example, Don Lemon was deeply impressed."

Now, he knows better. What do you think of that? But I do have to say this before we go, think about it. However you want to think about it. When someone apologizes, wow. We don't often see that here, especially a world leader who is saying I should have known better, and I'm sorry. You can feel about it however you want. But that to me, that does mean a lot. I've got to go Thank you."

If you can remember back all the way back to when Megyn Kelly of NBC found herself under attack in pretty much the same way. The difference was that Megyn Kelly never wore blackface. She wouldn't do that. She is not Justin Trudeau. She has made the mistake of not seeming quite offended enough in a TV segment by certain Halloween costumes. For that crime, Don Lemon told us she must be destroyed."

      "utterance": "I'm just going to be honest. Megyn is 47 years old. She is our age. There has never been a time in that -- in her 47 years that blackface has been acceptable. I wonder how much diversity she has on her staff. I don't know I'm not there. But I would imagine there's not a lot because people would have informed her. This is what people of the larger culture don't understand about racism and about privilege."

    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Keep in mind, and this is universally true. It was true of Jimmy Swaggart. It is true of Justin Trudeau, and probably true with Don Lemon. The more sanctimonious you are, the more you're hiding. You want to know who is up to no good? Look at the people who are tugging their chin and, oh, I would never do that. And yet suddenly Don Lemon went from that -- I wonder how much diversity she has on her staff -- to, oh, I'm so glad that Justin said sorry. Did Don Lemon have a change of heart? Is he now a forgiving man? Or could it be that because Justin Trudeau is a powerful leader on the left, he gets a pass no matter what he does? I think you know the answer because, of course, you've seen it before. Earlier this year, the governor of Virginia Ralph Northam was caught wearing blackface, actually it was a Klan hood. He still won't tell us which it was. But whatever it was, he was wearing -- blackface or a Klan hood, Northam, a liberal Democrat decided he didn't need to resign over it. The left pretended to care for a few minutes, oh, we're so upset, and then they forgot the whole thing ever happened. Northam himself said that the incident showed and I'm quoting, \"deep wounds in Virginia.\" What he did showed deep wounds in the whole Commonwealth of Virginia. In other words, Northam himself wasn't guilty of anything, blackface or a Klan hood. It was the people of Virginia who are responsible. They had the collective guilt and that guilt can only be expiated by giving Ralph Northam more power. Because that's what it's always about -- always. It's about power. When you make a mistake, it means you're a sinner and you must be damned. You probably don't have enough diversity in your offices, says Don Lemon. But when they screw up, it's society's fault, meaning it's your fault. So they've got you coming and going. It's pretty nice, actually. It's a good trick. Being woke means never having to say you're sorry. Dave Rubin hosts \"The Rubin Report\" on YouTube, and is one of the -- probably the world's reigning experts on sanctimony and a great opponent of sanctimony to his great credit, and he joins us tonight. So, Dave, what's the lesson here of Justin Trudeau?"

And it's so interesting, because yes, his comment where he then tries to link his mistakes in the past. Now, we've all worn costumes that -- you know, Halloween is coming. I was a Rastafarian when I was in like sixth grade, I didn't do it in blackface, but I did have dreadlocks, which that's cultural appropriation, right? I was a Jedi multiple times. I'm not really a Jedi in real life, as far as I know, although I would like to be. But look, the point here is that these are the rules they have set. And we know -- we know without question, that if this was someone on the right, they would be going for blood. The knives would be out and they'd be trying to take them down. I thought there was a really brilliant comment by Maxime Bernier who is running against Justin Trudeau actually in the Canadian elections. He is from the People's Party of Canada. He said, I'm not going to call Justin Trudeau racist, but I will call him the biggest hypocrite in the country."

Which is kind of what we want because we've all lived lives. We've all made mistakes. We all know that we're only people of our time. Or do we finally say, no, these are the rules that you set, and you guys have to get out of the way. Why is Ralph Northam still Governor of Virginia?

It's not his privileged background. He is a hypocrite. He is fake. And he's like a lot of worldwide liberals donating money to all -- taxpayer's money to all their causes.

      "speaker": "MURRAY",
      "utterance": "Well, there are several reasons. There are different groups of people who are responsible. There is one group who are just pushing this because this is naked politics and this -- I take each of these issues in \"The Madness of Crowds\" one by one. I do gay, women, race and trends; and in each of these ones, you see the naked root politics at some point. For instance, you get the thing where there are there are gay people who are conservative and therefore denounced by the gay press is no longer gay. I, by the way, had that again this week in America. Then you get women who have the wrong politics, i.e. conservative and they've said to no longer be feminists. You have, you have black Americans who have conservative politics and they are denounced as no longer black, and this keeps happening. And at those points you see, that's just naked politicking. You are using identity groups to batter down a political point, and that's undoubtedly the case of a lot of people. There are other things going on here, too. One of them, I show in the book, is just a continuation of an old Marxist idea. You know, there were from the 70s and 80s onwards, a group of people, Marxists and post-Marxists for whom the working class have let them down. You know, the working class never did come up with a revolution in America that they wanted."

They wanted these people to all be brought together to further and actually, this time bring about the revolution that the working class approved such a loser for them on. And so several things, but those two, I think are the most pernicious and the problem I have with this, I'll just say is that a lot of young people now are growing up in America, are being lied to that this is actually about virtue, that this is actually how they should be their lives, that they should spend their lives pursuing this zero sum game, this appalling zero sum game."

And while two of the gang members stood watch, the third allegedly executed the boy. Several shots point blank from a .40 caliber handgun and as gruesome and heart rending as the crime sounds, investigators say the original plan was to kidnap the boy, torture him by cutting off his fingers and ears and then kill him. And why was he shot? Because his father is in a rival gang that the suspects believe was responsible for killing one of their family members. Corey Morgan who is accused of standing watch while the boy was shot and Dwight Doty accused of pulling the trigger are being tried together and their defense attorneys are trying to pit them against each other.

Do you think these criminals will be registering their guns? Do you think these criminals will be giving up their guns? By the way, even over Labor Day weekend in Chicago, there were seven killed, 34 wounded. We hear these stories over and over and over again, and we don't see them covered enough, because they do not fit a mainstream media narrative. These people are working very hard to try to get another Democrat -- so they are trying to get a Democrat in the White House in 2020.

Like your guest said before, he said that the left tells African-Americans when they leave the Democratic Party, that they're not black anymore. They told gays when they leave the Democratic Party, that they're not gay anymore, et cetera. But when you go and you tell black people that these policies have been hurting us for decades and decades and decades, and they tell you that you know, you can't be a Republican. Look, let me tell you something. Candace Owens, Larry Elder, they say it all the time, the number one problem in the African-American community is fatherlessness. Now, I will probably tell you for sure that these young men that were in this gang that murdered that child, these people that are continuing to perpetrate this violence on the streets are men without direction. They are men that don't have jobs. They are men that did not have fathers in the home."

Maryland, for example, already has an assault weapons ban, but Baltimore still exists. So what does that tell you? Bernard Whitman is a former pollster for Bill Clinton. He joins us tonight. Bernard, thanks a lot for coming on. So this is an often asked question, but it's never really answered.

In New York City and New York State, 74 percent of the guns seized are coming from states with weak gun laws. In New York City alone, nine out of 10 guns that are purchased and used quickly come from states with lax gun control laws.

We lifted a billion people out of poverty because in fact, people are the solution, right? More people, a smarter society, we come up with ways to solve these problems.

      "utterance": "Over the past couple of weeks, there's been an acrimonious debate over the President's Afghanistan policy. President Trump has decided that after 18 years, 2,400 deaths and a trillion U.S. dollar spent -- enough is enough. He wants to end the war and bring American troops back to the United States. But the permanent war lobby in Washington is outraged by this idea. Trump's plan caused his final break with National Security adviser, John Bolton who basically stormed out over it. Some think Trump is a traitor for trying to negotiate with the Taliban. Others say, a withdrawal would betray Afghan women. They insist on staying until Afghanistan is modern and peaceful like Belgium, when it's currently a medieval society that has known only endemic warfare for its entire history. Harry Flashman could have told you that. None of these debates about Afghanistan policy are taking place in reality. They are imagining facts that don't exist in a war effort that isn't actually being waged, and the experts know it very well. Early this month, the Center for Strategic International Studies -- that's a top think tank here in Washington -- published a draft report that lays out the truth about what is happening in Afghanistan and has been for 18 years. America has likely already lost the war there. But our military leaders are hiding the truth of that. The Afghan central government is quote, \"corrupt, ineffective, weak and deeply divided.\" Despite billions spent on training and equipment, the Afghan National Army is essentially useless. It remains completely dependent on American forces to do anything. Think about that for a minute, after all these years. It's disgusting. Despite immense economic aid, the economy of Afghanistan is in shambles and it's not getting better. In fact, if we say despite aid, maybe because of aid, because that's the nature of aid. It keeps people dependent and inefficient. It never works. Instead of telling the truth about any of this, though, our leaders bury the truth. All the details, all the facts. In 2018, official estimate show that the Afghan government was losing control of the country, while the Taliban was gaining territory that's bad. So the U.S. government simply stopped providing official estimates. You don't like the statistics, stop collecting them. So that's the truth about the war in Afghanistan. We aren't winning. Don't listen to what Max Boot says, buffoons like Bill Kristol, and John Bolton. The only way we could win this war is by sending tens or hundreds of thousands of additional troops over there, spending hundreds of billions of dollars and in all likelihood killing hundreds of thousands Afghans. Would it be worth it? In effect, we would have to restart the war there from scratch and nobody is willing to do that, despite the posturing. But instead of accepting that reality, and that is the reality. In ending the war, Washington continues to pretend that we're trying to win when everyone knows we're not. Every year thousands of American soldiers continue to be torn away from their loved ones for months on end at great cost to them and their families fighting a war that our leaders aren't willing to win and are too prideful to end. Seventeen American troops have died in Afghanistan just this year. Why? If we stay in war, we will continue to die and every single one of them will be an American life wasted, thrown away again, for the vanity of morons like John Bolton, Max Boot and Bill Kristol. That's not a good reason to stay. That's it for us tonight. A whole hour has slipped through our fingers. We hope you'll join us tomorrow night and every weeknight at 8:00 p.m. The show that is the sworn and totally sincere enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and groupthink. Don't forget to DVR it if you can figure out how that works. You just saw Sean Hannity on the screen. We're going to bring him back. He's hosting the 9:00 pm hour tonight.
