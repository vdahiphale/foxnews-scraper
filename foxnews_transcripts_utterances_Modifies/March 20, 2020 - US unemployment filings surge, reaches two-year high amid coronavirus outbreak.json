      "sentences": "Good evening, I'm Bret Baier. \"BREAKING TONIGHT\", the governors of the three of the country's most populous states, California, New York and Illinois, are ordering workers in non-essential businesses to stay home because of the coronavirus pandemic. President Trump is still downplaying the prospect of a national lockdown. Saying, he does not think he will ever be necessary. Members of Congress and the administration are working on a massive economic stimulus package right now.  As more Americans take tests for the coronavirus, the infection rate is skyrocketing as predicted to more than 14,000 cases. So far, 210 deaths in the U.S.  Vice President Pence, says about 90 percent of Americans who have taken the test, so far, did not have the virus.  While the president is strongly, and at times, compatibly pushing alternative therapies to fight the COVID-19 virus, he is receiving some pushback from one of his top advisors. Dr. Anthony Fauci is cautioning reports of success are anecdotal and data needs to be collected. The U.S. is closing its borders with Mexico and Canada to non-essential travel because of the coronavirus. The president's response coordinator, says young people under 20 are being seriously affected but all have recovered.  Dr. Deborah Birx, emphasizing today that no one is immune, as she did last night on SPECIAL REPORT. The administration is pushing back the tax deadline from April 15th to July 15th. It is also waiving interest on federal student loans. At least 32 states have activated or plan to activate National Guard forces. And that's what we begin.  Chief White House correspondent John Roberts, begins our coverage live on the North Lawn tonight. Good evening, John.",

Fox Eight in Cleveland as thousands of people lose power after severe thunderstorms roar through Ohio, causing flooding and knocking down trees across that state. The storms that struck late last night and early today contained two heavy rains and strong gusty winds. The flooding led to travel issues in some areas, but no major problems were reported. Fox Two in Detroit, where a 65-year-old man was killed and two other people injured following a house explosion that may have been sparked by a gas leak and a lit crack cocaine pipe, according to authorities.  The deputy fire commissioner, tells the Detroit News, a 46-year-old woman, claimed she was lighting the crack pipe when the explosion happened. The woman suffered burns and was in critical condition at a hospital. Fox 29 in Philadelphia, where a funeral procession was held to honor Police Sergeant James O'Connor, who was killed in the line of duty last Friday. In his honor, city landmarks are lighting up in blue. Lincoln financial field was first to take action by lighting up Thursday night. A law enforcement support group is asking that all landmarks participate after learning O'Connor's funeral will be postponed amid the ongoing COVID-19 crisis. And this is a live look at St. Louis from our affiliate Fox Two there. The big story, Colonel Mary Barton is named the country's first female police chief. She has been with the department since 1978. Barton replaces Chief Jon Belmar, who retires April 30th, after leading the force for six years.

And so we need -- this package that the Senate is putting together is very important, but what it really needs to do, and it's not enough of it, is grants to small and medium sized businesses to cover their lost revenue if they don't lay off workers, because these businesses can never make up that revenue. If you are a factory, you are going to fill back orders. If you are a restaurant or a store or a hotel, you are not going to be able to do that. We need to make sure that these businesses survive by covering their revenues during this period so that they are there to lead the recovery.",

I want to underscore some of the things that Marc and Kim have already said about the economy, and emphasize that one of the possible meanings, significance of the downturn on Wall Street today is a lack of confidence in the solutions that are coming out of Capitol Hill. There is a kind of cumbersome nature to this big package, which has a lot of rules attached to it. It addresses in terms of sectors, airlines here, hotels there. What business needs right now, Bret, I believe, is liquidity. They need a loan. They need some kind of financing to get them from here to the summer still alive. And the best way to make that happen is not by a small business program where you have to sign up and prove that you have only 500 or fewer employees. It's going to be through massive liquidity backed by the Federal Reserve with the reserve fund approved by the Congress, and I really hope that kind of thinking starts to take hold soon.",

President Trump is still downplaying the prospect of a national lockdown. Saying, he does not think he will ever be necessary. Members of Congress and the administration are working on a massive economic stimulus package right now. As more Americans take tests for the coronavirus, the infection rate is skyrocketing as predicted to more than 14,000 cases. So far, 210 deaths in the U.S. Vice President Pence, says about 90 percent of Americans who have taken the test, so far, did not have the virus. While the president is strongly, and at times, compatibly pushing alternative therapies to fight the COVID-19 virus, he is receiving some pushback from one of his top advisors. Dr. Anthony Fauci is cautioning reports of success are anecdotal and data needs to be collected. The U.S. is closing its borders with Mexico and Canada to non-essential travel because of the coronavirus. The president's response coordinator, says young people under 20 are being seriously affected but all have recovered. Dr. Deborah Birx, emphasizing today that no one is immune, as she did last night on SPECIAL REPORT. The administration is pushing back the tax deadline from April 15th to July 15th. It is also waiving interest on federal student loans. At least 32 states have activated or plan to activate National Guard forces. And that's what we begin.

Morgan giving a sweetener to its branch and call center workers, while Walmart is handing out extra cash to hourly staff. Money that will be needed to weather the steep economic downturn.

First, here is what some of our Fox affiliates around the country are covering tonight. Fox Eight in Cleveland as thousands of people lose power after severe thunderstorms roar through Ohio, causing flooding and knocking down trees across that state. The storms that struck late last night and early today contained two heavy rains and strong gusty winds. The flooding led to travel issues in some areas, but no major problems were reported. Fox Two in Detroit, where a 65-year-old man was killed and two other people injured following a house explosion that may have been sparked by a gas leak and a lit crack cocaine pipe, according to authorities. The deputy fire commissioner, tells the Detroit News, a 46-year-old woman, claimed she was lighting the crack pipe when the explosion happened. The woman suffered burns and was in critical condition at a hospital. Fox 29 in Philadelphia, where a funeral procession was held to honor Police Sergeant James O'Connor, who was killed in the line of duty last Friday. In his honor, city landmarks are lighting up in blue. Lincoln financial field was first to take action by lighting up Thursday night. A law enforcement support group is asking that all landmarks participate after learning O'Connor's funeral will be postponed amid the ongoing COVID-19 crisis. And this is a live look at St. Louis from our affiliate Fox Two there. The big story, Colonel Mary Barton is named the country's first female police chief. She has been with the department since 1978. Barton replaces Chief Jon Belmar, who retires April 30th, after leading the force for six years. That's tonight's live look \"OUTSIDE THE BELTWAY\" from SPECIAL REPORT. We'll be right back."

We obviously have seen police chiefs -- female police chiefs around the country and especially in Washington, DC. Joining us tonight, our doctor experts, Dr. Marty Makary, Johns Hopkins health policy expert and Dr. Manny Alvarez, Fox News's senior managing editor for Health News. Thank you, gentlemen, for being here. We've been doing this all week. But there's a lot of great questions out there. Let's toss my first one, and this is about school."

Now, the president and the CDC has told you that they're going to give an announcement as to the curve by day 14. So, by day 14, you're going to have 10 or 12 or 14 days of data in a, so far, as the number and the rates of cases in different communities around the country. At that point in time, you're going to have a better idea, whether it's going to be a four-week, five-week, six-week, type of period, but I would wait until that data before. But it's not going to be for the next -- for the next two or three weeks, the kids are going to be home. So, let's start the lessons at home."

      "utterance": "Hi, Bret. My question is very simple. There was something going around in October, November, December, where people were having a cough, sore throat for 10, 14, 15, 20, some days. We weren't testing for this back then. Can they absolutely say that COVID-19 was not here during those times?"

      "utterance": "Well, common things being common, Bret. We know that the influenza virus was out there in the fall and that's typically when it's going around. We know most global pandemics with a novel virus strain lasted about three months, and we know that the first incident was probably in late November back in the Wuhan province of China. So, I think what we're going to learn from this are probably some best hygiene practices that we're going to carry on for years to come with the future flu epidemics."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "OK, this one is from Twitter. This is Sandy about blood donations. \"If one donates blood, and he is a coronavirus carrier, unknowingly, does the donated blood get tested? And if so, will the donor be told?\" Doctor Manny, you know the answer to that one?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ALVAREZ",
      "utterance": "Well, I don't think we're testing for coronavirus in blood donations right now. I think that there's a question and answer format that will include some of the coronavirus risk factors if have you had a fever? Which is typically when you donate blood, whether there's any risk factor. So, you know, I think from that perspective, it is safe to receive blood, and I think it is safe to donate blood. This is one of the factors right now that the Red Cross is saying, do not be afraid to donate, do not be afraid to receive, because I think that mechanism of this type of virus is not going to be a factor in you donating or receiving blood."

    {
      "speaker": "MAKARY",
      "utterance": "Well, that's a good point. We need to distinguish not all medical conditions put somebody at higher risk. It's particularly those where your immune system is weakened, and it's also those were the lungs and the respiratory system may not have a -- may not have the same strength and health to expand big. That's why people with severe disabilities may not have a great lung capacity and be at increased risk. That's why older people may not have -- may, are at higher risk because their immune systems are weaker than younger people. And encouraging study just this week, American Academy of Pediatrics found that only one child has been -- has died from this in any documented form. And that's out of 2,100. So, this virus for some reason spares kids in its case fatality rate."
    },

      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "But there are kids that are getting it and Dr. Birx has said that they're not immune, to your point, but they -- they're in low, low numbers. But the question about immunity, Doc, and Dr. Manny, take this. This is about stress. And this is Juliet, final one."

I'm an extrovert and I find it a happy thing to be out and about. So, I'm wondering, if your doctor can tell us how extroverts can deal with this situation?"
    },
    {

      "utterance": "Dr. Manny, a little bit of mental health in there too."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ALVAREZ",
      "utterance": "Well, listen, mental health is very important. You know, I -- look, if you listen to the governor of New York, he basically said, Look, we don't expect people to stay in their homes for five or six months at a time, never come out. If you do, what I call, responsible social distancing, you can go off for a walk. You know, find a path that you can walk by yourself, get a little sunshine. You know, you could go into the balcony, you can go into your backyard. You can do some gardening if you have something like that. So, you can sort of, you know, have a social aspect of social distancing, that you can be saved, but also you can enjoy the outdoors. Now, I think that that's going to be part of the overall solution to deal with some of the stress and some of the fears that people have, which is very important. And it's going to take a toll because, indeed, excessive stress can lead to, you know, your body not feeling right and your immune system being compromised."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "And Dr. Makary, are you do the things like take vitamin C, you take supplements and do what else do you build up the immunity?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MAKARY",
      "utterance": "Yes, we know that when you're well-nourished, when you're eating well, your immune system is strongest. Look at kids that are studying for exams and pull all-nighters and don't eat well. They break out with acne. Why? Because their immune system is down. And so, good sleep and good nutrition is the best thing you can do for your immune system."

      "utterance": "All right, doctors, thank you very much as always, we'll continue it next week. Up next, how to response to the virus is throwing Americans out of work in alarming numbers. And what that means big picture? First, \"BEYOND OUR BORDERS\" tonight, Afghans -- Afghanistan's military, says, at least 17 police and army personnel were killed today in an apparent insider attack at a joint military and police base. The Defense Ministry statement, says the Taliban carried out the attack with the assistance of Afghan police and army personnel inside that base. 11 soldiers, six police killed. A Dutch court has convicted a radicalized Muslim man of murder with a terrorist motive and sentenced him to life in prison for opening fire on a tram, killing four people last year. The defendant walked onto that tram, used a pistol to shoot passengers at a close range, then jumped out of the tram and shot a driver sitting behind the wheel of a car. An Olympic torch event in Japan, drew hundreds of spectators as the flame arrived today. The Greek part of the torch relay began last week, but a day later, the remainder was canceled to avoid attracting crowds. Olympic officials insist the games will go on this summer despite pressure to cancel or postponed, including from the U.S. swim team because of the coronavirus. Just some of the other stories \"BEYOND OUR BORDERS\" tonight. We'll be right back."

But at a certain point you also have to have somebody thinking about the economy and that overall balance. And I think people are beginning to look at this and say, you know those 14 days, maybe we need to start getting ready for what comes after it. Maybe more aggressive use of drugs.

      "utterance": "It is taking a long time, and we don't know how long this is going to last. And we may not be able to end the social distancing in 14 days. It may take longer. And that's why the economic package that Congress is considering is so important. What we are trying to do, Bret, is we are trying to create a V-shaped recession. And by the way, we are creating a recession. It is a government mandated recession. We are telling businesses to stop functioning, we're telling workers to stay home. We want that to be rapid and fast in the decline so that we can get ahead of the -- flatten the curve of the virus. But then we want to have a V-shaped recovery. We want to have a very rapid recovery going up. And so the only way to do that is to make sure that the businesses that are caught in the middle survive between the V. And so we need -- this package that the Senate is putting together is very important, but what it really needs to do, and it's not enough of it, is grants to small and medium sized businesses to cover their lost revenue if they don't lay off workers, because these businesses can never make up that revenue. If you are a factory, you are going to fill back orders. If you are a restaurant or a store or a hotel, you are not going to be able to do that. We need to make sure that these businesses survive by covering their revenues during this period so that they are there to lead the recovery."

And it's unfortunate that he would engage in that kind of speculation. On the other hand, it's a little bit understandable because I think everybody in this country is clutching at straws right now. I want to underscore some of the things that Marc and Kim have already said about the economy, and emphasize that one of the possible meanings, significance of the downturn on Wall Street today is a lack of confidence in the solutions that are coming out of Capitol Hill. There is a kind of cumbersome nature to this big package, which has a lot of rules attached to it. It addresses in terms of sectors, airlines here, hotels there. What business needs right now, Bret, I believe, is liquidity. They need a loan. They need some kind of financing to get them from here to the summer still alive. And the best way to make that happen is not by a small business program where you have to sign up and prove that you have only 500 or fewer employees. It's going to be through massive liquidity backed by the Federal Reserve with the reserve fund approved by the Congress, and I really hope that kind of thinking starts to take hold soon."

So I think with what everybody really needs to do is focus on solving this problem and getting us through this crisis. If we have a V-shaped recession and a V-shaped recover where we can contain the economic damage to spring in a bipartisan way, then voters are going to reward the people who did that. If this goes on and people see mismanagement, then they are not. Trump right now, his approval, an Axios Harris poll just came out, 56 percent approval of his handling of the COVID crisis, 44 percent disapproval. It's up five points from the last few days. He needs to remain presidential and focus on that and he'll be OK."

And you also see him over the past week really seeming to embrace this new position as sort of wartime commander, as it were, in the middle of a crisis. I think that that probably helps him in the near term, but I actually believe sort of what Marc was saying, that the measure of this is going to be what comes next. How does this sort of hit an end game? And that's going to be as big of measure of White House performance as anything that's happening now."
