And I know surveys like this are like shooting really stupid fish in a tiny, tiny barrel. Colleges where good grades don't matter, as long as you get a hammer and sickle tattoo on your butt. Still there. But hey, they're just dumb kids, right?  We can forgive them. But what happens when patriotism is now considered offensive by our very own leaders? This weekend, idiots from Maxine Waters to Cori Bush slam 4th of July is nothing more than a celebration of racism. I could read you their tweets. But why? Here's this just from Bush. \"The freedom they are referring to is for white people. Which raises a point. Perhaps our politicians do such an awful job because they hate America.\" Do you ever think about that and they're in competence is their weapon?   Think about how easy it is to subvert a Republic, get elected, then rot it from within. And if anyone challenges you, well, that's racist. Meanwhile, National Geographic mark the 4th by tweeting that smoke from fireworks causes disproportionate harm to communities of color. So I hope you enjoyed that roman candle, you racist. But of course National Geographic's virtue signal comes after decades of exploiting communities of color all over the world.  Oh, look at topless women in their natural habitat. Remember that? When I was a young man, I just assumed every naked woman carried a basket of food on their head. And then there's the new Facebook feature that warns users when they've been exposed to extremist content. Facebook asks if you know someone who's becoming an extremist, which is why this morning I ratted out every anchor at CNN. But actually, you know, I did ask myself if I came across anything that seems extreme. And I did, but oddly, it's from Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg himself.",

I mean, if writing a hydrofoil surfboard holding an oversized American flag isn't a mark of extremist privileged behavior. What is? All that's missing is the red hat. A rifle rack and a plate of racist apple pie. I mean, this -- in this era where patriotism is merely a dog whistle for hate.   Couldn't want to argue that any form of patriotism and an oppressive racist society is celebrating its past and therefore an example of extremism? I believe that's MSNBC's mission statement. I mean, Zuckerberg is certainly not helping his own case here as he encourages citizens to narc on citizens and it's working. At my 4th of July cookout I caught my brisket wearing a wire.  That's a corny joke. But thanks to Facebook, it's no longer media and government policing your beliefs. They're motivating the public to do the dirty work for you. It's the new version of if you see something say something. The only difference is that something is no longer in unintended -- of unintended suitcase at the airport. It's your buddy getting a don't tread on me tattoo. The rise of cancel culture isn't a mistake. It's bad on purpose. The fear of losing one's job over something you said that's intended, so that fear self-polices your own words, you don't need a government to do it when your fear silences you and debate mysteriously disappears. When the world's largest social media platform asks you to knock on your neighbor's.   It's not just you they're asking but your neighbors too. But at least real narcs point out people who actually broke the law. So what if someone reports you according to Facebook, you'll never know your accusers. How stussy is that? Big brother eases you into becoming their informant by reminding you that \"others in your situation have received confidential support.\" It's a high-tech self-made witness protection plan only when you rat somebody out. You don't have to change your name, grow a beard and move to Scranton, like Joe DeVito did. You can think without repercussions. \"Take action now to protect yourself and others,\" Facebook says. Let Facebook be the bad guy. They're protected, not you. I remember when we were young. We were supposed to fight Big Brother, not hold hands with him. I wonder what the angry white male thinks.",

On Monday, at downtown, downtown Neiman Marcus was robbed by thieves smashing and grabbing like they were Andrew Cuomo near a female staffer. This latest incident of wealth redistribution comes as a berry Target store, a cutting store hours due to losses from rampant theft. Stores will now close at 6:00 pm instead of 10:00, because, you know it's a scientific fact that shoplifters spend their days doing charity work at orphanages. So, crime has Target cutting hours while criminals become empowered. Target may soon follow Walgreens closing stores for good. That's not enough. The SFPD is reporting auto burglaries are up a modest 753 percent since this time last year, violent crime has also enjoyed a long weekend with more than 180 people killed across the U.S. The good news is none of this is happening. According to Joe, Joy Reid in a recent Twitter exchange with New York Times Fiction Writer, Nicole Hannah Jones. Reid claimed, \"I've seen more TV stories about crime than the actual anecdotes from friends in NYC and other big cities bear out.\" So, if Joy Reid's friends haven't been murdered, then no one has.

Did you know that? Did you know that? First they wanted me to wear a mask now there's no poop in the pool. I thought this was America. The agency was wide widely mocked up because the advice is pretty obvious, but also because they actually felt the need to include graphic cartoons of kids having explosive diarrhea while swimming, apparently believing that their guidance might be too difficult to understand. Or maybe they have an accurate view of public education. So, either the CDC face we're so dumb that we wouldn't already know that pooping in pools is not OK. Or that this is actually a way bigger problem than we thought. But it's like I always say, children should be seen and not turd. Thank you very much.

And I know surveys like this are like shooting really stupid fish in a tiny, tiny barrel. Colleges where good grades don't matter, as long as you get a hammer and sickle tattoo on your butt. Still there. But hey, they're just dumb kids, right? We can forgive them. But what happens when patriotism is now considered offensive by our very own leaders? This weekend, idiots from Maxine Waters to Cori Bush slam 4th of July is nothing more than a celebration of racism. I could read you their tweets. But why? Here's this just from Bush. \"The freedom they are referring to is for white people. Which raises a point. Perhaps our politicians do such an awful job because they hate America.\" Do you ever think about that and they're in competence is their weapon? Think about how easy it is to subvert a Republic, get elected, then rot it from within. And if anyone challenges you, well, that's racist. Meanwhile, National Geographic mark the 4th by tweeting that smoke from fireworks causes disproportionate harm to communities of color. So I hope you enjoyed that roman candle, you racist. But of course National Geographic's virtue signal comes after decades of exploiting communities of color all over the world. Oh, look at topless women in their natural habitat. Remember that? When I was a young man, I just assumed every naked woman carried a basket of food on their head. And then there's the new Facebook feature that warns users when they've been exposed to extremist content. Facebook asks if you know someone who's becoming an extremist, which is why this morning I ratted out every anchor at CNN. But actually, you know, I did ask myself if I came across anything that seems extreme. And I did, but oddly, it's from Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg himself."

I mean, if writing a hydrofoil surfboard holding an oversized American flag isn't a mark of extremist privileged behavior. What is? All that's missing is the red hat. A rifle rack and a plate of racist apple pie. I mean, this -- in this era where patriotism is merely a dog whistle for hate. Couldn't want to argue that any form of patriotism and an oppressive racist society is celebrating its past and therefore an example of extremism? I believe that's MSNBC's mission statement. I mean, Zuckerberg is certainly not helping his own case here as he encourages citizens to narc on citizens and it's working. At my 4th of July cookout I caught my brisket wearing a wire. That's a corny joke. But thanks to Facebook, it's no longer media and government policing your beliefs. They're motivating the public to do the dirty work for you. It's the new version of if you see something say something. The only difference is that something is no longer in unintended -- of unintended suitcase at the airport. It's your buddy getting a don't tread on me tattoo. The rise of cancel culture isn't a mistake. It's bad on purpose. The fear of losing one's job over something you said that's intended, so that fear self-polices your own words, you don't need a government to do it when your fear silences you and debate mysteriously disappears. When the world's largest social media platform asks you to knock on your neighbor's. It's not just you they're asking but your neighbors too. But at least real narcs point out people who actually broke the law. So what if someone reports you according to Facebook, you'll never know your accusers. How stussy is that? Big brother eases you into becoming their informant by reminding you that \"others in your situation have received confidential support.\" It's a high-tech self-made witness protection plan only when you rat somebody out. You don't have to change your name, grow a beard and move to Scranton, like Joe DeVito did. You can think without repercussions. \"Take action now to protect yourself and others,\" Facebook says. Let Facebook be the bad guy. They're protected, not you. I remember when we were young. We were supposed to fight Big Brother, not hold hands with him. I wonder what the angry white male thinks."

But as video mounts of five figure discounts, the media keeps grifting about shoplifting. I can't help myself. This week, in San Francisco really was the land of the free. On Monday, at downtown, downtown Neiman Marcus was robbed by thieves smashing and grabbing like they were Andrew Cuomo near a female staffer. This latest incident of wealth redistribution comes as a berry Target store, a cutting store hours due to losses from rampant theft. Stores will now close at 6:00 pm instead of 10:00, because, you know it's a scientific fact that shoplifters spend their days doing charity work at orphanages. So, crime has Target cutting hours while criminals become empowered. Target may soon follow Walgreens closing stores for good. That's not enough. The SFPD is reporting auto burglaries are up a modest 753 percent since this time last year, violent crime has also enjoyed a long weekend with more than 180 people killed across the U.S. The good news is none of this is happening. According to Joe, Joy Reid in a recent Twitter exchange with New York Times Fiction Writer, Nicole Hannah Jones. Reid claimed, \"I've seen more TV stories about crime than the actual anecdotes from friends in NYC and other big cities bear out.\" So, if Joy Reid's friends haven't been murdered, then no one has. Right, we should go by the anecdotal evidence of far-left pundit friends over murders statistics, where the hell did you get this dumb idea?"

Did you know that? Did you know that? First they wanted me to wear a mask now there's no poop in the pool. I thought this was America. The agency was wide widely mocked up because the advice is pretty obvious, but also because they actually felt the need to include graphic cartoons of kids having explosive diarrhea while swimming, apparently believing that their guidance might be too difficult to understand. Or maybe they have an accurate view of public education. So, either the CDC face we're so dumb that we wouldn't already know that pooping in pools is not OK.
