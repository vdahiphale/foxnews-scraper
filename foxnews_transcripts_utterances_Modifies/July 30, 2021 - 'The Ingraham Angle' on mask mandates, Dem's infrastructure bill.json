Now, Biden had his chance to bring back the America we love, but he yielded to the media, the left and the permanent bureaucracy.

But it's patently obvious that there is no science that is going to compel them to urge restrictions be lifted, because it's all arbitrary.

Well, did the science hold up his right hand and swear to uphold and defend the constitution of the United States? The experts had been playing a game for the past 18 months on this. We were told we could get past this, get back to normal, or something approaching normal, to do all these things. We did all these things. And none of it worked. Did the post 9/11 restrictions ever get lifted? I don't know. Do you still have to take your shoes off at the airport and you go through TSA? Did they remove all those surveillance cameras everywhere after 9/11? COVID is their excuse to do everything that they couldn't push through in the normal legislative, prosperous - the prosperous and happy times. They want all of this to roll into 2022 and 2024. They'll cite COVID to justify the need for more ballot harvesting, and to extend the voting times. I just don't believe though, that the American people are prepared to live under this many restrictions and restraints. I think more people are going to come to realize that there's just no way out, unless we get new political leadership. Americans will free themselves. No one's going to do it for them. If this was all about preventing COVID, they'd be focused on finding out where the virus came from in the first place to stop the next wave. The FDA wouldn't have trashed or ignored the very therapeutics and antivirals that speed up recovery from COVID. They would have shut down the border, not continued to cede America with COVID via migrants who tested positive. I want to be as clear about this as possible tonight. The dominant faction in the Democratic Party does not want life in America to return to normal. They never liked the old normal. They don't like capitalism much. They don't even like freedom. They want Americans to shut up and do what they're told. It doesn't matter how many people take the vaccine, it doesn't matter what the caseload looks like on any given day. It doesn't matter how much evidence we have that lockdowns are bad for public health, they do not care. And since they control the media, there's always going to be another variant, another study, another excuse to maintain serious restrictions on American Life. Even if COVID disappeared completely overnight, they'd simply use another alleged crisis. Maybe it's climate change, to promote a similar agenda. The less freedom of speech and expression, the better. The higher the gas prices are, the better. The Democrats' efforts to change America through these draconian policies, through runaway spending and endless borrowing will long outlast COVID. They won't stop when the science tells them to stop. They're only going to stop when the election returns tell them to. A Reagan era wipe out in 1980, in 1984, would look good right about now. And that's the \"Angle\". Here now is Dr. Peter McCullough, internist, cardiologist, and epidemiologist. We're going to get to how the strong arm of the COVID law is coming after you in a moment. But first, The Washington Post just got its hands on internal CDC documents that say is leading to this updated guidance, Dr. McCullough. And the data claims that the Delta variant in a vaccinated person may be as contagious as with an unvaccinated person. But Doctor, you heard what Biden said today, if 100 percent of Americans get the vaccine, we're going to somehow stop the spread. How does that make sense given the data that's pouring in right now?",

MATT WALSH, HOST, \"THE MATT WALSH SHOW\": I do think it's been interesting that I said men shouldn't cry in public, and lots of men have responded to that statement by crying in public, which hasn't really made me rethink my original assertion. And by the way, I think I'm being generous here. I did say there are some exceptions, like if a loved one dies, or you come home from a long deployment, hugging your children, you get your arm stuck in a woodchipper, you're watching the end of the movie \"Rudy.\" There are a couple other exceptions. Maybe I could publish an actual guide and if a man feels like he is about to cry, he can consult that guide to find out if it is a sanctioned sobbing fit or not. I could possibly do that if I need to. My real point, though, I think it's a pretty simple one. It's just that men should try to control their emotions. You could go too far on the stoicism end of it, but right now we are airing way on the other side of that extreme. Just try to control your emotions and not cry all the time. People react to that, though. It's like one of the many commonsense statements you can make these days. People react to it. They don't just disagree. They react to it like it's the most insane, outrageous thing they've ever heard. There were guys threatening me physical harm because I told them not to cry, and they were crying while they said it.

Now, for many months very smart and apolitical scientists have been saying that vaccines would never mean zero COVID infections, but instead that they would help curb hospitalizations and deaths. For 15 months, we've known that those who die from COVID have at least one if not two, three, or more serious comorbidities.

Why are we not talking about the use of vitamin D, of fitness, getting in better shape and diet? At this point, there is no question that this is in part about controlling us, not protecting us. Look at Australia, they have very few cases or deaths. In fact, compared to other countries, they never had all that many cases. And in Australia, right now, they're locked down for four more weeks after having been locked down for four weeks previous. So the lock downs for the left are the policy. They're not the answer or the solution for a problem. If they were, New York and California would have led the nation in preventing deaths and hospitalizations long ago.

They think that paying tuition is unfair. They're fine with punishing and excluding and shaming Americans who decide for themselves against getting this vaccine. And yes, they love the masks. They love the face shields, even our Secretary of Defense. So embarrassing. That's not him wearing the face shield, but you get the point. Now, Biden had his chance to bring back the America we love, but he yielded to the media, the left and the permanent bureaucracy. He made a colossal mistake by ceding this territory to Fauci and the CDC. But it's patently obvious that there is no science that is going to compel them to urge restrictions be lifted, because it's all arbitrary. CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky makes Dr. Birx look like Madame Curie. The real question is, how long will the blue state voters put up with this madness? These mandates aren't going to change the views of conservatives and independents at all. If anything, they're going to make them trust the vaccines less.

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "OK. Do you see where this is going? If the science tells us and the press goes, ooh, isn't this great? He's listening to the science. Well, did the science hold up his right hand and swear to uphold and defend the constitution of the United States? The experts had been playing a game for the past 18 months on this. We were told we could get past this, get back to normal, or something approaching normal, to do all these things. We did all these things. And none of it worked. Did the post 9/11 restrictions ever get lifted? I don't know. Do you still have to take your shoes off at the airport and you go through TSA? Did they remove all those surveillance cameras everywhere after 9/11? COVID is their excuse to do everything that they couldn't push through in the normal legislative, prosperous - the prosperous and happy times. They want all of this to roll into 2022 and 2024. They'll cite COVID to justify the need for more ballot harvesting, and to extend the voting times. I just don't believe though, that the American people are prepared to live under this many restrictions and restraints. I think more people are going to come to realize that there's just no way out, unless we get new political leadership. Americans will free themselves. No one's going to do it for them. If this was all about preventing COVID, they'd be focused on finding out where the virus came from in the first place to stop the next wave. The FDA wouldn't have trashed or ignored the very therapeutics and antivirals that speed up recovery from COVID. They would have shut down the border, not continued to cede America with COVID via migrants who tested positive. I want to be as clear about this as possible tonight. The dominant faction in the Democratic Party does not want life in America to return to normal. They never liked the old normal. They don't like capitalism much. They don't even like freedom. They want Americans to shut up and do what they're told. It doesn't matter how many people take the vaccine, it doesn't matter what the caseload looks like on any given day. It doesn't matter how much evidence we have that lockdowns are bad for public health, they do not care. And since they control the media, there's always going to be another variant, another study, another excuse to maintain serious restrictions on American Life. Even if COVID disappeared completely overnight, they'd simply use another alleged crisis. Maybe it's climate change, to promote a similar agenda. The less freedom of speech and expression, the better. The higher the gas prices are, the better. The Democrats' efforts to change America through these draconian policies, through runaway spending and endless borrowing will long outlast COVID. They won't stop when the science tells them to stop. They're only going to stop when the election returns tell them to. A Reagan era wipe out in 1980, in 1984, would look good right about now. And that's the \"Angle\". Here now is Dr. Peter McCullough, internist, cardiologist, and epidemiologist. We're going to get to how the strong arm of the COVID law is coming after you in a moment. But first, The Washington Post just got its hands on internal CDC documents that say is leading to this updated guidance, Dr. McCullough. And the data claims that the Delta variant in a vaccinated person may be as contagious as with an unvaccinated person. But Doctor, you heard what Biden said today, if 100 percent of Americans get the vaccine, we're going to somehow stop the spread. How does that make sense given the data that's pouring in right now?"

We had a wedding in Houston, where everyone was vaccinated; we had a Democratic legislative plane flight from Texas to Washington; we had a British naval vessel where all the sailors were vaccinated. And in fact, in all of those circumstances, there are cases that emerged of COVID. And now a paper by Farinholt and colleagues from Baylor College of Medicine in Houston has demonstrated, indeed, patients who are fully vaccinated can actually acquire, carry and transmit the Delta variant of COVID-19."

Now, one of the things that's come out of this entire COVID debate is the intimidation and retribution campaigns we've seen against medical experts.

We want every possible eligible voter to come to the polls and vote, and we want no non-eligible voters to come to the polls to vote. The Justice Department should enforce the voting laws. If they tried to extend the voting laws, for example, if they tried to knock down identification, mandatory identification, the Supreme Court will strike that down. So we have the Justice Department on the one hand, but we have the Supreme Court overseeing the Justice Department. Again, the goal, everybody who's eligible should vote, nobody who's ineligible shouldn't vote. How to strike the appropriate ballots is very difficult. As far as mandating vaccination, I think the Supreme Court would uphold gradual mandating of vaccination. That is first.

At a time we're facing massive inflation, other pressures and President Trump said, you guys have made a terrible deal that Republicans are big losers here, and that the Democrats are the big winners.

Since we voted yesterday, I gather there's some backstage last-minute negotiations happening. I just don't think that is the right way to start on any piece of legislation. Second, it's clear that Chuck Schumer and Joe Biden are trying to ram this bill through, but they do want to get to their $3.5 trillion blow out spending bill that will try to transform America into a socialist nation with reckless taxing and spending. But there's no rush here. We are not up against a deadline. The government is not about to close. The trips are not about to lose their pay. There is no reason to rush a bill like this.

It would be the height of folly to tell the world when they are already rushing our borders that if you get here in time, you too might get an amnesty, and if you don't get it this time, you will get it next time around.

And Biden and the Democrats are causing inflation, not just by spending trillions of dollars we don't have, but as you point out, they are also locking up the supply side of our economy. When people won't go back to work because as Uncle Sam is giving them a $300 bonus every year, or they're still facing social distancing requirements, or governors are starting to slap new mask mandates back on them, the Biden Democrats get you coming and going. They spend more money than we have, and they also don't allow our economy to open back up and get people back to work so they can start producing the goods that Americans want to buy. That is why we have inflation in this country. It is 100 percent because of Joe Biden's health policies."

You've got a lot of House Democrats are unhappy that this bill doesn't spend even more money and doesn't have even more reckless tax increases in it. So I think they've got a lot of rocky shoals that they're going to have to navigate in the months ahead, and the best thing for America would be not to pass a multitrillion dollar bill that is going to continue to drive up inflation and continuing harming this economy."

Joining me now is Matt Walsh, host of \"The Matt Walsh Show.\" Matt, what's wrong with men showing kind of their sensitive, vulnerable side in public. Why is that a problem? MATT WALSH, HOST, \"THE MATT WALSH SHOW\": I do think it's been interesting that I said men shouldn't cry in public, and lots of men have responded to that statement by crying in public, which hasn't really made me rethink my original assertion. And by the way, I think I'm being generous here. I did say there are some exceptions, like if a loved one dies, or you come home from a long deployment, hugging your children, you get your arm stuck in a woodchipper, you're watching the end of the movie \"Rudy.\" There are a couple other exceptions. Maybe I could publish an actual guide and if a man feels like he is about to cry, he can consult that guide to find out if it is a sanctioned sobbing fit or not. I could possibly do that if I need to. My real point, though, I think it's a pretty simple one. It's just that men should try to control their emotions. You could go too far on the stoicism end of it, but right now we are airing way on the other side of that extreme. Just try to control your emotions and not cry all the time. People react to that, though. It's like one of the many commonsense statements you can make these days. People react to it. They don't just disagree. They react to it like it's the most insane, outrageous thing they've ever heard. There were guys threatening me physical harm because I told them not to cry, and they were crying while they said it. So I wasn't really worried about it, but it is a pretty crazy reaction."

    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "The Olympic Games historically deliver great American stories, and of course showcase our pride in our nation. But instead, they have been engulfed in everything but this year. It began with hammer thrower Gwen Berry turning her back on the American flag during the National Anthem at the Olympic trials. And then it continued with track star Noah Lyles raising his fist in solidarity with Black Lives Matter at the same trials, and then culminated in the women's soccer national team of course taking a knee before their first match against Sweden where, by the way, they lost. I'm sure the games themselves have been marked by some great moments, and we love. But the bulk of the coverage seems to have revolved around COVID or underwhelming results, and now, of course, mental health. And viewers are voting with their remotes. Ratings have plummeted almost, I guess now 50 percent since 2016. Joining me now is Eli Bremer, who competed in the 2008 Beijing Olympics and is now an Olympic commentator. Eli, great to see you. You say the social justice movement among athletes is having a negative effect on all athletes, whether they are involved in social justice causes or not. Explain that."

We shouldn't be talking about this. We should be talking about the hometown girl or boy that goes to the grandest stage and wins an Olympic gold medal for the greatest nation on earth."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "A new poll just out from Monmouth actually found that 36 percent of Americans were less interested in these games that are delayed, obviously, in the 2021 games are delayed because of the situation with 2020 and COVID. And out of the 36 percent who are less interested, 30 percent said it was due to the pandemic, and 34 percent, Eli, said it was due to politics. And then the polling director went on to say this, \"The Olympic spirit is a bit dampened this year. The emergence of Black Lives Matter in the sports world has also led to a backlash among some Americans.\" So he went right to the BLM point, which I found, frankly, depressing."

Sports have historically been unifying. They brought people together. You don't look at someone based on their race or gender or ethnicity in sports. You look at them and marvel at the wonders of the human body and athleticism. And this year with the wokeness that has taken over, we are talking about that. And again, that has diminished the Olympics. It's diminished sports."

You know what, America is a great country. The Olympics can showcase that. And yes, nationalism is great. You should be proud of your country. If you're not proud of your country, find another country to compete in."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BREMER",
      "utterance": "I think there has already been issues behind the scenes. There's two aspects that can get in the way of an athlete competing. One is sort of that focus, the difficult level of focus that you have. And then obviously the other is the emotional piece of it. I don't know which piece is affecting Simone Biles. I will tell you, it is very concerning to me that we're seeing an uptick of that. I don't know if it's because of COVID or anything else, but it's disturbing. And it's another storyline that I think is taking away from great stories at the Olympics."

There's a lot going on. And I have enormous respect for you, Eli, for not only what you accomplished all those years ago, but I know you are looking to get into politics and maybe even in the Senate against Michael Bennet. We will be following that race as well as it develops. Eli, great to see you tonight, thank you."
