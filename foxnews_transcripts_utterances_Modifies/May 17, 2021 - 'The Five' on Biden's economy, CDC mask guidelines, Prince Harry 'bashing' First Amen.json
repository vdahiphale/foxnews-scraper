He says the - - he says that the economy is growing faster in nearly 40 years. That he also inherited an anemic economy. But it forces everybody else when you hear that to do the cleanup. You don't -- you can't fact check that. You have to do a complete fact sex change.  The two facts that he's pushing are only positive if you pretend the pandemic didn't exist. The economy was anemic because we had to shut down and the economy is coming back because the shutdown is ending. It is that simple. To make that your one-two punch is kind of pathetic.   And I do think that the reason why you don't see him or anybody in the media too worried about the gas stuff is because they don't drive. It's really is stupid. But I'll make a generalization about this. Most people in the media don't drive. They don't care about this because they don't have a job that requires gasoline. They don't even know how to pump their own gas. The problem is they're not aware of the people around them that need gas that rely on fuel. The truckers, the Amazon delivery people that send -- that bring your Pilates mats, the seamless driver that brings you your, you know, your Thai food. So, you may not drive, but other people are doing the driving for you.",

Because once you see the inflation, that's when those high prices are here to stay for a really long time.  I've argued that this is Joe Biden's America. And the real-world consequences just showed up a hell of a lot faster than any Democrats expected just in time for the midterms. That's why they're worried. Whoops. We're all getting to see where this Bidenian (Ph) brilliance would take this country.  Open borders, done. It happened really quickly. The only problem is, the Democrats couldn't manage the optics. Gas lines. Biden promised to transition away from the oil industry. Half of his infrastructure plan is aimed at eliminating fossil fuels. He already killed the Keystone XL Pipeline day one. And then Jen Granholm, the energy secretary says well, if you just drove an electric car, you wouldn't be having a problem with the gasoline shortages. Then on top of that, you have government handouts and run-away spending that extra $300 for unemployment is nothing compared to the four ginormous entitlements. Universal Pre-K, free child car, free community college and paid family leave that Biden has plans to implement but you don't even have to work for them.  So how do you do it? The Federal Reserve keeps printing money, it's buying up the debt. And what do you get? Crushing inflation that is a regressive tax on people who actually choose to work.",

I'm assuming if I think that's a little too strong. I'll you a chance to talk about that.  JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS CO-HOST & POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, I mean, you know, I like tabloids as much as the next guy to catch my attention as I'm walking past the news stand. But it's just not real. Let's just take a look at the public opinion. The public opinion polls, Joe Biden is well over 50 percent in almost all of the polls. I think in A.P., it was like at 60 percent approval. So that's just the reality touch.  I mean, you think about his policies in terms of dealing with COVID or in terms of his infrastructure plan. Again, the American people like these policies. They like the plan. So I just think, you know, yes, he has his critics but, you know, the big one to me in terms of the polls by the way, Dana, is that for the first time I think in like four years, most of the American people now say the country is on the right track. That is such an optimistic positive way of seeing what's going on. And I think Joe Biden deserves credit for it.   By the way, I'm a driver especially on weekends. I don't have to drive too much during the week. But on the weekends, you know, I get out and about. I got gas in D.C. this weekend. I think most of the gas stations in Virginia and Maryland, adjacent jurisdictions, they have gas. So, and I think most people understand, this wasn't the work of any policy. This is the work of hackers. Hackers from Russia. So, the fact that it's -- everything is being, I think resupplied, things are getting better, I think is a sign again America can adjust when difficult times, when turbulence hit.  But you know, just overall, I want to just respond to what I heard. I just think the economy is going from zero standstill because of COVID, we put it in a sleep essentially and now it's coming back to life. It's going from standstill to hyper speed and there's going to turbulence. You may not have your Chick-Fil-A sauces. You may have a shortage of ketchup here, lumber there. Used cars over there. But it's just like, you know, on a take-off when you hit a little turbulence. Every big sign, stock markets, you know, treasury bonds, all good stuff.",

      "sentences": "Yes. Juan is not panicking but the White House is. You always say the Biden White House doesn't panic? Well now there's three reports that's saying they're panicking. That means it's 10 times worse than they're actually saying. Biden is probably having his dog bite people he's so angry. The reason why inflation, Juan, is such a political killer is because it affects the left and the right equally. But it affects the poor and the rich unequally. So, it gives rise to populism. Something Joe Biden barely tamed and is still boiling beneath the surface. So, but forget about what it does to a politician. It can set countries back years. Look what it did to Germany or Brazil. And it happens only because you spend and print too much money.   So, we've asked for it. And Joe Biden's $300 weekly bonus is now creating a high unemployment situation. You combine inflation, high unemployment, you get stagflation. I wonderful word to say stagflation sounds good to say but is a horrible thing to experience. And the only thing you can do to beat stagflation or inflation is raise rates and stop printing money. And when you do that, the economy suffers.  So, what are they going to do? Joe Biden is going to have to act because the longer you wait, the harder it is to take care of. And Joe Biden's tool box is limited, because anything he tries, the left is going to freak out. If he tries to say hey, Republicans, maybe I'll lower the cost of my plan, they'll freak out. If he says, hey, let's stop the border influx so we can maybe raise wages, left is going to freak out. If he says, you know, energy producers, let's try to increase supply, take some pressure off, left is going to freak out. So eventually, fed is going to have to jump in. They're going to have to raise rates. It's going to hurt the economy. And Biden is going to do just what Barack Obama did. Blame his predecessor for the bad recovery.",

Deaths are down in all 50 states. And vaccinations he said were now at 60 percent of the American people. At least one shot. I think that's fantastic. I think that's evidence that we're making progress.  So, I mean, you know, I heard -- I hear the critics say hey, we -- why isn't Biden telling people they can do without the mask if they're vaccinated? He's been slow to tell us to take off the mask.

Because again, maybe they weren't consulted and they're starting to lose that kind of control and power that they've at least some of it that they've accumulated in the last year. But some of these Republican governors who are complaining about the announcement out of like, it's too fast. Stop whining. You shut down an economy, a state overnight. This is simple, a simple recommendation. It's mask was on, now it's mask off. Be nimble when the outcome is in you favor. Stop complaining about it. Know when to shut up.

And so, that actually I do think gives some companies like the ones that we put up on the board Target making the decision today to say OK, well the CDC said this. The criticism about the CDC and the moving too fast is really coming from the left, from the scientists. I mean, whether, as much -- even though I know, Dagen, you're right that some of the governors were complaining about that. And it does seem like all of a sudden, the government is saying OK, actually business, you land this plane. You figure it out for us. But that might be OK. I think the one thing that I really like to get some answers on is just two weeks ago or last week -- excuse me, last week, Rochelle Walensky, she is the head of the CDC, she testifies in front of Congress. And they're grilling her about the mask mandates. And she's just stalwart. Absolutely we need to wear a mask. We need to wear a mask.  Then all of a sudden, on Wednesday night they tell the White House that it's OK now?

And then his partner in crime, Bill de Blasio he is bribing people to get vexed with fast food. Meanwhile, obesity is like the number one component to get the coronavirus in the first place.

Although like literally in the commercial break, I was reading that Biden has just had a call with Netanyahu in which he reiterates the right of Israel to defend itself but he says something in there about how he supports the calls for a ceasefire. But it's not that strong. So, I want to -- literally that just happened so let me digest that and see -- we can all see how that turns out and how that's interpreted because as you diagram the sentence as you can see.  However, I think that he has been very um much restrained in terms of allowing Israel to defend itself, doing what it needs to do, and pushing back pretty aggressively even from the White House podium today on far left extremist views like those the ones that we just put up there. Another thing that I think is clear is that Biden understands, I believe he understands, and Blinken understands that Hamas has to lose because if they are given an inch here, they will take a mile. And we know that Iran is behind this and so there's all sorts of geopolitical things that go forward. Last thing I would say is we hear a lot about foreign aid and complaints about foreign aid. I get it. I hear it. But think about the military aid that's gone to Israel and how well that has been put to use. You are actually seeing it on your screens that the iron dome is successful.

If you want to go into that, we're going to need an hour to go into it but don't spin it around like that. And if you're going to use the David and Goliath analogy, use it appropriately. This David happens to be the one that keeps starting the damn fight, all right. And the most absurd argument is that the fact that somebody is a superior military force somehow makes that a war crime? The fact that rockets aimed at Israeli citizens are protected by the Iron Dome but the people that are sending those rockets aren't and somehow that is a war crime? No. You know what, they built the Iron Dome to protect Jews and Arabs who live there. There is a ton of Jews and Arabs that live together under the dome. This argument of a massive imbalance -- I mean if i start punching Tyrus, if I show up one day and go into his office and start punching Tyrus and all. And so, because Tyrus is bigger than me, he can't punch back and that he's guilty of a war crime if he picks me up by my legs and dangles me?  No, that's what he's got to do. So, you got to tell -- you have to tell the bullies -- the bullies can still be small, right? And as for these deals, the Abraham Accords are holding firm. These are independent commitments with Israel with Arab states, right? This is the exact kind of threat to peace that these accords were meant to endure. Yet, you're not getting peace -- well, you brought up Trump, no one else did, but the fact that these deals are keeping this whole Arab state together says a hell of a lot, a hell of a lot.

Political allies are faulting the White House for mixed messaging on the recovery. There are also concerns about growing inflation. And Axios is reporting some Democrats and economists think the president's spending plans could be too big. and the gas crisis the Biden administration told Americans would soon go away is still happening. In Washington, D.C., 71 percent of stations are out of gas and other states are still experiencing shortages.

He says the - - he says that the economy is growing faster in nearly 40 years. That he also inherited an anemic economy. But it forces everybody else when you hear that to do the cleanup. You don't -- you can't fact check that. You have to do a complete fact sex change. The two facts that he's pushing are only positive if you pretend the pandemic didn't exist. The economy was anemic because we had to shut down and the economy is coming back because the shutdown is ending. It is that simple. To make that your one-two punch is kind of pathetic. And I do think that the reason why you don't see him or anybody in the media too worried about the gas stuff is because they don't drive. It's really is stupid. But I'll make a generalization about this. Most people in the media don't drive. They don't care about this because they don't have a job that requires gasoline. They don't even know how to pump their own gas. The problem is they're not aware of the people around them that need gas that rely on fuel. The truckers, the Amazon delivery people that send -- that bring your Pilates mats, the seamless driver that brings you your, you know, your Thai food. So, you may not drive, but other people are doing the driving for you."

Because once you see the inflation, that's when those high prices are here to stay for a really long time. I've argued that this is Joe Biden's America. And the real-world consequences just showed up a hell of a lot faster than any Democrats expected just in time for the midterms. That's why they're worried. Whoops. We're all getting to see where this Bidenian (Ph) brilliance would take this country. Open borders, done. It happened really quickly. The only problem is, the Democrats couldn't manage the optics. Gas lines. Biden promised to transition away from the oil industry. Half of his infrastructure plan is aimed at eliminating fossil fuels. He already killed the Keystone XL Pipeline day one. And then Jen Granholm, the energy secretary says well, if you just drove an electric car, you wouldn't be having a problem with the gasoline shortages. Then on top of that, you have government handouts and run-away spending that extra $300 for unemployment is nothing compared to the four ginormous entitlements. Universal Pre-K, free child car, free community college and paid family leave that Biden has plans to implement but you don't even have to work for them. So how do you do it? The Federal Reserve keeps printing money, it's buying up the debt. And what do you get? Crushing inflation that is a regressive tax on people who actually choose to work."

I'm assuming if I think that's a little too strong. I'll you a chance to talk about that. JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS CO-HOST & POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, I mean, you know, I like tabloids as much as the next guy to catch my attention as I'm walking past the news stand. But it's just not real. Let's just take a look at the public opinion. The public opinion polls, Joe Biden is well over 50 percent in almost all of the polls. I think in A.P., it was like at 60 percent approval. So that's just the reality touch. I mean, you think about his policies in terms of dealing with COVID or in terms of his infrastructure plan. Again, the American people like these policies. They like the plan. So I just think, you know, yes, he has his critics but, you know, the big one to me in terms of the polls by the way, Dana, is that for the first time I think in like four years, most of the American people now say the country is on the right track. That is such an optimistic positive way of seeing what's going on. And I think Joe Biden deserves credit for it. By the way, I'm a driver especially on weekends. I don't have to drive too much during the week. But on the weekends, you know, I get out and about. I got gas in D.C. this weekend. I think most of the gas stations in Virginia and Maryland, adjacent jurisdictions, they have gas. So, and I think most people understand, this wasn't the work of any policy. This is the work of hackers. Hackers from Russia. So, the fact that it's -- everything is being, I think resupplied, things are getting better, I think is a sign again America can adjust when difficult times, when turbulence hit. But you know, just overall, I want to just respond to what I heard. I just think the economy is going from zero standstill because of COVID, we put it in a sleep essentially and now it's coming back to life. It's going from standstill to hyper speed and there's going to turbulence. You may not have your Chick-Fil-A sauces. You may have a shortage of ketchup here, lumber there. Used cars over there. But it's just like, you know, on a take-off when you hit a little turbulence. Every big sign, stock markets, you know, treasury bonds, all good stuff."

      "utterance": "Yes. Juan is not panicking but the White House is. You always say the Biden White House doesn't panic? Well now there's three reports that's saying they're panicking. That means it's 10 times worse than they're actually saying. Biden is probably having his dog bite people he's so angry. The reason why inflation, Juan, is such a political killer is because it affects the left and the right equally. But it affects the poor and the rich unequally. So, it gives rise to populism. Something Joe Biden barely tamed and is still boiling beneath the surface. So, but forget about what it does to a politician. It can set countries back years. Look what it did to Germany or Brazil. And it happens only because you spend and print too much money. So, we've asked for it. And Joe Biden's $300 weekly bonus is now creating a high unemployment situation. You combine inflation, high unemployment, you get stagflation. I wonderful word to say stagflation sounds good to say but is a horrible thing to experience. And the only thing you can do to beat stagflation or inflation is raise rates and stop printing money. And when you do that, the economy suffers. So, what are they going to do? Joe Biden is going to have to act because the longer you wait, the harder it is to take care of. And Joe Biden's tool box is limited, because anything he tries, the left is going to freak out. If he tries to say hey, Republicans, maybe I'll lower the cost of my plan, they'll freak out. If he says, hey, let's stop the border influx so we can maybe raise wages, left is going to freak out. If he says, you know, energy producers, let's try to increase supply, take some pressure off, left is going to freak out. So eventually, fed is going to have to jump in. They're going to have to raise rates. It's going to hurt the economy. And Biden is going to do just what Barack Obama did. Blame his predecessor for the bad recovery."

I thought it was really good news today in that little bit that we just heard from Biden, he said that for the first time now, you know, the cases -- infection rates are down in all 50 states. Deaths are down in all 50 states. And vaccinations he said were now at 60 percent of the American people. At least one shot. I think that's fantastic. I think that's evidence that we're making progress. So, I mean, you know, I heard -- I hear the critics say hey, we -- why isn't Biden telling people they can do without the mask if they're vaccinated? He's been slow to tell us to take off the mask. Then now I'm hearing people say hey, I think he was too fast to tell us to take off the mask. So, at some point I think hey, maybe this is just politics.

In terms -- the Democrat governors and Lori Lightfoot was clearly not happy with this mask guidance out of the White House. Because again, maybe they weren't consulted and they're starting to lose that kind of control and power that they've at least some of it that they've accumulated in the last year. But some of these Republican governors who are complaining about the announcement out of like, it's too fast. Stop whining. You shut down an economy, a state overnight. This is simple, a simple recommendation. It's mask was on, now it's mask off. Be nimble when the outcome is in you favor. Stop complaining about it. Know when to shut up.

And so, that actually I do think gives some companies like the ones that we put up on the board Target making the decision today to say OK, well the CDC said this. The criticism about the CDC and the moving too fast is really coming from the left, from the scientists. I mean, whether, as much -- even though I know, Dagen, you're right that some of the governors were complaining about that. And it does seem like all of a sudden, the government is saying OK, actually business, you land this plane. You figure it out for us. But that might be OK. I think the one thing that I really like to get some answers on is just two weeks ago or last week -- excuse me, last week, Rochelle Walensky, she is the head of the CDC, she testifies in front of Congress. And they're grilling her about the mask mandates. And she's just stalwart. Absolutely we need to wear a mask. We need to wear a mask. Then all of a sudden, on Wednesday night they tell the White House that it's OK now? And then they tell -- they wait till Thursday morning to tell the president then he rolls this out at one o'clock on Thursday. To me, the science -- the science didn't change in the last four days. But changed was the political winds. And I would imagine that they -- I'm not against the decision that they made or the announcement that they made.

Although like literally in the commercial break, I was reading that Biden has just had a call with Netanyahu in which he reiterates the right of Israel to defend itself but he says something in there about how he supports the calls for a ceasefire. But it's not that strong. So, I want to -- literally that just happened so let me digest that and see -- we can all see how that turns out and how that's interpreted because as you diagram the sentence as you can see. However, I think that he has been very um much restrained in terms of allowing Israel to defend itself, doing what it needs to do, and pushing back pretty aggressively even from the White House podium today on far left extremist views like those the ones that we just put up there. Another thing that I think is clear is that Biden understands, I believe he understands, and Blinken understands that Hamas has to lose because if they are given an inch here, they will take a mile. And we know that Iran is behind this and so there's all sorts of geopolitical things that go forward. Last thing I would say is we hear a lot about foreign aid and complaints about foreign aid. I get it. I hear it. But think about the military aid that's gone to Israel and how well that has been put to use. You are actually seeing it on your screens that the iron dome is successful. And people on the left will -- might ask, or the far-left extremists, I should say, might say, well, why doesn't uh Gaza have iron dome?"

But in terms of the messaging that we've heard for years from Ocasio- Cortez, and Ilhan Omar, and Rashida Tlaib, if it was anyone else who was consistently and publicly as anti-Israel against Israel as those Joe Biden would openly be calling them anti-semites because that's what they are."

I just don't think that there are too many Jewish people who think that, you know, Taylor Greene has got to have their back, you know what I mean? I just don't think that people react that way. But what we need here i just think is plainly a ceasefire. You have -- you have Palestinian children dying. You have huge apartment buildings that's being destroyed by the Israelis. And the Israelis clearly, you know, control the timetable here because they are so superior in terms of military might. As been pointed out, they have the Iron Dome. So what you get is a David and Goliath situation where Hamas which is the extreme and they're just terrible -- I mean, they shouldn't be firing these missiles but they are, but they -- you know, so many of their missiles are intercepted by the Iron Dome. On the other hand, Israel is firing rockets and missiles and blowing up stuff and the Palestinians in Gaza can't protect themselves."

It wasn't even a matter of conviction, it was a matter of displacing Palestinians from properties that they lived in, and then you get people angry.

If you want to go into that, we're going to need an hour to go into it but don't spin it around like that. And if you're going to use the David and Goliath analogy, use it appropriately. This David happens to be the one that keeps starting the damn fight, all right. And the most absurd argument is that the fact that somebody is a superior military force somehow makes that a war crime? The fact that rockets aimed at Israeli citizens are protected by the Iron Dome but the people that are sending those rockets aren't and somehow that is a war crime? No. You know what, they built the Iron Dome to protect Jews and Arabs who live there. There is a ton of Jews and Arabs that live together under the dome. This argument of a massive imbalance -- I mean if i start punching Tyrus, if I show up one day and go into his office and start punching Tyrus and all. And so, because Tyrus is bigger than me, he can't punch back and that he's guilty of a war crime if he picks me up by my legs and dangles me? No, that's what he's got to do. So, you got to tell -- you have to tell the bullies -- the bullies can still be small, right? And as for these deals, the Abraham Accords are holding firm. These are independent commitments with Israel with Arab states, right? This is the exact kind of threat to peace that these accords were meant to endure. Yet, you're not getting peace -- well, you brought up Trump, no one else did, but the fact that these deals are keeping this whole Arab state together says a hell of a lot, a hell of a lot.

That basically means like you really don't get it at all. And if you're going on a podcast or Oprah Winfrey and you start the sentence with I really don't want to go down the road of talking about the First Amendment because I really don't know enough about it, you can stop there."

He's the guy you tell to bring some lattes over if he stop and buy and he shows up with a roll of masking tape and pomegranate. He's useless.

While most people are happy to hug their loved ones again, those who prefer personal space are upset and claim hugging can actually induce more stress than it relieves.

So, it was kind of God's way of saying, you know what, let's have everybody get a time-out. You've been a little so grabby. Keep your hands to yourself for a year and then, you know, when we come back together, we can think about what we've done. Dagen, though, I'm going to need some space when we return to the green room. You know, I just asked that you respect my privacy and I'll get there for the hug when I'm ready."

So, I think we're going -- you know, we're post pandemic, we're going to have to reemerge in society but maybe people are uncomfortable with hugging, cuddling, I don't know. You have to social distance also in Me Too Land, you know."

This dog has got some skills and a lot of concentration. And they just go at it all day long. Look at this. It's pretty amazing. I know Rookie can't do this, Jasper can't do this.

I was trying to leave but the main performance guy was just -- he was just leaning on his horn. If we would have the tape, we have Elton John who was there. And he was just -- all he was doing was just honking. As you can see, he was very upset and he wanted to go home. He had to get home and put his (INAUDIBLE) to bed.
