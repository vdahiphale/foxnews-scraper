That has not existed in Washington in a very, very long time, because it's so constricted by partisan lines. But the big picture when you step back - the problem with Syria is not that the President withdrew too quickly, the problem with Syria is that we never had an open debate about why we were in Syria in the first place. Congress never voted on it. And the reason that President Obama never went to Congress to get a vote to go into Syria, is because he knew he could never get Congress to go along with it.

The plan includes one year of funding for six of the seven agencies affected by this partial government shutdown. And funding through February 8th for the Department of Homeland Security. That includes $1.3 billion for border security, but not for a wall. Senator Schumer and the likely soon to be Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi just put out a statement saying, \"While President Trump drags the nation into week two of the Trump shutdown and sits in the White House and tweets without offering any plan that can pass both chambers of Congress, Democrats are taking action to lead our country out of this mess. But Republican Congressman Mark Meadows is already blasting the proposal by saying, it doesn't represent any serious attempt to secure our border or find a compromise. And Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said yesterday that no wall funding is a non-starter for President Trump."

What do you make of these two actually trying to come in, in the 11th hour, unlike former Vice President Joe Biden and Senate then-Majority Leader Mitch McConnell? These two literally don't see eye to eye on anything.

I'll tell you, I've just been astounded to how people have talked down the economy in the past three or four weeks trying to drive the one of the accomplishments out of Donald Trump's hands that he rightly has -- he rightly lays claim to, is that the economy has done well under his pro- growth agenda."

The officer's death once again fueling a national debate over California's sanctuary policies. I want to start with you, Jason. What is it going to take for Democratic leadership to see the need for more money to secure our borders, to prevent these deaths and others?"

We are willing to put up money even for border security.  We just don't think a wall is effective. We've seen that first of all, it won't stop the flow of drugs, there are eminent and domain issues. And there are environmental issues and there are better ways to secure our borders. We know that most people come through in ports of entry. We know that, that is the main way, way that people come through. There are other ways that we can secure our borders. $300 million for scanners would make a big difference in terms of human trafficking and many of the other issues that face us on the border."

In fact, human smugglers will give a discount to people coming over the border illegally if they bring a child because they know they're more likely to be able to stay. This is absolutely not a compassionate policy. What I will say is despite the need for a wall, 56 percent of Americans oppose the idea of a wall.  So, in this case, you know, our guess is right. You know, the people don't like the idea of a wall. So, I think what President Trump and some of his other spokespeople have been trying to do is explain, what he means by a wall. He means metal slats, he means, you know, technology on. Maybe what the president needs to do is stop talking about just a wall."

You know what, nobody else has other than him is an Oval Office. For the life of me, I cannot understand why he didn't take time (INAUDIBLE) wall. She will -- Nancy Pelosi was in Hawaii. And while he was in Washington, D.C. and canceled all of his plans for Christmas and New Year's, why didn't hold an office -- Oval Office, you know, address to the nation on all the other networks including ours, and explain and frame this issue.

The president also seized done on the case of border security, a tougher call for that after this California police officer died at the hands of an illegal immigrant.

This was preventable.  Sanctuary cities do nothing but protect criminals. They actually don't help -- even illegal immigrants, I know that the Democrats like to say that, \"Oh, this will help them report crimes.\" It doesn't. That's just cover for them. Sanctuary cities help no one and absolutely the death of this American hero, Officer Singh, is on the hands of those who support this ridiculous policy, which by the way outside the California, nobody thinks this is makes any sense.

If they feel that their immigration status will be called into question, is a real fear there's a situation in Maryland where we had women who were being sexually assaulted but were afraid to come forward because they thought that they and their friends and partners, and families will be -- would be --"

She was a Republican all the way through the 90s because she believed in the free market economy and then thought that the Republican Party wasn't supporting that. She then made a career, left the classroom out of taking big banks to task for all of the rules that they were violating and hurting Main Street. I think in terms of where she falls in the Democratic Party primary hierarchy, I think right now she's leading towards the top. There's no question that she had a terrible blunder with the release of the DNA results. I think that unfortunately was answering a lot of noise and I don't think that you can get back at President Trump by bullying him. The best way to negate a bully is to ignore him and she didn't do that, but I think that she has a lot of really important issues to contribute to the Democratic primary and the earlier we start to talk about those issues the better we'll be."

I hope she does win because this is someone who's enjoying the luxuries of capitalism in her $1.9 million three-story mansion in Cambridge while talking about another economic system socialism that has decimated the middle class in Venezuela, decimated the middle class in Cuba, and all across the world where this experiment is tried.  It's not going to win a national election and President Trump will prosecute that case effectively on the national stage should she win."

Thank you very much for coming on this New Year. It's a rainy New Year's Eve here. Let me start with you Bryan. You know Mattis officially leaves his post at 11:59 p.m. tonight. He walks away amidst a controversial decision to pull all U.S. troops out of Syria, a decision he felt strongly against. What do you believe will be the new U.S. policy going forward in Syria as we head into 2019?"

The second is to create a degree of stability such that we can get those refugees that are spread throughout the Middle East, in particular Europe, back into Damascus, back into Syria.  And then the third and final goal for the President politically is to show and demonstrate, look, I promise to you all that I would bring the troops home and I'm doing it. And we're going to spend the money not over there but here. So I think that you're going to see those three themes become very large in the president's rhetoric."

      "speaker": "BANDERAS",

He actually issued a statement denouncing the move as \"an Obama-like mistake made by the Trump administration. And then this weekend the senator had a change of heart after meeting at the White House and later telling reporters the President told me some things I didn't know that made me feel a lot better about where we're headed in Syria. What do you think explains Graham's newfound optimism out about President Trump's plan to leave Syria and could the President be changing his stance?"

      "speaker": "CHARLIE HURT, THE WASHINGTON TIMES OPINION EDITOR",
      "utterance": "Well, clearly, Senator Graham heard something in that lunch that made him feel comfortable that the President took very seriously these concerns about the allies that have been working alongside the United States in Syria and also the seriousness that that ISIS could still in the future pose. I have to say just, as an aside, I find this sort of openness that you've seen from Lindsey Graham and the President, a refreshing change in Washington where people really do people in the same party are free to step out and have an open, robust argument about something like this and minds change with the argument and with debate, which I think is a very, very healthy thing. That has not existed in Washington in a very, very long time, because it's so constricted by partisan lines. But the big picture when you step back - the problem with Syria is not that the President withdrew too quickly, the problem with Syria is that we never had an open debate about why we were in Syria in the first place. Congress never voted on it. And the reason that President Obama never went to Congress to get a vote to go into Syria, is because he knew he could never get Congress to go along with it. And if congress isn't going to go along with some military intrusion like this, then should we really be doing it, probably not."

Push the President to potentially maybe compromise on the situation, because that's we know James Mattis was very much against, this Syria pullout and that ultimately is what led to his resignation and then his expedited exit from the White House after he voiced his concerns publicly. And the President said, you know what, your last day is January not February. It's something about Lindsey Graham, though, that I think had a huge - huge impact on President Trump, and I wonder what that was exactly?"

      "speaker": "WRIGHT",
      "utterance": "Well my guess he had a series of briefings from people, not only like Lindsey Graham, but when he was in Iraq talking with some of the generals, also talking with Gina Haspel, Head of the CIA. I think all those folks together probably delivered a message of, look we stand beside you. We want to draw these troops down. We need to protect the Kurds. But the ISIS threat is real. If they have not been defeated, they have been degraded. So what is the best path forward to do that? We need to maintain those informant networks, slowly pull out of Syria, ensure that the Turks pick up the slack. And then we can continue to move forward on our two big strategic goals, of also defeating ISIS, degrading ISIS and creating stability."

If Donald Trump is a racist, first of all, how come no one thought that, all many years that he was the toast of the town in New York for people of all races and all of the liberals? Secondly, if he is a racist and he is to be more for people of color and their jobs and their income than any other President has done, I just have to agree that real politics was right. He has terrible as a racist. He is a failure as a racist, because he is really doing things that are lifting up people of color like no one else ever has."

More Americans are now employed than ever recorded before in our history. More than 400,000 manufacturing jobs created since election. New unemployment claims recently hit a 49 year low.

And when the President moved it this year, I asked him, I said, \"What was the turning point?\" He said, real simply - just kind of shudder the shoulders and said, \"Well, number one, I promised I would do it. And number two, it's the right thing to do\". I found that so refreshing that he didn't listen to all the political advice that told him to not do it and he did it.

The revelers are standing behind these gates, and they're the gates are at the subway. So you don't have people coming in and out of entrances, so you don't know where they're coming. The guards, obviously, the number people that are wearing uniforms and who are not wearing uniforms.
