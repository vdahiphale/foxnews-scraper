He says that things were misunderstood, mischaracterized, and he believes that this begins a new chapter in his life, and it closes a two-plus-year chapter of investigations. He will not be charged. The former acting director of the FBI -- remember, he came in after Comey was fired -- he's accused of leaking sensitive information to a reporter from The Wall Street Journal about an investigation into the Hillary Clinton Foundation, then lying about that to investigators.  The Justice Department's inspector general looked into the McCabe situation and agreed that he -- quote -- \"lacked candor,\" but, ultimately, they decided not to charge him.   Here he is earlier this afternoon reacting to the news that he will not be charged by DOJ. Listen.",

But when it comes to McCabe, it really has been crickets around here, no reaction for the president, no reaction from his campaign, no reaction from any of the staff at the White House. They are keeping this close to the vest. That could change in the next few minutes. But don't forget that the attorney general, Bill Barr, very publicly admonished the president yesterday not to be tweeting or commenting in other forums about cases that are currently before the Department of Justice, the attorney general saying it makes it impossible for him to do his job.  But don't forget, for the past couple of years, the president has been very vocal about his belief that Andrew McCabe belongs in jail. It may be difficult for the president to resist saying something about this, though, because now the DOJ has actually washed its hands of it.  And earlier today, McCabe accused the president of using the Justice Department to carry out a political vendetta. Listen here.",

I mean, one, in terms of the Flynn situation, what's really interesting there is, it's starting to shadow what happened in the Ted Stevens case, if you go back a few years. You have got Judge Emmet Sullivan. You have got a defense attorney, new round of defense attorneys coming in and saying there's something wrong with the plea, which is usually a nonstarter. Withdrawing a guilty plea usually doesn't go very far. But now you add in a wrinkle of an independent counsel looking at that whole process. So I was a bit of a naysayer when it came to Flynn being able to withdraw his plea, but I don't think I can make a bet on that now. In terms of Mr. McCabe, I have to say, I mean, look, not everything in life that's wrong ends up with a criminal prosecution. And it's really kind of fascinating to have a guy who was at the center of all of these decisions by Comey to have false statement prosecutions if you're connected with Trump, but to not have false statement prosecutions if you're connected with Hillary Clinton, to be in -- himself in the middle of all that.   I think he had two very good lawyers, very good picks for lawyers in terms of a former I.G. with Mike Bromwich and a talented ex-AUSA from D.C., David Schertler, that probably spent a good part of that two years pushing hard on the U.S. attorney's office with the equities and why the case shouldn't be prosecuted.  But it's real early for him to have a parade for himself and to suggests that somehow he's now a victim, when the I.G. said he lied over and over again.",

So that tells me that this thing does have some life. Again, normally, withdrawing a guilty plea is essentially insulting the judge. It's telling the judge, you did something wrong when you found that my guilty plea was knowing intelligent and voluntary, but so far, Just Sullivan seems like he's tolerating a lot of litigation this or at least potential litigation. So I think it's a crapshoot.

During the -- early in the campaign, when he was the front-runner, Joe Biden at Jim Chanos, he's a financier's home raised $500,000. That was the biggest draw yet. And people thought a lot more would come in. Last night, at two fund-raisers, he barely got $800,000, sources are telling the FOX Business Network. Now, while that is not chump change, it's not what they were expecting. And, clearly, what we have now is a campaign that's in trouble, both in polls, as you know, Neil, and also in the money race. If they don't do well in South Carolina and Nevada, this race is essentially over, not just because of the polls, Neil, but because of money. They won't have a -- they probably -- they might not have enough money to get through Super Tuesday. So that's where he is right now. And because of this, Neil, what we understand, what sources are telling us -- these are -- and these are Democratic Party sources. They're close to Mr. Biden. They would vote for him, they would give him money. A lot of them are telling us they think that he should have possibly step down sooner. We interviewed Leon Cooperman, a longtime financier, independent, but has been -- voted for Democrats in the past, didn't like Barack Obama, I should point out. But he'd be the type of person that would vote for Biden. He's throwing his hat in the ring for Mike Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor. He's saying he's the guy with the money and the firepower and the message to beat -- to win the nomination and to beat Donald Trump.  As you know, FOX Business was first to report, my producer, Lydia Moynihan, who did great work both on getting the Cooperman interview, which is on FOXBusiness.com, and this number, $2 billion. We have learned that he's willing to spend $2 billion. We were the first to report that. Cooperman believes that type of money is the type of money that someone who could beat Donald Trump, who will raise about $1.5 billion. So we're talking about a lot of billions here. The problem is, is that Joe Biden doesn't have a lot of those billions and maybe won't.",

Mike Bloomberg seems to have the money and all to get the clout, to get the commercials and rise in the polls, including in one that features him leading in that delegate-rich state we call Florida, and not only there. He is surging in national polls as well. What to make of that Bloomberg threat with New York City Councilman Joe Borelli, The Wall Street Journal's Jillian Melchior, and, of course, the Democratic strategist Robert Patillo. Robert, end it with you. This notion that maybe we're seeing a shift in favorites, it's always premature to go in a moment and assume a candidate is finished. They said the same about Bill Clinton for a while when he was losing a string of primaries kind of at this stage. They said the same about John McCain ahead of New Hampshire, when he eked a victory, so, again, kind of at this stage, so be careful.

Joe Biden has a very clear strategy, the same strategy he's had since the beginning, do well in South Carolina, go through Super Tuesday, where you have states that are diverse that really represent the Democratic Party, and then have a delegate fight on through the primary. So let's understand, Buttigieg doesn't have a path to victory after New Hampshire. Elizabeth Warren's campaign has cratered and she's coming in third and fourth place in states she should be strong in. Amy Klobuchar has not picked up national momentum. Joe Biden is still the front-runner in this race, despite losing the first two primaries. So I think all the hyperbole in the 24-hour news cycle and the new shiny object of Mike Bloomberg is taking the idea away from that. But let's understand, Joe Biden's held strong at the top of the polls for over a year, since he entered the race. And I don't think that you're going to see the base of the Democratic Party jump ship. Let's wait for actual voting to start, not just the two early primary states.",

Obviously, he's staking his Waterloo on South Carolina, but Super Tuesday, just a couple of days later, there are two delegate-rich states, California and Texas. He is not leading in either of those. In North Carolina, the third largest state on that day, he's also plummeting in the polls. So this is not a good position for someone who was billed as the Democratic primary front-runner to be in.

So, what Joe Biden has to do is get out of the shadow of impeachment, get out of the shadow of Hunter Biden, a year-long attack on his campaign and on his record, and remind voters exactly what he stands for and the normalcy that he's trying to bring America back to.

But when it comes to McCabe, it really has been crickets around here, no reaction for the president, no reaction from his campaign, no reaction from any of the staff at the White House. They are keeping this close to the vest. That could change in the next few minutes. But don't forget that the attorney general, Bill Barr, very publicly admonished the president yesterday not to be tweeting or commenting in other forums about cases that are currently before the Department of Justice, the attorney general saying it makes it impossible for him to do his job. But don't forget, for the past couple of years, the president has been very vocal about his belief that Andrew McCabe belongs in jail. It may be difficult for the president to resist saying something about this, though, because now the DOJ has actually washed its hands of it.

    {
      "speaker": "TRUSTY",
      "utterance": "But, look, there's a couple of things. I mean, one, in terms of the Flynn situation, what's really interesting there is, it's starting to shadow what happened in the Ted Stevens case, if you go back a few years. You have got Judge Emmet Sullivan. You have got a defense attorney, new round of defense attorneys coming in and saying there's something wrong with the plea, which is usually a nonstarter. Withdrawing a guilty plea usually doesn't go very far. But now you add in a wrinkle of an independent counsel looking at that whole process. So I was a bit of a naysayer when it came to Flynn being able to withdraw his plea, but I don't think I can make a bet on that now. In terms of Mr. McCabe, I have to say, I mean, look, not everything in life that's wrong ends up with a criminal prosecution. And it's really kind of fascinating to have a guy who was at the center of all of these decisions by Comey to have false statement prosecutions if you're connected with Trump, but to not have false statement prosecutions if you're connected with Hillary Clinton, to be in -- himself in the middle of all that. I think he had two very good lawyers, very good picks for lawyers in terms of a former I.G. with Mike Bromwich and a talented ex-AUSA from D.C., David Schertler, that probably spent a good part of that two years pushing hard on the U.S. attorney's office with the equities and why the case shouldn't be prosecuted. But it's real early for him to have a parade for himself and to suggests that somehow he's now a victim, when the I.G. said he lied over and over again."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

      "speaker": "TRUSTY",
      "utterance": "It's -- I'll tell you, I wouldn't have predicted it would get to the point where there's another lawyer, another U.S. attorney looking into the conduct. So that tells me that this thing does have some life. Again, normally, withdrawing a guilty plea is essentially insulting the judge. It's telling the judge, you did something wrong when you found that my guilty plea was knowing intelligent and voluntary, but so far, Just Sullivan seems like he's tolerating a lot of litigation this or at least potential litigation. So I think it's a crapshoot. I think this thing could really blow up into something much different than you would expect from what would normally just be a false statement plea and sentencing, which could be pretty routine."

      "utterance": "Well, maybe that's why he only raised $800,000. I mean, let's be really clear here. During the -- early in the campaign, when he was the front-runner, Joe Biden at Jim Chanos, he's a financier's home raised $500,000. That was the biggest draw yet. And people thought a lot more would come in. Last night, at two fund-raisers, he barely got $800,000, sources are telling the FOX Business Network. Now, while that is not chump change, it's not what they were expecting. And, clearly, what we have now is a campaign that's in trouble, both in polls, as you know, Neil, and also in the money race. If they don't do well in South Carolina and Nevada, this race is essentially over, not just because of the polls, Neil, but because of money. They won't have a -- they probably -- they might not have enough money to get through Super Tuesday. So that's where he is right now. And because of this, Neil, what we understand, what sources are telling us -- these are -- and these are Democratic Party sources. They're close to Mr. Biden. They would vote for him, they would give him money. A lot of them are telling us they think that he should have possibly step down sooner. We interviewed Leon Cooperman, a longtime financier, independent, but has been -- voted for Democrats in the past, didn't like Barack Obama, I should point out. But he'd be the type of person that would vote for Biden. He's throwing his hat in the ring for Mike Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor. He's saying he's the guy with the money and the firepower and the message to beat -- to win the nomination and to beat Donald Trump. As you know, FOX Business was first to report, my producer, Lydia Moynihan, who did great work both on getting the Cooperman interview, which is on FOXBusiness.com, and this number, $2 billion. We have learned that he's willing to spend $2 billion. We were the first to report that. Cooperman believes that type of money is the type of money that someone who could beat Donald Trump, who will raise about $1.5 billion. So we're talking about a lot of billions here. The problem is, is that Joe Biden doesn't have a lot of those billions and maybe won't."

    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, we shall see, my friend. Thank you. Very good reporting, and on Lydia as well. So here's where we stand right now. Mike Bloomberg seems to have the money and all to get the clout, to get the commercials and rise in the polls, including in one that features him leading in that delegate-rich state we call Florida, and not only there. He is surging in national polls as well. What to make of that Bloomberg threat with New York City Councilman Joe Borelli, The Wall Street Journal's Jillian Melchior, and, of course, the Democratic strategist Robert Patillo. Robert, end it with you. This notion that maybe we're seeing a shift in favorites, it's always premature to go in a moment and assume a candidate is finished. They said the same about Bill Clinton for a while when he was losing a string of primaries kind of at this stage. They said the same about John McCain ahead of New Hampshire, when he eked a victory, so, again, kind of at this stage, so be careful. But, having said that, are you hearing from colleagues they're worried about Biden?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROBERT PATILLO, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST",
      "utterance": "No, not yet. Let's understand that Bernie Sanders has 21 delegates out of the 2,000 delegates you need to win. Joe Biden has a very clear strategy, the same strategy he's had since the beginning, do well in South Carolina, go through Super Tuesday, where you have states that are diverse that really represent the Democratic Party, and then have a delegate fight on through the primary. So let's understand, Buttigieg doesn't have a path to victory after New Hampshire. Elizabeth Warren's campaign has cratered and she's coming in third and fourth place in states she should be strong in. Amy Klobuchar has not picked up national momentum. Joe Biden is still the front-runner in this race, despite losing the first two primaries. So I think all the hyperbole in the 24-hour news cycle and the new shiny object of Mike Bloomberg is taking the idea away from that. But let's understand, Joe Biden's held strong at the top of the polls for over a year, since he entered the race. And I don't think that you're going to see the base of the Democratic Party jump ship. Let's wait for actual voting to start, not just the two early primary states."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, fair enough. Joe Borelli, at this stage of the race, I mean, a lot of folks were saying there was no way, even with his New Hampshire victory, that Donald Trump could ever get the nomination, that he would peter out by then. So maybe that is a good reminder from Robert. What do you think?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JOE BORELLI (R), NEW YORK CITY COUNCIL",
      "utterance": "Look, I'm certainly not complacent against any one of the candidates. But look at how far the story arc of Joe Biden went. I mean, we just heard that he was leading in the polls for a year. That's true, except today, when it counts. I mean, Super Tuesday is going to be a big test for him. Obviously, he's staking his Waterloo on South Carolina, but Super Tuesday, just a couple of days later, there are two delegate-rich states, California and Texas. He is not leading in either of those. In North Carolina, the third largest state on that day, he's also plummeting in the polls. So this is not a good position for someone who was billed as the Democratic primary front-runner to be in. And I would be surprised if he's able to go the distance, given the paucity in his fund-raising over the past two weeks or three weeks."

He didn't opt to stop and talk to reporters. But I'm wondering, with all these other developments, and the division among the Democrats, whether the president then does or should heed the advice of Republicans, who, when it comes to his tweets on the Justice Department and cases pending or not pending, just not say anything? Because the only one who could lose this for Donald Trump, they say, is Donald Trump. What do you think?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JILLIAN MELCHIOR, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL",
      "utterance": "Yes, he's certainly his own worst enemy. I mean, you're coming off of the impeachment. You're coming off of Iowa, Democrats in disarray. And still, I think it's one of those situations where, if you just step back a little bit, Democrats are going to make themselves continue to look bad. But he's got to be in the spotlight. That's something that we have usually seen. But I want to push back on this idea that Joe Biden is the front-runner. I have never heard of a front-runner that's not in front. So I think I think it's an unusual case to be making after what we saw in Iowa and New Hampshire. He's really got his work cut out for him. But I do think that that leaves a moderate-sized hole in this Democratic primary race. And I'm just not sure who's going to fill it. Bloomberg is pushing very hard to fill it. But the energy and the momentum within this party right now is on the hard left. And I think the central argument for Biden all along has been his electability. We have seen so far in New Hampshire and Iowa that voters aren't turning out to support him. So I think that gets at one of the central claims of his candidacy."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "I guess it all comes down -- and, Robert, you reminded me of this -- of the African-American vote and how it sorts out. South Carolina will be a test of that, as will the union vote, particularly in a place like Nevada, will have a caucus next week. I'm just wondering, what could be the game-changer for Biden? Or who else emerges in that gap? I mean, that criticism of party regulars is that you will never see Sanders pick up that kind of support. So, open convention. What do you say?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PATILLO",
      "utterance": "Well, I think we have to understand, even in a state like Iowa, where Bernie Sanders was supposed to do well, 70 percent of caucus-goers voted against Bernie Sanders. In a state like New Hampshire, which borders Vermont, where he won all counties in 2016, 72 percent of voters voted against Bernie Sanders there. So, what Joe Biden has to do is get out of the shadow of impeachment, get out of the shadow of Hunter Biden, a year-long attack on his campaign and on his record, and remind voters exactly what he stands for and the normalcy that he's trying to bring America back to. This -- and I think Bloomberg is doing well right now because he is unvetted. He's running commercials. No one has asked him questions. Nobody talks about his policy initiatives. Nobody has actually gotten down into the nitty-gritty with him."

They wouldn't. And his daughter was dead. And he was furious. And he was a dad looking to avoid this in the future. He has devoted his life to that and much more in memory of his beautiful girl.

They opened a Web site, SchoolSafety.org, where they list over 100 recommendations and best practices on school safety. But what I have learned over the last year, Neil, it (INAUDIBLE) locally. The president can't fix anything for you at a local level with the local school board. The school board dictates their policies and their own budget, and they're going to do whatever they want with that money, and they're going to -- they don't have to follow any federal guidelines. So it's really up to parents, locally, to get involved at a local level and make changes. Don't look for your governor or your senator or the president. It's really up to the parents. They dictate, and they're responsible where they put their children in school."

      "utterance": "Well, what happens is, when the last and certain people hijack school safety, and all they look at is gun control, it really distracts from what we could really do as a country, and that's make our schools safe. And that's what I -- that's what I work on day in and day out with different that -- with different initiatives to make our schools safer. And when you look at just gun control, it doesn't work. So, in Florida, they are looking at legislation to put different type of situations in the hands of law enforcement and take it away from the school district. Like restorative justice programs that are practiced in a lot of these school districts, still in Broward, I feel law enforcement should be involved with the restorative justice programs, and they are making leeway. But it's on the parents. The parents have to pressure their school districts locally."

We do know that it spread -- it can be spread person to person through upper respiratory droplets. We know the symptoms it causes. But in terms of how long it remains infectious, how long it's going to last and things like that, there's still a lot of other things that we don't know. I should say, Neil, this is one of the reasons why, in today's press conference from the CDC, they talked about really focusing on surveillance and containment. That is, taking a look even closer at the virus, so we can understand its patterns and help us better understand maybe what we can predict in the future, especially here in this country."

      "utterance": "But I think, given the apportionment that they have for delegates -- you get 50 percent, you get a share the delegates -- and given the crowd we have in there and the back-and-forth, it is distinctly possible that you arrive at the convention without someone having anywhere near what they would need on a first ballot. Now, I know others have come in to a convention with a healthy lead in delegates. Barack Obama had that. I guess John Kennedy had it. But they can't close the deal until the voting starts. So would they reward Bernie Sanders if he simply had the most delegates going in?"
    },

      "speaker": "GOODWIN",
      "utterance": "I think if they don't have a majority when you get into that convention, which is unlikely in these later years, because usually you do, then I think anything's possible. You know what I keep thinking of? There was a convention in 1924, when there was a big split between two people, Al Smith and McAdoo. It went on for more than 16 days almost and 103 ballots. And, finally, neither one got the numbers that they needed. So a complete other person, John Davis, wins. So who knows? I mean, I suppose all of us who love politics are looking for that."

    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

I don't know what would happen here, but they have got to leave united or appearing united. Can they?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GOODWIN",

I mean, I think that's unlikely if the Democrats don't -- don't really get a majority somewhere along the line in some of these states, and a landslide happens.

It's your sense of dignity, you go to work during the day, you feel a sense of the possibility of the future. The question is whether or not one can argue that, even if the economy has more jobs than it did before, many of those jobs are not paying higher wages, that people are still struggling from paycheck to paycheck, that health care is a problem."

I mean, the only time that -- like, in 1966, in the midterm elections, for LBJ, the economy was going very well still, but people lost their credibility in him, and the Vietnam War was heating up, and they lost those midterms. But that's unusual when it happens. So we will have to see. But I still say that things are so jittery in this country right now. Things change. Breaking news happens. Something could happen between now and then. There could be a foreign policy event that either goes for or against him."

      "utterance": "Well, polls show yes, whether people are telling the truth or not. I mean, that's the interesting thing. When we worry about where we have come as a nation in terms of social justice and economic justice, overwhelming majority of the polls say, yes, we'd have a black American, yes, we'd have a woman. We have got 90 percent that say yes. And I think it's like 78 or 80 percent that say, yes, we would take a gay man. So I don't know how that will play out. I think the more troubling thing is whether or not people will feel he has enough experience from South Bend, Indiana, in a small city."

What kind of experience have they shown? Have they grown in power? Do they acknowledge their errors? Have they grown in office and learned from their mistakes? We should be looking back at the kind of leaders they were. I'd love to know much more about what kind of a mayor he was, what kind of a governor such and such was. What kind of a senator was Sanders? How much legislation did he get passed? We don't talk about these things. We're caught with who zings who in a debate, who raises the most money.

Interesting to see if that holds up, then Elizabeth Warren and the rest. The union vote may be decisive here. Neil. The powerful Culinary Union hasn't endorsed any one candidate. So all of them are out there trying to get union members to vote for them. Senator Amy Klobuchar, for instance, was at a union-run health care center today. She said, I'm basically running because of the unions. That's the message they're all sending, caucus day, February 22, Neil."
