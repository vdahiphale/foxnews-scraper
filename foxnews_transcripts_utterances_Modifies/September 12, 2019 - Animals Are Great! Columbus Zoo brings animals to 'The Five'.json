It's unclear at this moment what those charges might be, but here's what we do know. McCabe was fired right before his retirement in 2019. It happened after the Justice Department inspector general found he authorized a media leak about an investigation into the Clinton foundation. The I.G. determined that McCabe did not tell the truth about what happened.  Jesse, you know, obviously, McCabe has been targeted by President Trump for a lot of, you know, nastiness. What do you think this means for Andrew McCabe right now?",

And if anyone takes a picture, they can just mysteriously die in a prison suicide. Just look at her. And you thought Bill was the exhibitionist in the family. Thank God they didn't turn his most memorable office moment into art. So, I hope she got paid and it better be a cool 10 million, because nothing less would get me to humiliate myself like that. And believe me I know humiliation. Speaking to the bill. Where the hell is Bill. He's the real winner here as long as she's paid to sit there for hours. He'll be haunting the Venice version of Hooters. But it's sad. She should be enjoying her best life, not reliving the worst moments in front of strangers. But she can't let go of the past or apparently the paycheck. As the curator admits the exhibition is a way to allude to an alternative world that will never exist. The bright side. It never will.

It's unclear at this moment what those charges might be, but here's what we do know. McCabe was fired right before his retirement in 2019. It happened after the Justice Department inspector general found he authorized a media leak about an investigation into the Clinton foundation. The I.G. determined that McCabe did not tell the truth about what happened. Jesse, you know, obviously, McCabe has been targeted by President Trump for a lot of, you know, nastiness.

But let's also remember this, he tried to take the president out, they hatched the insurance plot in his office, and when the president caught wind to that insurance policy and fired his boss, Comey, then McCabe comes along and wants people wearing wires and wants people getting Trump out of office undemocratically. And that's what this is about. This is the reason why Trump was elected in the first place. People want to see justice in this country. Smollett walks away. Hillary walks away. No one gets locked up after the financial crash. They want to see justice applied equally. So, I hope that he pays a price for this. Not only him, all the other people in the Cabal."

Comey, there you go. Obscurity, how can I say that? But remember also for McCabe, think about all the people that donated to his legal defense fund. I mean, a lot of people donated a ton of money. He got a big book deal. He got a big CNN contract. Like the guy is basically -- he set himself up to try to fight fire with fire, but when a grand jury gets recalled, that doesn't sound good."

But Andrew McCabe is being referred not just by the I.G., but look into by the U.S. attorney because he lied to federal investigators, inspector general investigators, and FBI agents under oath three times.

The guy with all the accoutrements does -- the difference between a driver of a basic Jetta and a driver who dresses it up with fancy spoilers and stripe. One is a responsible driver, the other advertises his own recklessness. So if we don't want to touch the powerful nature of a gun, why can't we address the cosmetic appeal, which tends to attract a certain kind of guy, a white, lonely male who poses and fantasizes in front of a mirror.

Check out these pictures of her spending an hour, leafing through her emails as part of an art exhibit in Venice. Venice, Italy, not Venice, California. I have a sneaking suspicion; she wasn't going to do this in a Southern California mall next to an anti-Ms. No, she's off to Europe where they don't have cameras or the Internet, so no one will surely see this. And if anyone takes a picture, they can just mysteriously die in a prison suicide. Just look at her. And you thought Bill was the exhibitionist in the family. Thank God they didn't turn his most memorable office moment into art. So, I hope she got paid and it better be a cool 10 million, because nothing less would get me to humiliate myself like that. And believe me I know humiliation. Speaking to the bill. Where the hell is Bill. He's the real winner here as long as she's paid to sit there for hours. He'll be haunting the Venice version of Hooters. But it's sad. She should be enjoying her best life, not reliving the worst moments in front of strangers. But she can't let go of the past or apparently the paycheck. As the curator admits the exhibition is a way to allude to an alternative world that will never exist. The bright side. It never will. So, Juan I think she did this for me, she knew it was my birthday, she knew this would make me happy. Now, are you going to do something for me for my birthday as well that will match that?"
