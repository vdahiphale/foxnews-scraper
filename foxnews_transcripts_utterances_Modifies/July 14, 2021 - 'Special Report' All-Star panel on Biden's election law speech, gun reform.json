When you compare that kind of hyperbole and dishonesty with what we heard from President Biden today, I guess I think it's no contest. We are living a nightmare in this country that I have seen in my career in the past in Latin America when former presidents refuse to accept the verdict of people and go around creating mischief and subverting the system for years after their terms are over.

BEN DOMENECH, PUBLISHER, \"THE FEDERALIST\": I have to disagree with Chuck on this. I don't think that this is actually connected to what the president was saying, the former president was saying about the election process directly so much as it was how much the former president did well among black and Hispanic voters in the last election. There's very much a need on the part of Democratic politicians to reassert a dominance within that demographic when it comes to the voting populous going forward. If you talk to Democratic consultants, they are scared about what numbers they saw, the increases of support for Republicans among black males and among Hispanic females in particular. It really does put a lie to this whole concept of demography is destiny. And so they're seizing on this as something to try to foment racial animosity in a, I think, very dangerous way. I agree with Chuck about the level of danger here, that I think is going to create all sorts of animosity in ways that is going to drive up the stakes in this upcoming midterm elections and is going to create all manner of distrust in the process going forward.
