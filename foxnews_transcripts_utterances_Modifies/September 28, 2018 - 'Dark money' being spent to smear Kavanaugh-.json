Now, you can probably imagine I'm not really wild about this delay. But I'm trying to look at this as optimistically as possible tonight. And this might actually turn out to be a good thing, and here's why. It may just end up giving those fence sitters, Flake, Murkowski, Manchin, Collins and others cover to vote for Kavanaugh's confirmation. They probably want to vote for him, but with this question of why not the FBI investigation, they had a reason to sit back.  But -- and this is very important -- if you think this is going to be the end of all the charades and the stunts that we've seen from the Democrats, think again. Now, just as a reminder, this is what they were saying about Judge Kavanaugh before the still-uncorroborated allegations emerged.",

Now, the media didn't just discover Ford's whereabouts by accident forcing her into the open, OK. That was the plan from the beginning. Then in the form of a Ronan Farrow and Jane Mayer piece -- we were expecting big things from that. They proffered another pathetically sourced non-corroborated account. This one alleged that Kavanaugh exposed himself at a college party even though the alleged victim herself is not sure that Kavanaugh was actually the one who exposed himself. But that didn't stop Chris Cuomo and Rachel Maddow from hosting the man peddling this tale (inaudible) Michael Avenatti with this absurd claim of Kavanaugh and gang rape crew stalking the D.C. suburbs.   Then of course, the night before yesterday's testimony, NBC trumpeted this breaking news, a fourth accuser, an anonymous person who sent a letter to a senator's office with no address, no names, nothing.

I'm going to implicate him in crimes\" and money pours into this account as his attorney flogs the internet site for donations. And we're seeing that now more and more, where people essentially invest in key witnesses, so that they become part of this legal process by making it more likely that folks are going to not only take a certain approach in testimony, but they essentially are competing against each other in this market. You're going to get more donations than you are --.",

      "sentences": "Laura, great to see you. New tonight, the FBI has actually started work on this new background check. The president tweeting a few moments ago that this will now be the seventh background check for Judge Brett Kavanaugh in recent years. There is some risk this time because remember, the judge yesterday testified himself that every day feels like an eternity for he and his family. So this could open the door, this delay, to more salacious and unverified allegations coming up. But on the plus side for the president and for Kavanaugh, this could lock in some yes votes from four or five key moderates in both parties and eventually get him confirmed. The big caveat of course is Kavanaugh could be confirmed as long as the FBI does not find evidence to corroborate Dr. Ford's allegations. At the urging of Republican Jeff Flake, the committee has now moved forward. They ask the president to do this. The president did order this new background investigation, but here's the key when you ask about the scope. The committee says it is, \"limited to current credible allegations that must be completed one week from today.\" That would suggest just the Dr. Ford allegations, which are current and which have been deemed credible even by the president, except that this does not seem to be good enough for Dr. Ford's attorney, Debra Katz, who tonight released a statement praising the Senate for agreeing to what she called a thorough FBI investigation. But then added, \"no artificial limits as to time or scope should be imposed on this investigation,\" suggesting that, yes, the Ford camp might want to delay this some more, except of course her team does not run the Senate and this FBI probe could be moving quickly as we noted at the top. Kavanaugh's friend, Mark Judge, has sent a new letter to the Justice Department tonight saying that, in fact, he saw nothing and doesn't in fact remember anything happening in the early 1980's, nothing like Dr. Ford testified to. At least five key moderates say they back this one-week investigation. So if the president does move forward with all of this and the FBI finds nothing, Kavanaugh would not be guaranteed to get these votes, but would likely get the backing moderate Republicans like Flake, Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski Democrat Heidi Heitkamp and Joe Manchin who all said they support this one week FBI investigation.  It's brokered by Flake and Democrat Chris Coons in that ante room of the Senate judiciary panel as they were about to vote on the nomination. This allowed the committee to report it out of committee with a favorable 11-10 vote, but then the pause. Listen.",

What it really is, it creates this -- they've thrown the rule book out the window, the Democrats. And I think they're going to pay dearly for that in the long run."

The site just indicates that it was \"sponsored by her neighbors and colleagues.\" And isn't it fair to ask with another long week in front of us, has this GoFundMe created a new incentive for accusers, and are we witnessing a new president involving major financial rewards for people who makes such claims. To answer these questions, let's bring in constitutional law expert, Fox News contributor Jonathan Turley. Jonathan, what's your reaction? The GoFundMe page first, is there an incentive issue here that should be concerning? Also with the swarmers in the senate. They apparently got Jeff Flake to, you know, put on a pair of depends and like we're unto Coons 20 minutes later. So, are we creating bad incentives here?"

And as an attorney, it really struck me as quite odd because you can have people effectively in a market for witnesses. You can buy a witness effectively by funding them as long as they're saying the type of thing that you want them to say. So Michael Cohen goes out and says, \"I'm now, you know, out the get the president. I'm going to implicate him in crimes\" and money pours into this account as his attorney flogs the internet site for donations. And we're seeing that now more and more, where people essentially invest in key witnesses, so that they become part of this legal process by making it more likely that folks are going to not only take a certain approach in testimony, but they essentially are competing against each other in this market. You're going to get more donations than you are --."

    {
      "speaker": "ED HENRY, FOX NEWS CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Laura, great to see you. New tonight, the FBI has actually started work on this new background check. The president tweeting a few moments ago that this will now be the seventh background check for Judge Brett Kavanaugh in recent years. There is some risk this time because remember, the judge yesterday testified himself that every day feels like an eternity for he and his family. So this could open the door, this delay, to more salacious and unverified allegations coming up. But on the plus side for the president and for Kavanaugh, this could lock in some yes votes from four or five key moderates in both parties and eventually get him confirmed. The big caveat of course is Kavanaugh could be confirmed as long as the FBI does not find evidence to corroborate Dr. Ford's allegations. At the urging of Republican Jeff Flake, the committee has now moved forward. They ask the president to do this. The president did order this new background investigation, but here's the key when you ask about the scope. The committee says it is, \"limited to current credible allegations that must be completed one week from today.\" That would suggest just the Dr. Ford allegations, which are current and which have been deemed credible even by the president, except that this does not seem to be good enough for Dr. Ford's attorney, Debra Katz, who tonight released a statement praising the Senate for agreeing to what she called a thorough FBI investigation. But then added, \"no artificial limits as to time or scope should be imposed on this investigation,\" suggesting that, yes, the Ford camp might want to delay this some more, except of course her team does not run the Senate and this FBI probe could be moving quickly as we noted at the top. Kavanaugh's friend, Mark Judge, has sent a new letter to the Justice Department tonight saying that, in fact, he saw nothing and doesn't in fact remember anything happening in the early 1980's, nothing like Dr. Ford testified to. At least five key moderates say they back this one-week investigation. So if the president does move forward with all of this and the FBI finds nothing, Kavanaugh would not be guaranteed to get these votes, but would likely get the backing moderate Republicans like Flake, Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski Democrat Heidi Heitkamp and Joe Manchin who all said they support this one week FBI investigation. It's brokered by Flake and Democrat Chris Coons in that ante room of the Senate judiciary panel as they were about to vote on the nomination. This allowed the committee to report it out of committee with a favorable 11-10 vote, but then the pause. Listen."

And I will tell you, I'd grab that calendar and have that calendar examined to show this is credible or not. They can age date those things with the ink and the paper to see if it was written contemporaneously the way he said it was. That's very powerful evidence. His own calendar says a lot about where he was and where he was not. So all kinds of things like that can be done, and they will do it with a great deal of vigor. And they're going to come out with some answers here, and it may not support the allegations. I think it probably won't."

They're well-coordinated and extremely well- funded. America Rising, a Republican research group, has been diving into the latest anti-Kavanaugh efforts and found there is one particular bad actor behind many of the smears, former Hillary Clinton and Eric Holder staffer Brian Fallon. Joining us now is to navigate the web of anti-Kavanaugh dark money is the researcher who compiled this report, Alexandra Wilkes. And on set with me is former Clinton Adviser and pollster Mark Penn. Alexandra, give us a rundown of how this group, it's called Demand Justice, which is led by Fallon, is the tip of the anti-Kavanaugh spear."

The liberals have been leaving all kinds of breadcrumbs for us to trace. So as you mentioned, Brian Fallon founded Demand Justice. He was the face of the Hillary Clinton campaign. You saw him all over the 2016 effort. After that campaign wrapped up in the spring of 2018, he founded Demand Justice. And his goal was to defeat whoever President Trump decided to choose as his nominee for the Supreme Court. So, again, we're dealing with an organization that didn't even look to see what qualifications this person would have. They didn't care. They were going to defeat anyone. He goes to George Soros for some seed money. He gets it. And I'll let you jump in before I tell the next part of the story."

    {
      "speaker": "WILKES",
      "utterance": "So here's the thing. For as much as Democrats like to lament dark money, and by dark money we're talking about money that comes from 501-C4 organizations. These are contributions that are unlimited to these organizations and undisclosed. These groups were popularized by the great decision in Citizens United. So we're talking about Democrats who apparently deplore dark money, but they have set up not one level, not two levels, but three levels of secrecy in setting up this project. Demand Justice is a project of the 1630 Foundation. Those are both C4's. And it's partnered with Hillary Clinton's Onward C4 as well. That means that all of their filings are obscured within each other's tax returns and we can't see them."

We are here because a professor wrote a letter and Senator Feinstein wrongly held that letter. But that's really why we're here. And I think the public wants some certainty here. Real questions have been raised. Even President Trump says that the professor's testimony was credible. And I think probably Senator Flake did the right thing. Maybe this is supposed to just take a week. Maybe it will just confirm, maybe it will turn up something new.
