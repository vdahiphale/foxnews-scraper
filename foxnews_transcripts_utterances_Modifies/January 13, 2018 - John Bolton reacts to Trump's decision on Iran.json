The White House announced Friday that the president will again waive nuclear- related sanctions on Iran but will add economic sanctions on Iranian leaders and businesses for their support of terrorist groups across the Middle East, making clear that this will be the last waiver he'll issue, giving Congress and our European allies until May to modify the agreement.  John Bolton is the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and a Fox News contributor.  Ambassador, welcome.  JOHN BOLTON, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO THE U.S. & FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Glad to be here.",

Because the idea that Congress and Europe can somehow change the teal in a way that satisfies the president's concerns is simply not going to happen. There's a small complication here. Iran is part of the deal, and they have to agree to it. Believe me, they're not going to do it.",

But from the American perspective, I think the president has to say that this deal remains a strategic mistake for the United States, it was a bad deal when we entered into it, it's a bad deal today, we should get out of it. I think there's been far too much debate over whether Iran is in violation of the deal. Technically, I'd be happy to argue that point. But when George W. Bush withdrew from the 1972 treaty prohibiting national missile defense, he didn't do it because the Russians were violating that treaty. He did it because it was in our strategic interest to do it.

Congress can amend the Corker-Cardin legislation, which was a mistake to begin with, but we're negotiating with Congress. It'd actually be easier to negotiate with Iran. The fact is that as long as Iran can hold out economic prospects to the Europeans or others -- particularly Russia and China -- they'll continue along. They'd be happy to pin us with withdrawing from the deal.

      "utterance": "Welcome to the \"Journal Editorial Report.\" I'm Paul Gigot. The Trump administration keeping the Iran nuclear deal intact for now. The White House announced Friday that the president will again waive nuclear- related sanctions on Iran but will add economic sanctions on Iranian leaders and businesses for their support of terrorist groups across the Middle East, making clear that this will be the last waiver he'll issue, giving Congress and our European allies until May to modify the agreement. John Bolton is the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and a Fox News contributor. Ambassador, welcome. JOHN BOLTON, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO THE U.S. & FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Glad to be here."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "So the president said, I think his words today, this is the last chance. And nobody should doubt my word. That sounds like a red line to me."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOLTON",
      "utterance": "Sounds like a red line to me, too. You know, in a way this is not unusual. This deal is not a treaty, but in treaties often there's a provision for a 90-day or 180-day notice of withdrawal. That, in effect, is what he served today. Because the idea that Congress and Europe can somehow change the teal in a way that satisfies the president's concerns is simply not going to happen. There's a small complication here. Iran is part of the deal, and they have to agree to it. Believe me, they're not going to do it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "No. They've already said they're not going to have anything to do with the renegotiation. They'll be backed up by Russia and China, so the pressure will be on Europe to try to come to some accommodation with us. But I don't see them really being eager to do that, because they're doing a lot of business with -- their companies are doing a lot of business in Iran now."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOLTON",
      "utterance": "Well, precisely, and that was what the ayatollahs and the Obama administration understood when they were crafting this deal, that if they could entice Europe in particular into more trade and investment with Iran, it would make it much more difficult to terminate the deal. But from the American perspective, I think the president has to say that this deal remains a strategic mistake for the United States, it was a bad deal when we entered into it, it's a bad deal today, we should get out of it. I think there's been far too much debate over whether Iran is in violation of the deal. Technically, I'd be happy to argue that point. But when George W. Bush withdrew from the 1972 treaty prohibiting national missile defense, he didn't do it because the Russians were violating that treaty. He did it because it was in our strategic interest to do it. I think that's the point. Trump has to emphasize that and explain it more."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "Well, but if the Europeans do not come to some agreement with us, what happens then? What does the president do? I would argue he's now committed. He's got to pull the trigger on this, or his credibility will be shattered. He has to reimpose the sanctions or his credibility will be shattered over the next three years."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOLTON",
      "utterance": "Yes. Well, I think one reason the Europeans are so upset by the prospect of American sanctions coming back into force is that a lot of the technology and products they want to sell to Iran is American. And their European companies have it on license from American firms. So if our sanctions remove that technology from trade with Iran, they're not going to sell any Airbuses among other things because there's too much American technology in there."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "So you think that might drive them enough to the table to cut a deal with us. OK, let's say they cut a deal with us, then Iran says, no, all right? And they go about -- what do they do? I mean, I think Iran probably stays in the agreement rather than rush to a nuclear deal. What would you -- what do you think?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOLTON",
      "utterance": "Sure. Why should they change the agreement? They're getting everything they want and more, and they'll wait to see what we do. But that's what really is foolish about the whole notion that somehow Congress is going to fix the deal. Congress can amend the Corker-Cardin legislation, which was a mistake to begin with, but we're negotiating with Congress. It'd actually be easier to negotiate with Iran. The fact is that as long as Iran can hold out economic prospects to the Europeans or others -- particularly Russia and China -- they'll continue along. They'd be happy to pin us with withdrawing from the deal. I think that's a trivial propaganda point when you compare it against our strategic interests and Iran's continued progress toward deliverable nuclear weapons."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "So the smart play would be to try to divide us from U.K., France and Germany, and say we're going to take your money, come on in, the water's fine, business investment, great. They need that investment in Iran, obviously, in the wake of the protests to satisfy their population. You think that's the way they'll go?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOLTON",
      "utterance": "I think they'll try that, but I think the Europeans are going to be hard-pressed to do very much if the choice is do business with Iran or with the United States."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "OK. So you think this is a smart play by Trump then?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOLTON",
      "utterance": "It would have been a smarter thing to do on January 20, 2017, because they'll now have 16 months in total by May of sheltering under this deal. Now, a fair question, Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary of Great Britain, said, well, what's the alternative policy. And we now have an answer to that. The alternative policy is regime change in Iran. The people rose at the end of December. That protest is over. But they crossed a red line in Iran, too, by calling for the death of the Ayatollah Khamenei for the overthrow of the regime itself. Widespread across Iran. I think this regime is weak."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "OK. I agree with you. But how do you reform a coalition if you're Trump to make that happen?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOLTON",
      "utterance": "Right. Well, that is the one advantage I can see of this, in effect, 120-notice of withdrawal. You go to the Europeans, you go to others, our Arab friends in the Middle East, Israel, and say this is happening, you know it as well as we do there's no fix to this deal, now let's figure out how to try and get the band back together and move forward. I don't underestimate the problems, but he's got now 120 days to do it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "That's going to be a very difficult task diplomatically, given the way Donald Trump is viewed in the world right now. Don't you think?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOLTON",
      "utterance": "Well, my take on the Arab countries of the region is they understand what is driving the United States. They don't want Iran to have nuclear weapons any more than we do --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOLTON",
      "utterance": "-- or Israel does. And I think they understand that the North Korea is a major factor here. North Korea is very close to crossing the finish line to getting deliverable nuclear weapons. And whatever technology they have, Iran could have the next day. So this threat is becoming more imminent. And honestly, our European friends have to wake up to that, too."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "Well, it's going to be a wild 120 days as we see this diplomacy going. Rex Tillerson and H.R. McMaster have their hands full. Thank you, John Bolton."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "SEN. DICK DURBIN, D-ILL.",

      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "President Trump complicating efforts to reach a deal on immigration late this week after he reportedly use an expletive to describe certain countries in a closed-door meeting with law makers. Thursday's outburst came just days after a bipartisan gathering where the president struck a decidedly different tone, calling for compromise on an issue that has divided the parties for more than a decade."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP",
      "utterance": "We've been talking about DACA for a long time. I've been hearing about it for years, long before I decided to go into this particular line of work. And maybe we can do something. I feel having the Democrats in with us is absolutely vital, because this should be a bipartisan bill. This should be a bill of love, truly, it should be a bill of love. And we can do this. So I'm appealing to everyone in the room to put the country before party and to sit down and negotiate and to compromise, and let's see if we can get something done."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "Let's bring in Wall Street Journal columnist and deputy editor, Dan Henninger, columnist, Kim Strassel, and editorial board member, Allysia Finley. So, Dan, where are we here at the end of the week after the lovefest there earlier in the week, and then we've got this controversy over the president's words or on Haiti and other countries? DAN HENNINGER, COLUMNIST & DEPUTY EDITOR: Yes. We've just been through another week of Donald Trump's magical mystery tours. Tuesday, the clip you showed was the good Trump saying he's going to produce a bill of love. And later in the week, the meeting with the Senators, expletive deleted, that was the bad Trump. And throws the negotiations somewhat up in the air. But I think we can identify the terms of an agreement if there's going to be one. There has to be something done for the DREAMrs either with or to without legal path to citizenship."
    },

      "speaker": "GIGOT",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENNINGER",
      "utterance": "The president's insisting that a wall of some sort be built. That's what's known as border security. They want to do something about chain migration, the idea that people who come in here can bring their relatives in. They want a modification of that. And they want a modification of the visa lottery system, which allows people to be given visas from underrepresented countries, which was kind of at the center of what Trump was talking about when he expletive deleted which countries he wants included in --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "All right, those are the outlines of the deal. But let's get to this expletive. Because the president tweeted late in the week after the reports that he used it, he said, \"The language used by me at the DACA meeting was tough, but this was not the language used. What was really tough was the outlandish proposal made, a big setback for DACA.\" He's talking about the proposal made by the Senate Democrats, Allysia. Is this going to be, you think his comments are a passing storm, and they'll all get back to focusing on this compromise?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ALLYSIA FINLEY, EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBER",
      "utterance": "I think what we've found is over time that most of Trump's tweets eventually blow over. It just depends how quickly. And I think some on the left will be tempted to use this to try to block a deal. The people -- or the Democrats really don't want a deal, want to bludgeon Republicans through the election on this. They'll use this to -- as a cudgel."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "And you think, where does the split among the Democrats between those you described and those who actually really do want to do something about these people? Because let's face it, if we don't get a deal on this, they're in legal limbo, notwithstanding a court order this week that temporarily said that it has to be in force to stay here. I think that's going to go away eventually, so these young adults will be in trouble."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FINLEY",
      "utterance": "Right. This is a humanitarian issue. These kids would end up -- or young adults would end up being sent back to a country which they may not even speak Spanish, they may not know anyone there."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "FINLEY",
      "utterance": "When they were four or five, and they don't have any family. And this is really going to test the sincerity of Democrats, Chuck Schumer, Dick Durbin, and those in the House, Nancy Pelosi, and whether they'll come together to compromise. Over the years, what has eluded Democrats and Republicans has been compromise because both sides have wanted to use the issue and it has been resisted."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "They want to use it as a political issue. Kim, let's talk about the debate on the Republican side, because as soon as the president gave his comments about we need to do something about DACA, even with the terms and border security that he set, a lot of people on his right flank said, wait a minute, you know, sellout. Donald J. Trump, the J. stands for Jeb, as in Jeb Bush. This is betrayal. The betrayal caucus came out. How is this going to complicate things?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KIM STRASSEL, WASHINGTON COLUMNIST",
      "utterance": "Amnesty, amnesty. Yes. Look, this is going to be one of the real tests of whether it gets done. There's a lot of talk about how the left would like to use this as an issue, but there is a determined flank on the right that, for them, any changes in the immigration system, anything whatsoever, and even the DREAMers amount to amnesty. And they're going to be putting -- a lot of those people, by the way, are Donald Trump's base. So they're going to be putting a lot of pressure on him not to go there. The test again is can they get across the point that this is a much more targeted and smaller compromise that everyone is talking about that will end up, if it passes, with a lot of priorities that Donald Trump had promised that base. And there is something in this for everyone. But the right at the moment is determined to make sure, the far right, that this does not happen."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENNINGER",
      "utterance": "But he seems to be bending a little bit under pressure from the right. And I think Kim is right, there's a basis here for a deal. Most Americans want something done on immigration, and certainly something done on the DREAMers. And I think the big question here in the coming week is going to be which party snaps first, which party starts breaking down and fighting internally and saying, we won't go there. Because I think whether it's the Democrats or the Republicans, the party that causes this bill to fail is the one that's going to take the political blame."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "And if Donald Trump gets a deal, Allysia, he can say, you know what, I solved a problem that George W. Bush and Barack Obama couldn't solve."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FINLEY",
      "utterance": "I think this is a big political winner for him. He can show he brought both a bipartisan deal, brought Republicans and Democrats together, and they won't be able to use it. Again, Democrats won't be able to use it against him in the next election."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "All right, thank you all. When we come back, fallout this week from Michael Wolff's explosive, if dubious, new book on the Trump White House. So is talk of removing the president through the 25th Amendment as common as Wolff claims? We'll tell you what the people around the president really say, next."

We're back with Dan Henninger, Kim Strassel and \"Wall Street Journal\" columnist, Bill McGurn. Bill, let's step back after a week of reporting about this Wolff book. What do we think the fallout ultimately has been?"

So in some ways, I think the more interesting story is what came after. But I think it's part and parcel of what we had in the first few months of no one really -- people sniping at each other. Again, I don't know if he's accurate in all of it, there's a lot of questions about --"

There are a lot of people who, for their own reasons or sincere views or politically motivated views, are saying Trump is unfit for office, despite the election, and we need to invoke this 25th Amendment. Isn't that, basically, a fantasy?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENNINGER",
      "utterance": "It's a fantasy, it's ludicrous, it's absurd. It's pointless to talk about it. The 25th Amendment was enacted in 1965, led by Senator Birch Bayh, in light of the JFK assassination. They weren't clear whether LBJ was alive or not. He wanted to get the succession established if the president was physically incapacitated. Birch Bayh, his chief of staff at the time, Jay Berman, who helped write the 25th Amendment, said it has no application whatsoever to Donald Trump right now. That if you're going to do something with Trump, that would be impeachment."

And I ask this because it's clear the White House took some of this seriously in the sense that they then rolled out the president to meet with congressional leaders this week about immigration. And they have an on-air TV discussion for nearly an hour led by the president where instead of, you know, having a two-minute clip and then going behind closed doors, they were negotiating in public. And the president -- I think the White House wanted the president to do that to show, in fact, that, look, he can lead, he can negotiate, and he's very much in charge."

The Democrats looked utterly confused by what was going on in this entire hour that they were sitting there. But this is -- you talk to people within the White House, yes, if you've gone to work for Donald Trump, you have taken onboard that he is an unusual president who does not follow norms. But the idea that there is this active, aggressive conversation going on every day about how you get rid of him, it's -- that is also just pure fantasy. So they have a challenge right now in trying to change the perception that is out there, but it isn't as if there is some personal coup going on at the moment for everyone to get rid of Donald Trump."

He's volatile, he's impulsive, he changes his mind. He doesn't have a lot of fixed north stars on principles, so he can be bounced around and moved by arguments or who he talked to last. That's a very difficult person to advise. But the madness of King Donald, what do you make of that?"

But, look, we've been through a year with Donald Trump, and they've passed a major tax reform bill. They've passed a whole host of deregulatory moves across various industries, energy and so forth, appointed judges, appointed a Supreme Court judge. Look, you can agree or disagree with all of that. As a liberal, you could say, I would have resisted every one of those things, and I hate Donald Trump. That is not grounds for impeaching this president on the basis of his mental capacity.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "STRASSEL",
      "utterance": "The biggest takeaway is that even Mr. Simpson is not able to corroborate anything in his dossier. And that came out very clearly as he was grilled by the Senate Judiciary Committee. Basically, this was his attempt to paint his motives for putting this together in a good light, to sort of buck up his credibility, and that of Christopher Steele, who was the actual author of the dossier. But we don't come out of this necessarily with any greater insight into Donald Trump's actions during the election year."

    {
      "speaker": "STRASSEL",
      "utterance": "No. And, look, by the way, he had to issue a correction. He came out, and he got everybody excited. The press was all over it saying when they turned in this dossier, they were simply back up information that the FBI already had from an internal source within the Trump camp."
    },

    {
      "speaker": "STRASSEL",
      "utterance": "Then after that came out, the transcript came out, the media goes wild saying, look, someone within team Trump was telling the FBI the same thing. Then we get a Simpson correction saying, no, that's not really what I meant. I meant that Australian diplomat that had tipped off the FBI about that campaign aide, George Papadopoulos. So the point is, we do not have any evidence of an internal Trump person talking to the FBI."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "OK. Bill, meanwhile, the House Intelligence Committee had struck a deal finally late last week with the FBI Director Christopher Wray and with Deputy A.G. Rod Rosenstein to turn over documents that they'd been seeking for a long time and that those gentlemen had been resisting turning over. What are we likely -- this is important, right?"

      "speaker": "MCGURN",
      "utterance": "Well, we're going to learn about this investigation. Isn't it interesting that we want this investigation into Donald Trump and Russia, but no one wants to see what the investigation's telling us? I mean, the only information we really have so far is the Steele dossier, which is sort of the Rosetta Stone for this. Now, I know a lot of people accuse Fusion, say, well, it's a piece of opposition research. I'm more interested to know is it true or is it false. I think Director Comey testified that it was salacious and unverified a few months ago. And I think Assistant Director McCabe, the reports are that he testified only to Carter Page's trip to Moscow --"
    },

    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCGURN",
      "utterance": "So the question is -- I mean, the question is -- and so many people don't seem to want to know the answer. Was this used in FISA warrants to spy on members of a presidential campaign team? And was it used knowing the information was unverified? How did the FBI present this? So I think we need to know these answers. Congress is the appropriate place to get these answers, you know, and get them out in public. So they have the documents now. They're going to interview only some of these FBI witnesses under oath, but the public is still largely in the dark."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "Yes, Dan, I think this would be a very big deal if, in fact, a piece of disinformation -- if that's what this turns out to be -- ended up motivating a warrant for spying on members of a presidential campaign?"

    {
      "speaker": "HENNINGER",
      "utterance": "Yes, I think you put your finger on it. It may, indeed, be misinformation. There's kind of a spy versus spy thing going on here between the Russian intelligence services, I think, and the American security service. And I think the American security service, especially the FBI, have gotten themselves to a point where they were humiliated by the way the Russians were using this disinformation, and that is what they don't want --"

      "speaker": "MCGURN",
      "utterance": "And to Dan and Kim's point, Christopher Steele, I mean, he was briefing reporters, but he's so reluctant to talk to Congress. If this stuff is true in what he found, shouldn't he want to set the record straight and explain it? That's what's so troubling."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "Kim, what about the likelihood that these documents that the House Intelligence Committee now has are going to become public at some stage? Do you think that's likely to happen?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STRASSEL",
      "utterance": "I think it's highly likely, because that's what everyone is now understanding, is that the spin out there has become monumental for those who support the dossier, speculations, outright claims that it's true when there's no evidence that it is. Republicans worried about the FBI motives. People are coming to understand that the only way you get answers to these questions is to just put it out there for the public to see. So, you know, it would be nice to think that the White House would step in here and declassify. It's probably not likely because they're worried about Mueller and his investigation. But watch to see if Congress doesn't exercise its authority to declassify."
    },

    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "The -- let's talk -- basically, the states that are mainly affected are the states with really high-income tax rates: New York City, 12.7 percent, state and local combined, California, 13.3, some others. So let's think through the responses they're making. First of all, there's a threat of a lawsuit that they're going to say that this tax bill is illegal, unconstitutional because it discriminates against certain states. How do you see that playing out?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HODGE",
      "utterance": "Well, it's kind of ironic that they're complaining about this when there are already provisions in the tax code that limit the state and local tax deduction. One is the alternative minimum tax, which was created by Democrats. The other is the limitation which limits or actually scales back your itemized deductions for high-income people. That was also created by an Ohio Democrat. So there are already provisions there that do discriminate against high-tax states. But this is, obviously, directly hitting their highest income people, essentially, their donors, and I think that's why they're complaining the most."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "But basically, the tax bill, the provisions of the tax bill treat all states alike. I mean, every state faces --"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HODGE",
      "utterance": "Right. Sure, and they're welcome to try these schemes, but they really are -- there's a great irony here. You have people who were once decrying the tax reform bill as tax cuts for the rich now coming up with these Rube Goldberg-type schemes to benefit the wealthiest people in their state by giving them back a deduction that was taken away from them in the tax bill."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "Let's take those one by one. First, what they're talking about in California in particular --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "-- which is the new charitable deduction. So that if you're a California resident, the state will give you a dollar-for-dollar deduction as a charitable contribution to defray any increased federal taxes. What to you make of that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HODGE",
      "utterance": "It's probably illegal. The whole purpose of charity, or one of the principles of charity is that that charitable gift cannot materially benefit or financially benefit the giver. And this clearly would. It's really a scheme, a tax payment by any other way. And a lot of court decisions have actually upheld this principle that a charitable gift can't financially benefit the giver. This clearly does. I think it'd be thrown out by the courts."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "And would the IRS approve it?"

      "speaker": "GIGOT",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HODGE",
      "utterance": "They've won decisions on this basis before, so I think they would challenge it, and they'd win."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "All right. Now, let's take the other proposal that we've heard a lot about which is the payroll tax change. So Andrew Cuomo says we'll rely less on income tax rates, and we'll substitute it by imposing a new, higher payroll tax that the companies would pay in the state, employers would pay in the states to compensate for it. Does this make sense to you?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HODGE",
      "utterance": "Well, they -- states are certainly allowed to create a payroll tax. But unless they fully eliminate the state personal income tax, they would essentially have employers paying your income tax, which the IRS would see as income to you. If a third party pays your income taxes, that's really income on your behalf. And so it would actually increase the tax burden on working New Yorkers. So that probably wouldn't fly. And I doubt that most employers would want to pay higher payroll taxes on behalf of their employees. There are a lot of mechanical problems with this, too, in trying to create -- how do you create a progressive payroll tax? That's very, very challenging."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "Well, and if you're an employer, and the payroll tax goes up on any individual employee, you're either going to have to absorb that higher cost --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HODGE",
      "utterance": "Sure."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "-- or you're going to have to reduce the compensation to the employee. Now, I don't know a lot of employees who would sit well with a company saying to them, you know what, we're going to have to reduce your compensation by 5 percent, 7 percent, 10 percent because of this tax law change. That's going to be politically difficult as well."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HODGE",
      "utterance": "Yes. I think this is really thrashing about. And states are really facing the fact that the federal subsidy has been dramatically limited for their tax-and-spend policies. And they are going to have to get in line. They are going to have to control themselves. They can no longer shift a lot of their burden off to Washington. And they're going to have to compete equally to other states, especially the low-tax states like Texas and Florida and others that don't have an income tax."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "So the simple solution here is cut your tax rates."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HODGE",
      "utterance": "Yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HODGE",
      "utterance": "It was very telling when Governor Cuomo actually expressed the worry that a lot of these high-income people would leave the states. That's extremely telling that he understands how tax competition works and that people can simply vote with their feet and leave and go to lower-tax jurisdictions."

Elizabeth Warren coming out to pooh-pooh the idea saying, you know, we don't need another celebrity president. So that would be one of the measures.
