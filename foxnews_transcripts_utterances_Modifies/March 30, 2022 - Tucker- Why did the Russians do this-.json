      "sentences": "Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. When the Russian military invaded Ukraine last month, the most highly credentialed people in the world seemed stunned by it and that was not very reassuring to the rest of us. Quote: \"It was a shock to many of the leading experts and policymakers in the United States, Europe and even Ukraine,\" explained a fellow expert and policymaker at the Atlantic Council. Quote: \"The head of German intelligence was so caught off guard that he was still in Kyiv and had to be evacuated.\" That's pretty weird if you think about it, because for weeks, Joe Biden had been speaking in a very loud voice about a potential Russian invasion of Ukraine. They seemed ready for it and yet it turns out that nobody in Washington, including Biden himself, really thought it was going to happen and when it did happen, official Washington concluded that Putin must be insane. \"The casual speculation about Vladimir Putin's mental state has become more serious,\" wrote \"National Review.\" In other words, there is a reason, a good reason none of us saw this coming. Putin just snapped. He is irrational and impossible to predict. A lot of people took that at face value, but you had to notice that, like most explanations you hear in Washington, it was self-exculpatory. It was more an excuse than an analysis. In fact, Putin may well be crazy, but it's fair to assume there was more to the invasion of Ukraine than a single psychiatric episode and at this point, it would be nice to know exactly what it is, what happened and why. Why did the Russians do this? It's not treasonous to ask that. It's essential. You can't make wise decisions about the future without understanding what just happened. It's a prerequisite, but our leaders so far have refused to do that. They keep lying to themselves. They're imposing censorship on the rest of us. They're forcing the entire American population to mouth childish slogans about good versus evil. It's insulting, but worse, it's not helpful. This is not how nations survive complex moments like this. Crisis demands crystal clear thinking. So now is the moment to ignore the people who have been consistently wrong and instead listen carefully to the people who've gotten it right in the past, the ones who saw the Ukraine war coming and said so out loud. Those are the people you should be listening to and one of them is Nigel Farage. Nobody would call Farage a stooge of Vladimir Putin, just the opposite. Farage is a nationalist. He cares about his own country. He has devoted his life to it. In his case, his country is Great Britain, whose long-term interests have been gravely damaged by the Russian invasion and by the West's response to it. The same is true, unfortunately, of our country. The U.S. has never had a President as reckless as Joe Biden is. We're going to pay the price for that for a long time. But Nigel Farage, had you asked him, could have predicted all of this. In fact, he did predict it back in 2014 as the leader of the U.K. Independence Party. Farage gave a speech to the European Parliament that year, which unfortunately, we just saw yesterday. In retrospect, his words seemed prophetic. Farage understood what would happen because he saw clearly what had already taken place. Watch this carefully. We think you'll agree it's an analysis worth understanding. Here's Nigel Farage eight years ago on Ukraine.",

      "sentences": "Amongst the long list of foreign policy failures and contradictions in the last few years, including, of course, the bombing of Libya, the desire to arm the rebels in Syria, has been the unnecessary provocation of Vladimir Putin. This E.U. Empire, ever seeking to expand, stated its territorial claim on the Ukraine some years ago. Just to make that worse, of course, some NATO members said they too would like the Ukraine to join NATO. We directly encouraged the uprising in the Ukraine that led to the toppling of the President, Yanukovych, and that led, of course, in turn to Vladimir Putin reacting and the moral of the story is if you poke the Russian bear with a stick, don't be surprised when he reacts. Now, just to continue with that, today we are rushing through an association agreement at undue speed with the Ukraine and as we speak, there are NATO soldiers engaged in military exercises in the Ukraine. Have we taken leave of our senses? Do we actually want to have a war with Putin because if we do, we're certainly going about it the right way. Perhaps we ought to recognize that the West now faces the biggest threat and crisis to our way of life that we have seen for over 70 years. The recent beheadings of the British and American hostages graphically illustrates the problem, and of course, we have our own citizens from our own countries engaged in that struggle, too. In the war against Islamic extremism, Vladimir Putin, whatever we may think of him as a human being, is actually on our side. I suggest we grow up. I suggest we recognize the real threat facing all of our countries, communities and societies; we stop playing war games in the Ukraine; and we start to prepare a plan to help countries like Syria, like Iraq, like Kenya, like indeed Nigeria, to try and help them to deal with the real threat that faces us. Let us not go on provoking Putin, whether we like him or not.",

And of course, you know, we joined together in two World Wars to fight for those values. We then lost our way completely, with Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, and many other things. The globalists -- and I'm talking about Bill Clinton and Tony Blair who began it, and that then becomes an orthodoxy that NATO, the European Union, these empires should expand. And, you know, you need to understand Russia's history. The invasion by Napoleon, the invasion by Hitler, the deaths of tens of millions of Russians as a result of those invasions, and I could see that the westward expansion of NATO, of the European Union, after the fall of the Berlin Wall was a deliberately provocative act. You know, Churchill said, at the fall of the Nazi Empire, you know, be magnanimous in victory, don't rub their noses in the dirt as a result of what has been done, try to make sure that you can form an alliance and a lasting peace.

After in one rant, Reid herself wrote on that blog: \"Does that make me homophobic? Possibly.

Aphasia is an inability to express yourself to put in words things, to understand language, to get the words right, or to comprehend the words. And I'll show you on the brain here where it is. It's on the left side of the brain. Tucker, the front is called Broca's aphasia in the back, it's Wernicke's. You could have both, but it really gives you cognitive problems. And we don't know in Bruce Willis's case, what's causing this. Over two million Americans have this. Most commonly, it's stroke. It can also be a blow to the head, but if it's longer term, it can be a degenerative disease, it can be dementia, unfortunately. We don't know what it is in his case. We heard Demi Moore use the words cognitive impairment, but that could be any of the things that I just said. We don't have a physical exam. We don't have an MRI. Here's what we do know, Tucker. We know that we have an actor, an icon that we all look to voyeuristically, whether we were watching \"Die Hard\" or whether we were watching \"Pulp Fiction,\" we projected ourselves into these films, and we didn't notice necessarily how much pain he was going through playing his own stunts a lot of the time, what it meant to him, how it tore him down.

      "utterance": "\"It was a shock to many of the leading experts and policymakers in the United States, Europe and even Ukraine,\" explained a fellow expert and policymaker at the Atlantic Council. Quote: \"The head of German intelligence was so caught off guard that he was still in Kyiv and had to be evacuated.\" That's pretty weird if you think about it, because for weeks, Joe Biden had been speaking in a very loud voice about a potential Russian invasion of Ukraine. They seemed ready for it and yet it turns out that nobody in Washington, including Biden himself, really thought it was going to happen and when it did happen, official Washington concluded that Putin must be insane. \"The casual speculation about Vladimir Putin's mental state has become more serious,\" wrote \"National Review.\" In other words, there is a reason, a good reason none of us saw this coming. Putin just snapped. He is irrational and impossible to predict. A lot of people took that at face value, but you had to notice that, like most explanations you hear in Washington, it was self-exculpatory. It was more an excuse than an analysis. In fact, Putin may well be crazy, but it's fair to assume there was more to the invasion of Ukraine than a single psychiatric episode and at this point, it would be nice to know exactly what it is, what happened and why. Why did the Russians do this? It's not treasonous to ask that. It's essential. You can't make wise decisions about the future without understanding what just happened. It's a prerequisite, but our leaders so far have refused to do that. They keep lying to themselves. They're imposing censorship on the rest of us. They're forcing the entire American population to mouth childish slogans about good versus evil. It's insulting, but worse, it's not helpful. This is not how nations survive complex moments like this. Crisis demands crystal clear thinking. So now is the moment to ignore the people who have been consistently wrong and instead listen carefully to the people who've gotten it right in the past, the ones who saw the Ukraine war coming and said so out loud. Those are the people you should be listening to and one of them is Nigel Farage. Nobody would call Farage a stooge of Vladimir Putin, just the opposite. Farage is a nationalist. He cares about his own country. He has devoted his life to it. In his case, his country is Great Britain, whose long-term interests have been gravely damaged by the Russian invasion and by the West's response to it. The same is true, unfortunately, of our country. The U.S. has never had a President as reckless as Joe Biden is. We're going to pay the price for that for a long time. But Nigel Farage, had you asked him, could have predicted all of this. In fact, he did predict it back in 2014 as the leader of the U.K. Independence Party. Farage gave a speech to the European Parliament that year, which unfortunately, we just saw yesterday. In retrospect, his words seemed prophetic. Farage understood what would happen because he saw clearly what had already taken place. Watch this carefully. We think you'll agree it's an analysis worth understanding. Here's Nigel Farage eight years ago on Ukraine."

      "speaker": "NIGEL FARAGE, THEN MEMBER OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT",
      "utterance": "Amongst the long list of foreign policy failures and contradictions in the last few years, including, of course, the bombing of Libya, the desire to arm the rebels in Syria, has been the unnecessary provocation of Vladimir Putin. This E.U. Empire, ever seeking to expand, stated its territorial claim on the Ukraine some years ago. Just to make that worse, of course, some NATO members said they too would like the Ukraine to join NATO. We directly encouraged the uprising in the Ukraine that led to the toppling of the President, Yanukovych, and that led, of course, in turn to Vladimir Putin reacting and the moral of the story is if you poke the Russian bear with a stick, don't be surprised when he reacts. Now, just to continue with that, today we are rushing through an association agreement at undue speed with the Ukraine and as we speak, there are NATO soldiers engaged in military exercises in the Ukraine. Have we taken leave of our senses? Do we actually want to have a war with Putin because if we do, we're certainly going about it the right way. Perhaps we ought to recognize that the West now faces the biggest threat and crisis to our way of life that we have seen for over 70 years. The recent beheadings of the British and American hostages graphically illustrates the problem, and of course, we have our own citizens from our own countries engaged in that struggle, too. In the war against Islamic extremism, Vladimir Putin, whatever we may think of him as a human being, is actually on our side. I suggest we grow up. I suggest we recognize the real threat facing all of our countries, communities and societies; we stop playing war games in the Ukraine; and we start to prepare a plan to help countries like Syria, like Iraq, like Kenya, like indeed Nigeria, to try and help them to deal with the real threat that faces us. Let us not go on provoking Putin, whether we like him or not."

You spent your entire life trying to defend your country, your country alone, so I don't think he was going to write you off as a tool of a foreign power.

But I also believe in western values, and there are things that we, you know, you, America, Canada, Australia, many other countries, there is much that we share. And of course, you know, we joined together in two World Wars to fight for those values. We then lost our way completely, with Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, and many other things. The globalists -- and I'm talking about Bill Clinton and Tony Blair who began it, and that then becomes an orthodoxy that NATO, the European Union, these empires should expand. And, you know, you need to understand Russia's history. The invasion by Napoleon, the invasion by Hitler, the deaths of tens of millions of Russians as a result of those invasions, and I could see that the westward expansion of NATO, of the European Union, after the fall of the Berlin Wall was a deliberately provocative act. You know, Churchill said, at the fall of the Nazi Empire, you know, be magnanimous in victory, don't rub their noses in the dirt as a result of what has been done, try to make sure that you can form an alliance and a lasting peace. Now look, I'll be honest with you, I am not a fan of Vladimir Putin in any way at all.

It goes and tells the 82nd Airborne, they are going into Ukraine, who backs Putin deeper into a corner. What we need right now is a peace settlement, and I think a peace settlement is achievable. I mean, why? Why? Even after the date of the invasion where American and British and other NATO soldiers insisting they thought Ukraine should be able to join. We have lost sense of anything -- our predecessors, our leaders in generations that have gone before were much more intelligent than this. It's madness."

And so all of these videos document that whatever these activists say, they are now creating a tracking program for all Disney children's content to find out exactly how many transgender, asexual, and bisexual characters that they are peppering into the show either in the foreground or the background.

And I think it's a good thing that they're learning about it. What is aphasia? Aphasia is an inability to express yourself to put in words things, to understand language, to get the words right, or to comprehend the words. And I'll show you on the brain here where it is. It's on the left side of the brain. Tucker, the front is called Broca's aphasia in the back, it's Wernicke's. You could have both, but it really gives you cognitive problems. And we don't know in Bruce Willis's case, what's causing this. Over two million Americans have this. Most commonly, it's stroke. It can also be a blow to the head, but if it's longer term, it can be a degenerative disease, it can be dementia, unfortunately. We don't know what it is in his case. We heard Demi Moore use the words cognitive impairment, but that could be any of the things that I just said. We don't have a physical exam. We don't have an MRI. Here's what we do know, Tucker. We know that we have an actor, an icon that we all look to voyeuristically, whether we were watching \"Die Hard\" or whether we were watching \"Pulp Fiction,\" we projected ourselves into these films, and we didn't notice necessarily how much pain he was going through playing his own stunts a lot of the time, what it meant to him, how it tore him down. But tonight we need to make a change. We need to say we're wishing well and prayers and hopes and everything for Bruce Willis, not the actor, but Bruce Willis, the man. Speech therapy may help. Retraining the brain to communicate in a different way may help. Hopes and prayers to Bruce Willis, the man tonight, Tucker, not the actor."

We thought was that a charge? And they said, no, it's not a charge. They're just going to try to influence the Judge at the very last minute.

The Justice Department calls \"New York Times\" and says you're a sex criminal, and then a year later, you're not charged with anything?

That happened during the Trump administration as well. We saw it during the Russia hoax. But the most important update, the most important thing that's happened since our last on-air discussion, someone has been indicted and has pled guilty to trying to shake down my family based on this pile of lies, and so I'm not going to allow it to hinder me.

Whether you committed a crime or not, it is everybody's business and you haven't, and I just want to ask you one more time crisply, and clearly, do you expect to be charged for the crimes of which they've accused?"

The notion that for three years, the F.B.I. has had this and the Chief of Cyber not only doesn't know where it is, doesn't know who at the F.B.I. we should call upon to test to see whether or not this laptop functions as a point of vulnerability for our country. Business deals kickbacks, who knows what else and that could actually be used to compromise the First Family. So, I don't think we ought to question this anymore. That's why I introduced the laptop into the Congressional Record, and it will be available for all to see soon. I also have filed legislation to strip the Security Clearances from the 51 National Security officials who all lied to the country and said this was Russian disinformation. We now see that being walked back with yet again, D.O.J. authorized leaks to CNN. I think it's really something, Tucker, that CNN comes out this big piece today saying, oh, the investigation into Hunter Biden is heating up a day after the F.B.I. was humiliated by basic questions I asked in the Judiciary Committee about their efficacy, their work, their chain of custody, and the evidence they may have of a U.S. vulnerability that could be exploited by our adversaries."

If a law enforcement agency or the Justice Department accuses you of a crime, they have to prove it. They don't get to just shut you up by smearing you. They have to take it to a Court and show that you're guilty. And if they're not doing that they're not really a law enforcement agency. They're really more like the Secret Police and you don't want that. Well, up next, there was a Supreme Court ruling that you may have missed, but it's kind of significant. It expanded tribal land in Oklahoma, and it's had an amazing and major effect on life in that state. State law enforcement, for example, longer has jurisdiction to prosecute violent crimes.

But the talk page has basically come to be used as, basically a place where authority is wielded, you know, the old hands, the administrators and so forth.

We're happy to have him join us tonight. Governor, thanks so much for coming on. This is one of those stories that I think most people kind of missed. What does it mean for your state?"

      "speaker": "STITT",
      "utterance": "Yes, so basically, this all started when McGirt, who was a child rapist, showed his Indian card and got his conviction overturned. So -- and for those of you that haven't been to Oklahoma in a while, it's literally half of our state. So if you think about Tulsa, with a million people, we have now had a change of rules. The state, if there is an Indian involved, has lost jurisdiction to prosecute those crimes. Our police have lost jurisdiction. And when you think about who's an Indian, you could be 1/500th or 1/1,000th. I've actually got my Indian card, my six children with blond hair and blue eyes, they all have their Indian card. So our police are having a tough time because you can't tell who an Indian is and who is not an Indian in eastern part of Oklahoma."

    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "So this is on the basis of race. So depending upon the racial category you're in, you're treated differently by law enforcement seems to be what you're saying."

    {
      "speaker": "STITT",
      "utterance": "That's exactly right. I mean, the cases are all over the state. I mean, one case I like to point out the Daniel Vivier, three really bad guys beat an 85-year-old man almost a death. Robbed him, stole his truck, and one of them showed their Indian card, he got out of prison. The other two are still in prison. That's not equal protection under the law. So one guy is out because of race. The other two people are still in prison. I mean, Tucker, we have people on death row that are doing 23andMe DNA test trying to get their convictions overturned. It's preposterous."

    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Yes. So this is the equity agenda. This is actually what they want for the whole country. So I'm really grateful that you explained what it means for your state, Governor Kevin Stitt of Oklahoma. Thank you very much."
