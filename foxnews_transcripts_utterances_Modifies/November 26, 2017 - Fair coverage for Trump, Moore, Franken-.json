The White House can say as much as they want that he wants the voters of Alabama to decide, whatever, that if he thinks the allegations are true, then he should step down.

And then when he spoke to the press this week, he said that he totally denied it. Forty years was a long time ago. There have been multiple races where this hasn't come up. So I would say he has changed his position. And when asked by the media specifically was he going to go down to Alabama and campaign for Roy Moore, he said I will decide next week. So, saying that he has taken a different position is an unfair characterization and saying that he is endorsing Roy Moore is inconsistent as well with the facts."

So, while it may be fear (ph), as Gayle points out, I have to say, well, he really hasn't changed.

I do think whether people love or hate President Trump, I think the most thing that everyone agrees on is that he usually does not, I don't think, usually ignore a whole lot of questions. I think when the questions are thrown at him sometimes, I think his press office would wish that he doesn't. I think he usually answers or responds with Twitter or whatever. He usually is better about responding. That is why it was particularly notable initially and why so many people talked about ho he hadn't commented on Roy Moore."

And like Juan was saying, I was a little surprised that he did not come out and say, well, I was right, I supported the challenger to Roy Moore. And like Ellison was saying, there is no filter on him and so he has the ability to go out there and say that.

Ivanka Trump certainly has said she believes the women involved. The president is taking a different stance. And I guess, you know, that does lead lots of questions of why these women accused you. You say that they are not telling the truth and maybe he is skeptical of Roy Moore. Let me go a little more here because the spotlight now is shifting to the Democrats. If I can just go through, three more accusers since last week saying that Senator Al Franken grabbed them. But in photo ap, one picture of one woman, at least we can put that up, Linsay Menz. He has apologized again. He said he crossed line. And senator is going to talk to Minnesota reporters later today. Eighty-eight-year-old John Conyers, Democrat, dean of the House actually, first reported by BuzzFeed that he secretly used $27,000 taxpayers money to settle a former staffer suite that included allegations of sexual harassment. He denies it. In terms of media coverage, is this all becoming a blur? Is it muddying the waters about who did what?"

Fox News is much more in the us than CNN, says the president, but outside of the U.S., CNN International is still a major source of (fake) news, and they represent our nation to the world very poorly. The outside world does not see the truth from them. CNN responded, that is not CNN's job to represent the U.S. to the world. That is yours. Our job is to report the news.

Now, Time called that account inaccurate and the pick will remain secret until early December. What exactly is the magazine denying?

AT&T says that is nonsense, but these are perfectly reasonable anti-trust concerns. If the Trump administration didn't take over, CNN will just keep operating as it has been and probably keep ticking off the president. Some pundits have had fun with Rand Paul over that attacked by his neighbor that left him with six broken ribs. Now, the senator's wife, Kelley, says in CNN op-ed that her husband has not taken a single breath without pain and has pneumonia. She dismisses concocted theories about some ongoing landscaping dispute with the neighbor. \"It is incredibly hurtful that some news outlets have victimized Rand a second time as he struggles to recover, delighting in hateful headlines like 'not a perfect neighbor.' This was not a scuffle, a fight, or an altercation, as many in the media falsely described it. It was a deliberate, blindside attack.\" Well, she's right. And that hurts.

I mean, it's the title of the show as Mediabuzz, the power of the press appears at this point when it comes to this thread of discussion, never to have been greater. The power of the press right now enables an article to come out and say the \"Washington post,\" the \"New York Times\" or a piece on \"Vox\" one day, and the next they sometimes even that night, people's careers have been vaporized. They not only lose their shows, as you know Howie, but they will lose any affiliations.

And Liz you were saying we have to make this distinctions but you know, Thrush essentially was accused of being overly aggressive in many of these cases. There's not a case where it's consensual. Is that in a different category and is that perhaps why the New York Times is just suspending him at this time?"

      "utterance": "It is in a different category. But the most egregious thing perhaps about say for example a Glenn Thrush is the pattern where he would be at events off-site from the New York Times, he would get people inebriated or they of their own volition would do so. Then he'd toss a twenty to somebody who was there as a third person say take a cab a home I'll pay for it so I can be alone with this person. Remember, Harvey Weinstein tossed a $100 bill at a kitchen person or a dishwasher and said get out of the kitchen while I'm giving this woman a tour. And then, he would make his move. That is very different from the Harvey Weinstein situation but in the end, perhaps the most egregious situation about Glenn Thrush is the scores of woman he may have deterred from entering the journalism world. We'll never know what great stories they would have broken or how they would have contributed to the world of journalism. That said, the New York Times came armed and prepared as did CBS. And let me just quickly add this, I thought CBS's David Rhodes, the president, handled it really well because the point he made was, and I even wrote it down. He said, despite Charlie's important journalistic contribution, there is nothing more important than enduring the safe and, you know, professional workplace. But a supportive environment where people feel they can do their best work."

Remember the Oakland Raiders, Marshawn Lynch of the NFL's Oakland Raiders stands for the Mexican anthem and sits down to boos for our national anthem. Great disrespect! Next time NFL should suspend him for remainder of season. Attendance and ratings way down. Now, I personally think that a lot of the media don't like Trump pushing these NFL protest. I think it's worked well for him. It's controversial, but a lot of his supporters like it. But to suggest that a particular player be suspended or potentially suspended, does that cross a line?"

      "utterance": "It's interesting isn't it because as you say, it's everyone. It's the left and the right. Everyone, whichever way you look at it. These big tech companies are too powerful and the way that they use their power is harmful to what they foresee to be the public interest. If you look at particularly a company like Facebook I think in the firing line, particularly from the left over what they perceive to be the platform's role in helping the Russians to swing the election against Hillary Clinton and for Donald Trump. But if you look on the other side, you've got Republicans who believe that these big tech companies are run by die-hard liberals who are using their power over the information that we consume and the way that people connect with each other to push an agenda of liberal values. And so I think all of these problems really are a consequence of the massive success of these companies in producing tools and products that billions of people around the world want to use."

    {
      "speaker": "HILTON",
      "utterance": "Well there are two parts I think. The first answer is there is just so much of it that the sheer scale of the content, the number of hours of content that's uploaded every second to YouTube, the amount of, you know, think about of the 2 billion people using Facebook. It's just so much that actually it's very difficult to police that or, you know, using automated means because even though we hear a lot these days about artificial intelligence and what's called machine learning and natural language processing where computers if you like try and understand the meaning of different words and trying then understand what's going on. Actually, all that is still in its infancy and so to police the content for example, to spark terrorist plotting or child abuse, those sorts of things. Actually, it's pretty difficult."

It's just interesting you talk about these companies getting badder from the left and the right. Twitter is now going to remove the blue verification for prominent people if in Twitter's judgment those people post hateful or racist messages. When you get into hateful, you start attacking politicians, is that hateful? Could they come under fire for exercising that judgment in a way that's controversial particularly as you say these Silicon Valley companies are perceived as being run by liberals?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HILTON",
      "utterance": "Yes, it's a really big issue. And I think one of the arguments that you hear a lot from the right particularly is that there is a double standard. Their judgment, the company's judgment of what is hateful actually is driven by their politics. So for example ads that promote pro- life position are considered to be provocative, and hate speech, and you've seen that. You've seen YouTube getting into hot water over classifying conservative philosophical instruction videos as contravening their guidelines."

      "speaker": "HILTON",
      "utterance": "Yes, I think that is right. On the next revolution, we regularly come back to this point about the impact of technology on our humanity and it's something I feel very strongly about. I wrote a book about it. I advocate -- I don't use a smart phone for example. I haven't had a smartphone for five years and I live perfectly without it."

      "utterance": "I don't use and I haven't for five years and life goes on. It's perfectly fine. And so I'm really concerned about the way there are phones in particular have made people basically addicted to this technology. But that doesn't absolve the companies from their own responsibility whether it's in terms of their market power, their dominance over a particular market for example online advertising or their power over information. And I think that they definitely need to take all these issues much more seriously than they have in the past. I think to be fair to them, they are realizing that now and they are starting to think much more deeply about their broadest social impact."

      "utterance": "Even in the media and entertainment culture that feels free to compare to Donald Trump to the worst villains in human history, this was a new low. Newsweek used this week's death of Charles Manson to compare the president to the cult leader, who happen to be a mass murderer. This utterly illogical connection rested on one psychologist who said both Trump and Manson use emotional anguish to appeal to alienated people or something. But even the person said he wasn't comparing Trump and Manson though that did not stop Newsweek. The magazine later deleted all references to the president saying the original piece didn't meet its editorial standards which were sadly missing in action. Just pathetic.
