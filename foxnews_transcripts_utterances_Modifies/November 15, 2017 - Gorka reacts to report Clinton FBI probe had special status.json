      "sentences": "All right, Tucker. Thanks so much. What a news night. Welcome to \"Hannity.\" Judge Roy Moore writes an open letter to me after last night I demanded answers. We will share that with you. Also, three more accusers down in Alabama. Now, my response is coming up later in the show.  Plus, Democrats, liberals and the media, they're finally now today having their day of reckoning when it comes to Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary, and the many allegations of the sexual misconduct, the mistreatment of women. Because for decades these accusations, they have dodged and been dismissed and downplayed by the left in this country, by the media in this country, and even worse. Those accusers were smeared, slander, besmirched, including by Hillary Clinton herself, and what is so inexcusable is that the Democrats and the media for 30 years did nothing to stop this from happening to protect women.  Instead, they were complicit. They enabled all of this to happen. Those women all suffered, and now they lecture everybody else. We will expose this blatant, despicable, disgusting hypocrisy in tonight's breaking news monologue.  All right, with new allegations of sexual misconduct now swirling around US Senate candidate Judge Roy Moore, the left and the liberal media, they are finally starting to re-examine what is their deplorable defense over the years: Bill Clinton's long history of disturbing sexual abuse allegations. It is taken almost 30 years for the left, the liberal destroy Trump media to finally start admitting Bill Clinton targeted women for decades with criminal impunity. Take a look at this headline from a liberal publication -- a little late -- The Atlantic: Bill Clinton: A Reckoning. Feminists saved the 42nd president of the United States in the 1990s. They were on the wrong side of history, is it finally time to make things right?\" Yes, it's beyond time. And then there's this op-ed from the New York Times and as the headline, quote, \"I believe Juanita.\"  But that's not all. Members of the mainstream media, they are even starting to realize that what Bill Clinton did was beyond disgraceful. His conduct should never, ever, ever have been defended in the first place. Wait until you see some of the tape we have for you tonight. Look at this tweet. Give him credit. Chris Hayes over at MSNBC. \"As gross and cynical and hypocritical is the rights' 'what about Bill Clinton stuff is,' it's also true. Democrats and the center left are overdue for a real reckoning with the allegations against him.\"  Take a look at what CNN's Jake Tapper had to say. Watch this.",

I decided to do it again at the end of the program tonight to be consistent in terms of where we put in the program. It's important. Three more women have today come forward making accusations against senate candidate Judge Roy Moore. Clearly this now raises new issues in the state of Alabama. Things are getting worse, and now very tough on the voters of Alabama. I lived there, I will talk about that in the second. Last night on this broadcast I demanded answers from Judge Moore. When the Judge's story broke. Just a reminder, I laid out a history. I don't rush to judgment, and I said these allegations are so serious, they should all transcend politics. Sadly, it's not, but it should. I'm never going to apologize for not rushing to judgment. The issue of presumption of innocence is important to all of us. However, these allegations are beyond disturbing and serious. I have a 16-year-old daughter. Ivanka Trumps said something today. There is a special place in hell for people who prey on children. Ivanka Trump is right. There is a special place in hell for predators that is something everyone should agree with. That should not be political. Now with George Moore, unlike everyone else in the media, I went right to the source. I interviewed him. I went to \"the Washington Post\" allegations methodically, point by point through each and every allegation in \"the Washington Post\" in that piece, and I let him respond. Shockingly, for the first time in my life, even the liberals praised that interview. Rarity for me. For me and so many others, because what happened in that interview, it did raise new questions. Then came the issue of the yearbook that allegedly shows Judge Moore's message to one of his accusers, and that is why for the sake of the people of Alabama last night I demanded answers. They deserve them. Those people of Alabama deserve them before an election. And today we got the answers to the questions that we ask. Let me give you Judge Roy Moore's attorney in a press conference and question the validity of the yearbook signature. He said it could be forged and demanded a forensic analysis. I spoke to a forensic analyst on my radio show today. He said they will be able to tell if the ink is fresh or not, and they will be able to look at comparisons to his handwriting then and in that your book and determine if it was his. Judge Moore today, late tonight released a letter to me. Let me read it to you. I will read it in full. I think that is fair. Dear Sean, I'm suffering the same treatment of the Republicans have had to endure. A month prior to the general election to U.S. Senate in Alabama I have been attacked by \"the Washington Post\" and other liberal media in a desperate attempt to smear my character and defeat my campaign. Over the last 40 years I have held several public offices, including deputy, district attorney, circuit Judge, chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court. In addition to running five state wide and three counter campaigns for public office, I have been involved in two major controversies that attracted national attention, one about the Ten Commandments, and the other about the sanctity of marriage. The Alabama judicial inquiry commission, court of the judiciary and Attorney General have investigated, scrutinized and examined and vetted me, not to mention every opposing candidate against whom I have run. I have been married for almost 33 years to my wife, and we have four children, five granddaughters. We are in the process of investigating these false allegations to determine their origin, motivation. For instance, we have documented that the most recent accuser, Beverly Nelson, was a Party in a divorce action before me in Etowah county circuit court in 1999. No motion was made for me to recuse. Nelson did not mention that I was the Judge assigned to her divorce case in 1999, a matter that apparently caused her no distress at a time that was 18 years closer to the alleged assault. Yet 18 years later while talking before the cameras about the supposed assault, she seemingly could not contain her emotions. My signature on the order of dismissal in the divorce case was annotated with the letters d and a representing the initials of my court assistant. Curiously, the supported yearbook inscription is also followed by the same initials D, A, but at the time, I was a deputy district attorney, not a district attorney. Those initials as well as the date under the signature block and a printed name of the restaurant are written in a style and consistent with the rest of the yearbook inscription. The seven and Christmas, 1977 are in a notably different script than the sevens in the date 12-22-27. I believe tampering has occurred. Are we had a stage in American politics in which false allegations can overcome a public record of 40 years, stampede the media and politicians to condemn an innocent man potentially impact the outcome of an election of national importance when allegations of events occurring 40 years ago, and never before mentioned during a 40 year career of public service, are brought out and taken seriously only 30 days before a critical election. We may be in trouble as a country. He then goes on I adamantly deny the allegations of Lee Corfman and Beverly Nelson, that I did not date underage girls and have taken steps to begin a civil action for defamation, because of that at the discretion of counsel, I cannot comment further. Roy Moore. Now we've demanded rightly answers from Judge Moore. He provided them to the specific questions we ask. In my opinion, so serious, the people of Alabama, they need to know the truth, and they've got to have all the facts that they need. That means that the Alabama voters can make an educated, informed, inclusive decision for their state when they go to the polls. And if that means -- whatever it means to get to the truth, if it means more time, I believe the governor according to Gregg Jarrett has the ability to make that decision. At the Alabama people deserve that. Gregg Jarrett said the governor can delay the race if need be. Now the people of Alabama deserve to have a fair choice, especially in light of the new allegations tonight. Now we have told you everyone's point of view. At the accusers continue to have an open invitation to come on the show and share their story. At the end of the day, I want to tell you something. I lived in Alabama, I enjoyed my time in Alabama. And I know these people. They are smart, they are great Americans, god, family, faith, country, and I am very confident that when everything comes out, they will make the best decision for their state. Shouldn't be decided by me, by people on television, by Mitch McConnell, Washington, talk show hosts, news people. One more thing, there's a report, by the way of sexual misconduct in Congress. I'm demanding tonight they pay $15 million of your money -- that was paid out to victims, who are they? Tell us now and why did they pay it? They need to be exposed.

I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky. CLINTON, AUG. 17 ,1998: Indeed I did have a relationship with Miss Lewinsky that was not appropriate. In fact, it was wrong."

Watch this. OK, sorry, it didn't show up. Now, next is Kathleen Willey. I've interviewed her many times. She is a former volunteer White House aide and accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct in 1993. I have interviewed Kathleen Willey many times about this encounter. This now gets worse and worse.

And George Stephanopoulos, he wrote in his memoir that in 1991 Hillary Clinton said, quote, \"We have to destroy her\" when destroying one of Clinton's accusers. Now, we did reach out to the Clintons for comment about all of this, of course they never got back to us. That's not surprising considering everything that they did, everything the Democrats and the media enabled and covered up, almost 30 years. The Clintons over these years have been given a free pass by their political party and their friends and their allies in the news media, you know, the ones they colluded within in the last campaign. And up until just a few days ago, the media and Democrats viciously attacking Bill Clinton's accusers. Here's what they said about Clinton's accusers just last year in the 2016 election. Watch this. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE, \"EVENING NEWS\"/CBS, MAY 19, 2016: A trio of women who say Bill Clinton made unwanted sexual advances in the 80s and 90s. Mr. Clinton denies it. Two of the cases were plagued by factual discrepancies. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE, CNN, JAN. 17, 2016: When it was Bill Clinton's problem, almost in the moment Republicans tried to make it an issue and it didn't work, so why is it going to work 20 years later with his wife?

Where were you when these accusers were coming forward? Why did you trash and discredit these women on a regular basis? And I want to tell you another thing, unlike the rest of the abusively biased news media in this country, I did go down and take this seriously, sat down with them, let them tell their stories before I made a decision in these cases. You know what? Why couldn't the press do the same thing? Here's why. The media has protected Democrats, people like the Clintons, by enabling their abuses and predatory behavior for decades. And guess what? Countless women suffered as a result. So, this is important as a history lesson. We are, you know, here tonight -- where all the apologies to those women, the Clinton accusers, attacked by the campaign, by that war room? George Stephanopoulos worked in the war room. James Carville smeared by Hillary Clinton, discredited by the mainstream media. Isn't it about time they all had their day of reckoning? My answer to Judge Moore is coming up later. Joining us now with their reaction, Fox News correspondent-at-large Geraldo Rivera, conservative columnist Monica Crowley. This was last year they were still doing this. And the thing is, it was systematic because of their policies, and the sanctimony, the self-righteousness that exists today by some of the very people that enabled, they colluded with Hillary.

Because if you don't, you are no better than Hillary Clinton, who always when confronted with wrongdoing says, oh my bad, and now it's time to move on. No, here's my challenge to them. You put your money where your mouths are. You all have platforms now. Give those platforms, give airtime and coverage to Kathleen Willey, Juanita Broaddrick, Paula Jones, Gennifer Flowers, any woman over the last 20 years who has been dismissed as fake news. You give them airtime, as much coverage as you are getting now to Roy Moore, you now have a chance to reverse your mistake. If you are telling us now that you made a mistake, now is your chance to fix it, and don't just give them a forum. Investigate what they've been telling us for the last 20 years.

At the one where she destroyed it all and bleach bit at all. According to the FBI, the deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe issued an email declaring that the Clinton investigation has been given \"special status and would be handled by a small team of high- ranking FBI officials.\" Wow, also tonight, Hillary Clinton saying the appointment of a special counsel to investigate uranium one would be an abuse of power. Here now, national security strategist former deputy assistant to the President Sebastian Gorka. Doctor Gorka, on top of the fact that we now know Comey was writing the exoneration letter before he did his investigation. This goes into him changing the words, extreme carelessness, instead of gross negligence, all done on purpose. Seriously? Who are these people? Why did she get special consideration? No equal justice under the law?"

If you are I had put secret, top secret SAP emails onto a private server, you would think McCabe would have written emails detailing how our case was being specially handled by senior FBI agents being shot away from the average procedures inside the bureau? I don't think so. The question is, does having the last name Clinton mean that you get a pass? You get a pass on doing things that are illegal? That you have things such as serious investigations relabeled simply \"matters\" to deflate their significance. The decisions are made before the investigation is actually executed. We have a problem. Don't get me wrong, I've worked with thousands of FBI agents and analysts, and they are fine patriots and they are keeping the nation safe, but at the highest level of the bureau we have issues, and McCabe's behavior during his wife's political campaign as an FBI senior agent, actually on social media promoting his Democrat wife, his wife receiving hundreds of thousands of dollars. There are hatch issues as well, which raise the questions of just how impartial is McCabe?"

The Loretta Lynch meeting and changing the language and making decisions ahead of time, and I am told from my sources tonight this is only going to get worse, the fix was in, as I've been saying. What about the Republican house and senate investigators today? Launching their effort to secure the evidence from federal agencies about this uranium one deal, the corruption case as they prepare to interview the FBI informant, this new informant was telling the FBI a year and a half for four uranium one that there was a network in the United States. He had his own experience, he had emails, and he had documents. He had tapes where he knew bribery, extortion, money laundering, racketeering was all happening."

Those should be used in the court of law to prosecute everybody involved with uranium one who undermined the American national security. The fact here is we have a very, very serious issue of not only is the law being done, but is it seemed to be done as well? Is justice blind, or is there special preferential treatment being given? This story gets deeper and deeper and deeper, and don't forget, Loretta Lynch threatened that person with loss of freedom."

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Welcome back to \"Hannity,\" you may remember last night I addressed the Roy Moore issue at the end of the program. I decided to do it again at the end of the program tonight to be consistent in terms of where we put in the program. It's important. Three more women have today come forward making accusations against senate candidate Judge Roy Moore. Clearly this now raises new issues in the state of Alabama. Things are getting worse, and now very tough on the voters of Alabama. I lived there, I will talk about that in the second. Last night on this broadcast I demanded answers from Judge Moore. When the Judge's story broke. Just a reminder, I laid out a history. I don't rush to judgment, and I said these allegations are so serious, they should all transcend politics. Sadly, it's not, but it should. I'm never going to apologize for not rushing to judgment. The issue of presumption of innocence is important to all of us. However, these allegations are beyond disturbing and serious. I have a 16-year-old daughter. Ivanka Trumps said something today. There is a special place in hell for people who prey on children. Ivanka Trump is right. There is a special place in hell for predators that is something everyone should agree with. That should not be political. Now with George Moore, unlike everyone else in the media, I went right to the source. I interviewed him. I went to \"the Washington Post\" allegations methodically, point by point through each and every allegation in \"the Washington Post\" in that piece, and I let him respond. Shockingly, for the first time in my life, even the liberals praised that interview. Rarity for me. For me and so many others, because what happened in that interview, it did raise new questions. Then came the issue of the yearbook that allegedly shows Judge Moore's message to one of his accusers, and that is why for the sake of the people of Alabama last night I demanded answers. They deserve them. Those people of Alabama deserve them before an election. And today we got the answers to the questions that we ask. Let me give you Judge Roy Moore's attorney in a press conference and question the validity of the yearbook signature. He said it could be forged and demanded a forensic analysis. I spoke to a forensic analyst on my radio show today. He said they will be able to tell if the ink is fresh or not, and they will be able to look at comparisons to his handwriting then and in that your book and determine if it was his. Judge Moore today, late tonight released a letter to me. Let me read it to you. I will read it in full. I think that is fair. Dear Sean, I'm suffering the same treatment of the Republicans have had to endure. A month prior to the general election to U.S. Senate in Alabama I have been attacked by \"the Washington Post\" and other liberal media in a desperate attempt to smear my character and defeat my campaign. Over the last 40 years I have held several public offices, including deputy, district attorney, circuit Judge, chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court. In addition to running five state wide and three counter campaigns for public office, I have been involved in two major controversies that attracted national attention, one about the Ten Commandments, and the other about the sanctity of marriage. The Alabama judicial inquiry commission, court of the judiciary and Attorney General have investigated, scrutinized and examined and vetted me, not to mention every opposing candidate against whom I have run. I have been married for almost 33 years to my wife, and we have four children, five granddaughters. We are in the process of investigating these false allegations to determine their origin, motivation. For instance, we have documented that the most recent accuser, Beverly Nelson, was a Party in a divorce action before me in Etowah county circuit court in 1999. No motion was made for me to recuse. Nelson did not mention that I was the Judge assigned to her divorce case in 1999, a matter that apparently caused her no distress at a time that was 18 years closer to the alleged assault. Yet 18 years later while talking before the cameras about the supposed assault, she seemingly could not contain her emotions. My signature on the order of dismissal in the divorce case was annotated with the letters d and a representing the initials of my court assistant. Curiously, the supported yearbook inscription is also followed by the same initials D, A, but at the time, I was a deputy district attorney, not a district attorney. Those initials as well as the date under the signature block and a printed name of the restaurant are written in a style and consistent with the rest of the yearbook inscription. The seven and Christmas, 1977 are in a notably different script than the sevens in the date 12-22-27. I believe tampering has occurred. Are we had a stage in American politics in which false allegations can overcome a public record of 40 years, stampede the media and politicians to condemn an innocent man potentially impact the outcome of an election of national importance when allegations of events occurring 40 years ago, and never before mentioned during a 40 year career of public service, are brought out and taken seriously only 30 days before a critical election. We may be in trouble as a country. He then goes on I adamantly deny the allegations of Lee Corfman and Beverly Nelson, that I did not date underage girls and have taken steps to begin a civil action for defamation, because of that at the discretion of counsel, I cannot comment further. Roy Moore. Now we've demanded rightly answers from Judge Moore. He provided them to the specific questions we ask. In my opinion, so serious, the people of Alabama, they need to know the truth, and they've got to have all the facts that they need. That means that the Alabama voters can make an educated, informed, inclusive decision for their state when they go to the polls. And if that means -- whatever it means to get to the truth, if it means more time, I believe the governor according to Gregg Jarrett has the ability to make that decision. At the Alabama people deserve that. Gregg Jarrett said the governor can delay the race if need be. Now the people of Alabama deserve to have a fair choice, especially in light of the new allegations tonight. Now we have told you everyone's point of view. At the accusers continue to have an open invitation to come on the show and share their story. At the end of the day, I want to tell you something. I lived in Alabama, I enjoyed my time in Alabama. And I know these people. They are smart, they are great Americans, god, family, faith, country, and I am very confident that when everything comes out, they will make the best decision for their state. Shouldn't be decided by me, by people on television, by Mitch McConnell, Washington, talk show hosts, news people. One more thing, there's a report, by the way of sexual misconduct in Congress. I'm demanding tonight they pay $15 million of your money -- that was paid out to victims, who are they? Tell us now and why did they pay it? They need to be exposed. We will have more on this tomorrow night. Laura Ingraham is next. Laura. Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2017 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.
