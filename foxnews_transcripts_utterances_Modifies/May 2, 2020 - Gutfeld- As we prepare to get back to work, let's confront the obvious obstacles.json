So, what to expect from this crew as we get back to work? More armchair quarterbacking, questioning the timing, the phases, the risk, and so on, which is fine.  If there's a problem, they'll find it and pin it on you know who, not the Chinese, of course, who needs Red China when you have Orange Godzilla.  So for the media and us, humans, let's introduce Gutfeld's Law, which goes like this. If you contributed nothing at the time of the event, then you can't point fingers in the future. Meaning if you have no suggestions of when to go back to work or when to shut down the economy or when to shut down travel or not and you have no evidence that you ever the contrary, then take your future analysis and shove it up your ass.  If you had no skin in the game, you have no place at the table.   And then there's the next obstacle. The politicians, who, of course are going to politic, exploiting real problems for their own political survival. Every democrat will blame Trump for the pandemic. Adam Schiff will lead the way already announcing he will be helming a commission which is hilarious given that his other quixotic misadventure, the impeachment proceedings allowed the outbreak to take us by surprise. You know, I won't say Adam has blood on his hands. But if you were underwater, he'd be mistaken for a lobster. Flatten him and he'd make a terrific sunset.  And then of course, there's Hillary suddenly appearing as Joe Biden implodes like a drooling vulture eyeing a desiccated hiker. She pretended to be at his virtual Town Hall to endorse Joe, but really, it was an opportunity for her to knock Trump who humiliated her in 2016 while hoping, obviously for a rematch, but you know, I think Biden did a pretty good job.

We've talked this thing out before. We're smart adults. We can be trusted. I mean, we flattened the curve like pros. Not bad for our first time ever. It's a lesson for all you undergrads taking courses on American History where your feeble, bitter professors portray the country as oppressive, genocidal, greedy -- it's all BS. This evil capitalist society in fact just put its entire system in jeopardy in order to save the sick, the weak, the old. You know, even Sweden didn't do that, and aren't they the model for progressive compassion? I do love their fish.  Now, the President's Economic Recovery Taskforce released a study predicting that a fast reopening will end America's recession with a quick recovery in the fall. I know this because I read it in their press release. I hope they're right. I think we all kind of feel like we're at a baseball game in the 15th inning and we just want this damn thing to end.   Instead, you don't want to go home. You want to leave home and go to work. You know, which reminds me I'm hoping a litigation shield will be attached to these bailout, so companies can get back to work without worrying that they might get sued by a guy who claims he got the corona from your barstool.  Fact is, you're not going to restart civilization if lawyers are in the room. Imagine if they were present in other world defining moments. You think Columbus would have discovered America? No way says a 15th Century Ralph Nader with those awful working conditions in those ships. You think Ben Franklin would have enticed electricity with a kite? No. Where the hell is his permit and his helmet? Although he looks like he's wearing one. And forget discovering penicillin, it's a mole. Think of the allergies. So, maybe let's be a little reasonable. We're all trying. We're all on the same team.   So, while we all go back to work, maybe you lawyers take half days, chill out, catch a movie, because there's good news coming. We've got promising drugs, flattened curves, newly adopted hygiene practices, and good people like you doing great things. That's the real weapon. Fact is, computer models, whether for climate or disease, never factor in human ingenuity. It can't because human ingenuity is impossible to predict, except that you know it will be there when the going gets rough. And sure enough, it showed up because you did, too. Nice job.",

I'll definitely do my part on that. But also the ability for there to be job-friendly policy. And there's a lot of policies currently in place that sort of hinder these businesses thriving. So it's not just about flipping a switch and having the economy reopen, but it's really about policies that can save and preserve jobs.  And so that's up to us to help lobby or, you know, talk with a vote essentially with those in power. As Dave mentioned, his mayor and his governor, they're in California.

They've got to pick their own slogan, why would they set themselves up for failure with one where there was obviously going to be these kinds of issues?",

Authorities say it started when 10 I.C.E. detainees refused to be tested for the coronavirus. That's after each reported having at least two symptoms of the virus that they allegedly broke windows and washing machines and pipes off the walls. It costs $25,000.00 in damage. One Houston Police officer is dead and another critically hurt after the helicopter crashed into an apartment complex. The helicopter missed the apartment buildings but clipped part of the clubhouse as it fell to the ground. No residents were hurt. They were responding to reports of bodies floating nearby.

So, what to expect from this crew as we get back to work? More armchair quarterbacking, questioning the timing, the phases, the risk, and so on, which is fine. If there's a problem, they'll find it and pin it on you know who, not the Chinese, of course, who needs Red China when you have Orange Godzilla. So for the media and us, humans, let's introduce Gutfeld's Law, which goes like this. If you contributed nothing at the time of the event, then you can't point fingers in the future. Meaning if you have no suggestions of when to go back to work or when to shut down the economy or when to shut down travel or not and you have no evidence that you ever the contrary, then take your future analysis and shove it up your ass. If you had no skin in the game, you have no place at the table. And then there's the next obstacle. The politicians, who, of course are going to politic, exploiting real problems for their own political survival. Every democrat will blame Trump for the pandemic. Adam Schiff will lead the way already announcing he will be helming a commission which is hilarious given that his other quixotic misadventure, the impeachment proceedings allowed the outbreak to take us by surprise. You know, I won't say Adam has blood on his hands. But if you were underwater, he'd be mistaken for a lobster. Flatten him and he'd make a terrific sunset. And then of course, there's Hillary suddenly appearing as Joe Biden implodes like a drooling vulture eyeing a desiccated hiker. She pretended to be at his virtual Town Hall to endorse Joe, but really, it was an opportunity for her to knock Trump who humiliated her in 2016 while hoping, obviously for a rematch, but you know, I think Biden did a pretty good job.

We've talked this thing out before. We're smart adults. We can be trusted. I mean, we flattened the curve like pros. Not bad for our first time ever. It's a lesson for all you undergrads taking courses on American History where your feeble, bitter professors portray the country as oppressive, genocidal, greedy -- it's all BS. This evil capitalist society in fact just put its entire system in jeopardy in order to save the sick, the weak, the old. You know, even Sweden didn't do that, and aren't they the model for progressive compassion? I do love their fish. Now, the President's Economic Recovery Taskforce released a study predicting that a fast reopening will end America's recession with a quick recovery in the fall. I know this because I read it in their press release. I hope they're right. I think we all kind of feel like we're at a baseball game in the 15th inning and we just want this damn thing to end. Instead, you don't want to go home. You want to leave home and go to work. You know, which reminds me I'm hoping a litigation shield will be attached to these bailout, so companies can get back to work without worrying that they might get sued by a guy who claims he got the corona from your barstool. Fact is, you're not going to restart civilization if lawyers are in the room. Imagine if they were present in other world defining moments. You think Columbus would have discovered America? No way says a 15th Century Ralph Nader with those awful working conditions in those ships. You think Ben Franklin would have enticed electricity with a kite? No. Where the hell is his permit and his helmet? Although he looks like he's wearing one. And forget discovering penicillin, it's a mole. Think of the allergies. So, maybe let's be a little reasonable. We're all trying. We're all on the same team. So, while we all go back to work, maybe you lawyers take half days, chill out, catch a movie, because there's good news coming. We've got promising drugs, flattened curves, newly adopted hygiene practices, and good people like you doing great things. That's the real weapon. Fact is, computer models, whether for climate or disease, never factor in human ingenuity. It can't because human ingenuity is impossible to predict, except that you know it will be there when the going gets rough. And sure enough, it showed up because you did, too. Nice job."

It's my garage. I've got a pretty good operation. It's time to get out there. It's time to go to work. You remember when people used to go out for a slice of pizza for lunch or you'd maybe have a drink with a friend after work, or sometimes you would just take a walk or go to the beach. I'm here in California, the People's Republic of California. In Los Angeles, specifically. I've got a progressive governor. I've got a progressive mayor. My Mayor wants me to snitch on my neighbors. My Governor doesn't want me to go to the beach. And it's like, if you're going to take the beach away from California, like why am I paying 98.8 percent in taxes, if I can go to the beach? Like Texas is looking pretty good these days. You know what I'm saying? Yes, we've got to get back to work. It's time. There's going to be some risk, but we've got to do it."

I will say that I think it's important and least the G.O.P. lawmakers have acknowledged that there needs to be liability protection in these additional phases. Absolutely. And you and I have talked about this before that, to me, the bounce back in part depends on consumer confidence, right? So, us sort of doing our part, going to bars, going to restaurants. I'll definitely do my part on that. But also the ability for there to be job-friendly policy. And there's a lot of policies currently in place that sort of hinder these businesses thriving. So it's not just about flipping a switch and having the economy reopen, but it's really about policies that can save and preserve jobs. And so that's up to us to help lobby or, you know, talk with a vote essentially with those in power. As Dave mentioned, his mayor and his governor, they're in California. If they're not doing business friendly or making business friendly decisions, then it's up to us to hold them accountable."

I think most people are, which is why I think it's so funny that -- well, it's not funny, but it's funny that Adam Schiff thinks that what everyone wants to hear right now is he is going to investigate Trump on this. And just as someone with a background in standup comedy, I want to give him some advice that is good for comedians, but also would help him in this situation, which is read the room. Like people are dying, people are losing their jobs. People are very upset. And it's not even as though he is saying I want to investigate this and see what happened so it doesn't happen again. He is saying I want to investigate Trump, see what Trump did wrong, which just exposes it as a partisan hack job, because I'm sure you could find Trump made mistakes. You could find a lot of people made mistakes, everyone made mistakes.

You know what I'm saying like, there's always going to be that one guy. You have to make changes, you have to make choices. And to piggyback off what Kat said, there's a weird visual there. People make mistakes. I myself made a mistake. And my homemade mask, I stole my wife's hair tie, because I didn't measure my face, right? So big trouble, but I need to have my mask. So, you've got to make choices. You're going to make mistakes. You're going to do things wrong. But I agree, it's time to get back.

All black people must be saying the truth. All gay people must be saying the truth. It's actually patently absurd. And the sadder thing about Biden is they've got him trapped in this basement.

Authorities say it started when 10 I.C.E. detainees refused to be tested for the coronavirus. That's after each reported having at least two symptoms of the virus that they allegedly broke windows and washing machines and pipes off the walls. It costs $25,000.00 in damage. One Houston Police officer is dead and another critically hurt after the helicopter crashed into an apartment complex.

Who would actually be surprised by reading these notes and figuring out that their goal, heaven forbid would be to investigate and see where the evidence leads them. But instead, it's for our nation's cops to get him fired or to prosecute. I mean, this is like an episode of \"Mean Girls\" where their goal is an administrative action. I think what's so disappointing to me as well is that there's a lot of players in this entire thing that are running around skipping or doing that absurd body thing that you just showed that just cracks me up like Comey who when he publicly stated the reason that he is not prosecuting Hillary Clinton, right, it was for this code that we don't use that very much anymore.

And you know what the most annoying thing to me, always has been, is some stranger coming going, oh, can I see your puppy? Like yo, social distance. Back up. Can't touch the puppy. Look, but don't touch. I think it's a beautiful thing. Just keep people away from touching things that matter to you. I mean, I've come to understand social distancing very specifically because I tried to social distance from my family."

You can explain to your sister why you are running in horror if they're trying to approach you or embrace you, but you can't articulate to your pet. They just think they're being abandoned. This is literally like torture and when this whole thing first started, there is this older man and I see him every day walking his little dog and he came up to me -- this was like a few days into the home quarantine. And he was like, you know, we're buddies, we chat at the lake, and he asked if dogs can get it. And at that time, I thought the answer was no. So I was like, oh, no, you're fine. And he was like, oh, good. You know, I couldn't imagine not giving my dog hugs. And I just keep thinking about that. To Dave's point about the companionship and the comfort that these animals are giving so many people who are considered vulnerable, especially the elderly, I mean, get out of here.

Disgusting. Exotic dancers at the Lucky Devil Lounge -- what a great name -- in Portland, it's always Portland -- perform in the club's parking lot while drive-thru customers wait for their food order. The ladies maintain safety and social distance by performing in masks and gloves behind metal railings just like me back in the 90s when I was working my way through college. Because there is a God and the strippers have been deemed essential workers. The owner says customers are loving the new experience. I love the human penchant for innovation as well as strippers. It makes you wonder, could all businesses be improved by adding exotic dancers? Strippers at a pet shop? Strippers at a Jiffy Lube? Strippers at a strip club? Probably not this is immoral, disgusting. Cue a funny video of someone failing on a stripper pole."

It is amazing. They pay taxes. They have payroll. They have licensures. And yet they are exempt from stimulus relief dollars because of some type of morality clause that I don't believe in.

I don't know but I don't think that they do. So, if it's only 30 bucks for a stripper show and some food, then like, you really have to tip them a lot. And I'm just -- I'm glad this is working. I think it's awesome. But I'm shocked because I always thought that the stripping was like less about the boobs and more about like the emotional manipulation of men. So, either I'm wrong, or these women have figured out how to emotionally manipulate men without them even having to get out of their car, which is pretty awesome."
