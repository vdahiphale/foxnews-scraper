Plus, why is Joe Biden quoting a dictator in an American military commencement address? And what's the latest plan for big tech to track you? Raymond Arroyo has it all in Friday Follies. But first, anti-Semitism matters. That's the focus of tonight's angle. Welcome to Joe Biden's America.",

      "sentences": "Now, the recent spate of vicious attacks against Jewish Americans shouldn't surprise anyone. The fact is anti-Semitism has been comfortably housed inside the Black Lives Matter movement. And just like attacks against police officers are tolerated and even celebrated by BLM activists. So, are attacks against Jews. It's disgusting. It has the Biden Administration in a bind of its own making. The Democrats right now are obsessing on a commission to investigate that two-and-a-half-hour Capitol riot on January 6th, but they're turning a blind eye to the explosion of crime on the streets of America. And they simply refuse to confront the anti-Semitic crosscurrents in both the BLM and the critical race theory crowd. So, by refusing to renounce the Far Left's push to defund the police and instead choosing a target police practices, the Biden DOJ has made life in America more dangerous for everyone. And by refusing to call out the vile anti-Jewish sentiments expressed by their own allies, Democrats have made America far more dangerous for Jews. The origin of the thuggish tactics of the embolden anti-Semites track the tactics of BLM thugs last summer. This was the scene Tuesday in West LA, as described by an eyewitness. A large caravan of people waving Palestinian flags as they drove through several neighborhoods, members of the caravan who approached the restaurant began throwing bottles at diners outside and using anti-Semitic slurs. It was a hate crime, the witness told CBS LA, it was prepared they came to fight with Jewish people. Another witness told the station that dozens of men ran from the caravan, toured the restaurant asking who's Jewish? Now, does that remind you of anything?",

And by refusing to tackle the social pathologies at the heart of urban crime. Biden has not only made America more divided and dangerous; he spawned a terrifying wave of anti-Semitic attacks that could quickly spiral out of control. And that's the angle.

Ari, this is beyond disturbing. It's hard to watch these videos, but we must in major cities across the country going table-to-table asking, are you Jewish here?

They are hunting for Jews in the streets of America. And where's the mainstream media? In Charlottesville when a mob assembled saying we will not be replaced by Jews, the media to its credit, went nuts. It made it a lead item on the news everywhere.

And as we predicted more than a year ago, the COVID lockdowns in the summer BLM rioting had the most devastating effects on the nation's poor, but the richest among us, they thrived. Now, as Glenn Reynolds recently wrote in The New York Post, the pandemic saw a huge amount of money and power transferred to the over class of politicians, corporate managers and bureaucrats. Small businesses shut down while big box stores deemed essential remained open. The laptop class worked from home to the delight of many of its members while the working class brought them stuff. And nowhere is this divide more stark than in New York City, where the financial capital world, they saw bank smash records even as the economic effects of the pandemic linger. In fact, Wall Street Titans JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Citi, all just reported last month that they broke earnings records. So, while Goldman's David Solomon was taking the company Gulfstream to the Bahamas on weekends, what was happening to the regular workers in New York? Well, 900,000 jobs in the city disappeared. That's what, they're gone. And today, only 40 percent of those have come back. According to The New York Times economists forecast that it'll take at least a few years to gain back the balance of those lost jobs. And Barbara Byrne Denham, senior economist at the Oxford Economics, as the New York City has trailed the rest of the U.S. every single month on every single measure. Well, you hear a lot of crowing from the Democrats about wealth inequality and the need for the rich to pay their fair share. But those are meaningless cliches. The fact is, in one of the most heavily Democrat run cities in the country, liberal policies have accomplished only one thing, suffering and the brutal expansion of the gap between the haves and have nots. Our angle on the critical race theory Gold Rush last night got a lot of attention. And tonight, we have another expos an out of Florida, where parents in Palm Beach County stood up to fight the racial bullies. It's dramatic video and it's next.",

It's also robbing our students of chances to achieve. Now, what am I talking about? In the name of so-called equity and equitable outcomes, California is proposing new guidelines that would force educators to keep all students in the same level of mathematics courses until their junior year in high school. Only then would students be able to go to advanced classes, like calc or statistics. So, do you have a gifted child in your family? Well, California just doesn't care. They want to snuff out their educational achievement and trying to even everything out along the way. Former Assistant Secretary of Education Bill Evers just wrote a great piece about all of this in the journal and he joins us now. Bill, you smartly note that California is choosing basically political agitation over mathematics. But it's even more nefarious than that, isn't not?",

The fact is anti-Semitism has been comfortably housed inside the Black Lives Matter movement. And just like attacks against police officers are tolerated and even celebrated by BLM activists. So, are attacks against Jews. It's disgusting. It has the Biden Administration in a bind of its own making. The Democrats right now are obsessing on a commission to investigate that two-and-a-half-hour Capitol riot on January 6th, but they're turning a blind eye to the explosion of crime on the streets of America. And they simply refuse to confront the anti-Semitic crosscurrents in both the BLM and the critical race theory crowd. So, by refusing to renounce the Far Left's push to defund the police and instead choosing a target police practices, the Biden DOJ has made life in America more dangerous for everyone. And by refusing to call out the vile anti-Jewish sentiments expressed by their own allies, Democrats have made America far more dangerous for Jews. The origin of the thuggish tactics of the embolden anti-Semites track the tactics of BLM thugs last summer. This was the scene Tuesday in West LA, as described by an eyewitness. A large caravan of people waving Palestinian flags as they drove through several neighborhoods, members of the caravan who approached the restaurant began throwing bottles at diners outside and using anti-Semitic slurs. It was a hate crime, the witness told CBS LA, it was prepared they came to fight with Jewish people. Another witness told the station that dozens of men ran from the caravan, toured the restaurant asking who's Jewish? Now, does that remind you of anything?"

During Trump's first term, progress toward peace was being made slowly but surely with those Abraham Accords. But President Biden is well on his way to blowing all of it by saddling up to the Marxist Black Lives Matter movement, by embracing the use of this poisonous critical race theory in schools. And by refusing to tackle the social pathologies at the heart of urban crime. Biden has not only made America more divided and dangerous; he spawned a terrifying wave of anti-Semitic attacks that could quickly spiral out of control. And that's the angle. All right, joining me now Harmeet Dhillon, CEO of the Center for American Liberty and a civil rights attorney and Ari Fleischer, former White House Press Secretary and Fox News Contributor. Ari, this is beyond disturbing. It's hard to watch these videos, but we must in major cities across the country going table-to-table asking, are you Jewish here? Remember what the BLM, they said raise your fist. They were challenging these diners last summer to raise their fists for Black Lives Matter and recite the lingo of Black Lives Matter.

They're going into the Jewish sections of cities in Skokie, Illinois, West Hollywood, Los Angeles, in Manhattan, in what's called the diamond district just off of Sixth Avenue where there are a host of Jewish owned stores, and they're targeting Jews. I mean, can you imagine in the streets of America mobs going around seeking violence? And there have been assaults where they say, are you Jewish? And they're looking especially for Jews who dress differently than you or me, Jews who wear yamakas. Jews who wear tallit, which is a traditional way of Jewish dress. They are hunting for Jews in the streets of America. And where's the mainstream media? In Charlottesville when a mob assembled saying we will not be replaced by Jews, the media to its credit, went nuts. It made it a lead item on the news everywhere. Here, the media is silent as Jews are being hunted, almost silent, you can find some coverage This is not the lead the network's put it on the front page story everywhere that it should be."

And we've done a great job as a country of resolving the historical discrimination that we had there. What's happening in the Middle East is entirely different, has its own history, and deserves its own separate treatment. We have a long history in this country, by the way of some African American leaders on the left, playing into various anti-Semitic tropes about the Jewish community saying that they control the banks, they control the media, where's ours? And this type of irresponsible rhetoric now we're seeing it from members of Congress, I would not have thought that I would be seeing a Hamas caucus in the United States Congress in 2021. But that's exactly what we have right now. And we don't have enough people standing up on the other side. Democrats, because this is their problem, to stand up and condemn this and call it what it is. I mean, only a few years ago, you would have seen a lot of Democrats standing up to these bullies, to these thugs and putting them in their place. But today, they're afraid of them."

In fact, people were released from jail the next day. So, there's a lot - there's the attack on the police. This is all interwoven and other piece of Marxist world view that seeks to take down old institutions and replace them with this new leftist world view.

And if you're the right color, you get extra, you get bonuses, you get federal programs, you get treated in liberal social circles as if you were oppressed hundreds of years ago, so therefore, you're oppressed now. And therefore, you have an entitled status. As opposed to saying we are all equal in this country. And there should be no discrimination of any type against anybody for any reason. This is the America that Martin Luther King held us up to. This is the America that he challenged us to live by our founding creed that all men are created equal. Today's Leftist movement has thrown out our founding creed, they have a new creed saying we are unequal, we should discriminate, we should discriminate on the basis of skin color.

What we have lost perspective of here in the United States is our history, is our history of working across the aisle is our history of confronting our problems peacefully, making laws working together, we have lost that completely. There's no cooperation between the parties we have dating back to the 2016 election. In my - with my own two eyes, I witnessed a mob violence on political lines in the streets of San Jose. California, with one side getting away with beating the other side, Trump supporters, there was no political retribution for that. We've now seen the Black Lives Matters. We've seen the forced indoctrination of children in our schools at on an accelerated basis, and Americans have become conditioned to this. So, this is really a time to stand up and say this is not right. We have right and wrong. And this is something that all Americans need to take a stand on, regardless of politics."

Harmeet and Ari, thank you so much. And as we predicted more than a year ago, the COVID lockdowns in the summer BLM rioting had the most devastating effects on the nation's poor, but the richest among us, they thrived. Now, as Glenn Reynolds recently wrote in The New York Post, the pandemic saw a huge amount of money and power transferred to the over class of politicians, corporate managers and bureaucrats. Small businesses shut down while big box stores deemed essential remained open. The laptop class worked from home to the delight of many of its members while the working class brought them stuff. And nowhere is this divide more stark than in New York City, where the financial capital world, they saw bank smash records even as the economic effects of the pandemic linger. In fact, Wall Street Titans JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Citi, all just reported last month that they broke earnings records. So, while Goldman's David Solomon was taking the company Gulfstream to the Bahamas on weekends, what was happening to the regular workers in New York? Well, 900,000 jobs in the city disappeared. That's what, they're gone. And today, only 40 percent of those have come back. According to The New York Times economists forecast that it'll take at least a few years to gain back the balance of those lost jobs. And Barbara Byrne Denham, senior economist at the Oxford Economics, as the New York City has trailed the rest of the U.S. every single month on every single measure. Well, you hear a lot of crowing from the Democrats about wealth inequality and the need for the rich to pay their fair share. But those are meaningless cliches. The fact is, in one of the most heavily Democrat run cities in the country, liberal policies have accomplished only one thing, suffering and the brutal expansion of the gap between the haves and have nots. Our angle on the critical race theory Gold Rush last night got a lot of attention. And tonight, we have another expos an out of Florida, where parents in Palm Beach County stood up to fight the racial bullies. It's dramatic video and it's next."

In the name of so-called equity and equitable outcomes, California is proposing new guidelines that would force educators to keep all students in the same level of mathematics courses until their junior year in high school. Only then would students be able to go to advanced classes, like calc or statistics. So, do you have a gifted child in your family? Well, California just doesn't care. They want to snuff out their educational achievement and trying to even everything out along the way. Former Assistant Secretary of Education Bill Evers just wrote a great piece about all of this in the journal and he joins us now.

And California is recommending that that not be present in the schools, as you say because they say oh, well, it's inequitable. The reason it's inequitable is because many students are in poorly performing schools. And so, they're not prepared.

Students have to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, and if they fail it is their fault.

Remember, this is what killed, and he referenced it there, the 1988 presidential campaign. He stole that speech from Neil Kinnock, the labor secretary in the U.K. referencing relatives who worked in the coalmines. Turned out, never happened. And \"The Washington Post\" this week, they said, well, Biden went too far, but we're not giving him Pinocchios. Unbelievable."

And I know it will probably embarrass you for me to point you out and say that, but you predict it, and practiced your disciplines on land and sea. You've shown that you are salty. We have to make sure that women have the chance to succeed and thrive throughout their careers. It's a Chinese saying that says women hold up half the world. It's a absolutely stupid position not to make sure they represent at least half of what we do."

By the way, that bit of Chinese propaganda was intended to push women into the factories. He loves borrowing lines from foreign politicians, doesn't matter who they are. Just take the line and make it your own."

This is really dangerous. Bill Barr and others sounded the alarm when Bill Gates was talking about this a year or two ago, digital passports. It's a lousy idea.

Joining me now is Chris Bedford, senior editor at \"The Federalist\", and Mercedes Schlapp, former White House strategic comms director and a senior fellow at the American Conservative Union. All right, panel, great to see both of you. Let's begin with CNN's very trusted and completely impartial journalist Don Lemon. DON LEMON, CNN HOST, \"DON LEMON TONIGHT\": The only party now that is operating in reality is the Democratic Party. The Republican Party is obsolete. The Republican Party is not dealing and living in reality. So you cannot negotiate with a party that doesn't operate on logic. I'm not a political person. I'm a person who lives in reality. I'm a journalist."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Mercedes, he's just a journalist. And I didn't realize that the Republican Party that just gained House seats, holds 50 Senate seats, and a majority of governors' mansions, is just now obsolete."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MERCEDES SCHLAPP, FORMER WHITE HOUSE STRATEGIST COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR",
      "utterance": "OK, the only journalist that's obsolete is Don Lemon. Let's be real. This is a man who tried to rebrand himself just this past week. People were wondering if he was going to get off the television screen, which would be a nice change of pace, I think, for the American viewer. But what we are seeing is that the people in his own state are fleeing to the bright red Republican states of Florida and Texas. They are the ones gaining the congressional seats, not these blue states. And more and more I think what we are seeing when you see a border crisis in place, when you see the chaos that has happened in our schools, you're going to see a Republican Party coming back stronger than ever before going in 2022."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "And Chris, people were rightfully up in arms when that Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot, she decided she was only going to give interviews based on race, the journalists based on race. But not Lynn Sweet of \"The Chicago Times.\" LYNN SWEET, \"CHICAGO SUN-TIMES\": I just want to say from the beginning, I am not troubled by this. I have been part of the Chicago press corps for a long, long time. And Lori Lightfoot did not say anything that we did not know."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Chris, I don't know where to start with this. But she was making a racist comment with racist underpinnings, but I guess journalists are just fine with having no access to any black mayor at this point. They are completely fine with that. They're fine with generally going along with anything that she would say right then, as long as it's not a Republican, or as long as it's not a conservative. But there is one aspect of this that I found kind of interesting, and that is that Mayor Lori Lightfoot actually has a lot to answer to to black and brown people in her city. The violence that's been spiking, the riots they've endured, the shops that have been destroyed have absolutely seriously affected that community. She floats above it, and she tries to throw out this critical race garbage right here as some kind of token of her good will. There are people who are black and brown in her city who she should be answering to. They're just not the journalists. They're the people who live there."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Excellent point. We've talked a lot on this show about how unnecessary and obviously in bad faith this January 6th commission is. But here is what CNN's John Harwood thinks."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JOHN HARWOOD, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "There is no good reason, none, for a member of Congress to oppose a bipartisan commission to investigate an attack on the Congress, attack on American democracy. There are a lot of people walking around the Congress who like to project the image of patriotic boy scouts who are defining themselves as anti-American by opposing this inquiry."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Mercedes, it's anti-America to try to stop a taxpayer funded with hunt before it starts that is obviously going to be staff by Pelosi and Schumer with their choices?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCHLAPP",
      "utterance": "This is theatric coming from the left. We know that what they're trying to do here is that the Democrats are ensuring that they can talk about what happened in the capital all throughout 2022, through 2024, and four years to come. They're going to hang this around the necks of Republicans. They're going to, of course, demonize President Trump as they've done all along. And the media is going to play along with this. The liberal media is going to push this narrative that it's anti-American if you don't support this commission. Let me tell you something. We know the Justice Department. We know the FBI, they're all involved in investigating and going after the criminals who were involved in the Capitol riots. Nancy Pelosi does have to answer some questions on why she didn't have the Capitol police ready to go that day. But at the same time, there is no need for a commission. We know how these commissions play out. It's always a political tactic."

      "speaker": "JOY REID, MSNBC HOST",
      "utterance": "This war against a clear-eyed, factual understanding of our history, which is all Critical Race Theory is, it's a war against our press freedoms, too. \"The 1619 Project\" means different things to different people. For some, including myself, it's a phenomenal piece of journalism, challenging us to reframe U.S. history. The idea that somebody with the MacArthur Genius Award and a Pulitzer would not get tenure is one its face ridiculous."

      "speaker": "BEDFORD",
      "utterance": "We've covered this a lot at \"The Federalist\" and \"The Daily Caller\" and also here at FOX News. All the inaccuracies that have taken place in this reporting, the central thesis of Nikole Hannah-Jones reporting on this had to be retracted by \"The New York Times,\" that this is a country that was founded on slavery and that the Revolution was fought for slavery. This is a person here who has fought academic freedom, who has rooted for riots, who has taken credits for the riots that destroyed our country, that killed a dozen people, that ruined an unbelievable amount of lives over the past year. This is not academic freedom. She is a fan of violence. She is a racist. She is a fraud, and she was fired."
