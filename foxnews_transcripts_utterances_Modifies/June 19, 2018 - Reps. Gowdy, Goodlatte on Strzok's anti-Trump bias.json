The president did not take questions from reporters but he did say, \"The system has been broken for decades.\" Obviously, talking about the immigration system. Another sign, he is not backing down over the zero-tolerance policy. Earlier, before the meeting, he charges the Democrats want illegal immigrant to \"infest our country\", a clear sign that he's not backing down. But House and Senate Republicans are showing more flexibility. Saying, they'll support legislation that would allow children to stay with their parents, other loved ones while they wait for an immigration judge to deal with their cases.   And in fact, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, other top Republicans, also perhaps, seeking a political lifeline, feeling the heat, and embracing legislation to prevent families from being separated while they seek asylum at the border. Here is the interesting thing. It appears that maybe for political reasons, Democrat Chuck Schumer is blocking this legislation that would help the children he says he wants to help. Schumer said he opposes this because he believes it would be easier for the President to simply fix the problem with the stroke of a pen. But Democrats have also made clear they want to keep the pressure on the president because of those emotional pictures you mentioned at the border, they've been highlighted around the clock in recent days.  And at a House hearing today, on that I.G. report that showed major problems at the FBI, Democrats were open about saying they want to shift as much focus away from issues like that back to the border issue. As the president said, the real problem is enforcing the law.",

Now, as you know under the president's policy, the parents are now being prosecuted but we would like to see the families stay together or not separated.

You fast forward to today, and there is a lot of focus on the enforcement side of this policy. And I know that zero tolerance sounds harsh, but zero tolerance simply means enforcing the law and making sure that there are consequences for actions in order to stop this problem. This what we're seeing right now is a culmination of decades of not enforcing the idea that crossing into America without permission is, in fact, a crime. This administration is going after people who do that and hopes that it will deter people from coming here. And inevitably, Congress is going to have to do something. Ted Cruz introduced legislation today, yesterday to try and stop this from happening and to keep families together.

And when you look at the types of people who are coming over, 83 percent of these -- of the people that are crossing are individual unaccompanied minors that leaves the other 18-17 percent being family units, at least, they claimed to be. There are very serious reasons why ICE is deciding to separate adults from children for the first reason being making sure that they're not being trafficked. The second reason being there is no proof that these adults are actually the parents of the children. So, again there are solutions on the table to change the way this is handled. Is up to Congress to do this not the executive branch. The ICE is simply doing their job and enforcing the law. And you can say that this is a horrible humanitarian situation, but my question is why is it our fault? Why are we not holding accountable to parents who sent their children alone through Mexico? Why aren't we looking at the inhumanity of little girls taking birth control shots and bringing along plan B along the way because the horrible awful inhumane things that are going to happen to them as a result of an open border?  This goes again to the very crux of the issue and the strongly held belief that the left doesn't want prosecution of the crime of entering the country illegally, and that provides inhumane conditions for children that you were seeing today in those detention facilities.",

The president did not take questions from reporters but he did say, \"The system has been broken for decades.\" Obviously, talking about the immigration system. Another sign, he is not backing down over the zero-tolerance policy. Earlier, before the meeting, he charges the Democrats want illegal immigrant to \"infest our country\", a clear sign that he's not backing down. But House and Senate Republicans are showing more flexibility. Saying, they'll support legislation that would allow children to stay with their parents, other loved ones while they wait for an immigration judge to deal with their cases. And in fact, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, other top Republicans, also perhaps, seeking a political lifeline, feeling the heat, and embracing legislation to prevent families from being separated while they seek asylum at the border. Here is the interesting thing. It appears that maybe for political reasons, Democrat Chuck Schumer is blocking this legislation that would help the children he says he wants to help. Schumer said he opposes this because he believes it would be easier for the President to simply fix the problem with the stroke of a pen. But Democrats have also made clear they want to keep the pressure on the president because of those emotional pictures you mentioned at the border, they've been highlighted around the clock in recent days. And at a House hearing today, on that I.G. report that showed major problems at the FBI, Democrats were open about saying they want to shift as much focus away from issues like that back to the border issue. As the president said, the real problem is enforcing the law."

White House officials, meanwhile, suggesting me tonight, the President may be willing to sign one of these bills floating around the House and the Senate to fix this problem at the border but he also wants to include other key provisions. Money for building the wall, other border security measures, those are measures Democrats oppose. So, frankly, we're still at a stalemate, Sandra."

      "speaker": "MCCAUL",
      "utterance": "He's very enthusiastic, optimistic, he expressed in his words. He said, \"I'm a thousand percent behind what you're trying to pass in the House. There will be two bills going to the floor on Thursday, the McCaul- Goodlatte bill, the original version, and then, the modified version. Both are very similar in terms of the four pillars, border security as the president wants and both provide for a DACA fix. And I think, importantly on this issue of family separation, it also addresses that issue because it will detain the family as a unit rather than separate them out."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SMITH",
      "utterance": "What happens if you find out that it's not a family member, it's not a parent that's traveling over the border with that child?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCCAUL",
      "utterance": "Well, that's the fundamental problem. As we've neglected the border in this crisis. In 2014, we had 20 million of these children crossing it's enticing to come over. And so, we have a lot of fraudulent parents. People that aren't even their parents saying they are the parents. Now, as you know under the president's policy, the parents are now being prosecuted but we would like to see the families stay together or not separated. But I think, most importantly from my position as the chairman of Homeland Security is to have a border security bill passed for the first time since we passed the Secure Fence Act in 2006, that's a long time ago. And this also fundamentally changes immigration to a merit-based system rather than a random lottery system or chain migration."

      "speaker": "MCCAUL",
      "utterance": "One thing metrics are important. I think the operation could control the border, and you can't quantify that in terms of how many people are illegally -- it's illegally entering the country. And the fact is because we have these legal loopholes, and the beginning when Trump had the rhetoric about the wall, and such the numbers went way down. The problem is they know that was just a rhetoric and that Congress has to change the laws and the legal loopholes. Otherwise, if they come they can stay. And that's the message that the smugglers and traffickers are selling to these victims at the price of six thousand dollars a person bringing them into the country. We will never stop this problem until we dry up the deterrent issue and the legal loopholes that exist thoroughly."

When you look on at that and you see the disgust from the American people and even from members of your own party and on the other side of the aisle, what is being left out of this national conversation based on what you see every day?"

But again, Sandra, we're not going to stop this problem. It's going to continue to keep going on and on until we fix our immigration system. And that's what we're trying to do on Thursday, in addition of fixing DACA. I hope the Democrats will want to work with us to fix separation families issue."

Alida Garcia served as the National Latino vote deputy director for President Obama's 2012 reelection campaign. And is the coalitions and policy director at Ford U.S. I want to get your thoughts first, Katie. I know that this is an issue you have been on for many years and following the changes here and now the new -- this implementation and this enforcement by the Trump administration you've been listening in. What are your thoughts tonight?"

In 2014, Townhall published photos from inside an (INAUDIBLE) processing center showing these children coming across the border and being detained in these facilities under the Obama administration. There were a number of journalists who were doing this work, but it did not blow up into this national narrative. You fast forward to today, and there is a lot of focus on the enforcement side of this policy. And I know that zero tolerance sounds harsh, but zero tolerance simply means enforcing the law and making sure that there are consequences for actions in order to stop this problem. This what we're seeing right now is a culmination of decades of not enforcing the idea that crossing into America without permission is, in fact, a crime. This administration is going after people who do that and hopes that it will deter people from coming here. And inevitably, Congress is going to have to do something. Ted Cruz introduced legislation today, yesterday to try and stop this from happening and to keep families together. It's up to Democrats now to come to the table with their solutions to make this different moving forward."

      "utterance": "Well thank you for having me. It's really hard to hear words of zero tolerance being downplayed. I just -- I woke up in McAllen, Texas this morning, which is ground zero of the family separation crisis. And yesterday afternoon, I spent my afternoon giving cough syrup to a number of children who had been sleeping on the floor in cold cages and all had a cold. And so, it's really important at time work that this time when we go back in forth with the politics of this moment that we understand these are small children who have been taken hostage by this administration in order to put forth a political agenda that incarcerates families at greater length in worse conditions. And that is just simply un-American to me."
    },

      "speaker": "SMITH",
      "utterance": "Katie, your response at Alida is making the point that this is politics over the care of those children. Your response to that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAVLICH",
      "utterance": "Politics is certainly involved, but if anybody knows what kind of children are, and the ages of the children who are in these detention centers. It's me because I've been reporting on this for years. This idea that these children are not being taken care of is just simply not true. And when you look at the types of people who are coming over, 83 percent of these -- of the people that are crossing are individual unaccompanied minors that leaves the other 18-17 percent being family units, at least, they claimed to be. There are very serious reasons why ICE is deciding to separate adults from children for the first reason being making sure that they're not being trafficked. The second reason being there is no proof that these adults are actually the parents of the children. So, again there are solutions on the table to change the way this is handled. Is up to Congress to do this not the executive branch. The ICE is simply doing their job and enforcing the law. And you can say that this is a horrible humanitarian situation, but my question is why is it our fault? Why are we not holding accountable to parents who sent their children alone through Mexico? Why aren't we looking at the inhumanity of little girls taking birth control shots and bringing along plan B along the way because the horrible awful inhumane things that are going to happen to them as a result of an open border? This goes again to the very crux of the issue and the strongly held belief that the left doesn't want prosecution of the crime of entering the country illegally, and that provides inhumane conditions for children that you were seeing today in those detention facilities."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "GOODLATTE",
      "utterance": "We are still open to working with him but he needs to understand that he has to do it on his timetable not on his. So if he's going to appear voluntary his lawyer better contact us right away because the subpoena is coming."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SMITH",
      "utterance": "Well, I think you will hear that message loud and clear. Chairman Gowdy, you talked a lot about the timeline of this text messages today. And then, the big news that the I.G. is now confirming that they are looking into whether or not this FBI agent in his bias whether it impacted the launch of the Russian investigation, that is the question. Did it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GOWDY",
      "utterance": "Well, it's the seminal question. If you look at the chronology, of course in late July of 2016 is when the Russia probe began. And you're not two weeks into it before Peter Strzok is saying we'll stop it with the 'it' being the presidency. We're not two weeks into it before he's talking about an insurance policy to make sure Donald Trump is never the president. So keep in mind, he is two weeks into an investigation and he's already talking about impeaching the target of his investigation. They hadn't done anything at that point. I mean, two weeks, the paperwork is not even processed. But yet, he is already reached his conclusion on what the outcome of that investigation is. Fast forward to what he's put on the Mueller probe, and he's talking about how important this is and how momentous it is and he's got to fix and finish what he's started with the Hillary Clinton investigation. I have never in 20 years being a prosecutor seen a law enforcement agent with this amount of animus and bias towards the target, and I hope and pray that he comes next week and portrays himself as a victim."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SMITH",
      "utterance": "I think a lot of people at this point based on that set up are going to want to see that as well. But Chairman Goodlatte, as far as now the I.G. confirming that they are looking into Peter Strzok those text messages and his role in this launch of this Russia probe, what more after those hearing wrapping up today, what more do you want to know?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GOODLATTE",
      "utterance": "Well, there are a lot of things that the inspector general was not tasked with looking at. But he also -- let's just note, that same Peter Strzok was deeply involved the lead investigator in the Hillary Clinton e- mail investigation, and at the same time he was making the statements that Trey just referred to. He was also helping a process that bent over backwards to not follow proper investigative procedures with regard to former secretary of state and then presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. That is a shocking contrast of that should be allowed again to occur in the Federal Bureau of Investigation. So we have to continue to pursue that to make sure that the 2020 presidential election or any other future investigation is not tainted by this kind of bias and not tainted by the inappropriate procedures."

      "speaker": "GOODLATTE",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HURT",
      "utterance": "Sure. And of course, obviously the markets have been all over the place for the last couple months. But you know, in the main, Donald Trump is right about this. You know, we've been at a trade war whether we like it or not, China has been in a trade war with us for decades now whether it's stealing technology or stealing designs, and then of course taking, you know, millions of jobs from this country, either furniture, textiles or whatever into China. Donald Trump ran a campaign promising to do something about it. And of course there are so many people that make a lot of money in this country or people in Washington who are unaware that we've been in this trade war for a long time because they're all making money hand over fist. There are a lot of people in places like Ohio and Pennsylvania or in my state Southern Virginia, where they are not making money, in fact, they're not working. And they haven't worked since their jobs went to China. And Donald Trump won an election promising to put people on notice about this and to do something about this. And we can debate about free trade and all that kind of stuff but he is doing what he promised to do."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SMITH",
      "utterance": "And not only it does seem to be some sort of a shock or surprise that he's following through on that. And then you can go to pre-President Donald Trump, pre-candidate Donald Trump and see the businessman Donald Trump who spoke of being tough on China."

      "speaker": "HURT",
      "utterance": "Sure it is."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SMITH",
      "utterance": "But he just had this meeting on Capitol Hill with Republicans about immigration. What did he do, I think it was Mark Meadows who stepped away to talk to Bret Baier. And Mark Meadows said the president started out the meeting saying don't worry about the trade issues with China. This was his first statement leading into that meeting with Republicans. He doesn't want anybody to worry about this, he says he's got it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HURT",
      "utterance": "Right. Because I think that and I do think that there is some wisdom in this. Donald Trump wants all of these issues, whether it's North Korea or trade or he wants all of them on the table as moving parts, that he can sort of negotiate different things. And his, you know, if he is the master at the art of the deal then he can take all of these things and make it a win. Certainly, most importantly, a win for the United States. But something that, you know, China likes, too."

But as far as losers Axios point out crude oil, U.S. coal producers, agricultural exports, whiskey, U.S. car makers. You know, looking at the near term in the long term here is one of the toughest things to do."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HURT",
      "utterance": "Sure. And there's no doubt at all that China is picking these products with an eye towards hurting Donald Trump's most ardent supporters. But again, it goes back to the same thing and that is that, we have been in a trade war for a long time with that part of the world and they have been eating our lunch. And Donald Trump ran an election. And I have to say, you know, in terms of the fair traders -- and I consider my -- I think fair trade is not only good, it's also inevitable. But the bottom line is, if you are not convincing American voters--"

You always will be. But there is a powerful force that designed you that way. If you are willing to accept that, you will have grace and grace is a gift.

      "speaker": "BILL BENNETT, CONTRIBUTOR, FOX NEWS",
      "utterance": "Yes. It was sure encouraging. I remember I gave a speech once and I talked about the role the U.S. military and I said even in godless and in eviscerated places. And someone came up to me and said, no, no, there are no godless places. Then he paused and said, well maybe Hollywood. So there is Chris Pratt taking it right on. And by the way, it's Chris Pratt. This is not the aging, sorry, Robert, but not age, Robert De Niro. This is Chris Pratt matinee idol. Have you seen \"Guardians in the Galaxy?\" have you seen the \"Jurassic Park\" new series? This is Chris Pratt, he's a heartthrob, he's a great actor. He's an action hero. And in addition, Sandra, what you heard, what we heard from when we played it, it's not just him saying it. Did you hear the audience cheering it?"

But talking about prayer and God, you have a soul. And you know, actually for the social media users and his audience to say you are not perfect was probably pretty a good idea as well. Because that stuff tends to exalt themselves to a degree that it's unheard of in human history."

What's your message?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BENNETT",
      "utterance": "Well, the message is, the truth remains the same. You can no more invent a new value or virtue than you can a new color. They've been there and they've been there a long time. The interesting thing is that when a guy like Chris Pratt says it, we all sit back and go, wow, how about that. That tells you it's not an oversupply in our world or at least in certain parts of our world. I'm very heartened by it and very encouraged by it."

There's another report about Russian collusion and that will be out, too. And if Horowitz doesn't see great fact finding job he does in that one as he did on this one that will really be something. The second thing is, history has a way of making certain kinds of statements emblematic of an age, and that statement, we will stop it, has a chance to be like Richard Nixon Watergate hearings, you remember, well, that would be wrong that's for sure. Or Bill Clinton it all depends on what the meaning of is, is. We will stop it and it may go down in history. That will be close the chapter I think and I think it's a huge political and cultural win for Donald Trump who has been saying he has been vilified, it's been unfair. Remember way back in the campaign."
