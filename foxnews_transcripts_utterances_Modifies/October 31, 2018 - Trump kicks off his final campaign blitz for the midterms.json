The Supreme Court said, 30-years-later, after the 14th Amendment, no problem. They are legal resident aliens, ergo that child can be considered for automatic birthright. The most important thing for people to consider when they talk about birthright citizenship is the context with the words 14th Amendment which ratified in 1868. It was right after the Civil War. It was during the construction period where they wanted to make sure that the slaves were given the ability to be citizens and to vote, all right? So that's the context that it came in.

That's the difference. So you cannot say that any other country in the world does this. And I think the third most important thing is not just the cost, it cost us billions because as a Supreme Court ruled a few years back any illegal, any child born here who was born here is entitled to education and health care and all that other stuff. So it will cost us billions. How do we change this? Number one, someone can take a court case up. Number two, congress can pass an act. Or number three, the president can do an executive order. But I think -- and I'm going to end here, the most significant part of this is section five of the 14th Amendment says congress has the power to enforce by appropriate legislation any provisions of this article. So they recognize that in a time when you could not anticipate illegals coming in, where the only issue in context where the slaves.

I do find it funny how liberals believe that illegal aliens crossing the border and having American babies is enshrined in our Constitution, but the right to bear arms isn't enshrined in our Constitution, major hypocrisy there. Excellent job summarizing the legal thing. The only thing I would add is what I said yesterday, the drafter of the 14th Amendment, Jacob Howard, said this should not apply to persons in the United States who are foreigners and aliens. This is a big issue because nearly 10 percent of babies born in this country are from illegal aliens.

Right now, CNN is just ripping Fox News, because they see Fox News as a proxy for America. They can't stop. But what's worse than fake news, I always believe, is the fink news.

And then -- but if Trump wins the left says, oh, all caravans are welcome and English will be ban in high school. So it's like everybody is doing -- neither reality is actually true.

The Constitution says if you're born or naturalized here and subject to the jurisdiction, you're a citizen. So then the question is, have the courts apply this? The courts have only ruled on one case and that involved a guy by the name of Juan Kemp, who was a Chinese legal resident alien. They've had a baby -- the couple had a baby who was born here. The Supreme Court said, 30-years-later, after the 14th Amendment, no problem. They are legal resident aliens, ergo that child can be considered for automatic birthright. The most important thing for people to consider when they talk about birthright citizenship is the context with the words 14th Amendment which ratified in 1868. It was right after the Civil War. It was during the construction period where they wanted to make sure that the slaves were given the ability to be citizens and to vote, all right? So that's the context that it came in. Now, there is no question that no other country in the world grants automatic citizenship."

What you've got to do is you've got have a parent who has been in that country for a period of time, not someone like in Los Angeles where two-thirds of the babies born in county run hospitals are born to illegal immigrants who just got there. That's the difference. So you cannot say that any other country in the world does this. And I think the third most important thing is not just the cost, it cost us billions because as a Supreme Court ruled a few years back any illegal, any child born here who was born here is entitled to education and health care and all that other stuff. So it will cost us billions. How do we change this? Number one, someone can take a court case up. Number two, congress can pass an act. Or number three, the president can do an executive order. But I think -- and I'm going to end here, the most significant part of this is section five of the 14th Amendment says congress has the power to enforce by appropriate legislation any provisions of this article. So they recognize that in a time when you could not anticipate illegals coming in, where the only issue in context where the slaves. And, by the way, they left out the American Indians, do you know why? Because they have jurisdiction, they're under the jurisdiction of tribal lands."

Should it be that someone can come over illegally with the sole intent of wanting to give birth to a baby that then have automatic citizenship and gains access to a bunch of benefits that citizens get here. You have to be able to question that. That doesn't mean you can write executive -- make a change, necessarily, but it does mean that the topic becomes up for debate.

Now, here's somewhat- about-ism, Juan. I do find it funny how liberals believe that illegal aliens crossing the border and having American babies is enshrined in our Constitution, but the right to bear arms isn't enshrined in our Constitution, major hypocrisy there. Excellent job summarizing the legal thing. The only thing I would add is what I said yesterday, the drafter of the 14th Amendment, Jacob Howard, said this should not apply to persons in the United States who are foreigners and aliens. This is a big issue because nearly 10 percent of babies born in this country are from illegal aliens. But, you have to combine this with the law and eliminating the lottery and eliminating the chain migration because right now it's out of control."

I blame the people who don't fix the system once they know the loophole is there. And I think Donald Trump understands how people see unfairness in this because he's always about reciprocity and fairness. And you get angry. The most fundamental human anger is when somebody cuts in front of you. The thing that drives me crazy, when you try to get from the airport to the rental car agency and you get on the tram and the last person on gets to be the first person in line at the rental car agency. I don't think I ever get as mad as I get at that point. When I go, I've been waiting here for 20 minutes and this guy -- then all of a sudden, he's first in line. That's bogus.

But here's another example of how the left injects politics into everything. Remember when politics stayed in its ugly little lane? Now it's all over the place. It's in sports. It's in movies, your desert. That's what happens when you decide that the personal is now political. You can't escape it. Look at the label. Maybe it's me, but I prefer not to be glared at while eating ice cream. I get that at home without the curtain. But thanks to the left, keeping politics out of regular life is seen as complicit to evil. If you don't join our mad crusade, you're the problem too. Now, I bet this stuff tastes good but who cares. The company says that by purchasing this glop, you will be supporting, quote, groups who are fighting President Trump's regressive agenda. But they should add while also adding to your deadly obesity because isn't that what Ben & Jerry's does? They speak calories to power. According to the NIH, obesity -- being overweight leads to 300,000 deaths per year in the U.S. That's second only to smoking. The math is simple. If obesity kills that many people a year and ice cream makes you obese, how large a role does Ben & Jerry's play in this? Aren't they part of the problem? They're like overweight Marlboro man. Maybe that's why they play up the activism. They want you to think their heart is in the right place as they're busy clogging yours. All right, judge, this doesn't make me want to eat ice cream. I like it to be fun."

Timing is not something over which they have any control. They mostly leave with nothing, and when you think about the time of year, you have little kids who want to have some sense of normalcy in their lives. So in New York, My Sister's Place, which is a shelter, takes in nearly 15,000 women and children every year who seek refuge from violence. I've been on that board for 30 years. They worked to end violence in intimate relationships and combat the effects as it relates to children. The next time you go to buy a Halloween costume, buy two. Help a child who's not at home anymore. Send it to your local shelter for battered women and now visit MSPNY.org to learn how you can donate."
