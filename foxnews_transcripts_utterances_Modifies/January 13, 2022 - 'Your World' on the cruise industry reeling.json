But it's also something that is not an emergency in the way that this type of short-circuiting the regulatory system is supposed to work. And so it wasn't a complete surprise that we saw the court here going in the direction that they were already going during oral arguments and saying, yes, we're not going to get into weighing whether this is a good rule or a bad rule, but we're just saying that OSHA does not have the authority to do it, and, in particular, doesn't have the authority to do it in this emergency way, where they evade all the regular process that they would normally have to go through.",

My guys are going to go down the street to my competition, who has under 100 employees, and isn't affected. And he said, and then I have got trucks off the street and can't make my deliveries.

The option is what happens in the House. Every time the House changes parties, they send a lot of bills over to the Senate that aren't going anywhere because they're too drastically headed in one direction. And then the next time it changes parties, they send bills over that would have reversed those bills if those bills would have ever become law. That's certainly not what you need. And, also, what we have got here is an attempt to once again federalize something that's been working well for a couple hundred years. I think states and local election officials are the place for elections to be conducted. There's generally been a consensus on that for decades, including President Obama in 2016 saying the diversity of the election system in America was one of the strengths of the system. The bill that come over from the House is 765 pages. It's not a reiteration of the 12-page 1965 Voting Rights Act. It's a federal takeover of elections. It is not the right way to go. And I think Democrats are not going to be able to get this done. But, more importantly, you had Senator Sinema and I think other Democrats may now step up and say, we're not for changing the rules. We don't want the House to become the Senate. The economic impact of that uncertainty, the regulatory impact of that constant uncertainty would all be bad.

It is an insidious tax on people, if the government doesn't manage the economy in a way that maintains a low inflation rate.

So, we take them at their word. And, certainly, we're encouraged by the data we saw from December."

But, first, I want to bring in Judicial Crisis Network president Carrie Severino. And, Carrie, I follow -- I followed some of your comments leading up to today. And one that caught me was the question that was asked during this was that this whole thing was -- quote -- \"trying to squeeze an elephant into a mouse hole\" with respect to OSHA having this sort of authority. Was that one of the many tells that maybe this would have been the decision?"

    {
      "speaker": "CARRIE SEVERINO, CHIEF COUNSEL AND POLICY DIRECTOR, JUDICIAL CRISIS NETWORK",
      "utterance": "Yes, that was Justice Alito in oral arguments last week. And the mouse hole really is that the extent of authority OSHA has. They're supposed to be regulating things that have to do with the workplace, and then things that are really emergency things that come up. As the court pointed out, not only does this go well beyond things that happen in the workplace. It's not a workplace-based type of risk, like having to wear hardhats or something. But it's also something that is not an emergency in the way that this type of short-circuiting the regulatory system is supposed to work. And so it wasn't a complete surprise that we saw the court here going in the direction that they were already going during oral arguments and saying, yes, we're not going to get into weighing whether this is a good rule or a bad rule, but we're just saying that OSHA does not have the authority to do it, and, in particular, doesn't have the authority to do it in this emergency way, where they evade all the regular process that they would normally have to go through."

    {
      "speaker": "PAYNE",
      "utterance": "Right. Yes. And many people who criticized this from the very beginning felt the administration knew this probably would be unconstitutional, found the best agency to try to sneak it through. And, obviously, that didn't work. What about the White House, though, their argument that people are dying every day, and that this is the sort of emergency that the Supreme Court should have taken into consideration?"

And what the court pointed out is, it's one thing if there's something that there was some meltdown of the plant that they needed to address in a quick way in one workplace. This is not something that just happened overnight. This is a pandemic that's been with us for two years. Even in the case of the administration itself, they announced this rule in September. They don't come up with an actual regulation until November. And then they didn't enforce it until January. If this was the kind of thing that needs to happen overnight, it wouldn't be behaving this way."

      "utterance": "Carrie, it's a 6-3 decision, all the so-called conservative justices going the same way. Just moments ago, President Biden saying that he was disappointed that the Supreme Court has chosen to block commonsense, lifesaving requirements. This is the second time this week that he's taken a shot at the Supreme Court. Are you concerned at all about the sort of relationship? I know the framers knew this might be the case and they designed it a certain way. But it feels like there's a growing animosity toward doing something to make the Supreme Court friendlier to this particular White House."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SEVERINO",
      "utterance": "You know, President Biden is certainly entitled to his opinion about the decisions. What really concerns me are, one, the types of decisions that we have seen from him where he has actually flouted the court's authority. We saw that in the eviction mandate case, where the court clearly was saying this is unconstitutional. He went full steam ahead the opposite direction, and then also concerns about the court-packing initiative. So if you're trying to intimidate the court by saying, well, we're going to pack extra justices onto it, like FDR spectacularly failed in doing so even amongst his own party, that's the kind of thing that concerns me. He's certainly welcome to disagree with the court."

Elaine, the fines started at $6,00, up to $136,000. I mean, this would have been one heck of a financial burden. And it already probably has had a major negative impact on businesses anyway."

It's a great day for our small business owners, because, from the beginning, the administration framed this as a big business mandate. And the reality is, it affected businesses that had 100 employees or more. The administration's own Small Business Administration defines a small businesses as any company under 500. So we were really concerned about that population in that 100 to 500 range. And that's why we took up this lawsuit. We were the first small business organization to file against the Biden administration. We were the first to petition the Supreme Court and asking them to block this mandate. So we're very excited that the Supreme Court blocked this mandate. It would have had a disproportionately negative effect on our small businesses, who can least afford it when they're facing massive inflation and labor shortages."

      "speaker": "PAYNE",

If you look at the lawsuits, from your lawsuit, National Retail Federation, the National Federation of Independent Businesses, truckers, all of the folks that we needed to help get us out of this supply chain issue to help keep us alive, to help keep the networks going, they were the ones most impacted by this. And yet it felt like the White House was tone-deaf. Did you ever get a chance to reach out to the White House and say, this isn't the way to go about this?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PARKER",
      "utterance": "We certainly did speak with the White House and OSHA officials when they were bringing -- writing the rule, actually, and stated our case. We talked about some of our small business owners who actually were co- plaintiffs on our lawsuits. And you mentioned trucking. We had a trucking company in the Northeast -- or -- I'm sorry -- in the Midwest who -- it was a refrigerated trucking company. So they were moving food from place to place and delivering to grocery stores. They were deemed essential during the pandemic and during all the shutdowns. But this mandate was going to disproportionately affect him. He couldn't afford to lose a single trucker because he was already experiencing massive labor shortages. And he said, what's the science between somebody who has 99 employees and somebody who has 100 employees? My guys are going to go down the street to my competition, who has under 100 employees, and isn't affected. And he said, and then I have got trucks off the street and can't make my deliveries. So it was going to be a huge burden on our small businesses. This is a huge win for small businesses, great day in America. And I hope that the administration does not continue their legal fight when it's sent back to the Sixth Circuit."

      "utterance": "Well, I think what the Senate is going to be doing is moving forward as the unique body the Senate is, where we have the ability to reach some consensus before you move forward. The option is what happens in the House. Every time the House changes parties, they send a lot of bills over to the Senate that aren't going anywhere because they're too drastically headed in one direction. And then the next time it changes parties, they send bills over that would have reversed those bills if those bills would have ever become law. That's certainly not what you need. And, also, what we have got here is an attempt to once again federalize something that's been working well for a couple hundred years. I think states and local election officials are the place for elections to be conducted. There's generally been a consensus on that for decades, including President Obama in 2016 saying the diversity of the election system in America was one of the strengths of the system. The bill that come over from the House is 765 pages. It's not a reiteration of the 12-page 1965 Voting Rights Act. It's a federal takeover of elections. It is not the right way to go. And I think Democrats are not going to be able to get this done. But, more importantly, you had Senator Sinema and I think other Democrats may now step up and say, we're not for changing the rules. We don't want the House to become the Senate. The economic impact of that uncertainty, the regulatory impact of that constant uncertainty would all be bad. And I hope we can continue through the rest of this Congress to maintain that unique ability that the Senate has, where you have to work with the other side."

    {
      "speaker": "PAYNE",
      "utterance": "Right. Right. And, of course, that's Senator Manchin and Sinema both have expressed that they believe that is a sacred part of the job. What about the messaging part of this? It's -- the notion -- and it dovetails with an overarching narrative that's been building up that, if the Republicans win the midterm and the next presidential election, democracy in itself is at great risk, that this country will never look the same. But now that -- you mentioned the Voting Rights Act of 1960 -- 1965. It was extended in 2006 for another 25 years, yet the narrative is that it's -- there's an urgency or lots of folks, including black Americans, will lose the right to vote. How dangerous is that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BLUNT",
      "utterance": "Well, it's very dangerous. And what the Democrats are doing here is destroying faith in a system that people should have every reason to have faith in. They're looking at states that leaned forward in 2000 (sic) and did some things they'd never done before because of the pandemic environment. When that election was over, those states looked back, and I think, in virtually every case, they kept some of the things that they thought should become permanently part of the system. But other things they might have done, like drive-in voting and mailing ballots to everybody that -- in various states, didn't meet the long-term standard."

I think one of the big winners today was probably the Biden administration by not having to go forward with something that had all kinds of consequences that they hadn't anticipated. We just heard the person you had talking about various businesses where you could go from the 100-employer business to the 90-employer business. You could go, Charles, from the 100-employer-or-more police force to the 20- employer police force or the fire force, of people working at grocery stores that have more than 100 employees. What happens if they decide they can make just as much money working somewhere across the street, and, suddenly, if you even had things to put on the shelves, another problem we're facing right now, even if you had things to put on the shelves, you wouldn't have people to put them on the shelves?

We had the producer price number today, second highest in history. We're back to 1982 levels of inflation for the average person out there. And part of this has been the inability to get workers to go to work. And, certainly, the idea of kicking people out of jobs. Just airlines say, oh, it was weather. We know, well, maybe some of that was the mandate. And, again, shouldn't we be working somehow to fix this, because this is a tax on all Americans, particularly those on the lower economic scale?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BLUNT",
      "utterance": "Well, it has dramatic impact on people who are at the lower economic part of the scale with things that you have to have, a way to get to work, a way to heat your house, groceries from the store. When those go up 50 percent, 20 percent, 15 percent, you don't have any real options except to cut back on those necessities. And whatever you would have done two years ago with the extra money from the same paycheck, you don't have the opportunity to do now. It is an insidious tax on people, if the government doesn't manage the economy in a way that maintains a low inflation rate. Putting $1.9 trillion in the American recovery plan into the economy in a very short period of time, something Democrats did all by themselves in March, has had an inflationary impact. And the Build Back Better or build back broker campaign effort would have had the same impact. I hope we can continue to resist adding a bunch of new government programs on top of an economy that's already overheated."

If by want Lindsey means by that is, we all need to do our best to work together and be talking about what a difference it will make if we win these elections, of course I'm for that. But the Republican Senate leader needs to be chosen by Republicans in the Senate. One thing Senator McConnell has never done is put our members out there on a vote that wasn't going to pass, like the vote that Democrats are taking this week, and they'd have a hard time explaining at home. Those are the kinds of things you need to look at when you're looking at the Senate leadership or House leadership. I have been a leader in both the House and the Senate. And I think those decisions need to be made by the senators who come together next year and form a new conference. And when you look at the track record of Mitch McConnell, I think it's pretty good."

We're seeing it happen all across the country. And the reason that it's important is because Republican-led legislatures are enacting these laws because they're afraid of black and brown power. This is just white supremacy reinventing itself and finding a way to limit the power and the voices of black and brown voters in this country."

He told them that he was going to pass police reform. Democrats didn't want to work Republicans on police reform. He said that he was going to get people back to work. Well, in December, we see that the unemployment rate for African-Americans is over 7 percent. He said that he was going to do a number of things that just have not come to fruition. And now you got leaders in the black community like Charlamagne tha God and many others who are calling out the inaction of the Democratic Party and what they continue to do, use these issues like voting or anything that's involving race to rally up African-Americans and then try to win elections. And it is un, un-American, and is not what we should be seeing on a daily basis out of any of our political parties."

I mean, do you ever consider that, if some young black kid 14 years old watched President Biden's speech this week in Atlanta, they would feel like this was -- this is not -- the country he painted, it's not the country I live in. And my grandmother's is from -- my mom, the whole family's from Alabama. I know about that. She was warned not to vote. She was so scared once only five people in her town, black people went to vote. They put them in a room for a couple hours. They were scared they were going to be hurt. The door opened up, it was Martin Luther King. He said, you guys can vote.

We were promised policing reform. We were promised the child tax credits that have already expired and the social spending plan provisions that would help the economic situation of many black Americans in this country. And it hasn't passed because Build Back Better hasn't passed. And so if you're a black voter watching what's happening in this country, you're thinking, what has this administration done for me?

My friend Abigail Spanberger and I introduced this a year ago, important legislation, we think, because we don't think that members of Congress ought to be able to be capitalizing on their positions of power as public servants, when you're making really important policy decisions, for example, on big tech, big pharma, big insurance, in light of in -- in the wake of Obamacare.

Her and her husband have made an absolute fortune. They buy $400,000, $500,000 worth of calls. You know what it means to buy $500,000 of a call? That's not even equity. You're betting on something working out in a relatively short period of time. You have got to have some serious confidence that's going to happen, and they have made millions.

In the second two weeks of December, that number shut up to 5,000.

With the national average today around $3.30, if we hit the higher end of that range, that would certainly take us to $4 a gallon in the not-too- distant future. And some states are already seeing prices rise at the pump. Indiana leading the way with an increase of 17 cents a gallon from a week ago, according to AAA, Ohio and Illinois, not too far behind. Illinois saw a 10-cent increase from last week. And it's not just gas prices climbing, but what you put that gas in to. New car prices reached record highs in 2021. And now Edmunds says the average transaction price for a new car is more than the average manufacturer's suggested retail price. So to sum all of this up, since last year, motor fuel is up almost 50 percent, used cars and trucks up almost more than 37 percent, and new vehicles up nearly 12 percent -- Charles, not a good time to be a driver right now, unfortunately."

And five out of six actually say they're worse off today -- today than they were when Joe Biden took office. Things are not looking good for the Democrats right now.

I mean, every president since Jimmy Carter in 1977 has performed better. He's performing on average 18 points below the last several presidents on the economy. That is just not acceptable. And most people are saying that they're worse off. The concerns about COVID have become secondary to concerns about the economy, because people are wondering, how are they going to pay their bills? People across the board are saying that it's impacted their household. It impacts how they're grocery shopping. It's impacting them across the board."

So, again, I tell people -- and they already know -- you go into store with more money, you feel pretty good. But you actually are coming out with fewer bags. And that stinks, doesn't?"

I mean, there's no doubt about it that -- I mean, even in this latest poll by Quinnipiac that came out today, the things -- there's two things that I think are really alarming for the president and for the Democrats they need to pay attention to. One is independents; 57 percent of independents disapprove of Joe Biden. But more importantly for him even is this. Democrats have gone from 87 percent approval in the same poll to 75 percent approval in just one month. He's lost eight points among his base in one month. That's devastating for him and for the Democrats."
