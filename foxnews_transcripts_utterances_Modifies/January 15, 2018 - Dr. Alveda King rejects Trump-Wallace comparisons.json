Democrats are threatening to vote against a short-term government funding bill if they're not able to get a deal on the so-called dreamers. But there is really is not a deal ready to go by Friday. So they are going to have to decide over here in the Senate if they're willing to filibuster a short-term spending bill, because the 19th is the deadline.  That would mean that government funding, if it's not approved, would expire on the 20th, which is the year anniversary, of course, of President Trump's inauguration. They just don't have anything ready on immigration.   So, the pressure will be on, because Republicans in the House will be able to pass it, send it over to the Senate, where all the Republicans will support it, and that will put all the pressure on Democrats. If they vote against it, it will be on their shoulders if the government is not funded.",

They need to save face, because their base is getting very frustrated. This is the fourth short-term spending bill. And people who are in support of the dreamers are pressuring Democrats, saying you're not going to vote for another one of these things because time is running out. There's this March deadline coming and they claim hundreds of so-called dreamers are losing their protected status every week.   So, they're being pressured from their base. However, Democrats alone will be responsible if the government shuts down. Now, you know Republicans always get blamed for this. And Democrats have had some comfort level thinking, well, if we vote about it, hey, the Republicans control Congress. They control the White House. But in this instance, I think that that is not assured that they would escape the blame. And you see President Trump tweeting today about it, where he's belittling Senator Dick Durbin about the DACA deal, but he's also saying they would be responsible because they don't support increased military funding in the spending bill, which is another issue that is holding up an accord.",

You have the Republicans saying this is going to be in the hands of the Democrats if the government shut down. You have Democrats saying the same thing. But the fact of the matter is, is that Democrats are asking for amnesty not just for these 800,000 people that are covered by DACA, but almost two million illegal immigrants. And that's just not going to happen. That's why I think it truly is Democrats' fault if the government does shut down. I think that would help Republicans in the midterms. We will see what happens.",

We just passed a very favorable tax package to foreign investors to invest in U.S. companies.   And yet this kind of arguing back and forth, there might be a relative winner. But the bottom line is, America loses with these kinds of fights. Sure, you might be able to position yourself, well, we're out of power. It's not our fault.  But it's not good. It doesn't make America look like a desirable place to invest in, to own debt in. And longer, longer term -- and this is an immigration issue -- is people come to America to be successful. And if we can't get it together financially and keep pushing these issues off and doing short-term resolutions, there's going to be a point where we have to tax success more. And that is going to limit the immigration quality we get anyway over the long haul. So it's not like this is a good situation for anybody.

What we're looking at is snow again across the Midwest for now that is eventually going to spread farther to the South. So far, we have seen a decent amount of snow running through the Ohio River Valley, now stretching back to the Ozarks. Right behind this, that is a line of cold air that is pushing in. It's been cold, but it's getting even colder. These are your current temperatures really piling up here into the Upper Plains States, five degrees in Minneapolis, currently four degrees. But if you add in that windchill -- and that's when it starts to feel really cold -- what it feels like outside, suddenly you see these numbers dropping down into the negatives. Negative 15 degrees in Minneapolis. Getting closer to negative 20 degrees in some of these spots. This is only going to settle farther and farther to the south. So, if you're south of this, that cold air is coming. And unfortunately right along this boundary, eventually, that snow is going to be on the way as well. Here's your future radar. As it begins to move this direction, you can kind of see it behind my head. We're taking you throughout today into Tuesday, eventually into Wednesday, as this entire line stretching all the way from portions of New England back down towards Texas, it continues to move. And, yes, portions of the South are at least going to see some snow and some ice here over the next 48 hours. And as I said, it is stretched way on back there, which is why we're seeing some of these winter storm watches, advisories, warnings stretching all the way from portions of South Texas all the way up into New England, running up into the U.P. of Michigan. And some of these areas that you're looking at in this pink color, spots where you typically don't get it as bad, those are the warnings. So those are the biggest concerns stretching you from portions of Mississippi back down into Texas, Austin, San Antonio, close to Dallas, all areas where perhaps freezing rain, which often can be the worst part of this, Neil, that's all on the way in the next 24 to 48 hours.",

But just the amount of money put through from U.S. aid, which $3.2 billion, that's the U.S. federal government aid, to monies promised around the world. Now, I will say that is a U.N. number, that $13 billion. I'm not sure it was -- it was -- quote, unquote -- \"earmarked.\" So I'm not sure how much ever really made to it Haiti. But it's just been a series of unaccountability. You have got 10,000 NGOs operating in Haiti. And let's face it. There's been a lot of mismanagement of that money, some deliberately, some perhaps not. But we have a ways to go.",

These countries that he talked about, other than using the word that he used, have been described in certain ways. We know Haiti, for instance, is the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere. We know that a lot of these other countries have their problems. Now, and consequently, what I find compelling is that the best and brightest of those nations often choose to leave those nations. Today, at this very moment, there could be a doctor in Alabama operating on an American -- an immigrant from Nigeria, a doctor, operating on someone, saving their lives in Alabama, instead of Lagos. So you start to ask yourself, what is going on that even the best and brightest of those nations want to leave? And I would love to see someone say, what is going on with there? Now, I do hope and I think, going into the State of the Union address, that this presents a great opportunity for President Trump to understand one thing. Whether he said something or didn't say something, his words are very powerful. We all like to be liked, and everybody wants to be liked by the president of the United States. Occasionally, you have to go out of your way and say, that was not my intention. OK? And you cannot let the mainstream media and others turning into something that you keep telling us that you're not. And it's OK, because I have hurt people's feelings, not on purpose. We all have done that. We have all said things that we found out later made someone feel bad about themselves. And I think the president could do a better job with that respect, knowing that the mainstream media and Democrats are going to skewer every word that he says, in some cases words that he didn't say. So there's a responsibility on that part. But the feigned outrage that I here that I did not hear when I heard the quote people clinging to their guns and their Bibles or a basket of deplorables, you could have easily argued that those were dog whistles and racists also, but we didn't hear the same people complaining about it.",

As you know, he's been ousted from Breitbart after his comments -- President Trump did not like his comments and neither did the Mercer family, one of the owners of Breitbart, the rich Mercer family, his comments that appeared in that Michael Wolff book about Don Jr. Here's what we have been learning. He's quietly plotting his return to some sort of a public life post-Breitbart. He's told friends he may possibly reenter the news business at some time. And we should get into that a little bit. But he's also telling friends he's thinking about creating some sort of a populist think tank that will spread ideas of -- the Bannon ideas, much of the same stuff you see in Breitbart. That think tank would do that. It's unclear how he is going to raise this money. As you know, these big benefactors, the Mercers, are no longer quite enamored with him anymore after the Trump book, Michael Wolff Trump book, came out. But he's talking about this. And I will tell you, one thing that I hear from close to -- to people close to Steve Bannon, they say, OK, he may not have money from the Mercers going forward to support any of these projects he has in his head, which includes getting back into the new business somehow, but he does have a very powerful friend, and his name is Peter Thiel, the Internet billionaire, who is a Trump supporter. And they are apparently still close, according to friends of Bannon. And what they say is, don't be surprised if Mr. Thiel doesn't finance any of this stuff, including what people were telling me close to Bannon is a possible -- he would make a possible run at buying Breitbart. That is not out of the question, people close to him tell me, not now probably. He's going to do this political thing apparently now. At least that's what he is talking. We should point out that Bannon tomorrow will be before the House Intelligence -- Intel Committee talking about potential Russian meddling in the 2016 election. So, he has got a pretty busy schedule right now. But his post -- he does have access to money if -- and he was a former investment banker. So, he knows how to raise money. And he has this connection with Thiel. And what people say is that, if he wants to make a run at Breitbart, if he wants to go to Breitbart's widow and say, listen, you make X-amount a year, or you make very little a year on this Web site, we're willing to pay you $5 million, $10 million, here's the financing, that could happen.

Democrats are threatening to vote against a short-term government funding bill if they're not able to get a deal on the so-called dreamers. But there is really is not a deal ready to go by Friday. So they are going to have to decide over here in the Senate if they're willing to filibuster a short-term spending bill, because the 19th is the deadline. That would mean that government funding, if it's not approved, would expire on the 20th, which is the year anniversary, of course, of President Trump's inauguration. They just don't have anything ready on immigration. So, the pressure will be on, because Republicans in the House will be able to pass it, send it over to the Senate, where all the Republicans will support it, and that will put all the pressure on Democrats. If they vote against it, it will be on their shoulders if the government is not funded."

So, this week, I expect there will be more intense talks. And you may see Democrats coming out saying, look, we feel ground is being gained here. We're getting more of what we want. They need to save face, because their base is getting very frustrated. This is the fourth short-term spending bill. And people who are in support of the dreamers are pressuring Democrats, saying you're not going to vote for another one of these things because time is running out. There's this March deadline coming and they claim hundreds of so-called dreamers are losing their protected status every week. So, they're being pressured from their base. However, Democrats alone will be responsible if the government shuts down. Now, you know Republicans always get blamed for this. And Democrats have had some comfort level thinking, well, if we vote about it, hey, the Republicans control Congress. They control the White House. But in this instance, I think that that is not assured that they would escape the blame. And you see President Trump tweeting today about it, where he's belittling Senator Dick Durbin about the DACA deal, but he's also saying they would be responsible because they don't support increased military funding in the spending bill, which is another issue that is holding up an accord."

Conservative blogger Allie Beth Stuckey with us, Fox News contributor Jonas Max Ferris, Democratic strategist Robin Biro. Allie, let's get a handle on what happens if the unthinkable happens Friday.

You have the Republicans saying this is going to be in the hands of the Democrats if the government shut down. You have Democrats saying the same thing. But the fact of the matter is, is that Democrats are asking for amnesty not just for these 800,000 people that are covered by DACA, but almost two million illegal immigrants. And that's just not going to happen. That's why I think it truly is Democrats' fault if the government does shut down. I think that would help Republicans in the midterms. We will see what happens."

Those have been showing less interest in America as an investment place, which is kind of unusual, because right now our economy is very strong. We just passed a very favorable tax package to foreign investors to invest in U.S. companies. And yet this kind of arguing back and forth, there might be a relative winner. But the bottom line is, America loses with these kinds of fights. Sure, you might be able to position yourself, well, we're out of power. It's not our fault. But it's not good. It doesn't make America look like a desirable place to invest in, to own debt in. And longer, longer term -- and this is an immigration issue -- is people come to America to be successful. And if we can't get it together financially and keep pushing these issues off and doing short-term resolutions, there's going to be a point where we have to tax success more. And that is going to limit the immigration quality we get anyway over the long haul. So it's not like this is a good situation for anybody. It could be a relative winner in the elections, but there's no long-term winner for America with these kind of games."

And while I did say and I stand by the fact in this round I think it's on the -- it's in the hands of the Democrats of why we're not reaching a deal, I think it does say something about Republicans, who do have control of Congress, who are in the White House, that they're unable to pass a good deal. But it seems like Democrats are so opposed to any kind of commonsense immigration reform, I really think that is what is holding us back more than anything. Any kind of leeway that they're able to give, I think would be able to push us forward into a more permanent deal. But they seem unable to do so.

That there were 38 minutes in an age of instantaneous social media where the government didn't get out the message that this was a false alarm, that's a complete outrage. But that the system was so easily tripped here that one individual could make a mistake and send out this message with tremendous ramifications, the notion that there could be an incoming missile to Hawaii is one that Hawaiians have to take quite seriously, given the situation with North Korea. And so this just goes to show that the state of Hawaii is asleep at the wheel on this one. They have not been doing their job with this. And they need very serious reforms right away."

Ever since the end of the Cold War, civil defense systems have been taken down across the country. We really haven't paid that much attention to them.

This is the button you hit for no drill. And, oh, by the way, if you hit the no drill button, an alert comes up apparently that says, are you sure you want to hit this button? Somehow, this person managed to screw that up. Look, I feel bad for him. Everyone makes mistakes, Neil. But this seems like a pretty easy one that he should have gotten right.

With state government, I think there's important precedents here, whether we're talking about notification for natural disasters, whether it's a hurricane, tornadoes, any number of things. It's up to the state government. If they need federal help, then of course they can call for it. The governor can call in assistance from the National Guard. But with this incident, you have look at this and say, obviously, this individual messed up. There's no question about that. But usually you have redundancies in place. It's not supposed to be as straightforward as you press one button and maybe you press another button, and, all of a sudden, the whole state thinks that they might be hit by an incoming ballistic nuclear missile. That's actually what we're talking about here. So, clearly, they didn't really think that this was something that they had to prepare for. They didn't adequately prepare for that eventuality. And just you need more layers before you can send out this message. I do think, Neil, though, that the worst part of this was the 38-minute window where they didn't correct it, where people are cowering in fear, terrified in their bathtubs or underground or wherever they were hiding, and understandably so."

I think about this stuff all the time. And actually I'm not prepared at home. We don't have enough water. We don't have enough food.

They're sharing the loot, 150 of them now benefiting upwards of 2.5 million Americans in terms of higher bonuses, lower insurance-related health care costs, even, you know, utility customers, that we didn't quite grasp the magnitude beyond the personal cut and how the business cut could come back to individuals.

The GOP effectively gave everybody a raise with this tax bill. And not a single Democrat voted to make that happen.

So, Erin, failing that, people are going to have to see it for themselves. They are going to see it in their checks. They are going to have to see it in the bonuses. They are going to have to see more companies sharing the loot. And then it could make a difference. Without that, I don't know about Republicans selling it. What do you think?"

They won the House, they won the Senate in 2006. And they won it because they campaigned against the Republicans. And what they said was the culture of corruption and the opposition to the war in Iraq. Those were two things that really didn't have anything to do with the economy. I mean, obviously, they do have things to do with the economy, but it wasn't about the economy and about pocketbook issues. And the Democrats still won. So, yes, the Republicans can try to campaign on this tax bill and on these tax cuts, but they had a disastrous year of governing, and just got the tax package through at the very end, after a miserable year."

What we're looking at is snow again across the Midwest for now that is eventually going to spread farther to the South. So far, we have seen a decent amount of snow running through the Ohio River Valley, now stretching back to the Ozarks. Right behind this, that is a line of cold air that is pushing in. It's been cold, but it's getting even colder. These are your current temperatures really piling up here into the Upper Plains States, five degrees in Minneapolis, currently four degrees. But if you add in that windchill -- and that's when it starts to feel really cold -- what it feels like outside, suddenly you see these numbers dropping down into the negatives. Negative 15 degrees in Minneapolis. Getting closer to negative 20 degrees in some of these spots. This is only going to settle farther and farther to the south. So, if you're south of this, that cold air is coming. And unfortunately right along this boundary, eventually, that snow is going to be on the way as well. Here's your future radar. As it begins to move this direction, you can kind of see it behind my head. We're taking you throughout today into Tuesday, eventually into Wednesday, as this entire line stretching all the way from portions of New England back down towards Texas, it continues to move. And, yes, portions of the South are at least going to see some snow and some ice here over the next 48 hours. And as I said, it is stretched way on back there, which is why we're seeing some of these winter storm watches, advisories, warnings stretching all the way from portions of South Texas all the way up into New England, running up into the U.P. of Michigan. And some of these areas that you're looking at in this pink color, spots where you typically don't get it as bad, those are the warnings. So those are the biggest concerns stretching you from portions of Mississippi back down into Texas, Austin, San Antonio, close to Dallas, all areas where perhaps freezing rain, which often can be the worst part of this, Neil, that's all on the way in the next 24 to 48 hours."

At last check, Haiti is still one of the poorest nations in the world, 60 percent of the population living in poverty, none of that money getting to them. FBN's Charles Payne, the host of \"Making Money,\" has been doing some digging. Charles, good to have you. What happened?"

      "utterance": "You know, Neil, to be quite frank with you, it's still a big question mark. Now, there's been improvement. If you recall, after the earthquake, 1.5 million Haitians were homeless, living in tent cities. Over 95 percent of them have been relocated. But just the amount of money put through from U.S. aid, which $3.2 billion, that's the U.S. federal government aid, to monies promised around the world. Now, I will say that is a U.N. number, that $13 billion. I'm not sure it was -- it was -- quote, unquote -- \"earmarked.\" So I'm not sure how much ever really made to it Haiti. But it's just been a series of unaccountability. You have got 10,000 NGOs operating in Haiti. And let's face it. There's been a lot of mismanagement of that money, some deliberately, some perhaps not. But we have a ways to go."

      "utterance": "Do you ever -- as a prominent African-American in your own right, and you hear the comments that are raised about the president, Martin Luther King III saying the president deliberately chose a country like Norway that he liked because he likes white people, and not Haiti because it's all black people, what did you think of that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAYNE",
      "utterance": "You know, it's really tough, because you don't want to think of the president in a certain way. And, listen, if it was -- if it was -- here's the thing. These countries that he talked about, other than using the word that he used, have been described in certain ways. We know Haiti, for instance, is the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere. We know that a lot of these other countries have their problems. Now, and consequently, what I find compelling is that the best and brightest of those nations often choose to leave those nations. Today, at this very moment, there could be a doctor in Alabama operating on an American -- an immigrant from Nigeria, a doctor, operating on someone, saving their lives in Alabama, instead of Lagos. So you start to ask yourself, what is going on that even the best and brightest of those nations want to leave? And I would love to see someone say, what is going on with there? Now, I do hope and I think, going into the State of the Union address, that this presents a great opportunity for President Trump to understand one thing. Whether he said something or didn't say something, his words are very powerful. We all like to be liked, and everybody wants to be liked by the president of the United States. Occasionally, you have to go out of your way and say, that was not my intention. OK? And you cannot let the mainstream media and others turning into something that you keep telling us that you're not. And it's OK, because I have hurt people's feelings, not on purpose. We all have done that. We have all said things that we found out later made someone feel bad about themselves. And I think the president could do a better job with that respect, knowing that the mainstream media and Democrats are going to skewer every word that he says, in some cases words that he didn't say. So there's a responsibility on that part. But the feigned outrage that I here that I did not hear when I heard the quote people clinging to their guns and their Bibles or a basket of deplorables, you could have easily argued that those were dog whistles and racists also, but we didn't hear the same people complaining about it."

      "speaker": "GASPARINO",
      "utterance": "So, there is some truth to that. Here's what we understand about Steve Bannon. As you know, he's been ousted from Breitbart after his comments -- President Trump did not like his comments and neither did the Mercer family, one of the owners of Breitbart, the rich Mercer family, his comments that appeared in that Michael Wolff book about Don Jr. Here's what we have been learning. He's quietly plotting his return to some sort of a public life post-Breitbart. He's told friends he may possibly reenter the news business at some time. And we should get into that a little bit. But he's also telling friends he's thinking about creating some sort of a populist think tank that will spread ideas of -- the Bannon ideas, much of the same stuff you see in Breitbart. That think tank would do that. It's unclear how he is going to raise this money. As you know, these big benefactors, the Mercers, are no longer quite enamored with him anymore after the Trump book, Michael Wolff Trump book, came out. But he's talking about this. And I will tell you, one thing that I hear from close to -- to people close to Steve Bannon, they say, OK, he may not have money from the Mercers going forward to support any of these projects he has in his head, which includes getting back into the new business somehow, but he does have a very powerful friend, and his name is Peter Thiel, the Internet billionaire, who is a Trump supporter. And they are apparently still close, according to friends of Bannon. And what they say is, don't be surprised if Mr. Thiel doesn't finance any of this stuff, including what people were telling me close to Bannon is a possible -- he would make a possible run at buying Breitbart. That is not out of the question, people close to him tell me, not now probably. He's going to do this political thing apparently now. At least that's what he is talking. We should point out that Bannon tomorrow will be before the House Intelligence -- Intel Committee talking about potential Russian meddling in the 2016 election. So, he has got a pretty busy schedule right now. But his post -- he does have access to money if -- and he was a former investment banker. So, he knows how to raise money. And he has this connection with Thiel. And what people say is that, if he wants to make a run at Breitbart, if he wants to go to Breitbart's widow and say, listen, you make X-amount a year, or you make very little a year on this Web site, we're willing to pay you $5 million, $10 million, here's the financing, that could happen. That's what people close to him say."
