Today's targets include actor-director Robert De Niro, and former Vice President Joe Biden. In fact, Biden had two packages addressed to him, and the package addressed to De Niro's Manhattan office was actually delivered yesterday but not identified until early this morning. That brings to ten the number of devices now intercepted and recovered. None of them exploded and there are reports that some of the pipe bombs did not have viable detonators.

You'd still have Antifa chasing down people on streets. You'd have politicians inciting face-to-face harassment. You've got Kathy Griffin, Johnny Depp, Madonna.

You can't attack political opponents. And then this morning, he shifts again, as you were suggesting to Greg, and says, hey, you know, the mainstream media needs to clean up its act in terms of setting the tone. The response has been pretty clear from Jeff Zucker, CNN, the head of CNN, and others saying that the tone is really set by the politician, by the president. This is a president who is talked about, you know, second amendment people taking care of Hillary and body slamming reporters. The press is -- I can go on. I mean, everybody knows this with me, even down in Charlottesville, with fine people on both sides. So I think that there's a sense that, you know, his instinct is to be a combative president and that, in fact, as a political strategy approaching the midterms, he sees the division as firing up his base.

And you look at people like Kathy Griffin, or Snoop Dogg, or Hillary Clinton the other day saying, you know, we don't have to be civil. Sometimes we have to be uncivil. We don't ever make Democrats accessories to the crimes politically.   What the left is doing now is they're trying to make Donald Trump an accessory to these attempted mail bombings and saying you're an accessory and therefore you need to stop attacking the media, and you need to stop attacking Democrats before the midterm elections. And I don't think he has a responsibility to do that. I agree, Trump talks tough sometimes. Sometimes it's too tough. A lot of times he's being tongue-in-cheek and the media has no sense of humor and they don't get that. But I agree sometimes he does cross the line. But when you're slamming someone on a video, you know, going like this and you're mocking someone get punched on purpose, it's a little different than when the media calls you a mentally- ill Nazi that needs to be taken out or fetishizes your son being raped.

So, this is like we've been having -- we've said -- Greg pointed out, I think start in 2015, we started this national civics lesson and now everybody is engaged. Look, it's good having everybody engage about turn out your base. Couple of things that I'll point out, the real clear average, real clear politics average, generic ballot plus 7 for Democrats. Republicans thinks that allows them to like keep in range. Just for comparison, in 2006 when the Republicans lost the majority, the generic ballot was plus 11 for Democrats. There's no doubt Republicans are getting crushed by retirements, 44 this year. In 2006 only 17. But I would also point this out, given at this rate of how close is going to be in the house, even if the Democrats take over, take a watch. I don't think Pelosi can become speaker. There's too many Democrats who have pledged already not to vote for her if they win election, so we could have some really big sort of leadership vacuums that are coming up because Speaker Ryan is leaving.

So I think that there's a lot of sense among people that the dynamic have shifted once since Kavanaugh drove up the enthusiasm on the Republican side. But I must remind you that the Democratic enthusiasm is extremely high. So it was just -- it came up to match it. The key thing here I think in terms of talking about President Trump's attitude is that this is a referendum on President Trump. It's hard to get away from it.   What we see in the poll numbers is people saying they're voting to oppose Trump. They want a check on Trump or they're voting to support Trump. The people who are voting for the check right now, way outnumbered the people who are voting to support Trump, but not in his base. And the second point I make as you look at where Trump is going, several stories today indicate that he's going to places where -- not swing districts outside the big cities where the house is going to be determined, but oftentimes going to rural areas in states where his bases is located, and that has some Republicans, which is, curious to me, the one thing I heard today that caught my attention, Republican saying, you know what, Trump is already focused on 200, and this is really -- the midterms are about Trump and, of course, 2020 will be about Trump.",

If you think about the state of the union or foreign trips or debates, the difference this time is his name is technically not on the ballot. Where, you know, Obama had big coattails in these generals, and he kind of swept people in. But remember, the midterms, he just got shellacked.  Now, this is going to be a big test of Trump's political capital. If he can face on these historic headwinds because his party usually loses in a situation like this, but despite the historical headwinds he's got a lot going for him. He's got the hot economy. He's got a fired up base. And the caravan is playing right into his hands. But the October surprise we thought was going to be Mueller, and Mueller has said, you know what? It's probably going to come after November. Now this mail bombing scenario is the October surprise, and that could go either way.

You know what they say, they're demanding respect for, quote, the international right to migrate. So anybody anywhere can walk across the border of any country and they have a right to do that. Think about that. As Dana knows, the treaty of Westphalia established the concept of the nation states. And we saw what happened in Europe, when all these Syrian refugees flew across to the E.U. and it caused absolute chaos. Even now, Merkel is regretting that decision. And people are building walls.

We used to call this \"Basket Weaving 101.\" If you're willing to give brown 50 grand for this crap, you need to unlearn common sense, too. Besides, it makes no sense. I mean, if men are so toxic, why would you want them detoxing on your campus? My prediction: unlearning toxic masculinity will soon be replacing Western Civ. After all, there's no question men are more aggressive than women. It's science. And it doesn't hurt to civilize unruly cads. That's what dads and moms used to do before we decided they sucked.  And men do live shorter lives. Just look at me. But mainly because of the risks taken to attract and protect the people we love.

It's the branding of a gender by angry, bitter radicals. It's also sexist.

It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is \"The Five.\" Fox News alert, a nationwide manhunt intensifies after three more suspicious packages are sent to high-profile Democrats, this time targeting Joe Biden and Robert De Niro. The FBI is urging the public to come forward with any tips that may help track down the suspected bomb maker, and Fox News is now learning authorities are honing in on a region of interest in the investigation. Trace Gallagher is standing by with the latest. Trace."

Fox News is now confirming that Florida is a region of interest for investigators and that connects with the reporting of our corporate cousin, the Wall Street Journal, saying some of these packages came from Florida, which is an indicator that the postal markings on these envelopes are providing key evidence. Today's targets include actor-director Robert De Niro, and former Vice President Joe Biden. In fact, Biden had two packages addressed to him, and the package addressed to De Niro's Manhattan office was actually delivered yesterday but not identified until early this morning. That brings to ten the number of devices now intercepted and recovered. None of them exploded and there are reports that some of the pipe bombs did not have viable detonators. But New York police say all of the devices were treated as live and dangerous, and they said this about the packages sent to New York. Watch."

President Trump immediately condemned the attempted attacks yesterday, but his critics continue to blame him for ratcheting up the inflammatory rhetoric, though the GOP has blamed Democrats for inciting violence against Republicans. Today, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said the idea that any of these attacks were at the hands of the president is, quote, absolutely ridiculous, and that he continues to condemn violence in all forms.

You wouldn't believe. I mean, even the duct tape. I had a murder case, we've got the prints off a duct tape. Stamps that you used to lick, now we have touched DNA. So, if they even touch the stamp, we can get DNA off the stamp. As to the post office, we can even get the origin as to where it came. And I think they're working on all that. You know, was it well- planned? Yes and no. Yes, and that they all went out simultaneously. However, no, in that -- I mean, names were spelled wrong. Some of the address we know are wrong and got returned to sender."

And I think, the thing, is everybody can point their fingers, depending on what group you belong to, and so it's natural. It's hard for me to take advice from the media overheated rhetoric because if you were to subtract the heated rhetoric of Trump. Let's say the cause of behavior, the jokes about sleepy eyes and lock him up. If you took that all away, right, like, Trump didn't even exist, you would still have speakers on campus being harassed. You'd still have Antifa chasing down people on streets. You'd have politicians inciting face-to-face harassment. You've got Kathy Griffin, Johnny Depp, Madonna. They did all their stuff early on before a lot of these stuffs. You have Mika obsessing over the 25th amendment. So it's all -- and you have weird -- at times, people defending Antifa. So essentially you've had two years of questioning Trump's sanity, calling him Hitler. And you're upset because he made a joke about a body slam. It doesn't work for me."

And I think it's kind of sad that we have reached this point. But I think people on the left are kind of taken aback that the president last night seemed to be more presidential in saying, you know, we need to unify, we need to come together. You can't attack political opponents. And then this morning, he shifts again, as you were suggesting to Greg, and says, hey, you know, the mainstream media needs to clean up its act in terms of setting the tone. The response has been pretty clear from Jeff Zucker, CNN, the head of CNN, and others saying that the tone is really set by the politician, by the president. This is a president who is talked about, you know, second amendment people taking care of Hillary and body slamming reporters. The press is -- I can go on. I mean, everybody knows this with me, even down in Charlottesville, with fine people on both sides. So I think that there's a sense that, you know, his instinct is to be a combative president and that, in fact, as a political strategy approaching the midterms, he sees the division as firing up his base. And I think a lot of people just worry that you can't keep -- we can't, as the American people, keep going down this path without respecting -- I mean, even, you know, dare say, loving each other as fellow Americans."

And Greg laid it out perfectly. I mean, the list is long. People's ribs have been cracked. People have tried to be stabbed. Cars have been firebombed. Anthrax and ricin have been sent around. And you look at people like Kathy Griffin, or Snoop Dogg, or Hillary Clinton the other day saying, you know, we don't have to be civil. Sometimes we have to be uncivil. We don't ever make Democrats accessories to the crimes politically. What the left is doing now is they're trying to make Donald Trump an accessory to these attempted mail bombings and saying you're an accessory and therefore you need to stop attacking the media, and you need to stop attacking Democrats before the midterm elections. And I don't think he has a responsibility to do that. I agree, Trump talks tough sometimes. Sometimes it's too tough. A lot of times he's being tongue-in-cheek and the media has no sense of humor and they don't get that. But I agree sometimes he does cross the line. But when you're slamming someone on a video, you know, going like this and you're mocking someone get punched on purpose, it's a little different than when the media calls you a mentally- ill Nazi that needs to be taken out or fetishizes your son being raped. I agree everybody needs to come together, but both sides need to look in the mirror, especially the media."

There's so much enthusiasm. There hasn't been this much enthusiasm since 1966. What was happening in 1966? Well, the country was having a big debate about expanding the war in Vietnam. So, this is like we've been having -- we've said -- Greg pointed out, I think start in 2015, we started this national civics lesson and now everybody is engaged. Look, it's good having everybody engage about turn out your base. Couple of things that I'll point out, the real clear average, real clear politics average, generic ballot plus 7 for Democrats. Republicans thinks that allows them to like keep in range. Just for comparison, in 2006 when the Republicans lost the majority, the generic ballot was plus 11 for Democrats. There's no doubt Republicans are getting crushed by retirements, 44 this year. In 2006 only 17. But I would also point this out, given at this rate of how close is going to be in the house, even if the Democrats take over, take a watch. I don't think Pelosi can become speaker. There's too many Democrats who have pledged already not to vote for her if they win election, so we could have some really big sort of leadership vacuums that are coming up because Speaker Ryan is leaving. They're going to have a fight on the Republican side. So, if you think it's going to be over on November 6, it's going to keep going either way."

      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",

I don't know that you would say that it's the case that, oh, you think Republicans now will retain, but it's just not as large, Pam, as people had been previously saying. So I think that there's a lot of sense among people that the dynamic have shifted once since Kavanaugh drove up the enthusiasm on the Republican side. But I must remind you that the Democratic enthusiasm is extremely high. So it was just -- it came up to match it. The key thing here I think in terms of talking about President Trump's attitude is that this is a referendum on President Trump. It's hard to get away from it. What we see in the poll numbers is people saying they're voting to oppose Trump. They want a check on Trump or they're voting to support Trump. The people who are voting for the check right now, way outnumbered the people who are voting to support Trump, but not in his base. And the second point I make as you look at where Trump is going, several stories today indicate that he's going to places where -- not swing districts outside the big cities where the house is going to be determined, but oftentimes going to rural areas in states where his bases is located, and that has some Republicans, which is, curious to me, the one thing I heard today that caught my attention, Republican saying, you know what, Trump is already focused on 200, and this is really -- the midterms are about Trump and, of course, 2020 will be about Trump."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "No, I think they need a little help because seven in the generic congressional ballot is not going to cut it, historically. Trump is a closer. He closed on Cruz. He closed hard on crooked. He's now closing hard on the midterms. And he always rises to these big occasions. If you think about the state of the union or foreign trips or debates, the difference this time is his name is technically not on the ballot. Where, you know, Obama had big coattails in these generals, and he kind of swept people in. But remember, the midterms, he just got shellacked. Now, this is going to be a big test of Trump's political capital. If he can face on these historic headwinds because his party usually loses in a situation like this, but despite the historical headwinds he's got a lot going for him. He's got the hot economy. He's got a fired up base. And the caravan is playing right into his hands. But the October surprise we thought was going to be Mueller, and Mueller has said, you know what? It's probably going to come after November. Now this mail bombing scenario is the October surprise, and that could go either way. I just know Speaker Pelosi, if she does become speaker, you're talking Trump tax returns, impeaching Kavanaugh, and they're going to go -- they're going to reopen the Trump-Russia investigation. It's going to be scary."

The Democrats, their message right now is working for them, which is we're not that guy. That's all they've got. We're not that guy. I believe competition helps, so I would like to see a good Democratic Party. That would help create -- improve a Republican Party and Trump.

If the Democrats could just reshape that because it created so many rifts between gender, race, sexuality, sports fans, entertainment choices, wherever there are liberals, there's division. So what they could do, the idea of America as a family, right? That all different kinds of families. Families could be any kind of family, but we're all in this together. That would be basically taking Trump's vision and moving it a step further. If they actually believed in that, they would do two things. They've separate themselves from identity politics, which people are tired of. And two, they have a winning message."

The caravan is destined to fail. So those feeding this spectacle with cameras and emotional testimony, they're not helping anybody. You think you care, but you're actually driving a caravan that's expanding and multiplying because, essentially, you're saying keep going. Keep going. They're going to meet an army.

So it's not just for the caravan, which is a thousand miles away. It is for this push that keeps coming. Politically, if you look at Senator Donnelly and Senator McCaskill, red state Democrats, they're in states where President Trump won by plus 20, this is not the issue that they want to deal with. And conventional wisdom in Washington, D.C. would tell you it is not good if you're a Democrat to bring up immigration and be tough on the border. But what's happening in the southwest, Dean Heller, who is the most vulnerable senate Republican, he's now plus 6 in a Reuters' poll. McSally is starting to pull away in Arizona. So the Democrats -- when we're talking about the blue wave, the house may be one thing, but the senate looks like it is increasingly out of reach. And I think that -- what Kavanaugh being one, the economy being another, Trump being out there and campaigning for them, but you can't discount the fact that immigration is still an issue that people want to vote on."

He's just saying we have a country with borders that need to be protected against people that think they have a right to just come across willy-nilly. I have a press release from the people that are running the show, people without borders, this is not a local group. This is a third-party group. You know what they say, they're demanding respect for, quote, the international right to migrate. So anybody anywhere can walk across the border of any country and they have a right to do that. Think about that. As Dana knows, the treaty of Westphalia established the concept of the nation states. And we saw what happened in Europe, when all these Syrian refugees flew across to the E.U. and it caused absolute chaos. Even now, Merkel is regretting that decision. And people are building walls. And you have Brexit. So that backfired big-time. George W. Bush sent National Guard to the border. Barack Obama sent 1200 National Guard to the border. Sometimes."

And in the pipes that carried the cars, resistant to dog sniffing. Stuffed full of kilos of cocaine and assault rifles, from Mexico and we stopped it in Florida. That's why we have to protect our borders."

This is pure class hatred based on stereotypes meant to demean a group of people. It's the branding of a gender by angry, bitter radicals. It's also sexist. If you don't believe me, just create your own class for Brown and call it \"Unlearning Toxic femininity.\" How long do you think that will last? Well, then again, maybe it's in the works already, designed to focus on those horrible, toxic stay-at-home moms who voted for Trump.
