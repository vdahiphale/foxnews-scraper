      "sentences": "I'm Laura Ingraham. And this is THE INGRAHAM ANGLE from Washington. We have a shocking story tonight. Private school teachers now across the country are implementing something called race essentialist curricula, and they're being instructed by former Black Panther. Well, we have a video of his lesson plans and we're going to show them to you. Plus, a current Disney employee will be here in just moments to tell us why he's so disgusted by the company he works for. And that is where we begin. Mickey is crying. That's the focus of tonight's 'Angle'. Now, my family's probably been to Disney in Florida and California, I don't know five or six times over the past 10 years. We've fantastic memories. Epcot, rides like Soarin', my favorite Test Track. But today, I joined millions of Americans across this country asking, why should we support a company that obviously detests people of faith and other traditional Americans? Now, Disney has become a place where most of us are just going to refuse to spend any of our hard earned money. It's shown itself to be a haven for radicals, who are hostile to anyone who has any sort of traditional conceptions of morality. Disney created cultural experiences, remember. That was the whole point that all Americans could enjoy, based on our shared love of country and all of our traditions. But now, they're turning that on its head. They're not welcoming all Americans. Instead, they're taking sides. Now, after its CEO initially and correctly had decided not to weigh in on Ron DeSantis's parental rights and education bill, the company decided to go all in. It should never have passed, they said in a statement declaring that, it was now Disney company policy to get the law repealed by the legislature or struck down in the courts. So now, the official position of Disney is that schools should be able to teach children from K through third grade about sexual orientation. I don't know, why not just rename the roller coaster, sex mountain. Come on kids. It'll be a blast. Now, Americans under the assumption that Disney somehow still embraces the vision of its founder Walt Disney are sadly mistaken.",

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "sentences": "You're not my friend. These people are so sick. No wonder employees on the inside are beginning to blow the whistle on them. Now, in an open letter Disney employees say, \"It's an increasingly uncomfortable place to work for non progressives that our beliefs come under attack. And they see people who share these beliefs condemned as villains by their own leadership.\" Now, this is just blatantly political, everything Disney's doing here. It's not in the least principled. If they were so committed to these issues, why do they do business in China, which engages in brutal oppression of minorities? Relying on laws, by the way, they are 10,000 times worse than anything in the parental rights bill. Now, since this isn't a matter of principle though, for Disney, you got to ask, what is the real end game here? I'll tell you what it is. By adopting this far-left corporate ethos, Disney has joined the cabal that believes that it's time to ostracize a huge swath of the American population, including traditional Americans, people of serious faith and social conservatives. Yes. They believe that you should be completely shut out of public life, and that your views shouldn't be frankly heard on the internet, TV, radio, taught at our universities. None of it. People who hold these views, these horrible views shouldn't serve in the military, certainly not as officers. They shouldn't be teachers, or sit on any corporate boards. And by the way, if you ever donate to one of these traditionalists in elected office, you're going to be denounced and trolled. Such was the case when LGBTQ activists discovered Disney had donated to the politicians who supported the DeSantis bill. So what they're trying to create is a world in which believing in more traditional sexual norms is the same as being a member of the KKK. This Disney controversy, by the way, is not a one-off. They want to put everyone on notice. If you're a devout Muslim, Catholic, Orthodox Jew, evangelical Christian, and you have these views? We're going to treat you like you support cross burning. Now, remember, when we were told, by the way, that tolerance was all the Liberals really wanted? Tolerance for different lifestyles, orientations. But now we see the real agenda, cultural annihilation of anyone who disagrees with them on these issues. They want to turn all of America into, kind of, like a gender studies class at UC Berkeley, where people are afraid to say anything that might possibly upset the Thought Police, where anyone who steps out of line is shunned or very severely punished. Think about JK Rowling. 10 years ago, she wasn't just a global bestseller, but a beloved liberal. But today, the left hates her more than Harry hated Voldemort. Folks like John F Kennedy, Bobby Kennedy, who appealed to devout Catholics. They'd never be welcomed in their party today. And, remember, even Obama in 2007. At that time, he was against gay marriage. He wouldn't be welcomed either. By taking their orders from extremists, who dominate the Democrat Party, Disney and like-minded corporations, are engaged in an expulsion project against at least half of America. They're going to lose billions in income until someone has the guts to do their own hostile takeover and return to common sense. But let's look on the bright side here. Ron DeSantis really smoked them out at Disney. Just like Brian Kemp smoked out Coca Cola and Delta when they supported boycotting the all-star game after leftists screamed about the voter integrity law in Georgia. We all know where they stand. And we can make our purchasing decisions accordingly. We love Mickey, but not more than we love our families. And that's the 'Angle'. Joining me now is Jose Castillo, who is currently a resort duty manager at the Walt Disney Company. Jose, are you concerned first and foremost about your job, your job security, by speaking out here tonight?",

Because I think if I were to get fired for my views, I think it would send a wrong message to conservatives, that conservatives would not be welcome at Disney. I know that right now, it seems like there's a misconception. This is what I tell people, there's a misconception out there that everyone at Disney is just raging liberals and that - I think, that could not be farther from the truth.

And so what about our democracy right now? The people of Florida, a lot of Disney cast members voted for our state legislature. These are duly-elected members of Florida, House of Representatives in the Florida Senate who passed this bill, sent it to the governor. And thank God, our governor has the backbone to stand up to companies like mine, Disney, and pass this bill and stand with the people of Florida, stand with the parents and protect our children.",

They're just not going to do that. So I mean, I guess Disney can cobble together their income from non-traditional Americans, but that's going to be a heavy lift. Now, a new poll is saying that a majority of Florida Democrats support its new parental rights bill. So Democrats support the parental rights bill. The numbers are huge.

I'm not a candidate, I'll be as loud as I can, tell them people that we need to stand up for our conservative values and I'll be doing the same in Congress.

Everyone's walking around this issue. They do not think that traditional Americans should have a seat at the table, or frankly, even be on corporate boards. I don't know how many conservatives around the court - on the board of Disney today. We should have put their names up on television tonight. But I think this is just the tip of the iceberg and corporate America is going to be in for a rude awakening. Thank you, Jose. We really appreciate you speaking out tonight. Now, when the media isn't helping fan the flames of a manufactured controversy, they're busy covering up for anything that might be inconvenient to their preferred political party.

A Politico reporter published a book eight months ago, with ample evidence concluding that it was true. The New York Times, 10 days ago, said they authenticated it. The Washington Post today said the same thing that these materials are authentic.

Dr. King really warned against that in her letter from a Birmingham jail when he said the greatest stumbling block to black progress is not the white citizen's council or the KKK.

They're worse than hardline bigots, because they are really preaching self-annihilation. Every five minutes, Laura, a child is shot in America.

We need to know that the field is clear. This is going to be a disaster for the Democrats. 2024 is a long way away. We'll see electorally what happens. But getting there, a wide open field of chaos.",

      "utterance": "I'm Laura Ingraham. And this is THE INGRAHAM ANGLE from Washington. We have a shocking story tonight. Private school teachers now across the country are implementing something called race essentialist curricula, and they're being instructed by former Black Panther. Well, we have a video of his lesson plans and we're going to show them to you. Plus, a current Disney employee will be here in just moments to tell us why he's so disgusted by the company he works for. And that is where we begin. Mickey is crying. That's the focus of tonight's 'Angle'. Now, my family's probably been to Disney in Florida and California, I don't know five or six times over the past 10 years. We've fantastic memories. Epcot, rides like Soarin', my favorite Test Track. But today, I joined millions of Americans across this country asking, why should we support a company that obviously detests people of faith and other traditional Americans? Now, Disney has become a place where most of us are just going to refuse to spend any of our hard earned money. It's shown itself to be a haven for radicals, who are hostile to anyone who has any sort of traditional conceptions of morality. Disney created cultural experiences, remember. That was the whole point that all Americans could enjoy, based on our shared love of country and all of our traditions. But now, they're turning that on its head. They're not welcoming all Americans. Instead, they're taking sides. Now, after its CEO initially and correctly had decided not to weigh in on Ron DeSantis's parental rights and education bill, the company decided to go all in. It should never have passed, they said in a statement declaring that, it was now Disney company policy to get the law repealed by the legislature or struck down in the courts. So now, the official position of Disney is that schools should be able to teach children from K through third grade about sexual orientation. I don't know, why not just rename the roller coaster, sex mountain. Come on kids. It'll be a blast. Now, Americans under the assumption that Disney somehow still embraces the vision of its founder Walt Disney are sadly mistaken."

    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "You're not my friend. These people are so sick. No wonder employees on the inside are beginning to blow the whistle on them. Now, in an open letter Disney employees say, \"It's an increasingly uncomfortable place to work for non progressives that our beliefs come under attack. And they see people who share these beliefs condemned as villains by their own leadership.\" Now, this is just blatantly political, everything Disney's doing here. It's not in the least principled. If they were so committed to these issues, why do they do business in China, which engages in brutal oppression of minorities? Relying on laws, by the way, they are 10,000 times worse than anything in the parental rights bill. Now, since this isn't a matter of principle though, for Disney, you got to ask, what is the real end game here? I'll tell you what it is. By adopting this far-left corporate ethos, Disney has joined the cabal that believes that it's time to ostracize a huge swath of the American population, including traditional Americans, people of serious faith and social conservatives. Yes. They believe that you should be completely shut out of public life, and that your views shouldn't be frankly heard on the internet, TV, radio, taught at our universities. None of it. People who hold these views, these horrible views shouldn't serve in the military, certainly not as officers. They shouldn't be teachers, or sit on any corporate boards. And by the way, if you ever donate to one of these traditionalists in elected office, you're going to be denounced and trolled. Such was the case when LGBTQ activists discovered Disney had donated to the politicians who supported the DeSantis bill. So what they're trying to create is a world in which believing in more traditional sexual norms is the same as being a member of the KKK. This Disney controversy, by the way, is not a one-off. They want to put everyone on notice. If you're a devout Muslim, Catholic, Orthodox Jew, evangelical Christian, and you have these views? We're going to treat you like you support cross burning. Now, remember, when we were told, by the way, that tolerance was all the Liberals really wanted? Tolerance for different lifestyles, orientations. But now we see the real agenda, cultural annihilation of anyone who disagrees with them on these issues. They want to turn all of America into, kind of, like a gender studies class at UC Berkeley, where people are afraid to say anything that might possibly upset the Thought Police, where anyone who steps out of line is shunned or very severely punished. Think about JK Rowling. 10 years ago, she wasn't just a global bestseller, but a beloved liberal. But today, the left hates her more than Harry hated Voldemort. Folks like John F Kennedy, Bobby Kennedy, who appealed to devout Catholics. They'd never be welcomed in their party today. And, remember, even Obama in 2007. At that time, he was against gay marriage. He wouldn't be welcomed either. By taking their orders from extremists, who dominate the Democrat Party, Disney and like-minded corporations, are engaged in an expulsion project against at least half of America. They're going to lose billions in income until someone has the guts to do their own hostile takeover and return to common sense. But let's look on the bright side here. Ron DeSantis really smoked them out at Disney. Just like Brian Kemp smoked out Coca Cola and Delta when they supported boycotting the all-star game after leftists screamed about the voter integrity law in Georgia. We all know where they stand. And we can make our purchasing decisions accordingly. We love Mickey, but not more than we love our families. And that's the 'Angle'. Joining me now is Jose Castillo, who is currently a resort duty manager at the Walt Disney Company. Jose, are you concerned first and foremost about your job, your job security, by speaking out here tonight?"

Honestly, no, it's no secret here in central Florida that (inaudible) Congress that I'm a Disney worker, and I'm a strong conservative. To be honest, I'm not concerned about my job. Because I think if I were to get fired for my views, I think it would send a wrong message to conservatives, that conservatives would not be welcome at Disney. I know that right now, it seems like there's a misconception. This is what I tell people, there's a misconception out there that everyone at Disney is just raging liberals and that - I think, that could not be farther from the truth. For my perspective as a candidate running for Congress, I have tons of people that work for the Walt Disney Company that reach out to me daily on social media."

But I can tell you what, after people saw what they saw on those videos, they're not happy at all. So I'm glad your job security's there. Good for you. But someone who is a traditional conservative, social conservative, serious Christian or frankly, any other faith, is now being told that Disney's purpose - political purpose is to ensure that kindergarteners to third grade are taught about sexual orientation. That is the hill that Disney wants to die on, after making billions off of families who are traditionalist. That's the problem here. That's the problem."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CASTILLO",
      "utterance": "I think, they're making a terrible miscalculation that ultimately maybe - will be bad for business. Their statement says this about the bill that Ron DeSantis passed. They said, \"Our goal as a company is for the law to be repealed by the legislator or struck down by the courts\". And in the left, they talk about democracy after this election. And so what about our democracy right now? The people of Florida, a lot of Disney cast members voted for our state legislature. These are duly-elected members of Florida, House of Representatives in the Florida Senate who passed this bill, sent it to the governor. And thank God, our governor has the backbone to stand up to companies like mine, Disney, and pass this bill and stand with the people of Florida, stand with the parents and protect our children."

    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Well, I just - I can't tell you how many people I heard from today, said they're never going to Walt Disney world again. They're not going to Disney World, they are not going to Disneyland. They're not going to spend the thousands of dollars that are asked - they're charging at the Star Wars experience at Disney to essentially be told they're a bunch of anti-LGBT, horrible, awful rotten people. They're just not going to do that. So I mean, I guess Disney can cobble together their income from non-traditional Americans, but that's going to be a heavy lift. Now, a new poll is saying that a majority of Florida Democrats support its new parental rights bill. So Democrats support the parental rights bill. The numbers are huge. Again, Disney going with the far-left extremists, which I can't imagine what Walt Disney would think today."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CASTILLO",
      "utterance": "Well, the reason that's happening is because really - there's the saying, \"Squeaky wheel gets the grease\", and the small minority within the Walt Disney Company that's part of the LGBT community are screaming the loudest. They're being the loudest, they're being the most vocal. So we need conservatives like me here. I'm not a candidate, I'll be as loud as I can, tell them people that we need to stand up for our conservative values and I'll be doing the same in Congress. But what Disney fails to realize is that, we've gotten emails from our executive, saying their stance is on the bill and whatnot. And what people fail to realize, I knew where they stand - they stood already, but there's a lot of people that are disappointed in Disney--"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "But why would you want to work at a company, where the company essentially thinks that you're a bigot? I mean, what they said, essentially, about Ron DeSantis, and all the activists who supported what Disney did was that Ron DeSantis was a bigot. So I mean, again, the message to traditional Americans is, you're not welcome here. That's the message Disney is sending out. I'm going to say it very clearly tonight. Everyone's walking around this issue. They do not think that traditional Americans should have a seat at the table, or frankly, even be on corporate boards. I don't know how many conservatives around the court - on the board of Disney today. We should have put their names up on television tonight. But I think this is just the tip of the iceberg and corporate America is going to be in for a rude awakening. Thank you, Jose. We really appreciate you speaking out tonight. Now, when the media isn't helping fan the flames of a manufactured controversy, they're busy covering up for anything that might be inconvenient to their preferred political party. Now, as we all know, in October 2020, The New York Post exclusively reported on the contents of Hunter Biden's laptop. The biggest newsrooms in the world didn't work to confirm the details.

Now, Glenn, it's nice that they kind of referenced it and acknowledged it as a story.

      "utterance": "No, there's been none. And, remember, they didn't just dismiss the story. They peddled an outright lie that came from dozens of former intelligence officials that this material was Russian disinformation. Meaning two things, one, it came from Russia; and two, the emails are forged. They asserted it over and over. I can show you a hundred clips from CNN and NBC, and from liberal digital outlets saying this lie over and over. The evidence was overwhelming from the start that this material was authentic. A Politico reporter published a book eight months ago, with ample evidence concluding that it was true. The New York Times, 10 days ago, said they authenticated it. The Washington Post today said the same thing that these materials are authentic. Laura, not one of the outlets that spread that CAA lie, that this material in the weeks before the election was Russian disinformation, has even acknowledged any of that evidence, let alone retracted their lives, because they don't care about the truth. And the proof is in the pudding."

You can go find it, saying that this material is Russian disinformation. But in the two weeks up to the presidential campaign, Joe Biden, when asked about this material, repeatedly accused reporters who asked him about it, and the Republican Party and Donald Trump, who raised it of spreading Russian disinformation and serving Vladimir Putin a complete and total lie from the President on down. Not one reporter in that briefing room is saying. Now that the New York Times and The Washington Post have authenticated and confirmed the authenticity of the material, do you owe the American people an apology for lying to them? And the reason is, it's because those media figures, these personalities who work in the White House, were in cahoots with this lie, also spreading it on behalf of Joe Biden."

And there was ample evidence they were pursuing business deals in China, trading on the influence Biden build that as vice president and would again as president, to produce profitable deals, not just for Hunter Biden. He apparently got $5 million from those deals, but also possibly with Joe Biden's participation. And none of that was pursued because they lied and said the emails were fake and forged by Russia."

Emails between the AFT, the Biden White House, and the CDC show that the Biden administration's political leadership at the CDC positioned the union to impose line-by-line edits to the reopening guidance. So how do you obtain such sway? Well, in 2020, 99.9 percent of the AFT's donations went to Democrats, nearly $1 million. Republicans got $75 and that was from an employee. Of the 25 biggest recipients of AFT cash, four are Democratic senators up for reelection in tossups. Raphael Warnock of Georgia; Mark Kelly of Arizona; Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada; and Maggie Hassan, sneaky, in New Hampshire. Here now is the top Republic on that COVID Subcommittee, House Minority Whip Steve Scalise. Congressman, this level of coordination between the Democrats and teachers unions who have them in their back pocket. This is not science, this is politics."

And in fact, CDC was getting ready to come out with guidance that would have been more favorable towards opening schools. And then the teachers unions were given weeks - over a week before it came out. We're given a sneak copy of it that no one else got that we've been able to find. And said, \"OK, what do you think about this?\" And we had uncovered emails between the CDC Director and the union president saying, \"Wait a minute, we don't like this. We want new language that makes it easier to close schools.\" And they actually, the unions, gave different language to the CDC. And then CDC's final language was almost word-for-word verbatim from what the teachers union said. I don't know of any other group, surely no parents groups that got this kind of VIP access. And in fact, I asked the CDC Director today in the hearing, to give me a list of anybody else that they gave this kind of access to change the documents."

And second of all, I mean, the teachers unions, we know from the Chicago experience, Congressman, they never want to go back. They - if they could stay remote forever, the unions would be happy to stay. Just like your colleagues never want to come back to do actual voting in-person. So why would we ever ask for their guidance since they don't want to come back to work?"

And keep in mind too, Laura, this is all going on under the backdrop when the Justice Department is calling parents, domestic terrorists, for showing up at school board meetings. So I asked the CDC Director, give me names of parent groups that you consulted and gave the same kind of VP act - VIP access. They couldn't give me a name. And I said, I want to know, were parents allowed to have the same kind of ability to change the science, like the unions were able to give to keep schools closed. And she couldn't give me a single name, because it was the union bosses who said, \"Look, don't come up with this until you give us new ability to shut down schools\".

It's there that we begin to see the bias surface."

BOB WOODSON, THE WOODSON CENTER FOUNDER & CEO: Well, first of all. Thanks for having me on, Laura. This whole emphasis on race, it really is a flip side is, I think, white progressive narcissism, that somehow that the destiny and future of black America depends upon what white people do or do not do. Dr. King really warned against that in her letter from a Birmingham jail when he said the greatest stumbling block to black progress is not the white citizen's council or the KKK. It is the white moderate, that lukewarm acceptance from people of good will is more difficult to tolerate than outright rejection of people of ill-will. And some of these progressives that are teaching this poison to our children, in one sense, are worse than bigots. They're worse than hardline bigots, because they are really preaching self-annihilation. Every five minutes, Laura, a child is shot in America. I know of a black woman who lost all four of her children, her four sons, to homicide before the age of 30. There is a crisis in America, and the answer to those kinds of challenges is not going to come from teaching white people to be less racist. It is narcissistic to believe that, but also harmful to the nation. It's poisonous."

It's a cultural inflection point, and it glamourizes and normalizes these ad hoc beatings and smackdowns you see all across America. You don't need a leading actor like this, particularly one that families identify with, enacting this violence, and it shouldn't be celebrated or condoned. And when O.J. Simpson comes out to support you, Laura, as he did Will Smith, you're probably not the innocent party. Maybe Smith can play \"The Juice\" next. And there are those peculiar Instagram posts.

Obama pollster Cornell Belcher telling \"Vanity Fair\" \"Plan B is complete f-ing chaos.\" Democrats are already feeling out their options, so Pete Buttigieg, Kamala Harris, the Rock. Joining me now, Ari Fleischer, former White House press secretary, FOX News contributor, and Victor Davis Hanson, Hoover Institution senior fellow. Ari, first the media confirms the Hunter news that we all knew last year, and now they're already talking 2024 replacement. A part of me wonders if the media is now beginning to turn on Joe."

And after the blowout the Democrats are going to go through in November, they are going to just call on Biden to step aside so a new generation can run. And you sent me back down memory lane -- 27 Democrats ran for president when the last open seat was there in 2019-2020. We remember Biden, we remember Harris, we remember Buttigieg. But Beto O'Rourke ran, Jay Inslee ran, Marianne Williamson ran. Do you remember all these names -- 27. It's going to be the same situation in the next open seat.

And the vice-presidential solution to the presidential problem is worse. The solution's worse than the problem. So I guess you go back, as Ari said, to the 2020 candidate field. But the problem there, Laura, is that all of their agendas have been actualized. They got what they wanted and they're a disaster. When you look at the individual people, Beto's going to lose the Texas race, Buttigieg has been a disaster as transportation secretary, booker had a t-bone gush the other day. There's no there there. And in the past when the Democratic Party was hijacked in 72 by McGovern and 88 by Dukakis, there was a solution. They got a southern governor like Jimmy Carter or Bill Clinton. Not that they were moderate, but they posed as moderate. I don't see anybody there. Gavin Newsom, maybe Jared Polis in Colorado, or maybe they can bring back Andrew Cuomo. But there's not the traditional solution of going hard left and destroying the party as they had in the past."

Ted Cruz mentioned her last night that really, that's maybe their only hope. But if we have soaring chaos oversees and inflation at home, I'm not sure a celebrity is going to change much."

You have six Democratic Socialists now serving in the House of Representatives. And the Democrat Party, which used to be somewhat of a moderate party, is now an overwhelmingly liberal socialist party, and it's the kiss of death. It's one of the reasons Hispanics are increasingly becoming Republican. They're kicking everybody off except the far let progressives who will never be happy, and their agenda can never be achieved. So the Democrats are going to be a shell of a party, and it's going to happen because Biden is not going to be able to run for reelection. And this is going to start the day after Election Day. In seven months, that's when you're going to hear the Democrats go to Biden and say, you need to announce you're not running. We need time to organize our campaigns. We need to know that the field is clear. This is going to be a disaster for the Democrats. 2024 is a long way away. We'll see electorally what happens. But getting there, a wide open field of chaos."
