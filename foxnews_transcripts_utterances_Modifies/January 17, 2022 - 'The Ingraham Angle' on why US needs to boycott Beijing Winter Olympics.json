Now, it was only two years ago that China was furiously working to cover up the truth about the virus that would ravage the globe and change American society in profound ways. They had the WHO and even President Trump praising their efforts. But the disturbing truth eventually came out about China. \"Several labs, including government labs, had the complete genetic sequence of the virus within the first few days of January, but Chinese officials blocked the sharing of any information about the virus. The data wasn't made public until January 11.\" Then from notes released months later, we found out that the WHO chief of emergencies Dr. Michael Ryan sounded the alarm on January 8. He said, \"The fact is, we're two to three weeks into an event; we don't have a laboratory diagnosis; we don't have an age, sex or geographic distribution; we don't have an epi curve.\" As a result of China's cover up then, there were enormous delays in the global response and the development of vaccines and effective strategies to slow the virus' spread. Even China's own version of the CDC admitted that \"Between the day the full genome was first decoded by a government lab on January 2, and the day the WHO declared a global emergency on January 30, the outbreak spread by a factor of 100 to 200 times.\" Well, of course, then China also fed lies about the vet market origins of the virus. Now we know that the virus most certainly escaped from the Wuhan Institute of Virology. We still don't know if it was an accident. If it was related to the Fauci funded highly controversial gain-of-function research. But of course, the CCP refuses to fess up to any part of this. And they never provided unfettered access to the lab, data, or the samples. They never took responsibility for this virus. They never offered compensation for any of the victims. China did, however, locked down millions of its own citizens and made certain inconvenient scientists disappear. And then they went on to brag about how effective their response was to the virus. Look, comrade, zero COVID. They cashed in on the drugs and the PPE that they had spent years cornering the market on as a result of, of course, the U.S. stupidly relinquishing its share of key industries to the communist regime. Now, this was all happening, of course, as China was crushing dissent in Hong Kong and committing ongoing atrocities against this ethnic Muslim minorities, the Uyghurs.",

And as the virus spread around the globe, other inconvenient Chinese figures, even high-profile CEOs mysteriously went missing. Even if they're CCP members any perceived criticism of President Xi, and they're forced to confess to bogus charges, and then these individuals are usually sentenced to jail terms. They'll never survive. This is the Chinese way. Yet now after all this, the CCP is going to be rewarded with a huge propaganda coup. The athletes of the world will be traveling to compete in the Beijing Winter Olympic Games on February 4. How obscene? Atlanta wasn't allowed to host Major League Baseball's All-Star game. But China's allowed to host the games, the big games. This is grotesque, and it's sickening. This is why the 'Ingraham Angle' Not One Minute. Now, we can't force a boycott, but we can pledge not to spend one minute watching NBC's coverage of President Xi asides Olympics. Think about it this way. Every minute you watch, you put money in the pocket of those profiting off the communist (ph) piarco. And you all know that I love sports and we love our athletes, and we celebrate them. And we're going to celebrate them upon their return. But we will respond to this hideous sellout by corporate America and the only language they understand, money. The corporations that have decided to sponsor the torture games like Visa, Coca Cola and Intel, they must hear from you. You can choose where to spend your own hard earned money going forward. Knowing where these companies put their value, when contacted by members of the press about the moral issue of sponsoring the games, these companies run and hide. Now, one of them, French tech company, Otto's even told Fox News, it was proud of the role they play. Those same CEOs certainly had no problem though trashing Georgia when the time came.

Our government's policies are really to blame here for the current situation with China. It's long since time we began the process of decoupling from the CCP. Today is shocking. 1/3 of all manufacturing in the world is done in China. Think about what that does, and has done to the millions of Americans dependent on factory jobs here, and the millions of ancillary businesses that were affected by this. We have paid a very high price for cheap goods. The ultimate insult though, comes from President Xi himself, who obviously thinks we're very stupid people.

The sad fact is most American elites invariably nodded in response to Xi today. They're thinking to themselves, how bold and forward thinking. For decades, our so-called leaders, except President Trump, have done everything possible to help the murderous CCP regime at our expense. And of course, our business community has repeatedly bent over backwards and forwards to court, China's business. So of course, it's no surprise that big business and the IOC believed that Americans would simply shut up and take it while they turn the Olympic - Winter Olympics into the latest propaganda coup for their pal President Xi. But I'm telling you tonight, they're wrong. We're tired of pretending that the CCP operates under some kind of rule of law. And we're also tired of buying things made with their slave labor. We will not support companies who help the CCP. We will not vote for politicians, who help the CCP. We will not celebrate President Xi's dictatorship. Figure skating and hockey, they're great. And we look forward to watching them again someday. But this year, the cries of the Uyghurs; the people of Hong Kong; the journalists, and everyone who wants to know the truth about COVID are just too loud to ignore. And that's the 'Angle'. All right.

We had one party far-left liberal monopoly that has been in control in two years. And they passed a series of laws and made Virginians less safe, less secure. They voted to end the mandatory reporting requirement of sexual assault in schools. They tried to end mandatory minimums for even second offense, stealing drugs to a child at a school or a bus stop. They are reducing from felony to a misdemeanor or assaulting a Police officer. And you layer on top of that, a lot of these far-left special interests. They call themselves, justice prosecutors, but they never conveniently ever mentioned justice for the victims that are deciding not to prosecute wholesale crimes, and particularly in northern Virginia. What you've seen is in these outer excerpts outside of DC, voters were so concerned that they solved this sky high rate - murder rate. The murder rate in Fairfax has doubled since the Fairfax prosecutor Descano took over, another one of these far-left social justice woke warriors that have taken over. And so, our message is, we are now going to value law enforcement. We're not going to defund them. We're going to defend them and give them the tools they need to do their jobs.

Parents know what's best. And we want to empower the parents to make that decision. And so, at the end of the day, if you have a legislature that's going to be in defiance of what the general assembly hopefully is also going to codify in the law.

The protecting the student part of it, when you look at this population, this is a very low risk population, zero to near zero death in severe illness from COVID infections as per the CDC data. So these shots are not medically necessary in this population. And the second point of protecting the community, we now know that the vaccines don't protect people from getting infections and being contagious.

Now, it was only two years ago that China was furiously working to cover up the truth about the virus that would ravage the globe and change American society in profound ways. They had the WHO and even President Trump praising their efforts. But the disturbing truth eventually came out about China. \"Several labs, including government labs, had the complete genetic sequence of the virus within the first few days of January, but Chinese officials blocked the sharing of any information about the virus. The data wasn't made public until January 11.\" Then from notes released months later, we found out that the WHO chief of emergencies Dr. Michael Ryan sounded the alarm on January 8. He said, \"The fact is, we're two to three weeks into an event; we don't have a laboratory diagnosis; we don't have an age, sex or geographic distribution; we don't have an epi curve.\" As a result of China's cover up then, there were enormous delays in the global response and the development of vaccines and effective strategies to slow the virus' spread. Even China's own version of the CDC admitted that \"Between the day the full genome was first decoded by a government lab on January 2, and the day the WHO declared a global emergency on January 30, the outbreak spread by a factor of 100 to 200 times.\" Well, of course, then China also fed lies about the vet market origins of the virus. Now we know that the virus most certainly escaped from the Wuhan Institute of Virology. We still don't know if it was an accident. If it was related to the Fauci funded highly controversial gain-of-function research. But of course, the CCP refuses to fess up to any part of this. And they never provided unfettered access to the lab, data, or the samples. They never took responsibility for this virus. They never offered compensation for any of the victims. China did, however, locked down millions of its own citizens and made certain inconvenient scientists disappear. And then they went on to brag about how effective their response was to the virus. Look, comrade, zero COVID. They cashed in on the drugs and the PPE that they had spent years cornering the market on as a result of, of course, the U.S. stupidly relinquishing its share of key industries to the communist regime. Now, this was all happening, of course, as China was crushing dissent in Hong Kong and committing ongoing atrocities against this ethnic Muslim minorities, the Uyghurs."

Even if they're CCP members any perceived criticism of President Xi, and they're forced to confess to bogus charges, and then these individuals are usually sentenced to jail terms. They'll never survive. This is the Chinese way. Yet now after all this, the CCP is going to be rewarded with a huge propaganda coup. The athletes of the world will be traveling to compete in the Beijing Winter Olympic Games on February 4. How obscene? Atlanta wasn't allowed to host Major League Baseball's All-Star game. But China's allowed to host the games, the big games. This is grotesque, and it's sickening. This is why the 'Ingraham Angle' Not One Minute. Now, we can't force a boycott, but we can pledge not to spend one minute watching NBC's coverage of President Xi asides Olympics. Think about it this way.

Knowing where these companies put their value, when contacted by members of the press about the moral issue of sponsoring the games, these companies run and hide.

Our government's policies are really to blame here for the current situation with China. It's long since time we began the process of decoupling from the CCP. Today is shocking. 1/3 of all manufacturing in the world is done in China. Think about what that does, and has done to the millions of Americans dependent on factory jobs here, and the millions of ancillary businesses that were affected by this. We have paid a very high price for cheap goods. The ultimate insult though, comes from President Xi himself, who obviously thinks we're very stupid people.

For decades, our so-called leaders, except President Trump, have done everything possible to help the murderous CCP regime at our expense. And of course, our business community has repeatedly bent over backwards and forwards to court, China's business. So of course, it's no surprise that big business and the IOC believed that Americans would simply shut up and take it while they turn the Olympic - Winter Olympics into the latest propaganda coup for their pal President Xi. But I'm telling you tonight, they're wrong. We're tired of pretending that the CCP operates under some kind of rule of law. And we're also tired of buying things made with their slave labor.

And remember, he's just echoing what the Warriors coach said at the beginning of this controversy a few years ago. And Mr. (ph) Kerr said that, well, you know, we have our own problems. We have mass shootings. And so, who are we to talk about the human rights? So it's always - we're going to look at their felonies and excuse them because of our misdemeanors. And as the - the Chinese are brilliant, Laura. They really understand this needless, self critical, self loathing, Western trait to look at us and say, we're not perfect, we're not good. They're not good, but they're perfect. And that's - it's really, it's really depressing, and it's everywhere in our culture.

And they're not just liberating Virginia's economy and taking out the radical school boards, they're also restoring law and order. Within hours of taking office, Attorney General Jason Miyares open major investigations. And that includes investigating the state parole board for the early release of violent felons without notifying their victims. And his office will also look into the Loudoun County School Board's brazen attempt to cover up of the sexual assault of a young girl on campus. Joining me now is the new attorney general of the Commonwealth of Virginia, Jason Miyares. Mr. Attorney General, congratulations on taking office.

      "utterance": "Well, I mean, the message is there's a new sheriff in town. And what we saw in Virginia, big reason why we won is that we've had a criminal first victim last mindset in Richmond. We had one party far-left liberal monopoly that has been in control in two years. And they passed a series of laws and made Virginians less safe, less secure. They voted to end the mandatory reporting requirement of sexual assault in schools. They tried to end mandatory minimums for even second offense, stealing drugs to a child at a school or a bus stop. They are reducing from felony to a misdemeanor or assaulting a Police officer. And you layer on top of that, a lot of these far-left special interests. They call themselves, justice prosecutors, but they never conveniently ever mentioned justice for the victims that are deciding not to prosecute wholesale crimes, and particularly in northern Virginia. What you've seen is in these outer excerpts outside of DC, voters were so concerned that they solved this sky high rate - murder rate. The murder rate in Fairfax has doubled since the Fairfax prosecutor Descano took over, another one of these far-left social justice woke warriors that have taken over. And so, our message is, we are now going to value law enforcement. We're not going to defund them. We're going to defend them and give them the tools they need to do their jobs. We're not going to have a criminal first victim last mindset, kind of a victim first mindset. So it's a new day in Virginia."

I want to talk about mask mandates, because localities are now resisting Governor Youngkin's order rescinding the mask mandates, including Fairfax County, Arlington County, the City of Alexandria. That's right outside of DC, very liberal. Now, the White House is siding with these counties. Jen Psaki from her personal account, tweeting, \"Hi there. Arlington County parent here (don't believe you are Glenn Youngkin but correct me if I'm wrong). Thank you to the Arlington Public schools for standing up for our kids, teachers and administrators and their safety in the midst of a transmissible variant.\" Aside from the poorly written tweet, Mr. Attorney General, are you going to take these counties to court?"

But the Virginia constitution is clear. Parents have a fundamental right to the upbringing and the education of their children. And so, I think this is a classic case of a lot of bureaucrats and far-left Democrats that think they know more what's best for your child, more than the parent. And we've said from day one, there's a huge change in Virginia. We're going to empower parents. We're not going to empower far-left politicians. And every time I hear a far-left liberal say, they know what's best for my child. I always ask them, ok, what's their name? When's their birthday? And that's going to be the key. Parents know what's best. And we want to empower the parents to make that decision. And so, at the end of the day, if you have a legislature that's going to be in defiance of what the general assembly hopefully is also going to codify in the law. Absolutely, we're going to look at all options, including if need be, take them to court. Because this is about parents know what's best for their child. If you have a child that has asthma, I had - absolutely, you should make that decision."

Mr. Attorney General. I really appreciate your coming on tonight. We look forward to having you on the show down the road. And Republican National Committee, well, they're also finally taking on a different debate and a battle. That's the Commission on Presidential Debates. In a scathing letter RNC Chairwoman and my next guest, Ronna McDaniel notified the commission, that she had lost faith in their organization and threatened to keep GOP candidates from participating in the presidential debates if nothing changes going forward. Since the debate commission's liberal bias was a total boon to Biden in 2020, the White House was unsurprisingly very peeved."

And then they switched one of the debates to virtual to let Joe Biden stay in the basement. So Republicans know when we have a free and fair forum, and when we have an exchange of ideas, we win. That's why we said to the debate commission, we want to guarantee that debates will start before 26 states start voting. They said no, thanks, we don't want to work with you.

What, seven percent inflation, an energy crisis with gas prices soaring, COVID on the rise, problems in Russia? So much is going on that's a failure under this administration, I don't know what they can even point to as a success. Of course, we have Republican governors that kept their states open, their economies are surging, they kept their kids in school, and that contrast is so stark. Look at Glenn Youngkin's inaugural address last weekend and compare that to what Biden did in Georgia. Look at the difference in between hope and optimism and division and destroying our country and calling Republicans racists like Joe Biden did in Georgia."

The paper's editorial board writing \"The governor's next move would be to find a way to mandate the kind of mass vaccination campaign we should've launched a year ago, going as far as to deploy the National Guard to ensure that people without proof of vaccination would not be allowed, well, anywhere.\" The petty little tyrants in Washington, D.C., are hard at work making this a reality as well. The city's vax mandate in D.C. went into effect over the weekend, hitting black residents the hardest -- 58.6 percent are not vaccinated. And now, they are being banned from having a normal life. This is disturbing, and it's a mandate mindset that has unfortunately taken hold at my Alma Mater, Dartmouth College. The school not only has a vax mandate for students, faculty, and staff, but they're also mandating booster shots as well. And my next guest is Joni McGary the mother of a Dartmouth junior.

So they're asking the students to get boosted at Dartmouth and 325 colleges across the country. The protecting the student part of it, when you look at this population, this is a very low risk population, zero to near zero death in severe illness from COVID infections as per the CDC data. So these shots are not medically necessary in this population. And the second point of protecting the community, we now know that the vaccines don't protect people from getting infections and being contagious.
