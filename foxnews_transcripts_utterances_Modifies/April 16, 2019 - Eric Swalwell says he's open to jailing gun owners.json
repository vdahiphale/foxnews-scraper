If you're O'Rourke, you're out there running for President really hard or at least running for Vice President, you're running anyway.  You're given speech after speech every day. \"Children are our future. Today is the first day of the rest of your life.\" Inspiring stuff like that. Deep stuff like that. And there's a physical component to the job, too. You're riding your skateboard for the camera. You're taking God knows how many selfies for your fans on Snapchat and Instagram. It's not an easy gig.  Then one morning, you wake up and discover that your one true love -- the American news media -- have called it off. They've left you for a younger, hotter candidate. Went out for a pack of cigarettes that just never came home. They split with some guy from Indiana. You can't even pronounce the guy's name.",

They don't just want to vote for this guy, they want to consume him like a hearty stew -- every last drop of Buttigieg, yum. They're all in.  What's going on here exactly? Who is this guy? There are a lot of liberals running for President right now. Why would the 37-year-old mayor of some third-string Midwestern city -- no offense, but that's what it is - - why would that guy stand out? Why is he more impressive than, I don't know? Senator Cory Booker or former Governor John Hickenlooper, or for that matter any of the approximately eleven thousand progressive Democrats running for President at the moment. Why is this guy better than them? That's a pretty tough question actually. We checked. Nobody knows. Least of all, Buttigieg himself. His website gives you his bio and then tells you how young he is -- very young -- it says pretty much nothing about what policies he might support. That's not an accident, but we can't just talk policy points all the time, Buttigieg said recently, \"As Democrats, we have to figure out how to tell a better story about our principles,\" end quote. And actually that's not a crazy point.  Storytelling does matter, but first you have to know what your story is. You have to know what your principles are, and suddenly neither party knows this. They're not sure what they stand for and that's really why things seems so bizarre right now in this country politically, why they are so chaotic.  The confusion is especially acute on the left, we have to say, because when your only principle is gaining power, well, you're out of luck. You wind up elevating people like Bernie Sanders who seem like they're acting on principle, but are just the opposite. Here's one example. Sanders recently took fire from the left wing think- tank Center for American Progress. CAP noted the irony -- and it's real -- that Bernie Sanders became a millionaire by writing a book about how millionaires are evil.  Sanders didn't like that criticism. Last night, he delivered this response to it. Listen.",

Just like Jack Kemp and Ronald Reagan, it is fine. He's not embarrassed about it and neither were they, but let's not call it socialism. Let's not tell the kids it is socialism. It's not socialism. Bernie may think it is, or more likely, he doesn't think that much about anything. Maybe he is not capable of it or he doesn't care to or whatever. How else to explain this?

And he basically said, \"Well, nobody should be denied entry at the border.\" Okay, so where are they going to stay? \"Shut up. That's not a real question. Don't demonize immigrants. Pass comprehensive immigration reform.\" He reverts immediately to talking points. That's not impressive, it's buffoonish and it's par right now.   In the Democratic Party, logical incoherence is practically a campaign plank. For example, Democrats are telling us that America sends too many people to jail and they may be right about that. We sent a lot of people to jail. They're telling us we need to let thousands of drug dealers out of jail even though we're in the middle of the worst drug epidemic in American history. They even got the White House to sign on to that as you may have noticed and so it's happening. Legislation passed and was signed. And yet, even as thousands of criminals stream out to freedom and to voting which is always the point, at least one Democratic Presidential candidate, Eric Swalwell, tells us we need to send a new class of people back to prison.

He is just making noises he thinks the left wants to hear. That's what they're all doing on every topic. They tell us the Green New Deal is the most important thing we can do. It's more important than the beaches at Normandy. It's more important that winning World War II. It's more important than putting a man on the moon. Neil Armstrong, shh; the Green New Deal is in town now.  Okay, so what's in the green New Deal? Nobody knows. They're making it up as they go along. Impeach Trump. It must be done.

There's nothing progressive about Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.  Here's the real division -- it's between equality which is the traditional agenda of the Democratic Party. An agenda that cared about the individual and the constitutional rights that protected the individual and the new wing of the Democratic Party, which news to Nancy Pelosi is bigger than five people. It's the identity politics wing of the party. Identity politics is the opposite of equality. Identity politics preclude equality. They make it impossible. In identity politics, all groups are not equal. Some are much better than others. Some must be destroyed. That is not equality, it is permanent war. So that's what's taken the place of concerns about the individual and you can see it even in the personal behavior of the Democratic candidates for President. Beto O'Rourke for example, it turns out gave one-third of one percent of his total income to charity last year, one third of one percent. He's a rich guy, too. Kamala Harris, also a rich person, 1.4 percent to charity.  So why are these people not being called out on this? They want to run the country where they give nothing to charity? Well, because they say the right things, that's why. They check the little identity politics boxes. They're against white privilege. So it's enough, except it's not enough. This is not a satisfying style of politics, it doesn't actually improve anyone's life. It's not working and the Democrats running for President even though standing on the sidelines know it's not working. They're going to lose to President Trump unless they figure out a way to improve the lives of actual people, otherwise the internal contradictions in this party will become unbearable. This is the party of hedge fund managers and illegal aliens. What holds it all together? They have no idea, and until they find that out, it's going to fall apart. Nate Lerner is executive director of Build the Wave. He helped found the group Draft Beto, and we're happy to happen on tonight. Nate, thanks very much for coming on. So it must -- I mean, there's something kind of poignant about watching yesterday's adored figure get cast aside for this new character, this cad from Indiana or whatever, but it does raise the kind of bigger question here which is, what is the principle -- the core principle of the Democratic Party right now?",

The source goes on to say quoting here, \"They realized how serious the charges are, but feel that once the judge hears their story, he will see they had no bad intention.\" So let's review. Loughlin and Giannulli newly allegedly paid a half million dollars to bribe their two daughters into the University of Southern California to be designated as recruits for the crew team even though their daughters had never rowed before and now Loughlin and Giannulli say they did not believe they were money laundering, they felt the $500,000.00 would be used as a donation to benefit the school, which begs the question why didn't they donate money to the school? And a legal expert is telling Fox News that after pleading not guilty, Loughlin and her husband have very few options saying that because they face 40 years in prison, they desperately need to cut a plea deal, but the best case scenario could be maybe 21 to 27 months in prison, although experts also say the final decision is up to a judge.

It doesn't matter that it's his program and he can invite on whomever he wants. It doesn't matter that his fans are obviously happy with his program. More people listen to Joe Rogan than watch anything on CNN or MSNBC. Media Matters is sending a warning. Joe Rogan had better listen to them or they'll crush him. They'll find some excuse to start an ad boycott to take his show away. Now if you ask Media Matters, they'd say they're upset because Rogan doesn't care about diversity, but of course the truth is exactly the opposite. Rogan is popular precisely because he welcomes a diversity of opinion -- left, right, everyone in between, Milo Yiannopoulos, Elon Musk, Alex Jones -- he has interviewed them all. If you've got something interesting to say, Rogan and his fans want to hear it. But for the speech police on the left, that's terrifying because they don't control it, so it shouldn't exist at all. Why tolerate freedom when you can have power instead. So stay strong Joe Rogan. I'm sure you will. During his Fox Town Hall last night, Bernie Sanders said his position on abortion. It is pretty clear, it should be legal without any restriction at all up to the moment of birth. Watch.",

They don't just want to vote for this guy, they want to consume him like a hearty stew -- every last drop of Buttigieg, yum. They're all in. What's going on here exactly? Who is this guy? There are a lot of liberals running for President right now. Why would the 37-year-old mayor of some third-string Midwestern city -- no offense, but that's what it is - - why would that guy stand out? Why is he more impressive than, I don't know? Senator Cory Booker or former Governor John Hickenlooper, or for that matter any of the approximately eleven thousand progressive Democrats running for President at the moment. Why is this guy better than them? That's a pretty tough question actually. We checked. Nobody knows. Least of all, Buttigieg himself. His website gives you his bio and then tells you how young he is -- very young -- it says pretty much nothing about what policies he might support. That's not an accident, but we can't just talk policy points all the time, Buttigieg said recently, \"As Democrats, we have to figure out how to tell a better story about our principles,\" end quote. And actually that's not a crazy point. Storytelling does matter, but first you have to know what your story is. You have to know what your principles are, and suddenly neither party knows this. They're not sure what they stand for and that's really why things seems so bizarre right now in this country politically, why they are so chaotic. The confusion is especially acute on the left, we have to say, because when your only principle is gaining power, well, you're out of luck. You wind up elevating people like Bernie Sanders who seem like they're acting on principle, but are just the opposite. Here's one example. Sanders recently took fire from the left wing think- tank Center for American Progress. CAP noted the irony -- and it's real -- that Bernie Sanders became a millionaire by writing a book about how millionaires are evil. Sanders didn't like that criticism. Last night, he delivered this response to it. Listen."

A pretty good book, you might want to read it. It's a bestseller. It's sold all over the world and we made money.

Just like Jack Kemp and Ronald Reagan, it is fine. He's not embarrassed about it and neither were they, but let's not call it socialism. Let's not tell the kids it is socialism. It's not socialism. Bernie may think it is, or more likely, he doesn't think that much about anything. Maybe he is not capable of it or he doesn't care to or whatever. How else to explain this? Last night on this channel, Sanders seems completely baffled when Martha MacCallum asked him a very simple question. The immigrants being detained at the border, where should they be kept exactly?

And he basically said, \"Well, nobody should be denied entry at the border.\" Okay, so where are they going to stay? \"Shut up. That's not a real question. Don't demonize immigrants. Pass comprehensive immigration reform.\" He reverts immediately to talking points. That's not impressive, it's buffoonish and it's par right now. In the Democratic Party, logical incoherence is practically a campaign plank. For example, Democrats are telling us that America sends too many people to jail and they may be right about that. We sent a lot of people to jail. They're telling us we need to let thousands of drug dealers out of jail even though we're in the middle of the worst drug epidemic in American history. They even got the White House to sign on to that as you may have noticed and so it's happening. Legislation passed and was signed. And yet, even as thousands of criminals stream out to freedom and to voting which is always the point, at least one Democratic Presidential candidate, Eric Swalwell, tells us we need to send a new class of people back to prison.

He is just making noises he thinks the left wants to hear. That's what they're all doing on every topic. They tell us the Green New Deal is the most important thing we can do. It's more important than the beaches at Normandy. It's more important that winning World War II. It's more important than putting a man on the moon. Neil Armstrong, shh; the Green New Deal is in town now. Okay, so what's in the green New Deal? Nobody knows. They're making it up as they go along. Impeach Trump. It must be done.

There's nothing progressive about Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Here's the real division -- it's between equality which is the traditional agenda of the Democratic Party. An agenda that cared about the individual and the constitutional rights that protected the individual and the new wing of the Democratic Party, which news to Nancy Pelosi is bigger than five people. It's the identity politics wing of the party. Identity politics is the opposite of equality. Identity politics preclude equality. They make it impossible. In identity politics, all groups are not equal. Some are much better than others. Some must be destroyed. That is not equality, it is permanent war. So that's what's taken the place of concerns about the individual and you can see it even in the personal behavior of the Democratic candidates for President. Beto O'Rourke for example, it turns out gave one-third of one percent of his total income to charity last year, one third of one percent. He's a rich guy, too. Kamala Harris, also a rich person, 1.4 percent to charity. So why are these people not being called out on this? They want to run the country where they give nothing to charity? Well, because they say the right things, that's why. They check the little identity politics boxes. They're against white privilege. So it's enough, except it's not enough. This is not a satisfying style of politics, it doesn't actually improve anyone's life. It's not working and the Democrats running for President even though standing on the sidelines know it's not working. They're going to lose to President Trump unless they figure out a way to improve the lives of actual people, otherwise the internal contradictions in this party will become unbearable. This is the party of hedge fund managers and illegal aliens. What holds it all together? They have no idea, and until they find that out, it's going to fall apart. Nate Lerner is executive director of Build the Wave. He helped found the group Draft Beto, and we're happy to happen on tonight. Nate, thanks very much for coming on. So it must -- I mean, there's something kind of poignant about watching yesterday's adored figure get cast aside for this new character, this cad from Indiana or whatever, but it does raise the kind of bigger question here which is, what is the principle -- the core principle of the Democratic Party right now?"

I just wonder how the actual policy prescriptions line up in favor of what you just said, so obviously unrestricted immigration, more low skilled immigration helps big companies. It doesn't help average people. The Green New Deal is a massive, obviously, blank check to the power companies. Now, the green power companies, but they're still power companies.

I'm just being honest about it there. But the Democratic Party does seem like there's been a huge reorientation and I'm not really sure what it's about anymore, are you?"

It seems clear to me that Bernie Sanders whatever you think of him, has a full toehold in the race. He has got money. He has got a base of support and you could tell in that audience last night that he has a strong base of support even in parts of Trump country. So those are two candidates who are not young and not new faces, obviously, who will -- who I think will be with us awhile. What we can't tell is whether you know Beto O'Rourke or Pete Buttigieg or Kamala Harris or any of these others are going to develop any momentum or going to have any staying power and I think, this is a field that is really kind of shapeless at this stage and is in terms of our understanding of it, it is it in bad need of being winnowed which I think, before very long, it will start to be."

The thing you have to weigh against all of this, Tucker, when you start thinking that these people are pretty far out there is, if in the end somebody -- a member of the old guard is nominated. Will people stay home or vote for Trump? I doubt the people who were disillusioned by Joe Biden are going to vote for Donald Trump, just to cite an example. I don't think -- I don't think that's going to happen."

They believe he's the Antichrist and the most evil man ever to be President and maybe something worse than that. So they have that powerful unifying factor on that side, which I think will tend to knit the party together when all is said and done. But between now and then, who knows what's going to happen. We don't know whether young Pete Buttigieg for example it was just having a moment and will prove to be a flash in the pan or whether his seemingly thoughtful approach to things where he seems a little more substantive than Beto O'Rourke for goodness' sake will last a while or whether he'll just fade from the scene, you know, flavor of the month. It's very hard to tell and you know, we've got all these other characters in there. Eric Swalwell?

A source close to Loughlin is now telling \"Entertainment Tonight\" that those who orchestrated this whole cheating scandal misled and manipulated Lachlan about the severity of her involvement and that she and her husband were under the impression they were breaking rules, not laws. The source goes on to say quoting here, \"They realized how serious the charges are, but feel that once the judge hears their story, he will see they had no bad intention.\" So let's review. Loughlin and Giannulli newly allegedly paid a half million dollars to bribe their two daughters into the University of Southern California to be designated as recruits for the crew team even though their daughters had never rowed before and now Loughlin and Giannulli say they did not believe they were money laundering, they felt the $500,000.00 would be used as a donation to benefit the school, which begs the question why didn't they donate money to the school? And a legal expert is telling Fox News that after pleading not guilty, Loughlin and her husband have very few options saying that because they face 40 years in prison, they desperately need to cut a plea deal, but the best case scenario could be maybe 21 to 27 months in prison, although experts also say the final decision is up to a judge. Loughlin's friends reportedly say until the actress recently, she believed that she'd just end up getting a slap on the wrist. She does not think that anymore, Tucker."

A lot of kids are struggling to buy homes or start families well into their 30s. Many are living at home because of the debt they face, and yet some people, a small group are getting very rich from this setup. But what's interesting is that does not include a lot of the people who actually do the teaching in colleges, whether you like them or not. At many schools, many classes are now taught increasingly so by adjunct faculty. They receive low pay and little to no benefits. Many moonlight as Uber drivers or waiters to pay the bills. In other words, college administrators are the Lords here and the faculty are mere serfs. Now Jason Nichols is Professor of African-American Studies in the University of Maryland. He is a frequent guest on the show. We always debate politics when he's on, but he seemed like someone who might be worth talking to about this because it's an interesting fact. So Professor, thanks a lot for coming on to explain this to us."

      "speaker": "NICHOLS",
      "utterance": "Well, I would say, you know in many cases it's the banks that actually lend people money to go to college. Oftentimes, when you're looking to trace money and who is making money, it's usually the banks. Then of course, at some universities, it may be the football coach, it may be the President of the university. There are lots of people who get paid lots of money and they do their job, they do it well, hopefully. At some universities, they don't do it so well, but either way they get paid a lot. But you have a lot of adjunct faculty, people who have gone to school for eight, ten, fifteen years in some cases in order to get a Doctorate because they're passionate about teaching and they are actually part of the working class even -- and some of them are even impoverished. They're sitting there and driving Uber just to make ends meet or doing real estate or mowing lawns or doing whatever they can to make money and this is actually really problematic and it's not good for students and learning. That's one of the biggest problems."

That tells me that the college is not putting any kind of priority on teaching. They don't care. That's the message I'm getting, am I right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "NICHOLS",
      "utterance": "Well, I would agree in many ways. I think, teaching is something that is undervalued. We put a lot of value on research and in some cases research that people don't read, and then all of a sudden, teaching becomes a secondary aim of the university and of a lot of departments and so I think that is very problematic. And also a lot of the people who are working to get a Doctorate are also teaching a lot of the courses and you have a lot of young people who are being taught by people who don't have much more experience than them and at the same time, you know, the people who are studying to get a Doctorate sometimes don't make it through the program because they're working so much teaching the courses."

Anyway we're here in LA. The other day we passed through a town south of here, Laguna Beach, California and we saw to our surprise that the local cop cars, they were decorated with a logo that features the American flag. Now that should not surprise us, because this is after all America even its westward outpost, it's still America, but it did surprise us. We were surprised that anyone could get away with supporting America in 2019, and it turns out we were right to be surprised. Laguna Beach Police are now under attack for using the flag.

They despise it because it implies that America is a country inhabited by Americans rather than a hodgepodge of other cultures united only by economic interest. That's their vision. If Americans remembered that it's an actual country and not just some massive private equity scheme, they might expect their politicians to focus on the best interests of Americans, the people who live in that country, but focusing on Americans would threaten the hegemony of the Democratic Party so there could be none of this country or sovereignty talk, the flag must go, even in little Laguna Beach, California well. Well, as we told you at the top of the show, Democratic Presidential candidate Eric Swalwell committed an almost unprecedented act of honesty recently when he talked about guns. He didn't talk about background checks or barrel shrouds. He was far more blunt. He said, \"We're banning semi-automatic rifles if I'm President. We're going to take them from their owners by force and anyone who refuses to comply goes to jail.\" That's the Swalwell program. Quentin James is co-founder of the Collective PAC, pretty familiar with Democratic politics and Mr. James joins us tonight. Thanks so much for coming on. So we've had Swalwell on this show a bunch of different times about Russia. We've never had him on about guns. He won't come on. So I'm interested in your take on this. I don't think I'm misunderstanding it and in fact I'm not, what he is saying is that anybody who possesses illegal product today will soon be a felon when he makes that product illegal and without committing any act of violence, that person can be imprisoned. That sounds like mass incarceration to me. I would think you'd be against it."

It got great ratings. Everyone who saw it was excited. For a moment, America seemed united in cheering on a legend. Sports used to be like that all the time. Now, whether it's the National Anthem or the voting preferences of athletes, as if we should care, sports divide us too often. How can we get back to where we were? Jason Whitlock co-host Fox Sports 1, speak for yourself and he joins us tonight. Jason, thanks all for coming on. JASON WHITLOCK, CO-HOST, FOX SPORTS 1: Thank you for having me."

What Tiger represented in 1997 when he won his first Masters and the iconic hug with his father after winning the Masters at 21 and then his dad has passed. That was a tragedy for Tiger. Obviously, what happened in Thanksgiving 2009 with his wife and Tiger's image blowing up in his face that was a tragedy and then all of the injuries that Tiger has had, and then he had -- he got an addiction to painkillers. Tiger has become a comeback story and an underdog. Tiger Woods didn't think he would ever play at a high level again for a while. He thought he might never play again and then to see him return to the greatest golf event America has and to win and to win against a group of young guys that basically he created, it's the \"Rocky\" story --"

When Muhammad Ali lit the torch in the Atlantic Olympics in 1996 that was a great wonderful story and kind of the bow on Muhammad Ali's career. This kind of feels like even though I'm sure Tiger is going to be in competition for more Masters and major tournaments. But this kind of feels like the bow to Tiger Woods' career and it's a great -- it's like a movie, man."

      "speaker": "WHITLOCK",

Because at the end of the day, all of these sporting ranging from golf to football, they're just television shows and they're way off script trying to have these political debates. This is the place for a political debate."

No, we're there to watch athletes do things we could only dream of doing. We're there to be entertained and we're there to -- You may be a right-wing person and this may be a left wing person, but we both love Tiger Woods and we both love football. This is the way we bond."

      "speaker": "WHITLOCK",
      "utterance": "Okay, I come back to the same people all the time. It's Silicon Valley. It's the tech companies. It's social media. Because they've hooked all these athletes from their social media brand and they're more caught up in their social media brand than their brand as great athletes. Our brains have been hacked. And all of these athletes, many of them, not Tiger Woods but many of them -- in football and basketball other sports, they're addicted to their cell phones. They're addicted to social media. They want to be popular there and the way to be popular there is to be polarizing and divisive."

Plus, Bernie Sanders, the latest Democrat to endorse abortion up until birth, the great Dean Cain here to respond to that. He's got a new film on the subject, straight ahead."

      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Joe Rogan is a comedian and television figure and host of a podcast called \"The Joe Rogan Experience.\" You may not know it, but it's a big deal. It's one of the most downloaded podcasts in the world. Suddenly, he has some very angry critics on the left. Media Matters which is a character assassination organization benefiting the Democratic Party, but posing as a non-profit just went after Rogan. Their complaint, he has too many men on his program. It doesn't matter that it's his program and he can invite on whomever he wants. It doesn't matter that his fans are obviously happy with his program. More people listen to Joe Rogan than watch anything on CNN or MSNBC. Media Matters is sending a warning. Joe Rogan had better listen to them or they'll crush him. They'll find some excuse to start an ad boycott to take his show away. Now if you ask Media Matters, they'd say they're upset because Rogan doesn't care about diversity, but of course the truth is exactly the opposite. Rogan is popular precisely because he welcomes a diversity of opinion -- left, right, everyone in between, Milo Yiannopoulos, Elon Musk, Alex Jones -- he has interviewed them all. If you've got something interesting to say, Rogan and his fans want to hear it. But for the speech police on the left, that's terrifying because they don't control it, so it shouldn't exist at all. Why tolerate freedom when you can have power instead. So stay strong Joe Rogan. I'm sure you will. During his Fox Town Hall last night, Bernie Sanders said his position on abortion. It is pretty clear, it should be legal without any restriction at all up to the moment of birth. Watch."

      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "So like 10 years ago that would be considered an extreme position. Today, it's the moderate position in the Democratic Party. Some are defending infanticide just flat-out. Safe, legal and rare. No. That's not at all the position today. It should be free, frequent and horrifying so Dean Cain starred in a movie called \"Gosnell.\" President Trump's screened it at the White House last week. He joins us tonight. Dean, thanks very much for coming on. So I think of you as having a pretty kind of traditional liberal view of abortion. You've never been advocating for the overturning of Roe v. Wade or anything. Are you surprised by how much the goalposts have moved in the last couple of years?"

I'm actually a pro-choice in my -- I were to be a legislator, I would legislate pro-choice about viability. I'd probably be in that ballpark where most of our states are, 20 weeks, 24 weeks and then there are extenuating circumstances, okay and I do want it to be rare. Personally, I'm very pro-life. I've been one in my life, but it's shocking to me that someone would advocate for allowing it up until the moment of birth. Kermit Gosnell did that. He had live births and then he killed the children. I mean, he very well could have just given them comfort care until they passed away like Governor Northam suggested, but he actually went out and he snipped their spinal cords and that's why he's in jail forever. But it's shocking to me."
