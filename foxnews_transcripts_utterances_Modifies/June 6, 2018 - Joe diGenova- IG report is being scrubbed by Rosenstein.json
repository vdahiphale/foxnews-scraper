      "sentences": "All right, Tucker. Great show as always. All right. This is just an amazing news night. Stay with us.  Welcome to 'Hannity.'  Eighteen months and counting and guess what? We're still waiting for that inspector general's report on how the FBI and DOJ completely mishandled the Clinton's server investigation.  But tonight, parts of that I.G. report and their findings are being leaked. We'll share it with you and it's not looking good for James Comey, Andrew McCabe or Loretta Lynch. But we will see. Are there going to be criminal referrals? We have new information. Also, we have breaking new information surrounding Mueller's runaway witch- hunt as he is now demanding that all witnesses turn over their phones so his merry band of Hillary-supporting and Trump-hating sycophants can comb through private communications. Are these witnesses going to be allowed to follow the Clinton model? Are they going to be allowed to delete, bleach bit, remove the SIM cards and bust them up with hammers? Interesting thought, I doubt it.  Also, the First Lady Melania Trump back in the public spotlight tonight after weeks of rampant and frankly disgusting speculation from your corrupt news media. We're going to show you how the president responded earlier today. And also, the president shining a light on criminal justice reform in the wake of his latest clemency grant, an amazing story. We'll analyze that and much more.  And more fallout, Bill Clinton still under fire for his disaster his book tour. Looks like Slick Willy is no longer getting a free pass from his friends in the media and the Democratic Party.   And we have yet another -- this one's probably the best one yet, amazing economic statistic, yes, all in a hundred -- and 501 days of Donald Trump. We have all of that, a lot to cover. Busy news night in tonight's very important opening monologue.",

      "sentences": "ABC News now reporting at this hour, the DOJ's watchdog, Michael Horowitz, is coming out strong against James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Loretta Lynch in his forthcoming report, which examines how Obama's Justice Department and FBI -- well, mishandled the criminal case into Hillary Clinton. In other words, we were right and your media was wrong.   And, of course, fired FBI Director James Comey, he cleared Hillary Clinton of all charges, but not before many public missteps, misdeeds surrounding the investigation. According to the report, quote, one source telling ABC that the draft report explicitly uses the words insubordinate to describe Comey's behavior. Now, the I.G. report will also allegedly rebuke Loretta Lynch and fired Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe. None of this is surprising. Remember, the McCabe report came out, then comes the criminal referral. After all, we know about Comey's exoneration before investigation. We know about Loretta Lynch's illicit tarmac meeting with Bill Clinton just before she helped clear his wife of all these charges. And we all know about McCabe's Democratic ties and rampant pattern of lying. And we also know Hillary Clinton -- she did commit felonies. She did obstruct justice. That is indisputable at this point.  As we reported last night, Andrew McCabe, he's now requesting immunity from the U.S. Senate in exchange for his testimony, possibly against his former boss James Comey.   The full, unredacted report should literally have been released by now. And frankly, if it's released any time between now and next Wednesday, remember we have the summit on Tuesday of next week, that means they're trying to bury this on a summer weekend, so it doesn't get the coverage it normally would. If they release it early next week, they are totally trying to bury this during this all-important summit in Singapore. What Americans deserve, what you deserve is justice in the form of criminal referrals for everybody we just mentioned it has been long months and Mr. Obstruction himself of Congress, Rod Rosenstein, he has had this report for two weeks already and I could only imagine what he's trying to get removed or changed or redacted.  Our own Catherine Herridge has a new report about FBI love bird, one of the two, Peter Strzok in this case, remember he was the agent demoted after his rampant anti-Trump text became publicly available, our own Catherine Herridge is reporting that he was actually the lead investigator in this Clinton case. He hated Trump. He wanted the insurance policy and then he moved on to the Russia, so-called Russia collusion case and then he was put on Mueller's witch hunt team. In other words, this Trump-hating FBI agent played a lead role in pretty much completely everything, including clearing Hillary Clinton of charges, crimes we know she committed, and then tapped to investigate Donald Trump. One more reason the inspector general's report should have been released by now.  And meanwhile, as the Mueller witch hunt churns on, the special counsel -- this is interesting -- they are demanding that witnesses turn in their phones so team Mueller and, of course, his pit bull Andrew Weissmann and Jeannie Rhee, who worked for Clinton, get to review all of their electronic communications. He wants the phones turned over even texts that are on what are called encrypted apps like WhatsApp or Signal or one of these things.  Maybe Mueller's witnesses, I don't know. If I advise them to follow Hillary Clinton's lead, delete all your emails and then acid-wash the emails and hard drives on the new phones, then take your phones and bash them with a hammer into little itsy-bitsy pieces, use BleachBit, remove the SIM cards, and then take the pieces and hand it over to Robert Mueller and say, Hillary Rodham Clinton, this is equal justice under the law, how do you think that would work out for everybody who Mueller is demanding their phones of tonight? I'm certain the result would not be the same as Hillary's.  And meanwhile, the person in charge of his Mueller witch hunt, the deputy A.G. Rod Rosenstein, he has responded to growing calls for his recusal, writing a letter to Senator Lindsey Graham stating he will recuse himself if deemed appropriate, and he recommended -- he's the guy that recommended Comey's firing. He signed off on the final FISA warrant based on Hillary Clinton's bought and paid for dossier that even Christopher Steele said there may be 50/50.   So, given that Rosenstein is overseeing an investigation where he's a key witness and he signed off on the FISA I think it's probably deemed inappropriate a long time ago. And earlier today, former New York City mayor, current Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani had very strong words for the seemingly never-ending fishing expedition to undo the election of you the American people. Watch what the former mayor had to say.",

Also, the president delivered a very special message for the media today, on Twitter, writing: The fake news media has been so unfair, so vicious to my wife, our great First Lady Melania, during her recovery from surgery. They reported everything from near death to facelift to she left me in the White House for New York or Virginia to abuse, all fake and she's doing really well. Let's turn our attention now to Kim Kardashian. OK, you didn't expect me to say that, did you?  She visited the Oval Office as you know recently, to shine a light on the criminal justice system and reform in particular and one case involving Alice Marie Johnson who was a great-grandmother. Remember, she was sentenced to life in prison after being found guilty of nonviolent drug charges. It was only a first offense. Today, President Trump commuted the sentence of Ms. Johnson who has already served 22 years.   A few hours ago, Kim Kardashian thanked the president, writing, quote: So grateful to @RealDonaldTrump, Jared Kushner and to everyone who showed compassion and contributed countless hours to this important moment for Ms. Alice Marie Johnson. Her commutation is inspirational and gives hope to so many others who are also deserving of a second chance.  And, of course, by the way, this is likely just the beginning of what is a long needed conversation in this country about sentencing criminal reform that the president has vowed to tackle, this two-tier justice system that we now know way more than we should about, it stretches wide and it stretches far. These issues must be addressed, equal justice under the law, equal application of the laws. We do wish Ms. Johnson all our best tonight. And meanwhile, someone was actually benefited from our two-tiered justice system, speaking of which, his whole entire life, former president Bill Clinton. Yes, he's back in the spotlight, believe it or not. He's finally facing some backlash from the mainstream media and Democrats over his long history of sexual abuse and misconduct.   And Democrats and the media, remember, they protected the Clintons all through the last presidential campaign that is until November 9th, 2016, the day after Hillary lost. Remember this.",

These are issues that should transcend politics. Finally, tonight, we finish with yet another amazing piece of economic news, perhaps the best ever.

We're still waiting for that inspector general's report on how the FBI and DOJ completely mishandled the Clinton's server investigation. But tonight, parts of that I.G. report and their findings are being leaked. We'll share it with you and it's not looking good for James Comey, Andrew McCabe or Loretta Lynch. But we will see. Are there going to be criminal referrals? We have new information. Also, we have breaking new information surrounding Mueller's runaway witch- hunt as he is now demanding that all witnesses turn over their phones so his merry band of Hillary-supporting and Trump-hating sycophants can comb through private communications. Are these witnesses going to be allowed to follow the Clinton model? Are they going to be allowed to delete, bleach bit, remove the SIM cards and bust them up with hammers? Interesting thought, I doubt it. Also, the First Lady Melania Trump back in the public spotlight tonight after weeks of rampant and frankly disgusting speculation from your corrupt news media. We're going to show you how the president responded earlier today. And also, the president shining a light on criminal justice reform in the wake of his latest clemency grant, an amazing story. We'll analyze that and much more. And more fallout, Bill Clinton still under fire for his disaster his book tour. Looks like Slick Willy is no longer getting a free pass from his friends in the media and the Democratic Party. And we have yet another -- this one's probably the best one yet, amazing economic statistic, yes, all in a hundred -- and 501 days of Donald Trump. We have all of that, a lot to cover. Busy news night in tonight's very important opening monologue."

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "ABC News now reporting at this hour, the DOJ's watchdog, Michael Horowitz, is coming out strong against James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Loretta Lynch in his forthcoming report, which examines how Obama's Justice Department and FBI -- well, mishandled the criminal case into Hillary Clinton. In other words, we were right and your media was wrong. And, of course, fired FBI Director James Comey, he cleared Hillary Clinton of all charges, but not before many public missteps, misdeeds surrounding the investigation. According to the report, quote, one source telling ABC that the draft report explicitly uses the words insubordinate to describe Comey's behavior. Now, the I.G. report will also allegedly rebuke Loretta Lynch and fired Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe. None of this is surprising. Remember, the McCabe report came out, then comes the criminal referral. After all, we know about Comey's exoneration before investigation. We know about Loretta Lynch's illicit tarmac meeting with Bill Clinton just before she helped clear his wife of all these charges. And we all know about McCabe's Democratic ties and rampant pattern of lying. And we also know Hillary Clinton -- she did commit felonies. She did obstruct justice. That is indisputable at this point. As we reported last night, Andrew McCabe, he's now requesting immunity from the U.S. Senate in exchange for his testimony, possibly against his former boss James Comey. The full, unredacted report should literally have been released by now. And frankly, if it's released any time between now and next Wednesday, remember we have the summit on Tuesday of next week, that means they're trying to bury this on a summer weekend, so it doesn't get the coverage it normally would. If they release it early next week, they are totally trying to bury this during this all-important summit in Singapore. What Americans deserve, what you deserve is justice in the form of criminal referrals for everybody we just mentioned it has been long months and Mr. Obstruction himself of Congress, Rod Rosenstein, he has had this report for two weeks already and I could only imagine what he's trying to get removed or changed or redacted. Our own Catherine Herridge has a new report about FBI love bird, one of the two, Peter Strzok in this case, remember he was the agent demoted after his rampant anti-Trump text became publicly available, our own Catherine Herridge is reporting that he was actually the lead investigator in this Clinton case. He hated Trump. He wanted the insurance policy and then he moved on to the Russia, so-called Russia collusion case and then he was put on Mueller's witch hunt team. In other words, this Trump-hating FBI agent played a lead role in pretty much completely everything, including clearing Hillary Clinton of charges, crimes we know she committed, and then tapped to investigate Donald Trump. One more reason the inspector general's report should have been released by now. And meanwhile, as the Mueller witch hunt churns on, the special counsel -- this is interesting -- they are demanding that witnesses turn in their phones so team Mueller and, of course, his pit bull Andrew Weissmann and Jeannie Rhee, who worked for Clinton, get to review all of their electronic communications. He wants the phones turned over even texts that are on what are called encrypted apps like WhatsApp or Signal or one of these things. Maybe Mueller's witnesses, I don't know. If I advise them to follow Hillary Clinton's lead, delete all your emails and then acid-wash the emails and hard drives on the new phones, then take your phones and bash them with a hammer into little itsy-bitsy pieces, use BleachBit, remove the SIM cards, and then take the pieces and hand it over to Robert Mueller and say, Hillary Rodham Clinton, this is equal justice under the law, how do you think that would work out for everybody who Mueller is demanding their phones of tonight? I'm certain the result would not be the same as Hillary's. And meanwhile, the person in charge of his Mueller witch hunt, the deputy A.G. Rod Rosenstein, he has responded to growing calls for his recusal, writing a letter to Senator Lindsey Graham stating he will recuse himself if deemed appropriate, and he recommended -- he's the guy that recommended Comey's firing. He signed off on the final FISA warrant based on Hillary Clinton's bought and paid for dossier that even Christopher Steele said there may be 50/50. So, given that Rosenstein is overseeing an investigation where he's a key witness and he signed off on the FISA I think it's probably deemed inappropriate a long time ago. And earlier today, former New York City mayor, current Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani had very strong words for the seemingly never-ending fishing expedition to undo the election of you the American people. Watch what the former mayor had to say."

And, of course, by the way, this is likely just the beginning of what is a long needed conversation in this country about sentencing criminal reform that the president has vowed to tackle, this two-tier justice system that we now know way more than we should about, it stretches wide and it stretches far. These issues must be addressed, equal justice under the law, equal application of the laws. We do wish Ms. Johnson all our best tonight. And meanwhile, someone was actually benefited from our two-tiered justice system, speaking of which, his whole entire life, former president Bill Clinton. Yes, he's back in the spotlight, believe it or not. He's finally facing some backlash from the mainstream media and Democrats over his long history of sexual abuse and misconduct. And Democrats and the media, remember, they protected the Clintons all through the last presidential campaign that is until November 9th, 2016, the day after Hillary lost. Remember this."

These are issues that should transcend politics. Finally, tonight, we finish with yet another amazing piece of economic news, perhaps the best ever. For the first time since the stat started recording, the United States has more jobs today than jobless claims. Get that -- more jobs available than we have people on the unemployment lines. And on top of that, we have 14 states today with record low unemployment numbers and record low unemployment for women, African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans. Remember, if this was the Obama administration, I guarantee you, Chris Matthews would be having a lot of thrills running up and down his leg. It'd be non-stop 24/7. But this president did promise you jobs, jobs and more jobs, and in 501 days, guess what? He's delivering. Joining us now with reaction to our monologue and all the breaking news tonight, he's the former U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia and that is Joe diGenova. Let me start with the I.G. report, 18 months later. I have a problem, he doesn't -- but we did have a good result in the case of McCabe where there was a criminal referral, but now, Rod Rosenstein and the DOJ, they have had this report for now two weeks. Why am I suspicions the same guy that has obstructed Congress and won't hand over the documents that they've subpoenaed to do their congressional constitutional oversight? Why do I not trust them that they want changes, revisions, redactions to protect themselves?"

He believes in the institution of the Department of Justice and the FBI to the exclusion of any accusations of fault. And what's happening right now is that the I.G. report is being scrubbed by Rosenstein and his minions and people at the FBI, and they are removing as much embarrassing information about the bureau as possible. And unfortunately, it's going to delay the release of the report and perhaps put it out during the Singapore summit. This conduct by Rosenstein and the people responsible for the delay is reprehensible, but it is of a pattern because what they want to do is they want to hurt the president -- believe it or not, the deputy attorney general wants to hurt the president and he wants to prevent the release of truthful information to deny transparency to the American people to protect career people inside the Department of Justice and the FBI. What happened during the campaign and what happened during the Hillary Clinton email server investigation is a national disgrace and Rosenstein should be at the forefront of releasing that information. And instead, he is trying to hide substantial portion of it."

      "speaker": "HANNITY",

So, in other words, if it's released any time between now and all through next week with this historic summit taking place in Singapore with Kim Jong Un and President Trump, would you agree with me that they're either burying it on a summer Friday weekend, or they're burying it during one of the most historic summits in history?"

      "speaker": "DIGENOVA",

The reason it's being delayed is also to allow the leaks which you saw today, the partial leak of the description of Comey's insubordination. Wow, that's a big surprise, he was insubordinate. He was more than that. He not only was insubordinate, he subverted the Department of Justice and its core function, even though Loretta Lynch was compromised, there sat Sally Yates with all of her flaws who could have easily described what happened and could have just decided this case on behalf of the attorney general. But what's happening now is there delaying purposely to prevent timely disclosure."

It's irrefutable -- it's indisputable at this point, it's incontrovertible at this point. Hillary in fact violated the Espionage Act. She put top-secret classified special access programming information on a private server. That's illegal, and she lied about it."

Of course, that wasn't the way Hillary Clinton was treated because James Comey conducted a fraudulent investigation. No subpoenas. No search warrants. No grand jury. Massive use illegally of immunity, with the permission of the attorney general and Sally Yates, the deputy attorney general. So, what you have is a double standard, and it's just flagrantly visible by the way Mueller is conducting his investigation. The ultimate pressure as opposed to the ultimate no pressure in the Hillary Clinton investigation."

He's the guy that interviewed Flynn and said he didn't lie to the FBI. He's the guy that then flew to London and was involved in the investigation at Trump immediately and Robert Mueller appointed this guy. When are the charges against him coming?"

It's impossible not to, and if it didn't, then, of course, the Horowitz's performance would be abysmal. But I expected to deal with it. Strzok is a very, very serious person in all of this. He would probably be someone because of the knowledge that he has of Comey's and other activities who may very well be immunized. But my guess is, is that there will be criminal referrals from the investigation involving the way the FBI covered up the Clinton investigation and basically as a bunch of dirty cops led by the senior dirty cop, James Comey, threw the case. It's really the most embarrassing situation in history of the FBI."

Despite dozens of them by the way RSVP, yes, we'll be there and a thousand fans going to Washington only to be screwed by the Eagles. I never liked the Eagles. I still don't. And I'm sick of the NFL and I'm sick of all of this nonsense. Now we are going to hide in the locker room so we'll take our knee there. We can't respect the flag that people fought, bled and died under. And meanwhile, tonight, the destroy Trump media owes the president and the first lady a serious apology for the absolutely vile and vicious coverage of the first lady and her public absence in recent weeks. She did just have surgery. Well, the first lady joined the president a FEMA briefing earlier today as we showed you earlier. Joining us with reaction, we'll see who rules world it is, she's already a deficit because she's not here, Jessica Tarlov. And he is the co-hosts of not one but two shows 'Watters World' and of course, 'The Five.' Go ahead."

In every generation there have been heroes like them. Patriots who answer the call to serve, who do whatever it takes, wherever and whenever we need them to defend America."
