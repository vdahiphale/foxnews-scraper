      "sentences": "Welcome to HANNITY this busy Friday news night. Tonight, it is no secret that from the very beginning, we had really low expectations of the Biden White House. Now, somehow, some way, yeah, things are even far worse than we predicted. This is not hyperbole. This is not Sean Hannity talking points. No. As we speak, even Democrats and Republicans and the media mob are openly questioning if Joe and Kamala will even or be in a position to run for re election with some wondering if they can even finish out their current term. It is a legitimate concern. Every day this week was a horror show, one worse than the other. On Monday, the CDC recorded a record high 1.35 million new COVID cases in the United States. Oh, he was going to shut down the virus. On Tuesday, make believe Georgia Governor Stacey Abrams stood up the leader of the free world during his bizarre rant in Atlanta about the so-called voting rights bill and pretty much calling a lot of people racist. On Wednesday, we learned that inflation is now at a 40-year high, 40-year high, and all while Biden's approval rating this week hit a new low 33 percent in Quinnipiac's latest poll. And on Thursday, and the U.S. Supreme Court shot down Biden's vaccine mandate for large employers. At the same time, two Democratic senators, that would be Senator Joe Manchin, Kyrsten Sinema killed Biden's dreams of abolishing the filibuster. And now, the fake voting rights bill and the rest of the Biden agenda is dead in the water. And today, the HHS reported a record high, 157,000 COVID hospitalizations. Mr. I will shut down the virus has some explaining to do. But if you want answers -- well, you're going to have to track him down somewhere in Delaware, because he's spending yet another long weekend, not working, away from the White House. And today, before he left, Joe Biden could not be bothered to address any of the major issues affecting our country. Instead he gave an ironic speech about unity once again and building bridges. Biden also praised his infrastructure czar Mitch Landrieu or as Biden called him Mitch McConnell. Whoopsy-daisy, shocker. Take a look.",

Voting rights, doesn't look like that is going to pass. These vaccine mandates that they have been pushing businesses to institute on employees, it turns out the Supreme Court thinks that they are mostly illegal and this is a president who you go back two years, he tried to stand out in this giant Democratic field -- in the primaries by saying, I'm the one with all the experience, send me to D.C. because I know how to get things done. And that was a big, big part of his pitch the entire time and almost a year in, it just -- is not playing out like that, Sean. You know, especially when you look at his comments about Bull Connor and, you know, here's a guy that praised Strom Thurmond. Here's a guy that praised George Wallace.

Well, we found out today that next week, you can go to COVIDtests.gov to finally start ordering those 500 million free at-home tests. The problem is they're saying that once you ordered it, you're not going to get it for 7 to 12 days.

Now, between the COVID, the economy, 40-year high inflation, supply chain crisis, border crisis, America sadly is facing a multitude of really serious crises and Democrats, the media mob only seem to care about one thing and one thing only, the January 6 Capitol riot. Unfortunately, they're not concerned with finding out why there was a security breakdown at the Capitol, how to prevent this from ever happening again. In fact, according to the chairman of the January 6 committee, Speaker Pelosi who is ultimately in charge of security in the House is totally off limits. But, of course, they are now desperately trying to haul in Republican Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. This committee is a blatant political sham. They have one goal, and that is to purge Donald Trump away from the White House forever. Joining us now with more, former Trump chief of staff, Mark Meadows, Indiana Congressman Jim Banks. You know, Congressman Meadows, we now have confirmed, the joint chiefs, secretary of defense, you, the chief of staff for the Defense Department, all in the room, Donald Trump multiple times requests that the -- up to 20,000 troops get called in. If that happened, January 6 never would have happened. But he didn't -- he only had the legal authority to call -- to authorize it. He did his part. Why didn't Pelosi and why didn't the mayor of D.C. understand after the summer of 2020 riots, knowing hundreds of thousands of people were there, knowing tensions were high, knowing you always have bad actors in crowds, what would -- what reasons did they give you if any why they wouldn't call up the troops the president authorized?",

But I think more importantly, the four days that just happened will be a turning point because what you see now are Democrats are starting to say, listen, we've got to have a candidate for 2024, we've got to have a plan, and it's not a January 6th plan and that's not going to be the success in the midterms in 2022 that they think it will be.",

Now this move is expected to be voted on by committee members when the RNC holds their winner meeting. That's early next month in Salt Lake City. But, of course, the mob, the media are melting down, totally distraught over the push for balance and presidential debates. Joyless Behar over at that hard-hitting news show the view tweeted, quote: Are they afraid that their candidates can't keep up? Bloomberg writer Tom O'Brien added: Another example of Republicans antipathy toward public institutions and civil processes leading them to just walk away. Of course, the mob has said little about Joe Biden's constant refusal to talk to the press less than oh the last six presidents. But we're learning that Joey finally will hold a press conference next week. Here with reaction, FOX News contributor Joe Concha, along with RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel. Ronna, you're not saying you're against debate you're against the debate commission and I agree with you. I think it was the right call. I don't think any debate should take place after a single vote is cast. That's number one. Number two, you have -- you have the RNC or the DNC, you guys should be able to hammer out what the rules are, who the moderators are, I volunteer. And that'll never happen I know. But who the people should be? Are you say -- are they saying they can't enter into negotiations and come to an agreement?",

And they said no pound sand, we don't want to work with the party. We don't care about 74 million Republicans. We're going to negotiate with the candidate. The problem is you don't get a nominee until July or August of 2024 and by then it's too late. So, the RNC has said, enough is enough.

But now shifting gears to the city of Baltimore, Baltimore City, their city state's attorney, Marilyn Mosby, has been federally indicted on charges of perjury, filing false mortgage applications related to the purchase of two vacation homes in Florida. And get this, we are learning that Vice President Harris was a strong inspiration for Mosby. Harris said of Mosby back in 2017, she cannot fail and I know she will not fail. Mosby told the local paper in 2020, there would be no Marilyn Mosby without Kamala Harris. When I won states attorney, Kamala was my inspiration.

EMILY COMPAGNO, CO-HOST, \"OUTNUMBERED\": That's true. There is software for that. Part of the reason is so important to comply and execute search warrants so fast within the usual ten-day period is because evidence can become ephemeral, Sean. So, here we have someone that has claimed publicly the reason he didn't want his phone to be made public is because there were love letters to his wife, he said things of a private nature, but that doesn't matter in a criminal investigation. The subject of a search warrant was his cell phone and that is why he should have turned it over. To Pam's point to go from a ten day time period to four weeks is unacceptable, now this created extra work for the sheriff's office because they will have to determine whether or not any type of evidence or any type of important communications was, in fact, deleted. That means they have to issue additional search warrants or subpoenas to ensure through other communications they are that they were getting the whole picture from it.

Now, somehow, some way, yeah, things are even far worse than we predicted. This is not hyperbole. This is not Sean Hannity talking points. No. As we speak, even Democrats and Republicans and the media mob are openly questioning if Joe and Kamala will even or be in a position to run for re election with some wondering if they can even finish out their current term. It is a legitimate concern. Every day this week was a horror show, one worse than the other. On Monday, the CDC recorded a record high 1.35 million new COVID cases in the United States. Oh, he was going to shut down the virus. On Tuesday, make believe Georgia Governor Stacey Abrams stood up the leader of the free world during his bizarre rant in Atlanta about the so-called voting rights bill and pretty much calling a lot of people racist. On Wednesday, we learned that inflation is now at a 40-year high, 40-year high, and all while Biden's approval rating this week hit a new low 33 percent in Quinnipiac's latest poll. And on Thursday, and the U.S. Supreme Court shot down Biden's vaccine mandate for large employers. At the same time, two Democratic senators, that would be Senator Joe Manchin, Kyrsten Sinema killed Biden's dreams of abolishing the filibuster. And now, the fake voting rights bill and the rest of the Biden agenda is dead in the water. And today, the HHS reported a record high, 157,000 COVID hospitalizations. Mr. I will shut down the virus has some explaining to do. But if you want answers -- well, you're going to have to track him down somewhere in Delaware, because he's spending yet another long weekend, not working, away from the White House. And today, before he left, Joe Biden could not be bothered to address any of the major issues affecting our country. Instead he gave an ironic speech about unity once again and building bridges. Biden also praised his infrastructure czar Mitch Landrieu or as Biden called him Mitch McConnell. Whoopsy-daisy, shocker. Take a look."

You matter, we're building back and building back better with you. I want to thank you all for listening and we got a lot of work to do and the reason I asked Mitch Mc -- to do this is because he knows how to get things done.

Now, of course, Press Secretary John Psaki has her own unique way of responding to the growing chaos inside the Biden White House, as the dumpster fire now gets worse and worse.

Right now, this White House is dealing with quite a collection of recent losses. They -- the Build Back Better social spending plan doesn't look like that's going to pass. Voting rights, doesn't look like that is going to pass. These vaccine mandates that they have been pushing businesses to institute on employees, it turns out the Supreme Court thinks that they are mostly illegal and this is a president who you go back two years, he tried to stand out in this giant Democratic field -- in the primaries by saying, I'm the one with all the experience, send me to D.C. because I know how to get things done. And that was a big, big part of his pitch the entire time and almost a year in, it just -- is not playing out like that, Sean. You know, especially when you look at his comments about Bull Connor and, you know, here's a guy that praised Strom Thurmond. Here's a guy that praised George Wallace. Here's a guy that partnered with Robert Byrd, a former Klansman, to stop the integration of public schools. Nobody's ever asked him about it, because he didn't want public schools integrated because he said they would become racial jungles.

But they lost that gamble. And something else that's remarkable. You know, they constantly pivot back to the pandemic and look at us. We know how to handle COVID-19. Well, we found out today that next week, you can go to COVIDtests.gov to finally start ordering those 500 million free at-home tests. The problem is they're saying that once you ordered it, you're not going to get it for 7 to 12 days. That means that if you think you have COVID symptoms and the CDC says basically go about your life after five days, you can have a symptom isolate, go about your life and then your test comes from the Biden administration and their latest plan."

But we have inflation also at a 40-year high. We have the highest number incidences of COVID positivity since the beginning of the pandemic. He didn't shut it down. We don't have the antivirals.

And unfortunately, the opposite is true. Not only has he not carried out on that promise, he is literally doing the exact opposite rapidly carrying our country in the wrong direction, tearing us apart, pouring fuel on the flames of divisiveness and it just -- I mean it really makes me wonder how we can go through three more years of this and still come out the other end with the possibility of being able to come together again as Americans, as the United States of America."

And what is so extremely dangerous about this, Sean, is that the president United States is the authority here in America. And so, if our president is targeting Americans for being, quote-unquote, anti-authority, what they're really saying is you are an enemy of the state if you are against the president or his policies. This is the foundation of authoritarianism. And it's -- the message that is received by people at home is if you're going to target me for being against your policies as the president, there will be consequences and therefore what are people to do?

Now, between the COVID, the economy, 40-year high inflation, supply chain crisis, border crisis, America sadly is facing a multitude of really serious crises and Democrats, the media mob only seem to care about one thing and one thing only, the January 6 Capitol riot. Unfortunately, they're not concerned with finding out why there was a security breakdown at the Capitol, how to prevent this from ever happening again. In fact, according to the chairman of the January 6 committee, Speaker Pelosi who is ultimately in charge of security in the House is totally off limits. But, of course, they are now desperately trying to haul in Republican Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. This committee is a blatant political sham. They have one goal, and that is to purge Donald Trump away from the White House forever. Joining us now with more, former Trump chief of staff, Mark Meadows, Indiana Congressman Jim Banks. You know, Congressman Meadows, we now have confirmed, the joint chiefs, secretary of defense, you, the chief of staff for the Defense Department, all in the room, Donald Trump multiple times requests that the -- up to 20,000 troops get called in. If that happened, January 6 never would have happened. But he didn't -- he only had the legal authority to call -- to authorize it. He did his part. Why didn't Pelosi and why didn't the mayor of D.C. understand after the summer of 2020 riots, knowing hundreds of thousands of people were there, knowing tensions were high, knowing you always have bad actors in crowds, what would -- what reasons did they give you if any why they wouldn't call up the troops the president authorized?"

I can -- I can tell you, the questions need to be asked of Speaker Pelosi and Mayor Bowser, both of them, because ultimately, it's the two of them that had the responsibility of authorizing those National Guard troops to be on the ready, in place on January 6. And so, to see what we have, everything focused on this, the reason why that's happening, Sean, is this -- it's the events that have led up to this first year of the Biden administration where you have just listed the fact that energy prices are going up, not a secure border the Afghanistan withdrawal was a debacle they have nothing to run on. But I think more importantly, the four days that just happened will be a turning point because what you see now are Democrats are starting to say, listen, we've got to have a candidate for 2024, we've got to have a plan, and it's not a January 6th plan and that's not going to be the success in the midterms in 2022 that they think it will be."

And first of all, Kevin McCarthy, anyone else at this committee has tried to drag before them should not be forced to participate when Nancy Pelosi herself refused to participate in the bipartisan homeland security investigation of January 6 over the last year. And she may -- still today, she keeps documents in her office that she refuses to turn over that that point to this big point that we're making about the breakdown of security and the lack of the National Guard coming to the Capitol. Secondly, it's not -- the coincidence isn't lost on any of us, that the same week that inflation hits a 40-year high and Joe Biden's approval rating at 33 percent is the worst approval rating of any sitting president at the end of his first year happens in the same week that they want to go after -- that they want to go after the Republican leader Kevin McCarthy. And then third, Sean, it's obvious to me. It's long past time for the Republican Party to kick Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger out of the House GOP conference."

Now this move is expected to be voted on by committee members when the RNC holds their winner meeting. That's early next month in Salt Lake City.

Ronna, you're not saying you're against debate you're against the debate commission and I agree with you. I think it was the right call. I don't think any debate should take place after a single vote is cast. That's number one. Number two, you have -- you have the RNC or the DNC, you guys should be able to hammer out what the rules are, who the moderators are, I volunteer. And that'll never happen I know.

They picked a moderator that worked for Joe Biden. They switched to a virtual debate without talking to the candidates, and the RNC went to the commission on presidential debates and said, can you guarantee that these three egregious actions from 2020 will not happen again in 2024? And they said no pound sand, we don't want to work with the party. We don't care about 74 million Republicans. We're going to negotiate with the candidate. The problem is you don't get a nominee until July or August of 2024 and by then it's too late. So, the RNC has said, enough is enough. We are going to put our candidate in the best forum that is fair and not biased and we're taking this long needed action by the Republican National Committee."

But honestly, I think they feign outrage, I don't believe they believe it, number one. Number two, nobody's saying there won't be debates but the rules are going to change. I would say no debates if a -- if a single vote has been cast and I think you got to put a list together.

And at the time, we got to remember what happened here, he was soliciting Anthony Scaramucci who had become vehemently anti-Trump for questions to ask Trump during the debate. And that debate was ultimately cancelled. The Commission for Presidential Debates blamed COVID, but it appeared they were embarrassed about their debate moderator, didn't want him to be become a story, and he was clearly biased obviously. And they figured the less Joe Biden on stage in front of 70 million people, the better. And, of course, we all remember what happened in 2012. CNN, Candy Crowley jumps in to save Barack Obama against Mitt Romney. There are other examples. But what the RNC is saying here is that they have every right to question the commission's integrity and ask for changes to be made, to your point, hold these debates more earlier in September before votes are cast, because their track record speaks for itself and they deserve scrutiny, Sean."

The RNC is saying enough is enough. We are opening the field to a different way to do debates with a -- with a moderate or with a commission that's not biased. It's not fair to our candidate and it's not fair to the voters. And the fact that they wouldn't hold a debate before 26 states had started voting, it's egregious and it's wrong for the American people."

His COVID strategy, we don't have enough tests, we don't have enough therapeutics, monoclonal antibodies or antivirals. His agenda now appears dead in the Senate. Ask yourself, has Joe Biden gotten anything right? Has he done anything to make the life of the average American better? And rather than just be honest about the obvious failures, the media mob, they doubled down on the bizarre smearing of the GOP, or just do another night of January 6 coverage.

They just announced -- in \"The New York Times\" today, I think I saw the article where they're asking their 2020 four nominees to not engage in presidential debates. They're no longer a party.

Now, this week, he even compared Americans against his federal election takeover scheme to George Wallace and Jefferson Davis. You're starting to feel the unity? All right. He's brave enough to show up. I have no idea why -- former Obama economic adviser Austan Goolsbee. Okay, I'm just waiting for the spin. Forty-year high with inflation, gas up about a buck a gallon, average family paying -- because of inflation, on average, $5,000 more per household. That's how much it's costing. Your dollar today, if you take a dollar out of your pocket, I only carry 20s and 50s, but if you take -- I'm joking by the way.

But now shifting gears to the city of Baltimore, Baltimore City, their city state's attorney, Marilyn Mosby, has been federally indicted on charges of perjury, filing false mortgage applications related to the purchase of two vacation homes in Florida. And get this, we are learning that Vice President Harris was a strong inspiration for Mosby. Harris said of Mosby back in 2017, she cannot fail and I know she will not fail. Mosby told the local paper in 2020, there would be no Marilyn Mosby without Kamala Harris. When I won states attorney, Kamala was my inspiration.

They had to negotiate a search warrant which meant Alec Baldwin, you have to give us your phone, you don't have a choice not matter. It should not have taken a month to get it. He should have done it right away, right after the shooting. The only victim here is Ms. Hutchins, that young cinematographer who lost her life. You know, his drawing, his drawing -- nothing is funny about him drawing a dead body and his wife posting it. She is a victim in this, this young woman and there is nothing comical. I think Alec Baldwin is a lunatic and disturbed."

But your legal background will clarify this, that you can turn over the phone and there are artificial intelligence machines that can specifically look for keywords if maybe he was concerned about text messages getting out of that were private that had nothing to do with the incident, is that true? EMILY COMPAGNO, CO-HOST, \"OUTNUMBERED\": That's true. There is software for that. Part of the reason is so important to comply and execute search warrants so fast within the usual ten-day period is because evidence can become ephemeral, Sean. So, here we have someone that has claimed publicly the reason he didn't want his phone to be made public is because there were love letters to his wife, he said things of a private nature, but that doesn't matter in a criminal investigation. The subject of a search warrant was his cell phone and that is why he should have turned it over. To Pam's point to go from a ten day time period to four weeks is unacceptable, now this created extra work for the sheriff's office because they will have to determine whether or not any type of evidence or any type of important communications was, in fact, deleted. That means they have to issue additional search warrants or subpoenas to ensure through other communications they are that they were getting the whole picture from it. And someone better let him know it doesn't matter if he is embarrassed because someone lost their life and that is what is most important."

But on that note, that could've been done very quickly, it wasn't. Let me ask you about Mosby and the connection to Kamala Harris. Why would somebody lie on the mortgage application? I'm trying to figure it out and do it twice and yet you are a prosecutor, you've got to know the law, I would assume that you can't lie on an application, correct?"

Her full salary during COVID when the people of her city were suffering -- so she gets money out of her retirement early to buy two homes in my beautiful state in Florida, two vacation homes.

She claims it is, quote, racial animus. She is facing 30 years in prison and a million dollars and I don't think it's because of racial animus. Kamala Harris said in 2017 when supporting her, she wanted to do so, so that she would get convictions and have convictions, I think it's now clear that she will be the one that will be convicted."
