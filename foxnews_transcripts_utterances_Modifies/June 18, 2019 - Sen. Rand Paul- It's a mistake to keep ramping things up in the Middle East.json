You're looking live at Joint Base Andrews, where the president and the first lady are set to depart moments from now for a big reelection rally in Orlando, Florida.  And in Orlando, where those people are gathering, many have been lining up for the better part of days. That's right, days.  Welcome, everybody. The race is on. And I'm Neil Cavuto.  In a moment, we're going to talk to Karl Rove about how the president is doing in key battleground states, including the state of Florida, and Kentucky Senator Republican Senator Rand Paul on what he thinks of the military's plan to send another 1,000 troops to the Middle East. All that in a moment. First, Fox team coverage with Kevin Corke on how the president is preparing for that big rally, and Kristin Fisher in Orlando on what supporters are hoping to hear at that rally.  We begin with Kevin. Hey, Kevin.",

Sally Persons and others are actually out on the South Lawn awaiting the departure. So, if the president speaks, I promise to pass that along to you, Neil. But this is also a chance for him not just to talk about 2020 and look ahead. It's a chance also to look back. He's going to talk a great deal about illegal immigration. You want to talk about a big crowd. Let me show you some of the pictures. Yes, we have seen rallies before, but can I just tell you, this is one of those circumstances? Remember when people were saying back in 2016, Neil, the crowds don't matter? Well, maybe, maybe not. But I can tell you this. It certainly would seem to portend a great deal of enthusiasm. Certainly, the president feels that way as he looks forward to this evening.   Now, there are a number of issues that he's going to tackle. He will talk about why he wants to run and why he thinks things are going great in our country. But, in particular, Neil, I want to drill down on a couple. He's certainly expected to talk about illegal immigration. And we certainly expect him to talk at length about Iran. What's happening overseas is crucial, not just from a business perspective, not just from a transport perspective, but we're talking about real national security issues that affect your bottom line and my bottom line, real pocketbook issues as it relates to the cost of gasoline. So he will talk about that, and security, and certainly illegal immigration. That's going to be a very big topic. We have watched what he had to say on Twitter. He's talked about this at length, Neil, this idea that it's not about looking just at what migrants from other countries want and need. It's also about looking at what Americans want and need -- that and much more coming up tonight, but, for now, back to you.  And if I hear from the president, I promise I will pass it along, buddy.",

So the first wave, the first few hundred of the president's supporters are now inside the Amway Center, after waiting outside in the heat and the humidity and in the rain. Some of them waited for as long as 40 hours to get in here tonight. This place, it only holds about 20,000 people. Sounds like a lot, but President Trump says that his campaign received about 100,000 requests for tickets to get in here tonight.  The president also tweeted a little bit earlier today, talking about all the crowds that he was seeing on TV and reading about. He said -- quote -- \"The fake news doesn't report it, but Republican enthusiasm is at an all- time high. Look what is going on in Orlando, Florida, right now. People have never seen anything like it, unless you play a guitar. It's going to be wild.\"   And these big crowds are indeed a strong show of support as the president kicks off his campaign in a critical swing state. He won this state, he won Florida by a very small percentage back in 2016. And heading into 2020, the latest poll just out from Quinnipiac University on the state of play here in Florida has him trailing behind many of his Democratic rivals. So he is likely going to hit some or all of those rivals very hard tonight. He's going to be talking about the good economy and immigration. So, Neil, it's pretty interesting. He really catapulted his campaign in 2016 at that kickoff rally by talking about immigration. And here we go, four years later, and, once again, the dominant issue that he's likely going to be talking about tonight is immigration -- Neil.",

But it does echo similar type of polls we have seen in a couple of battleground states, and leads that are shared by rivals of Joe Biden's, including Bernie Sanders.

One of the hidden stories about today's rally is how they're going to use the data of those 100,000 people who signed up to come to the rally to, in essence, help build their Florida army. Each one of those people, unlike four years ago, is going to be carefully catalogued, so they know their name, their address, their e-mail number, their cell phone number, and they're going to then follow up with them, so that they draw them actively into their organization. Tonight, there are going to be hundreds, if not thousands, of events around the country, watch parties, where some of the people who've attended previous rallies for the president have been drawn into watch parties in their communities in battleground states around the country, from New Hampshire, to Arizona, from Nevada to Florida.",

Two, talk about what he intends to do in the future. People don't vote for you simply because of what -- of your past performance. They want to know what you're going to keep doing in the future. And, third, he's going to have to have a target so that he can say, this person represents a visible threat to what you and I have -- have wanted to do and have done to encourage prosperity spread all across the country. So, three things that he's got to do. Right now, he's doing only one of those three, which is to talk about, isn't the economy good? He's got to be pivoting to number two and then be prepared to do number three, that is, say -- disqualify as opponent on the economy when that moment finally come.",

So many of the Democrats have been so vociferous in their opposition to what the president's done, whether it's a reforming the tax code, whether it's the regulatory relief, whether it's conservative judges. All of these things, they have been highly critical of. So the president does have the opportunity to begin to say, you know what? No matter who out of that crowd ends up being my opponent, they all are in the same place, which is, they want to go just do just the opposite of what I have done in order to create prosperity.  So, in a way, of those three things that he's got to do, he can start doing all three right now. And he probably would be better served by doing all three. He doesn't need to attach a name to the final point of, these people represent a threat to the policies that I have put in place.  But he can just sort of say, they all do. But he's got to do all three of those things, not simply harp on how good things are, but here are the next wave of things that I want to do to keep this prosperity growing and spreading to even more places in America.

It's a tough time for him, the president says. \"I didn't ask him to withdraw.\" There were allegations, of course, that came up in Mr. Shanahan's past that deal with family abuse and that sort of thing. It gets into the weeds here, a lot of people denying and then confirming, then denying again some allegations. Mr. Shanahan taking himself out of the process, given that this was a distraction. The president wishing him well, and saying that, overall, his departure will not complicate things. No indications right now out of -- putting the secretary of the Army in that acting position, whether that secretary the Army will be the permanent replacement to become the next secretary of defense.

It's important to have consequences when people break the law. And so the Justice Department put that docket together. They have heard thousands of cases; 90 percent of the people who are in that cohort didn't go to their asylum hearing or to their immigration hearing. They were noticed by ICE to come into the office to try to get right with the process. Many of them didn't. Thousands of them didn't. And now they're out there in the shadows. So the agency now has to close the loop. The president's trying to do everything he can to secure the border and bring integrity to the immigration system. So we have got to close the loop on these families. They have all been offered a chance at due process.

Neither do I think Iran's going to be overrun by Saudi Arabia. I think there's somewhat of a standoff between the two and a counterbalance. But I think just continuing to dump arms into this cauldron is fueling an arms race, and particularly nuclear technology. If Saudi Arabia should misuse nuclear technology, Iran will quickly follow, if they're not already headed in that way.

      "utterance": "Thank you, Shepard. And you can bet the president will be crowing about that. You're looking live at Joint Base Andrews, where the president and the first lady are set to depart moments from now for a big reelection rally in Orlando, Florida. And in Orlando, where those people are gathering, many have been lining up for the better part of days. That's right, days. Welcome, everybody. The race is on. And I'm Neil Cavuto. In a moment, we're going to talk to Karl Rove about how the president is doing in key battleground states, including the state of Florida, and Kentucky Senator Republican Senator Rand Paul on what he thinks of the military's plan to send another 1,000 troops to the Middle East. All that in a moment. First, Fox team coverage with Kevin Corke on how the president is preparing for that big rally, and Kristin Fisher in Orlando on what supporters are hoping to hear at that rally. We begin with Kevin. Hey, Kevin."

      "speaker": "KEVIN CORKE, WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Always good to be with you, my friend. And as you can well imagine, it's an interesting day here at the White House. In fact, we have some of our staffers. Sally Persons and others are actually out on the South Lawn awaiting the departure. So, if the president speaks, I promise to pass that along to you, Neil. But this is also a chance for him not just to talk about 2020 and look ahead. It's a chance also to look back. He's going to talk a great deal about illegal immigration. You want to talk about a big crowd. Let me show you some of the pictures. Yes, we have seen rallies before, but can I just tell you, this is one of those circumstances? Remember when people were saying back in 2016, Neil, the crowds don't matter? Well, maybe, maybe not. But I can tell you this. It certainly would seem to portend a great deal of enthusiasm. Certainly, the president feels that way as he looks forward to this evening. Now, there are a number of issues that he's going to tackle. He will talk about why he wants to run and why he thinks things are going great in our country. But, in particular, Neil, I want to drill down on a couple. He's certainly expected to talk about illegal immigration. And we certainly expect him to talk at length about Iran. What's happening overseas is crucial, not just from a business perspective, not just from a transport perspective, but we're talking about real national security issues that affect your bottom line and my bottom line, real pocketbook issues as it relates to the cost of gasoline. So he will talk about that, and security, and certainly illegal immigration. That's going to be a very big topic. We have watched what he had to say on Twitter. He's talked about this at length, Neil, this idea that it's not about looking just at what migrants from other countries want and need. It's also about looking at what Americans want and need -- that and much more coming up tonight, but, for now, back to you. And if I hear from the president, I promise I will pass it along, buddy."

      "utterance": "You always do, Kevin. And we are hearing, just as you surmise, the president is taking some questions from reporters on the South Lawn, before he heads into Joint Base Andrews. We will pass out along to you when we get this so-called pool spray after the fact. Meanwhile, to Kristin Fisher in Orlando, where those crowds are gathering. And, Kristin, they have been gathering for quite some time, right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KRISTIN FISHER, CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "They have been gathering since -- depending on whose reporting you believe -- somewhere between 2:30 and 5:00 a.m. on Monday. So the first wave, the first few hundred of the president's supporters are now inside the Amway Center, after waiting outside in the heat and the humidity and in the rain. Some of them waited for as long as 40 hours to get in here tonight. This place, it only holds about 20,000 people. Sounds like a lot, but President Trump says that his campaign received about 100,000 requests for tickets to get in here tonight. The president also tweeted a little bit earlier today, talking about all the crowds that he was seeing on TV and reading about. He said -- quote -- \"The fake news doesn't report it, but Republican enthusiasm is at an all- time high. Look what is going on in Orlando, Florida, right now. People have never seen anything like it, unless you play a guitar. It's going to be wild.\" And these big crowds are indeed a strong show of support as the president kicks off his campaign in a critical swing state. He won this state, he won Florida by a very small percentage back in 2016. And heading into 2020, the latest poll just out from Quinnipiac University on the state of play here in Florida has him trailing behind many of his Democratic rivals. So he is likely going to hit some or all of those rivals very hard tonight. He's going to be talking about the good economy and immigration. So, Neil, it's pretty interesting. He really catapulted his campaign in 2016 at that kickoff rally by talking about immigration. And here we go, four years later, and, once again, the dominant issue that he's likely going to be talking about tonight is immigration -- Neil."

Remember, it was in Florida too that he dispatched the two favored sons at the time -- you had Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio -- on his way to the Republican nomination. Now this poll, of course, that you heard Kristin refer to is a Quinnipiac poll that has the former Vice President Joe Biden leading the president by about nine points. Now, it's still way, way early. But it does echo similar type of polls we have seen in a couple of battleground states, and leads that are shared by rivals of Joe Biden's, including Bernie Sanders. What does Karl Rove think of all of this? Karl, how do you handicap it right now?"

But these polls did point to the fact that they got to do some work. And my sense is, they understand that. One of the hidden stories about today's rally is how they're going to use the data of those 100,000 people who signed up to come to the rally to, in essence, help build their Florida army. Each one of those people, unlike four years ago, is going to be carefully catalogued, so they know their name, their address, their e-mail number, their cell phone number, and they're going to then follow up with them, so that they draw them actively into their organization. Tonight, there are going to be hundreds, if not thousands, of events around the country, watch parties, where some of the people who've attended previous rallies for the president have been drawn into watch parties in their communities in battleground states around the country, from New Hampshire, to Arizona, from Nevada to Florida."

We go on what we have for the time being, these polls, and they're quick snapshots, as you and I have discussed, one snap, then shot. But they are interesting, in that whether do you want to give the president credit for this economic boom or not, it only seems fair, since we blame presidents when it's -- when it's going south, that he's not benefiting more, especially in some of these states, Florida among them, is dealing with at or near record unemployment, Pennsylvania the same, Wisconsin the same, Michigan close to the same, and no follow-through for him. What's going on?"

      "utterance": "And they don't give as much credit to the incumbent as they would give blame to the incumbent if the economy were going badly. And this requires the president to spend more time talking about this strength. And it requires him to do three things. One, talk about what he's done. Two, talk about what he intends to do in the future. People don't vote for you simply because of what -- of your past performance. They want to know what you're going to keep doing in the future. And, third, he's going to have to have a target so that he can say, this person represents a visible threat to what you and I have -- have wanted to do and have done to encourage prosperity spread all across the country. So, three things that he's got to do. Right now, he's doing only one of those three, which is to talk about, isn't the economy good? He's got to be pivoting to number two and then be prepared to do number three, that is, say -- disqualify as opponent on the economy when that moment finally come."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "You know, incumbents are prone, especially if they see a market surge or an economic surge, to say, all right, if the other guy gets in, he's already promised, in the case of Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, pretty much all the Democratic candidates, they're going to rescind all of those tax cuts, or most of them."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "They're going to put back regulations they think the president prematurely took out. So he is going to frame it, if you like what you have been seeing and take it for granted, well, you won't like what you're going to be seeing. And don't take it for granted. How does that play out?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROVE",
      "utterance": "Yes. Well, I think you put your finger on an important point. So many of the Democrats have been so vociferous in their opposition to what the president's done, whether it's a reforming the tax code, whether it's the regulatory relief, whether it's conservative judges. All of these things, they have been highly critical of. So the president does have the opportunity to begin to say, you know what? No matter who out of that crowd ends up being my opponent, they all are in the same place, which is, they want to go just do just the opposite of what I have done in order to create prosperity. So, in a way, of those three things that he's got to do, he can start doing all three right now. And he probably would be better served by doing all three. He doesn't need to attach a name to the final point of, these people represent a threat to the policies that I have put in place. But he can just sort of say, they all do. But he's got to do all three of those things, not simply harp on how good things are, but here are the next wave of things that I want to do to keep this prosperity growing and spreading to even more places in America. And all of those people represent a threat to my policies."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, Karl, thank you very, very much, Karl Rove on all of that. By the way, as Karl and I were speaking here, the president is still talking to reporters on the South Lawn, presumably en route to Marine One to get to Air Force One to get to Joint Base Andrews for that kickoff in Orlando of his reelection campaign. He was speaking at length about the acting defense secretary, Pat Shanahan, who is not going to go through the full confirmation for -- the become the next defense secretary. And the president is saying that he's a wonderful person, he's going to take some time off for family matters. It's going to take some time to deal with that. It's a tough time for him, the president says. \"I didn't ask him to withdraw.\" There were allegations, of course, that came up in Mr. Shanahan's past that deal with family abuse and that sort of thing. It gets into the weeds here, a lot of people denying and then confirming, then denying again some allegations. Mr. Shanahan taking himself out of the process, given that this was a distraction. The president wishing him well, and saying that, overall, his departure will not complicate things. No indications right now out of -- putting the secretary of the Army in that acting position, whether that secretary the Army will be the permanent replacement to become the next secretary of defense. We just don't know. Now to Wall Street right now, finished up about 353 points, a lot of this on hopes for a trade deal that now suddenly looks at least a little bit more likely than it did a little more than 24 hours ago.

Meantime, we did have a Bloomberg reports suggesting that the White House had lost patience with Fed Chair Jerome Powell, and even considered demoting him back in February. Larry Kudlow, though, saying that that is not the case today. Finally, a vote of confidence for Boeing, the owner of British Airways, IAG, signing a deal, inking a deal to buy 200 737 MAX jets.

At the end of those comments, also talking about his acting defense secretary planning to step down, not go through the confirmation process to be the next secretary of defense. Instead, the president has tapped the secretary of the Army, Mark Esper, to handle that job, recognizes Shanahan, with some personal family issues that came up, and a lot of back and forth on, that the better part of valor was to step down, not go through that confirmation process.

And I think we have been very clear that we need to revisit those, and hopefully get them to a good agreement. But I think you can read more into this than anything else that this administration is serious. Congress, members of my party, are here to support the president on using all the devices that he has to get China to recognize that their future is dependent upon a good economic relationship with the United States. But it has to be fair. It has to take care of our farmers in North Carolina, our workers in North Carolina and across the country. And the president's fighting for that.

      "speaker": "TILLIS",
      "utterance": "Well, there may be. But I think that the whole of government, a lot of our contractors see the writing on the wall. We cannot trust Huawei. It has basically got a direct line to the leadership of China. Their policies are that any business in China has to cooperate with their intelligence agencies. And they're -- they're really intertwined. It's unlike anything we see in the United States. So, we have to view that as a threat to our own whole of government infrastructure. And I think state and local governments need to do the same and to their suppliers. So I don't believe Huawei, in its current form, is going to be able to continue to cheat the way they have, steal technology. They may have a limited market opportunity in the United States, but, in the near term, I don't think it's going to be significant."

So I think he was expressing his frustration, responsible for making sure economic growth continues. And that's dependent on the Fed moving in a direction that he believes is prudent. I think, at the end of the day, though, I haven't -- I haven't heard a confirmation one way or the other. I do think it's within the president's authority to potentially have another chair. And Chair Powell could serve as a governor throughout his term.

When I was still with the agency in September, we asked the Department of Justice to put together a rocket docket for families. We were looking for ways to reduce the flow at the border. It's important to have consequences when people break the law. And so the Justice Department put that docket together. They have heard thousands of cases; 90 percent of the people who are in that cohort didn't go to their asylum hearing or to their immigration hearing. They were noticed by ICE to come into the office to try to get right with the process. Many of them didn't. Thousands of them didn't. And now they're out there in the shadows. So the agency now has to close the loop. The president's trying to do everything he can to secure the border and bring integrity to the immigration system. So we have got to close the loop on these families. They have all been offered a chance at due process. Many of them neglected to take it, and so now it's time for the enforcement and the integrity for the system to be in place."

One of the things I liked about President Trump is that he said the Iraq War was a mistake. I think an Iran war would be even a bigger mistake than the Iraq War. We lost over 4,000 soldiers over there. I don't think we need to get involved in another war. Iran is really not someone that we depend on for oil. The Middle East, in fact, we don't depend on for oil anymore. And so, no, I think it'd be a mistake to get involved in another shooting war."

He went on to say that unprovoked attacks on commercial shipping warrant a retaliatory military strike. The president has the authorization, he says, to act to defend American interests. What do you think of that?"

      "speaker": "PAUL",
      "utterance": "Well, it's -- that would be inconsistent with the Constitution. The Constitution is very clear that we don't go to war unless it's voted on by Congress. A declaration of war is required to be voted on by Congress. Now, if a ship is shooting at you, you can return fire, you can defend yourselves, but to go and retaliate and say, oh, we're going to blow up one of their naval ships, or we're going to drop a bomb on Tehran, or to say this somehow has to do with a 9/11 proclamation, no, those are completely wrongheaded and unconstitutional ideas. But I think what's interesting about this is that, of all the people involved with the administration, I think, really, the president actually has the best handle on this, and is less likely to act in an irrational way to immediately blow something up. I think he actually has pretty good sensibilities that most of the wars that we have fought in the Middle East really haven't been for our national interest."

If we're talking about giving them nuclear technology that they could actually use to break out and pursue nuclear weapons, huge mistake to give a government that actually chops up dissidents, beheads people, crucifies them. These aren't the kind of people that really should have nuclear weapons. But, beyond that, even conventional weapons -- I'm not for arming them. They have had an acceleration of the bombing of civilians in Yemen, a total disregard for civilian life and for the humanitarian disaster that they're causing. So, no, I think the Saudis don't deserve our weapons. I think that they -- if we are ever to have -- sell them weapons again, it should be conditioned on better behavior."

Number one, I think it should be someone who agrees with President Trump that the Iraq War was a mistake, that regime change has not worked and has many unintended consequences. But I also think it would be a good idea to rethink whether or not we want somebody who spent their career in procurements and where profit has been very much motivated by more weapons to everyone.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAUL",
      "utterance": "Yes. And I think what a lot of people don't get out of this, and don't examine this thoughtfully, is that Saudi Arabia and the Gulf allies around Saudi Arabia spend eight times more on the military than Iran does. Saudi Arabia is the third biggest purchaser of weapons in the world. So I don't think Saudi Arabia is all of a sudden going to be overrun by Iran if we don't sell more weapons to them. Neither do I think Iran's going to be overrun by Saudi Arabia. I think there's somewhat of a standoff between the two and a counterbalance. But I think just continuing to dump arms into this cauldron is fueling an arms race, and particularly nuclear technology. If Saudi Arabia should misuse nuclear technology, Iran will quickly follow, if they're not already headed in that way. So if you had three regional powers all within about a couple hundred miles of each other with nuclear weapons, I think that would be the worst disaster we could -- any of us could imagine."

The price of money -- interest rates is the most important signal throughout the whole economy, and when the government fixes the price, you get the same distortions you get if you fix the price of bread. If you fix the price of bread, you only distort the bread market -- well, mostly the bread market and maybe their suppliers. You fix the price of money, you distort all markets, and we put -- we don't get the feedback to know when we have overbuilt or overextended and are entering into a new phase in the -- in the business cycle. You can't really determine when the business cycle comes or goes without freely fluctuating interest rates.

So they have these large JumboTron screens outside, so they can catch a glimpse of the president of the United States, who we're told is likely going to pass along what a lot of them already know, the economy's booming, markets are doing more than OK. And if a lot of the know the president, he is going to point to those Democratic challenges who want to take a lot of the impetus for that away, like the tax cuts. To a man or woman, most of the Democratic candidates there are for getting rid of them. And that is something few people really know in detail.

So having said it so often, I think he really means it. And this is something that is going to have a negative impact on something like 90 percent of wage earners who actually benefited from the Trump tax cuts, despite the rhetoric that it's just the top 1 percent. This would end up hitting a family of four making about $78,000, cost them about $2,000 in higher taxes. Family of one parent, one child would be about $1,300 or something like that, and then far harder to measure is just the overall slowdown in the economy. If we lose the 21 percent corporate tax rate, that shoots up to 35 percent, that will make the U.S. less competitive, slow down the expansion of businesses, reduce the number of new jobs, not a good thing. So it's very rare for people -- it used to be rare for people run for office to saying, I'm going to raise taxes, but Joe Biden is being very open and bragging about it.

So what we're going to do is look out for you. What do you say?"

      "utterance": "Yes, that's what she says. But, no, it's something like 90 percent of wage earners, and I think something like 80 percent of wage earners have seen a higher take-home pay as a consequence of this. And, again, people are seeing this wonderful decrease in unemployment, 3.6 percent unemployment, record low unemployment for blacks, Hispanics, people who've only graduated high school. People who are leaving prison are now getting out of jail and actually finding job opportunities. So, I think we have something like 1.5 million more job openings than we have job seekers. So, I think it's -- there's the highest gap between job seekers and job openings we have ever seen in American history. This is the result of all of this tremendous boom in industry, new companies being started, older companies growing. And that will come to a -- if not a halt, certainly a slowdown, if we have Elizabeth Warren, President Warren, or President Biden, whoever it may be, come in and take away this tremendous feast of incentives for work-saving and investment."

And, of course, the big run-up that we had on the Dow today had a lot to do with that economy and a confidence that it will grow all the more if a China deal can be had. And that's the growing suspicion, that maybe one can be. At least, it was heavily teased. More after this."

Now, you might ask, why Florida? Of course, if you remember correctly, this is where he dispensed of two favorite sons, Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio, and then later on in the general election surprisingly picking up a victory there over Hillary Clinton, paving the way for what would be the election shocker and historic moments. FBN's Kristina Partsinevelos with that Orlando crowd, as we speak -- Kristina."

      "utterance": "Thank you, Neil. So, as you mentioned, there's been a lot of focus on Florida. This is a state where President Trump during his presidency has already visited 100 times. This is his 34th visit here tonight. He's expected to speak at 8:00 p.m. There's a lot riding on this swing state. We know that President Trump beat Hillary Clinton by only 1.2 percent back in 2016. And now they're expanding their electoral map to include states that they lost. They're focusing on New Hampshire, Nevada, New Mexico. And we know -- I know you focused in early on in the show about the polls, but the people here are starting to pile in. We're expecting at least 20,000 people if all the seats fill up. So I will throw it back to you."

      "utterance": "All right, Kristina, thank you very much, Kristina in the middle of all of that. Remember, in the last campaign, people would look at the crowds and the energy of the crowds, unless Hillary Clinton had a rock star with her or Katy Perry, nothing like the crowds that Donald Trump would generate alone. We should have seen in that maybe that was tipping something. That was then. What happens now? We're going to be exploring all of that tomorrow, get a billionaire's read on this economy as well tomorrow. Here comes \"The Five.\" Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC.
