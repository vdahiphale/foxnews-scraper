      "sentences": "Welcome to \"Hannity.\" You will not believe what we're about to tell you tonight. It'll take the full hour.  Twice demoted DOJ Bruce Ohr was grilled by Republican lawmakers for seven hours behind closed doors earlier today. The information he revealed is tonight blowing this case wide open in terms of a fraud that was committed multiple times against the FISA court, all to get Donald Trump and his campaign and undermine his presidency. Everyone who signed off on these FISA requests signed off on fraudulent documents and they knew what they were fraudulent.  Now you won't hear this information anywhere else. Of course, your media is obsessed with hating Trump but in minutes, we're going to tell you everything you need to know about Bruce Ohr's testimony today including damning new revelations surrounding the rampant abuse of power in our FISA court system. What we're about to reveal should rock the country to its core.  And also tonight, we have a breaking new report from John Solomon about a clear case of actual real, with proof, Russian collusion connecting the dots between Bruce Ohr, the DOJ and a Putin-linked Russian oligarch. It happened. Robert Mueller, where are you? Jeff Sessions, pay attention.  Now, we'll cover all the latest sad examples of actual fake news from CNN. One of their key sources, Cohen attorney Lanny Davis, was feeding them a bill of lies. He says it wasn't true. He's completely backtracked about his claims related to Trump Russia collusion, but CNN stands by their tainted reporting. Amazing. And coming up I have a message for fake news CNN and their media reporters. They watched this show because it's more interesting. Maybe they need to watch their own network.  And a strong new economic indicator more evidence that the economy is just blowing it through the roof. All of that, plus, we are tracking primary races in multiple states.   Now, just moments ago, it was announced that FOX News is projecting that Trump ally Ron DeSantis will win the Republican primary for Florida governor and FOX News is projecting the Governor Rick Scott, who's done a great job in Florida, he will win the GOP Senate primary and he will be going up against Bill Nelson. We'll bring you the results as we have them. All right. But, first, sit tight, buckle up, time for our jam-packed opening monologue edition.",

      "sentences": "All right. Tonight, we are blowing this case about Bruce Ohr, FISA abuse wide open. I've been on the phone with sources all day and all night, people who were in the room during Ohr's testimony. We did learn today that Bruce Ohr said that he understood the Steele dossier would never have been accepted in a court of law. He understood it. We have 65 pages of notes and text, and then meetings between him and Christopher Steele. He said the FBI knew about the seedy relationship with steel. So much to cover. Stay with us. We'll break it wide open.  But there's no doubt that a conspiracy to commit fraud against FISA court judges did in fact take place. Now, let's dive into the testimony from Bruce Ohr today. Now, remember, he is the twice demoted DOJ official who once helped ex-foreign spy paid for by Hillary, Christopher Steele, spread all these anti-Trump Russian lies throughout the highest levels of our government and today, during a closed-door hearing, Bruce Ohr was grilled on the Hill by members of the House Oversight and the Judiciary Committees for seven hours.   Now, the crucial issue at play here is rampant FISA abuse surrounding Christopher Steele's dirty dossier with Russian lies that Hillary Clinton illegally funneled through a law firm into Fusion GPS hiring then Christopher Steele. Now, our sources say that that topic was front and center at the hearing today. Get this -- Sara Carter is now reporting, she'll join us later, that we now know that the FBI was aware of Steele's blatant and extreme anti-Trump bias before they used as dossier is the bulk of their FISA court applications. Remember Bruce Ohr even wrote Steele was, quote, desperate that Donald Trump not get elected. He was passionate that Donald Trump not being president of the United States sounds just like Carter just like Page and Strzok. And Sara Carter also reporting that today's hearing proved that the FBI was using Bruce or as a back channel for Steele's anti-Trump intel even after the FBI cut all formal ties with Christopher Steele over trust issues, and he's saying that the FBI knew everything.  And despite this, Congressman John Ratcliffe who was a part of today's hearing is telling us that Ohr was not mentioned in any of the FBI FISA applications against the Trump campaign associate. Now, Congressman Radcliffe, Sara Carter, Gregg Jarrett and John Solomon will all be with us tonight. This is yet another sign of the FBI's blatant effort to hide the true nature of Clinton's bought and paid for Steele's dirty Russian dossier it was campaign op research. It was compromised. It was never verified or corroborated. It turned out to be lies, Russian lies, funded by the Clinton campaign and the DNC.  They funneled the money through a law firm, hiring Fusion GPS, that then hired Christopher Steele, an ex-foreign spy that had really seedy Russian connections we now know who was working with and for Fusion GPS, and by the way was also on the FBI payroll.  This is really the cherry on the top. He was working with Bruce Ohr's wife, Nellie Ohr. The Ohrs were literally profiting off their relationship with Christopher Steele. Ohr said today that he disclosed that to the FBI. Really? And the FBI was OK with that? Now, at the end, this is where we are. We now know for a fact that in four separate FISA court applications, FISA court judges will repeatedly lie to, knowingly lie to. The American people, you were all lied to, all in an effort by high-ranking government bureaucrats to steal, sway, rob an election and at all costs stop Donald Trump from winning and then to destroy his presidency.  Now, communications between Ohr and Christopher Steele, 60-some-odd pages of it. It shows that Steele was extremely concerned about being exposed for this and for good reason because this level of corruption and abuse should make every single American citizens sick, a blatant example of what I've been telling you a two-tiered justice system.   Hillary Clinton gets a free pass. Trump is literally targeted by our government with her salacious, phony, campaign op research put together by a foreign national using Russian sources for lies. We have a brand new article tonight from Gregg Jarrett. He'll be with us too. He details how the one-time FBI director James Comey took control of the Clinton investigation, took it right out of the hands of the field offices and twisted the facts, soften the language, exonerated Clinton, rigged her investigation from the very beginning. There really never was an investigation. Clinton was never going to be found guilty, because she was the favorite candidate. And meanwhile, the FBI, the Department of Justice, they work hand-in-hand with ex-foreign spy Christopher Steele to use his phony lies to open an investigation into allegedly Trump-Russia collusion. They gain these FISA warrants illegally against a Trump campaign associate. They potentially leaked that information, we know they leaked it, to the general public, to sway opinion with lies.  This is the stuff that happened in the former Soviet Union. All of this despite everybody knowing including Ohr admitting today that Steele's shady past that has worked for the Clinton campaign that is blatant bias against Trump, that is leaks to the press, that he was let go by the FBI that was also paying him, it's no wonder President Trump keeps talking about a witch hunt, and he's livid with his attorney general.  Mr. Sessions, where are you tonight? Why are you standing by and literally doing nothing to fix what is clearly a horrific inequality in our justice system? Now, today, Senator Lindsey Graham, he summed it up best. Let's take a look.",

And most recently, the FBI tried to squeeze the oligarch for information surrounding Trump Russia collusion including a theory that Paul Manafort was leading Trump campaigns collusion efforts. By the way, he'd been into a lawsuit with Paul Manafort and even he said that's ridiculous, it's absurd. And according to Solomon, the oligarch actually used the word preposterous.  Now, think about this -- this is the same Russian oligarch that the U.S. won't even allow into the country. He met with Bruce Ohr. He met with other top officials. You've got to be kidding me. How much more insane does this get? You cannot make this up.  We reached out to Ohr, the DOJ, the Russian oligarch involved. Of course, we didn't get a response. We're going to have a lot more on all of these issues all of the key players are joining us tonight.  But meanwhile, the biggest cheerleader of Trump Russia collusion has been caught red-handed yet again, reporting fake news to you the American people. In July, fake news CNN, they broke a huge bombshell story detailing shocking evidence about Trump's involvement in the now infamous 2016 Trump Tower meeting. We've got the tape to remind you.",

He's now completely backtracking on his claims to fake news CNN. He says that his client in fact does not have information of Trump's knowledge of the 2016 Trump Tower meeting.   He's saying that CNN's anonymous sources including himself, we were wrong. And after all, Michael Cohen testified under oath. This is all coming out that he had no knowledge of Trump's involvement in that meeting or anything else. And we also have a new wrinkle in the story. When CNN published their, quote, bombshell report, they wrote that Lanny Davis declined to comment in an article where he was the primary source. That's fake news at its worst. Now, tonight CNN is actually laughably standing by that horribly flawed story. Spokesperson even said to us they are confident in their phony reporting. It seems like a perfect story for some members -- media reporters at CNN but I guess they're probably too busy watching this show every night because they can't even watch their fake news network and their own terrible reporting that comes from them every day.   Now, the debacle surrounding Lanny Davis is just the latest in a long line of faulty reporting from fake news CNN. 2017, three CNN employees resigned after a fake story about our friend Anthony Scaramucci. A few months later, CNN was slammed and publicly embarrassed over a fake report about Donald Trump Jr.  And let's never forget, CNN's fake reporting over President Trump. Remember when he was with the Japanese prime minister and they were feeding the fish. Now, since the very moment, Donald Trump announced his run for office, CNN has been blinded by their hatred. And now, while the network ramps up this crazy rhetoric and faulty reporting to destroy the president, the country is actually improving by leaps and bounds.  Stock market breaking new records. We're seeing historic low levels of unemployment in 14 states, African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, women in the workforce, youth unemployment the 52-year low. And now, we have more great news that they'll never report. Consumer confidence today closing at an 18-year high, so much more good news to report on the economic front. We'll get to all of that.  Joining us now more information on Bruce Ohr's testimony. He is Texas Congressman John Ratcliffe. And from \"The Hill\", John Solomon.  We'll start with you, Congressman.

Based on the latest vote returns, FOX is projecting that Andrew Gillum has won the Democratic nomination. The key here is that he is backed by socialist Bernie Sanders. This is a complete upset. He beat former Congresswoman Gwen Graham. She's the daughter of the former Florida governor and Senator Bob Graham. She's much more moderate establishment. This is a sign the Democratic Party being pulled further and further left even in a swing state like here in Florida. It pits this Bernie Sanders backed candidate in Andrew Gillum against as you mentioned, Ron DeSantis, backed by President Trump. So, this could be an epic clash here in the Sunshine State in November in these midterms. Gubernatorial battle Sanders versus Trump essentially when you've got DeSantis who was given no chance of winning just a few months ago had a dramatic victory tonight against Adam Putnam, the state agriculture commissioner. The president tweeted just a few moments ago, quote, such a fantastic win for Ron DeSantis, and the people of the great state of Florida. Ron will be a fantastic governor on to November. Look at how pivotal the support was by the president. In mid-June, Mason- Dixon polling had Putnam beating DeSantis by 15 points. A week later, the president sends out a tweet, one tweet endorsing Ron DeSantis. All of a sudden, the numbers completely flipped. DeSantis in mid-July was up by 12 points, so that's a 27-point swing, Sean.  And all of a sudden, DeSantis tonight wins not, just wins, wins big on the Republican side for governor. You mentioned Rick Scott who is leaving office as governor, he has easily won the Republican primary to face Bill Nelson, the Democratic senator. He may be in a lot more trouble the Democrats first thought. Nelson in this battle against Governor Scott now running for Senate. And then again, in this gubernatorial race, I can't stress what a big upset this is that Andrew Gillum, the mayor of Tallahassee, would be a first African-American governor if he wins in Florida by the way, Sean, backed by Bernie Sanders that was his big endorsement. Sanders versus Trump in the Florida governor's race.",

One lawmaker said Ohr's answers about the timing and handling of the dossier do not line up with other witnesses, including former FBI lawyer Lisa Page who sent anti-Trump texts and Glen Simpson who testified on the Hill last December. His firm Fusion GPS was paid by the DNC and Clinton campaign for the anti-Trump research. With more than two decades of government experience, Ohr's portfolio at the Justice Department was gangs and drugs not Russia, but in 2016, documents show or became the back-channel between the FBI officials and Steele after the bureau fired him as a confidential source.

These are serious crimes to the court.

The special counsel has already interviewed the president's lawyer, Mr. McGahn, for 30 hours. Anything that he learned from him, that's the president's knowledge. The president therefore under the law is not readily available. He is under no obligation to testify.

Twice demoted DOJ Bruce Ohr was grilled by Republican lawmakers for seven hours behind closed doors earlier today. The information he revealed is tonight blowing this case wide open in terms of a fraud that was committed multiple times against the FISA court, all to get Donald Trump and his campaign and undermine his presidency. Everyone who signed off on these FISA requests signed off on fraudulent documents and they knew what they were fraudulent. Now you won't hear this information anywhere else. Of course, your media is obsessed with hating Trump but in minutes, we're going to tell you everything you need to know about Bruce Ohr's testimony today including damning new revelations surrounding the rampant abuse of power in our FISA court system. What we're about to reveal should rock the country to its core. And also tonight, we have a breaking new report from John Solomon about a clear case of actual real, with proof, Russian collusion connecting the dots between Bruce Ohr, the DOJ and a Putin-linked Russian oligarch. It happened. Robert Mueller, where are you? Jeff Sessions, pay attention. Now, we'll cover all the latest sad examples of actual fake news from CNN. One of their key sources, Cohen attorney Lanny Davis, was feeding them a bill of lies. He says it wasn't true. He's completely backtracked about his claims related to Trump Russia collusion, but CNN stands by their tainted reporting. Amazing. And coming up I have a message for fake news CNN and their media reporters. They watched this show because it's more interesting. Maybe they need to watch their own network. And a strong new economic indicator more evidence that the economy is just blowing it through the roof. All of that, plus, we are tracking primary races in multiple states. Now, just moments ago, it was announced that FOX News is projecting that Trump ally Ron DeSantis will win the Republican primary for Florida governor and FOX News is projecting the Governor Rick Scott, who's done a great job in Florida, he will win the GOP Senate primary and he will be going up against Bill Nelson. We'll bring you the results as we have them. All right. But, first, sit tight, buckle up, time for our jam-packed opening monologue edition."

I've been on the phone with sources all day and all night, people who were in the room during Ohr's testimony. We did learn today that Bruce Ohr said that he understood the Steele dossier would never have been accepted in a court of law. He understood it. We have 65 pages of notes and text, and then meetings between him and Christopher Steele. He said the FBI knew about the seedy relationship with steel. So much to cover. Stay with us. We'll break it wide open. But there's no doubt that a conspiracy to commit fraud against FISA court judges did in fact take place. Now, let's dive into the testimony from Bruce Ohr today. Now, remember, he is the twice demoted DOJ official who once helped ex-foreign spy paid for by Hillary, Christopher Steele, spread all these anti-Trump Russian lies throughout the highest levels of our government and today, during a closed-door hearing, Bruce Ohr was grilled on the Hill by members of the House Oversight and the Judiciary Committees for seven hours. Now, the crucial issue at play here is rampant FISA abuse surrounding Christopher Steele's dirty dossier with Russian lies that Hillary Clinton illegally funneled through a law firm into Fusion GPS hiring then Christopher Steele. Now, our sources say that that topic was front and center at the hearing today. Get this -- Sara Carter is now reporting, she'll join us later, that we now know that the FBI was aware of Steele's blatant and extreme anti-Trump bias before they used as dossier is the bulk of their FISA court applications. Remember Bruce Ohr even wrote Steele was, quote, desperate that Donald Trump not get elected. He was passionate that Donald Trump not being president of the United States sounds just like Carter just like Page and Strzok. And Sara Carter also reporting that today's hearing proved that the FBI was using Bruce or as a back channel for Steele's anti-Trump intel even after the FBI cut all formal ties with Christopher Steele over trust issues, and he's saying that the FBI knew everything. And despite this, Congressman John Ratcliffe who was a part of today's hearing is telling us that Ohr was not mentioned in any of the FBI FISA applications against the Trump campaign associate. Now, Congressman Radcliffe, Sara Carter, Gregg Jarrett and John Solomon will all be with us tonight. This is yet another sign of the FBI's blatant effort to hide the true nature of Clinton's bought and paid for Steele's dirty Russian dossier it was campaign op research. It was compromised. It was never verified or corroborated. It turned out to be lies, Russian lies, funded by the Clinton campaign and the DNC. They funneled the money through a law firm, hiring Fusion GPS, that then hired Christopher Steele, an ex-foreign spy that had really seedy Russian connections we now know who was working with and for Fusion GPS, and by the way was also on the FBI payroll. This is really the cherry on the top. He was working with Bruce Ohr's wife, Nellie Ohr. The Ohrs were literally profiting off their relationship with Christopher Steele. Ohr said today that he disclosed that to the FBI. Really? And the FBI was OK with that? Now, at the end, this is where we are. We now know for a fact that in four separate FISA court applications, FISA court judges will repeatedly lie to, knowingly lie to. The American people, you were all lied to, all in an effort by high-ranking government bureaucrats to steal, sway, rob an election and at all costs stop Donald Trump from winning and then to destroy his presidency. Now, communications between Ohr and Christopher Steele, 60-some-odd pages of it. It shows that Steele was extremely concerned about being exposed for this and for good reason because this level of corruption and abuse should make every single American citizens sick, a blatant example of what I've been telling you a two-tiered justice system. Hillary Clinton gets a free pass. Trump is literally targeted by our government with her salacious, phony, campaign op research put together by a foreign national using Russian sources for lies. We have a brand new article tonight from Gregg Jarrett. He'll be with us too. He details how the one-time FBI director James Comey took control of the Clinton investigation, took it right out of the hands of the field offices and twisted the facts, soften the language, exonerated Clinton, rigged her investigation from the very beginning. There really never was an investigation. Clinton was never going to be found guilty, because she was the favorite candidate. And meanwhile, the FBI, the Department of Justice, they work hand-in-hand with ex-foreign spy Christopher Steele to use his phony lies to open an investigation into allegedly Trump-Russia collusion. They gain these FISA warrants illegally against a Trump campaign associate. They potentially leaked that information, we know they leaked it, to the general public, to sway opinion with lies. This is the stuff that happened in the former Soviet Union. All of this despite everybody knowing including Ohr admitting today that Steele's shady past that has worked for the Clinton campaign that is blatant bias against Trump, that is leaks to the press, that he was let go by the FBI that was also paying him, it's no wonder President Trump keeps talking about a witch hunt, and he's livid with his attorney general. Mr. Sessions, where are you tonight? Why are you standing by and literally doing nothing to fix what is clearly a horrific inequality in our justice system? Now, today, Senator Lindsey Graham, he summed it up best. Let's take a look."

And most recently, the FBI tried to squeeze the oligarch for information surrounding Trump Russia collusion including a theory that Paul Manafort was leading Trump campaigns collusion efforts. By the way, he'd been into a lawsuit with Paul Manafort and even he said that's ridiculous, it's absurd. And according to Solomon, the oligarch actually used the word preposterous. Now, think about this -- this is the same Russian oligarch that the U.S. won't even allow into the country. He met with Bruce Ohr. He met with other top officials. You've got to be kidding me. How much more insane does this get? You cannot make this up. We reached out to Ohr, the DOJ, the Russian oligarch involved. Of course, we didn't get a response. We're going to have a lot more on all of these issues all of the key players are joining us tonight. But meanwhile, the biggest cheerleader of Trump Russia collusion has been caught red-handed yet again, reporting fake news to you the American people.

      "utterance": "More humpty-dumpty CNN fake news. And according to \"BuzzFeed\", one of the unnamed sources in the report was called attorney Lanny Davis. He's now completely backtracking on his claims to fake news CNN. He says that his client in fact does not have information of Trump's knowledge of the 2016 Trump Tower meeting. He's saying that CNN's anonymous sources including himself, we were wrong. And after all, Michael Cohen testified under oath. This is all coming out that he had no knowledge of Trump's involvement in that meeting or anything else. And we also have a new wrinkle in the story. When CNN published their, quote, bombshell report, they wrote that Lanny Davis declined to comment in an article where he was the primary source. That's fake news at its worst. Now, tonight CNN is actually laughably standing by that horribly flawed story. Spokesperson even said to us they are confident in their phony reporting. It seems like a perfect story for some members -- media reporters at CNN but I guess they're probably too busy watching this show every night because they can't even watch their fake news network and their own terrible reporting that comes from them every day. Now, the debacle surrounding Lanny Davis is just the latest in a long line of faulty reporting from fake news CNN. 2017, three CNN employees resigned after a fake story about our friend Anthony Scaramucci. A few months later, CNN was slammed and publicly embarrassed over a fake report about Donald Trump Jr. And let's never forget, CNN's fake reporting over President Trump. Remember when he was with the Japanese prime minister and they were feeding the fish. Now, since the very moment, Donald Trump announced his run for office, CNN has been blinded by their hatred. And now, while the network ramps up this crazy rhetoric and faulty reporting to destroy the president, the country is actually improving by leaps and bounds. Stock market breaking new records. We're seeing historic low levels of unemployment in 14 states, African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, women in the workforce, youth unemployment the 52-year low. And now, we have more great news that they'll never report. Consumer confidence today closing at an 18-year high, so much more good news to report on the economic front. We'll get to all of that. Joining us now more information on Bruce Ohr's testimony. He is Texas Congressman John Ratcliffe. And from \"The Hill\", John Solomon. We'll start with you, Congressman.

If Mueller wanted to get to the bottom of this, the questions that Congress has raised that are now in the public, whether the FISA warrant was legitimate and the origins of this investigation were legitimate, you would at the very least, he'd want to talk to Bruce or and find out why was he playing the intermediary role.

I've heard you say some of these names on your program before and I can tell you as someone that has reviewed the FISA applications, the unredacted versions -- I can't talk about what's in there but I can tell you what's not in there and what's not in there is any information about Nellie and Bruce Ohr."

He tried to give him some guidance. In 2016, a more consequential event occurred. The FBI showed up in September 2016, one month before the FISA application, and they said, listen, we think Paul Manafort is colluding with Russia to help Trump win the election. We now know where they got that information. They got it from Christopher Steele. That's in his dossier. And Deripaska tells him, a trusted guy who's been with him helping him for 10 years, I'm telling you, it's preposterous, it's not happening. You got it wrong."

They got a help in trying to locate a former agent. They got information waving them off bad intelligence. But here's the real problem with collusion that goes into the FISA warrant -- when Deripaska tells them, hey, you're wrong about Manafort. I can tell you, you're wrong about Manafort, they had an obligation a month later to go to the court and say, well, listen, Steele's telling us this, but this Russian guy we've had a lot of good record with, he's telling us something different. There's no evidence that occurred. Another thing that Steele --"

FOX News has another race to call and tonight on this busy night oh big night in Florida for the president. He's two for two down there. Ron DeSantis, Governor Rick Scott both won their primaries. DeSantis running for governor. Rick Scott is running for an important Senate seat down in Florida against Bill Nelson who does nothing. Ed Henry, what do you got?"

    {
      "speaker": "ED HENRY, FOX NEWS CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Well, Sean, this is a huge upset. Fox projecting right now an upset win in Florida's gubernatorial primary. Based on the latest vote returns, FOX is projecting that Andrew Gillum has won the Democratic nomination. The key here is that he is backed by socialist Bernie Sanders. This is a complete upset. He beat former Congresswoman Gwen Graham. She's the daughter of the former Florida governor and Senator Bob Graham. She's much more moderate establishment. This is a sign the Democratic Party being pulled further and further left even in a swing state like here in Florida. It pits this Bernie Sanders backed candidate in Andrew Gillum against as you mentioned, Ron DeSantis, backed by President Trump. So, this could be an epic clash here in the Sunshine State in November in these midterms. Gubernatorial battle Sanders versus Trump essentially when you've got DeSantis who was given no chance of winning just a few months ago had a dramatic victory tonight against Adam Putnam, the state agriculture commissioner. The president tweeted just a few moments ago, quote, such a fantastic win for Ron DeSantis, and the people of the great state of Florida. Ron will be a fantastic governor on to November. Look at how pivotal the support was by the president. In mid-June, Mason- Dixon polling had Putnam beating DeSantis by 15 points. A week later, the president sends out a tweet, one tweet endorsing Ron DeSantis. All of a sudden, the numbers completely flipped. DeSantis in mid-July was up by 12 points, so that's a 27-point swing, Sean. And all of a sudden, DeSantis tonight wins not, just wins, wins big on the Republican side for governor. You mentioned Rick Scott who is leaving office as governor, he has easily won the Republican primary to face Bill Nelson, the Democratic senator. He may be in a lot more trouble the Democrats first thought. Nelson in this battle against Governor Scott now running for Senate. And then again, in this gubernatorial race, I can't stress what a big upset this is that Andrew Gillum, the mayor of Tallahassee, would be a first African-American governor if he wins in Florida by the way, Sean, backed by Bernie Sanders that was his big endorsement. Sanders versus Trump in the Florida governor's race."

The closed-door deposition lasted seven hours with the consensus among Republican lawmakers the Justice Department official Bruce Ohr told the FBI there were issues with the Trump dossier and its author former British spy Christopher Steele, but the evidence suggests the national security court or FISA court was kept in the dark when it granted a surveillance warrant for a Trump campaign aide just two weeks before the 2016 election. One lawmaker said Ohr's answers about the timing and handling of the dossier do not line up with other witnesses, including former FBI lawyer Lisa Page who sent anti-Trump texts and Glen Simpson who testified on the Hill last December. His firm Fusion GPS was paid by the DNC and Clinton campaign for the anti-Trump research. With more than two decades of government experience, Ohr's portfolio at the Justice Department was gangs and drugs not Russia, but in 2016, documents show or became the back-channel between the FBI officials and Steele after the bureau fired him as a confidential source. Earlier today, Ohr ignored my questions."

Sara, let's stay on this, then we'll get the background from Greg. We'll do it backwards, and that is, oh, he never testified, never was called to testify before Robert Mueller -- Robert Mueller who cares more about loan applications and taxicab medallions, and we've got real evidence that FISA courts were lied to. It is irrefutable and incontrovertible. We've known for a long time, this blows it out of the water. The courts were lied --"

One of the things that Bruce Ohr did discuss, some of the questions there that Catherine (ph) was throwing out was that he had not informed his superiors at the DOJ that he was providing this back door channel for Christopher Steele. Another really interesting point, I thought..."

He discussed this with Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, which was really fascinating because Lisa Page played down her communications with Bruce Ohr. She was actually according to Ohr part of his circle, part of the people that he was discussing this with at the FBI. I think that's highly significant. And the fact, Sean, that they withheld all of that -- that is evidence withheld, all of that evidence from the secret courts. The top court in the land is absolutely inexcusable to the sources I have been talking to. And it's very, very damaging."

But I want to get to this because you have Bruce Ohr saying today that he understood this could never be used in a court of law. OK. But it was used as the bulk of information for the FISA court applications. Now, if he understood that, and his I guess his wife understood that, why was he still trying to read 65 pages of notes, texts, emails, messages, hope the firewalls hold, I hope we don't get exposed. It is now beginning to come together that this was a broad conspiracy to defraud the FISA court and to really take down Donald Trump? This is not a game anymore."

But today we learned that Bruce Ohr told Comey and his confederates that this is a guy, Christopher Steele, who had said he was desperate to stop Donald Trump. He was vagrantly (ph) anti- Trump. They should have stopped right there in their tracks and said goodbye to Steele, thrown his dossier in the garbage. But they didn't care. They moved ahead to launch this investigation of Trump to damage him and to spy on a Trump associate. These people should be prosecuted for obstruction of justice, for perjury, abuse of power, and about three other felonies I can think of. The law enforcers became the law breakers. And where is the FISA court? Why aren't these judges holding these in criminal contempt? Why didn't they prosecute these people with indictments."

So not only did they know the dossier was invalid, but they continued to use the dossier to pump out disinformation on president-elect Trump and President Trump. This is serious. These are serious crimes to the court. And what they have done is presented a disinformation campaign against an administration where the only people that appear to have been collaborating with the Russians were the people that were involved in this, Fusion GPS, the Hillary Clinton campaign, you know, and all of the other people that were involved in collecting information."

Here is now with reaction, former Clinton pollster Mark Penn and former U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, Joe DiGenova. Full discloser, yes, he's done some legal work for me. He's very expensive, but really he's worth it, him and Victoria (inaudible) lawyers in the country. And he did come to my Christmas party. Mark Penn will be invited next year. But you know, I'm watching all of the developments today. And I think probably Dershowitz is right. I think Mueller wants to do it. He is following taxicab medallions and loan applications. We've got FISA courts literally lied to with Russian propaganda, the American people, Russian lies perpetrated in this last election cycle. He has no interest in any of this. Can you believe we learned today that Bruce Ohr was never called before Mueller? Mueller is not serious about any really Russian collusion. Joe DiGenova."

Sean, if Mr. Mueller wants to subpoena the president, he can certainly try. But he is going to lose. And the reason is very simple. The special counsel has already interviewed the president's lawyer, Mr. McGahn, for 30 hours. Anything that he learned from him, that's the president's knowledge. The president therefore under the law is not readily available. He is under no obligation to testify. And if Mr. Mueller pursues the subpoena, he is going to lose in the Supreme Court because he already has all of the information he needs. And then, there is one more very important thing. He is using the grand jury for impeachment. That's an unconstitutional use of the grand jury. And that's another reason he will lose. You can't use grand jury subpoenas to get testimony..."

And any notion it was designed to get illegality concerning that the entire campaign is a falsehood. Not only is Mueller not investigating it, but it is clear now that the Department of Justice under Rosenstein and Sessions is not investigating the unmasking or the leaks from the grand jury, or anything else, or the leaks of classified information involving the president. Jeff Sessions and Rosenstein have now abandoned all semblance of respectability. This is truly disgraceful."

And it's the fifth in my playbook. It's a bombshell that CNN reported. All of which were anti-Trump and none of which came true. And if CNN had eggs on its face, four out of five they had to retract.

I've had arguments about facts like 2 plus 2 equals 4, where a liberal media person will say no, it's 4.5. I promise you. Listen, here is the problem with this. And Ari is right. It's just incredible that just by sheer odds alone, you think a Trump scoop that CNN got at least once would be a pro-Trump scoop. The problem is, as Ari correctly said here, all of CNN's scoops that get debunked later, their big stories are always anti-Trump stories, which means one of two things. Either CNN is full of suckers or they are lying. I don't know which one is. And for them not to retract this story, Sean, is absolutely absurd. Ari is right. The source for the story is the lawyer of the guy, Michael Cohen."

It's another for journalists to allow blind people to get on the air to speak, and not deal with it when they make a mistake. Now, I will put myself in CNN's shoes. The only thing I could think off that would allow them to standby that story when they know that Lanny got it wrong is that Michael Cohen told it to them. But then, if Michael Cohen told it to them then he committed perjury when he testified before Congress. So that's the only thing you can hang your hat on if you are CNN. And if that's the case, they need to come out and say it. Otherwise, this is journalistically embarrassing for CNN, as the only network standing by when everybody else has pulled it back. And especially, Sean, like I said before, do you know what they did to Donald Trump, Jr., when they said he had advanced knowledge of WikiLeaks? They got burned on that story. They won't cite their sources who burned them, yet they reported that as a bombshell. These bombshells that are duds are killing journalism."
