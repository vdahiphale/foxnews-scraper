      "sentences": "Good evening and welcome to “Tucker Carlson Tonight.” It's the end of impeachment week one. The public hearings began this week in Washington. The Democrats kicked off the spectacle on Wednesday, you'll remember by trotting out a procession of State Department functionaries each explaining how deeply upsetting it has been to watch an elected President control America's foreign policy. They hate that.  Interestingly though, none of them said they'd seen the President commit any sort of actual wrongdoing. It was much the same story today.  The star witness was the former Ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch who was dismissed from her job earlier this year by the President. Now keep in mind that Yovanovitch was testifying at an impeachment hearing. So the only question on the table was and remains has Donald Trump committed crimes that would justify his removal as President of the United States? And fairly early on, Yovanovitch stated unequivocally that as far as she knows, he has not.",

So attacking for example, Kellyanne Conway, that's not sexism, which is why they were able to do it yesterday on CNN, but criticizing Ambassador Yovanovitch for her work product, that is sexism.

A more proper term is gossip in chief. So the gossip monger in chief and the Deputy Assistant gossip monger, they consult with those two staffers that have been with the N.S.C. and you might say there was actually a sale from Intel state, but when the President made that call on July 25th, the news was closing in on these people because he was going to get evidence of the corruption that involved Ukraine as well as the United States and their effort to affect our election.

According to the Sheriff's Office in Kings County -- King County, Washington, that's where Seattle is, a group of about 10 immigrants carried out an elaborate fake burglary against themselves and why did they do that? But one of the many visas that we offer to foreigners is called a non- immigrant visa. It allows a foreigner who was a victim of a crime in the United States to stay in this country for the sake of assisting authorities in solving the crime. Now, since this crime was fake, of course, the hope was that the case would never be closed and they could stay in this country long term, maybe even forever. Jason Rantz has been following the story. He's a Seattle area radio show host and he joins us tonight. So Jason, did I describe that correctly?

We don't normally see these kinds of robberies where in this case it was alleged that two men in masks, one with a handgun went into Bob's Burgers and Teriyaki. It's this restaurant. They held people up, they tied people up. They sexually assaulted two of the female victims before getting away. And the story was that some customer wandered in and noticed that this had happened and called 911, and then obviously King County Sheriff's Deputies took this incredibly seriously. They had a specific description of the two individuals. They had a car and a license plate, and it turns out it was completely a hoax. And they found out pretty quickly that it was a hoax. And during the investigation they discovered, yes, this was so they thought they would qualify to have a U-Visa which says under certain circumstances under certain crimes, you're protected from being deported because you would have to participate in the actual you know, justice system to go after these bad guys. Now in theory, when you think you're not actually going to be deported because there's not actually a crime, but they think there's a crime, it means indefinitely they'd be able to stay here. Now, the ironic part about this story is now that they figured it out, right? They haven't yet pressed charges, and the expectation is there are going to be some charges. Well, in Washington State, and in King County, and in Seattle, we are sanctuary. We have sanctuary policies, which means even after they are convicted, and let's say they do some jail time, they're unlikely to actually be deported anyway, because we will not participate with I.C.E. and we won't turn them over.",

The Democrats kicked off the spectacle on Wednesday, you'll remember by trotting out a procession of State Department functionaries each explaining how deeply upsetting it has been to watch an elected President control America's foreign policy. They hate that. Interestingly though, none of them said they'd seen the President commit any sort of actual wrongdoing. It was much the same story today. The star witness was the former Ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch who was dismissed from her job earlier this year by the President. Now keep in mind that Yovanovitch was testifying at an impeachment hearing. So the only question on the table was and remains has Donald Trump committed crimes that would justify his removal as President of the United States? And fairly early on, Yovanovitch stated unequivocally that as far as she knows, he has not."

And yet Marie Yovanovitch kept going and going and going. By the end, the hearing sounded like a therapy session or an extended meeting with the HR Department. The definition of hell.

If you spend enough time in Walmart or Denny's, you'll actually hear people say that out loud. Americans are sick of this democracy thing. And yet at the same time, as CNN points out, Americans also despise sexism, which if you want a precise definition means any criticism of a woman who is currently serving the interests of the Democratic Party. So attacking for example, Kellyanne Conway, that's not sexism, which is why they were able to do it yesterday on CNN, but criticizing Ambassador Yovanovitch for her work product, that is sexism. Got it? Okay, onto lesson number two that we learned today. What Donald Trump has done in Ukraine is bribery. How exactly is it bribery? Don't ask dumb questions. It just is bribery.

Democrats decided on the punishment three years ago, impeachment, and they've been looking for the crime ever since. Congressman Louis Gohmert represents the proud State of Texas in the House of Representatives, which is currently impeaching the President. He joins us tonight. So what did you think? So here you had the press telling us that Ambassador Yovanovitch who was undone by relatively mild criticism from the President, I mean, she was shocked, appalled and immobilized in the fact, but she also has a spine of steel at the same time.

It could have had no effect on her whatsoever. But I mean, for heaven's sake, and to hear all these liberal, alt-left media, some call them mainstream, but they're alt-left.

A more proper term is gossip in chief. So the gossip monger in chief and the Deputy Assistant gossip monger, they consult with those two staffers that have been with the N.S.C. and you might say there was actually a sale from Intel state, but when the President made that call on July 25th, the news was closing in on these people because he was going to get evidence of the corruption that involved Ukraine as well as the United States and their effort to affect our election. And that's when the gossip monger and chief goes to Adam Schiff's staff and he didn't come up originally with the idea of a whistleblower, the staff did, and it also helps provide him some protection for a little while. The courts will eventually throw it out, but the news was closing in and the thing that the State Department people were really ticked off about this President quit talking about helping Ukraine and actually sent them lethal weapons that could use to defend themselves.

No. The reason Crimea was invaded was because Obama and Clinton had her go over there with a red plastic button with the wrong Russian word on it, but they wanted to reset.

But one of the many visas that we offer to foreigners is called a non- immigrant visa. It allows a foreigner who was a victim of a crime in the United States to stay in this country for the sake of assisting authorities in solving the crime. Now, since this crime was fake, of course, the hope was that the case would never be closed and they could stay in this country long term, maybe even forever.

They held people up, they tied people up. They sexually assaulted two of the female victims before getting away. And the story was that some customer wandered in and noticed that this had happened and called 911, and then obviously King County Sheriff's Deputies took this incredibly seriously. They had a specific description of the two individuals. They had a car and a license plate, and it turns out it was completely a hoax. And they found out pretty quickly that it was a hoax.

Now in theory, when you think you're not actually going to be deported because there's not actually a crime, but they think there's a crime, it means indefinitely they'd be able to stay here. Now, the ironic part about this story is now that they figured it out, right? They haven't yet pressed charges, and the expectation is there are going to be some charges. Well, in Washington State, and in King County, and in Seattle, we are sanctuary. We have sanctuary policies, which means even after they are convicted, and let's say they do some jail time, they're unlikely to actually be deported anyway, because we will not participate with I.C.E. and we won't turn them over."
