They damned Comey and out of bipartisan benevolence, Trump grants them their wish. Which is why their stuttering outrage over his firing makes them look two-faced. Which now requires twice as much Botox. But what about the firing itself? Let's separate the action from its execution. The act, defensible. The execution, flawed. He could have let him go in August when half the media are drunk picking sand from their naval. No one would have noticed. He could have done it professionally instead of shooting him in the public square. But expecting Donald Trump stick to formalities, that's like expecting a dog to meow, or a cat to bark or Chris Matthews to make sense.  Let's face it: There's no downtime in this administration. Imagine if the movie \"Jaws\" only had just shark attacks? No character development. Just characters being eaten. That's this White House. There's no off switch. He's our \"Spinal Tap\" president where everything is always set to 11. And maybe one day, but maybe one day he might realize you can't be on DEFCON 5 all the time. Of course, that will be when he invents DEFCON 6. So, I've talked about Dana this idea, you don't have to be in a prison of two ideas. It doesn't have to be treasonous or absolutely wonderful.

I don't really hear anybody saying that Jim Comey was doing, you know, a bang up, stand up job where this was somebody that we're saying, this is the shining example of the FBI and the director at its best. No, both sides were objecting to the way that he handled himself and I certainly as I said as a formal prosecutor object him, overstepping his grounds.  And making -- it's not his decision as to whether or not an indictment could be brought. He is simply is to present just the facts, ma'am.

Sarah Huckabee Sanders, there was a little bit of a contradiction. She said at one point that the President was thinking of getting rid of Comey right after the election. He didn't have the power to do that at that point. Then he also said that he was thinking about it about the time of the inauguration. But I think you can safely go back probably into last summer.

Some of the comp staff were at, they were, you know, called back urgently to their offices. And they were told this is happening.

Once his people started getting on the air, they had Sean Spicer was on with our Lou Dobbs last night. Sarah Huckabee was on with Tucker. Kellyanne Conway went on one of the rival cable networks.

To bring him the evidence and the recommendation. The President followed that recommendation. The problem that people are having here is when they don't like when the Democrats, when it does something that they actually wanted and then they feel like they should be against him regardless. So, it's an issue of optics and it's an issue of process. Was the right process followed in terms of how to handle this? Perhaps the guy call, okay, maybe I object to that. I don't really hear anybody saying that Jim Comey was doing, you know, a bang up, stand up job where this was somebody that we're saying, this is the shining example of the FBI and the director at its best. No, both sides were objecting to the way that he handled himself and I certainly as I said as a formal prosecutor object him, overstepping his grounds. And making -- it's not his decision as to whether or not an indictment could be brought. He is simply is to present just the facts, ma'am. And then what he did instead was, being the judge jury executioner usurped the power of the then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch and tried to make the decision for her and tell us all how it's going to be.

And we now know that it goes back at least as far as the inauguration, potentially back as far as the actual election night. And I would assume long before that as well. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, there was a little bit of a contradiction. She said at one point that the President was thinking of getting rid of Comey right after the election. He didn't have the power to do that at that point. Then he also said that he was thinking about it about the time of the inauguration. But I think you can safely go back probably into last summer. When President Trump first started getting real doubts about James Comey, when he came out and he said that Hillary Clinton should not prosecution for the email. So, we learned a lot today and what we're learning, we thought that this was a bottom-up operation coming up through the ranks of the Department of Justice and the President.

Clearly this was a very closely held operation. I was talking to some White House officials just a few minutes ago, and they pointed out that among all of the things that have been swirling around the White House and the things that have leaked out, this is the one thing that didn't leak out. And a lot of the communications team was actually not even in their offices at the time that the decision went down and the news dropped. There was an ice cream social for a group of veterans. Some of the comp staff were at, they were, you know, called back urgently to their offices. And they were told this is happening. And I guess the President probably assumed that they could develop an instantaneous communications strategy, you know, they probably could have -- if they had an extra 20 minutes to think about it. But I am told that the President was a little unhappy. May be very unhappy with the initial response. Once his people started getting on the air, they had Sean Spicer was on with our Lou Dobbs last night. Sarah Huckabee was on with Tucker. Kellyanne Conway went on one of the rival cable networks. So, once the President saw that his people were out there, then they got some surrogates out. Early this morning on this, he became quite happy with the communications response. But I think he was asking them to almost to do the impossible."

Because I don't remember a lot of times when the Democrats never circled the wagons around anything President Obama did. Is there anything underway to make sure everybody gets on the same page? Because if people aren't on the same page, this gets picked apart by the left and in the media. And it makes just the legislative agenda that much harder."

And I know that they have been talking with members of Congress as well. I think the President was initially a little surprised at the amount of blowback that he got, particularly if you go back over history and you looked at the statements that were made by Democrats like Chuck Schumer about James Comey. He thought that people would have been, if not happy that he was fired, at least accepting of the fact that he was fired. But it was the timing of everything. You know, right in the middle of this investigation into Russia, it has the percept -- you can easily see that people would get the perception that the President was trying to play fast and loose here with the investigation. And I think, you know, even if that is not the case, I think that the Democrats have gone down for that and they're going to use it as a -- which debate the President."

And just confirming that yes, apparently the President was very open about his thoughts regarding Comey in the days that were leading up to the firing. So, that would confirm that he was probably among a very small circle of people talking quite openly about his desire to get rid of Comey, whether or not he should do a bouncing it off his closest state. I am sorry, Juan, your question again?"

      "speaker": "ROBERTS",

I think it would have like to have heard something a little more public. The President is very frustrated that this Russia story is still making a lot of headlines and refuses to go away.

You just, he didn't think this was a big deal, he didn't think that Russia will be pulled into this or that it would bring attention, he just thought he was firing somebody and moving on. Could that be? Simple as that."

    {
      "speaker": "ROBERTS",

I think that he saw, you know, the history of what people has said about Comey and thought that if he were to pull the trigger and get rid of him, that most of the people in Congress, saw on both sides of the aisle, would be happy about it. Certainly Democrats were calling for Comey's head. At the end of October when he came out and he said that he would reopen the investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails. Hillary Clinton herself thought that Comey threw the election with that pronouncement. So, President Trump probably would have been right in thinking that if he got rid of Comey, that the Democrats on Capitol Hill would have probably said, good idea. Let's move on to the next person. But again it was this idea of the timing. Right in the heart of the Russia investigation even if the Democrats, Greg, are happy to see Comey go, they're going to beat the President over the head with this because that's what you do when you are playing politics."

Well, Wilkerson didn't reach it but he did reach the most retweets of all time, surpassing Ellen De Generes' famous Oscar selfie in 2014 which held the record at 3.3 million. So, Wendy's has said that given Carter Wilkerson's impressive record, he's going to get free nuggets for a year and Wendy's also gave $100,000 to the Dave Thomas Foundation for Adoption.
