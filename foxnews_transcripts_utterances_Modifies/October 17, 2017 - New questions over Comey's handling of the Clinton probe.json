Well, here we are less than a year into his administration, that plan is being implemented, and now the enemy is on the run. Let's remember that enemy, ISIS, carrying out a series of atrocities during the Obama administration including that particularly horrific one in which they took a Jordanian pilot hostage, put him in a cage and then burned him a life for all the world to see. The same enemy that then-President Barack Obama had dismissed as the J.V. team even though the terror group then begin wreaking havoc around the globe, including disgusting videos of the beheadings of American Journalist like, James Foley, and Steven Sotloff.  Tonight, American officials are being cautious not to declare mission accomplished, though we're getting reports from fighters from the American- backed militia in Syria, firing celebratory shots in the air as they get the boot off this terror group off of their throats tonight. U.S. Central Command telling us \"More than 90 percent of Raqqa is in SDF control.\" That's referring to the Syrian Democratic Forces, as Candidate Trump, if you remember, promised on the campaign trail almost exactly one year ago tonight that he would defeat them.",

The reason that ISIS spread so rapidly in that map that we saw recently across the Syria and Iraq was because 2012, for political reasons, the Obama administration withdrew our military forces from Iraq. Does anybody think that if we had kept intelligence gathering, and air assets, and military trainers, and military coordinators, that as an organized column of ISIS approached Mosul, that American fire power and American leadership could not have helped the Iraqis keep them restrained and not allow them to take Mosul and all that territory.  Right after -- literally, the city boundaries of Baghdad. So, yes, President Trump did two things. First of all, he made clear that we're going to take action, and we saw that when -- unlike what President Obama said that's a red line if they dropped gas on their own people. When the Syrians dropped gas on their own people under this president, he immediately took action, and then he listened to the military and unleashed them on the mission they could do -- which is setting up a force of Syrians to work with American trainers and American assistance to do exactly what we saw today. But let's not kid ourselves, the battle against ISIS is going to continue. They've been kicked out of Raqqa but just like al- Qaeda, we will face these people for years to come.",

We know that when the hardworking people of this country huddle in the break room at the rest stop, or at the end of a long shift, they take pride in knowing that the projects they work, and the products they make, aren't just building business, their building families and communities, and most of all, they are building this nation that we all love so much.",

He laid it out there tonight to the Heritage Foundation, part of a very concerted effort to go out and sell this plan. He has done it to small communities in Pennsylvania. Tonight, speaking to the Heritage Foundation, trying to rally their support, and their outreach as much as they can to support this bill as well. He was criticized for not doing this with health care, and he is definitely out there trying to make this happen for tax reform.

He hit the main points, cut the corporate tax rate to 20 percent. One point he didn't make that needs to make, he made it sort of gently, the people who pay the corporate tax rate are primarily the workers in the form of lower wages and smaller benefits, and secondarily, the consumers who were buying the goods or services of the company. So when we cut the corporate tax rate, the first people who are going to feel this are going to be the employees of the company. Larry Lindsey, a colleague of Marc and mine said taxes are paid by those who can't escape them. Actually, it's called the immobile factor of production and economics. Workers can't escape the fact that their companies are getting taxed. Then you talk about repatriation, the idea -- think about it, we're the only major industrialized country in the world that taxes the foreign profits of companies headquartered in it twice. If you're a German company that sells something to the United States, you pay a tax on the profit here, take it home and don't pay a tax there. But when you're an American companies sell something at a profit in Germany, you get taxed in Germany, and then you get taxed again in the United States. So having one of the largest, the highest corporate tax rates of any major industrialized country. The president misspoke a little bit, we're bringing it down into just below the middle of the industrialized countries. There are lots of countries that are below us, Korea, Denmark, others, they're below us, and then making it into a territorial tax system so we don't go back to this process of stranding these foreign profits. President said free trade. I've talked to a bunch of economists, they think it's an access of $4 trillion of American profits that are stranded abroad.",

Look, the problem we have right now -- first of all, this is a great speech. It's exactly what he had to do because he didn't do this on health care reform. He's using the bully pulpit to sell this to the American people, rally conservatives, rally ordinary Americans around it, and get it done. He's got to have more details like that. That $4,000 figure is a little bit shaky for most of the economist I talked to, and part of the problem is that we don't have a tax bill yet. We don't know what the rates are going to be for each individual group, and so he can't really go out there yet and say in a credible way, if you're making this and this amount of money, this is how much your tax bill is going to go down. If you're making this and this amount of money this is how much your tax bill. He's got to learn if he's going to pass this he's got to make it real for ordinary Americans. And the other problem he has to overcome in writing this bill is that -- during the Bush tax cut debate, as Karl remembers very well, President Bush was able to say every single American will get a tax cut, and that's not true yet of this bill. You had -- Cohen, I'm sorry, rather, going out there saying, well, if you're in the middle class some people might have a little bit of a tax increase. That's not going to work. You have to get a tax bill that cuts taxes for every single American and no one can argue with that and that's a winning sell.",

MARTHA MACCALLUM, \"THE STORY\" HOST: Breaking tonight, President Trump about to take the stage to talk about, we are told, the greatness of America. He's also rally support for his tax cut plan, vital to the success of year one for his presidency; he will do that at the Heritage Foundation in D.C. where you see everybody gathering. Good evening, everybody! I'm Martha MacCallum. We are going to take you there live in moments. But first tonight, our story begins in Raqqa, where it was a huge day as the ISIS stronghold all but fell to U.S.-backed Syrian forces. The radical Islamic group once referred to by President Obama as the J.V. team dominated a caliphate that stretch from Syria to Iraq, killing thousands, some by drowning, some by being set on fire, mass beheadings. Their story is far from over; we will talk about that, but Raqqa is no doubt a huge development today. Here is President Trump on the news today, and then back on the campaign trail at the end.

As a candidate, President Trump was repeatedly mocked by Democrats for saying he had a plan to defeat ISIS but was not going to share it with the public because he did not want to tip off the enemy. Well, here we are less than a year into his administration, that plan is being implemented, and now the enemy is on the run. Let's remember that enemy, ISIS, carrying out a series of atrocities during the Obama administration including that particularly horrific one in which they took a Jordanian pilot hostage, put him in a cage and then burned him a life for all the world to see. The same enemy that then-President Barack Obama had dismissed as the J.V. team even though the terror group then begin wreaking havoc around the globe, including disgusting videos of the beheadings of American Journalist like, James Foley, and Steven Sotloff. Tonight, American officials are being cautious not to declare mission accomplished, though we're getting reports from fighters from the American- backed militia in Syria, firing celebratory shots in the air as they get the boot off this terror group off of their throats tonight. U.S. Central Command telling us \"More than 90 percent of Raqqa is in SDF control.\" That's referring to the Syrian Democratic Forces, as Candidate Trump, if you remember, promised on the campaign trail almost exactly one year ago tonight that he would defeat them."

In fact, Pentagon officials, telling us tonight that ISIS had put improvised explosive devices on the ground hidden all around the city of Raqqa. It could take years to clear that out without more injuries, more deaths. There's a lot of work to be done, Martha, but this is a big victory tonight."

Bush; and Marie Harf, former President Obama's State Department Spokesperson, both are Fox News Contributors. Great to have both of you here tonight as we wait for the president's speech to get started a few minutes down the road. Marie, I want to start with you. I heard General Jack Keane talk about this this morning and he said it took the Obama administration far too long to deal with ISIS. He claims that the administration was too concerned with possible adverse consequences of their actions and he sees President Trump's action as decisive and effective, what do you say?"

But after our administration, sort of, got a better sense of what was going on, we did put in place a plan that we see being carried out now. I mean, the plan to retake Raqqa was put in place during the Obama administration. Now, President Trump has done something like we've some of the rules of engagement, he has made some tweaks around the edges, but this is the plan that the military has had in place for a long time. And Ed is absolutely right, this is a big victory."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "But some of the military would say that they weren't allowed to do what they believe that they could do. And Karl, I want to get you in here, even President Bush said that he always listens to his generals, he had daily conversations with them. We did not see that in the Obama administration."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KARL ROVE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR AND CHIEF OF STAFF TO PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH",
      "utterance": "And let's be honest. The reason that ISIS spread so rapidly in that map that we saw recently across the Syria and Iraq was because 2012, for political reasons, the Obama administration withdrew our military forces from Iraq. Does anybody think that if we had kept intelligence gathering, and air assets, and military trainers, and military coordinators, that as an organized column of ISIS approached Mosul, that American fire power and American leadership could not have helped the Iraqis keep them restrained and not allow them to take Mosul and all that territory. Right after -- literally, the city boundaries of Baghdad. So, yes, President Trump did two things. First of all, he made clear that we're going to take action, and we saw that when -- unlike what President Obama said that's a red line if they dropped gas on their own people. When the Syrians dropped gas on their own people under this president, he immediately took action, and then he listened to the military and unleashed them on the mission they could do -- which is setting up a force of Syrians to work with American trainers and American assistance to do exactly what we saw today. But let's not kid ourselves, the battle against ISIS is going to continue. They've been kicked out of Raqqa but just like al- Qaeda, we will face these people for years to come."

They recently retook the city of Mayadin, which is also a stronghold of ISIS. So, now, you've got really the battle between Russia and Iran, and the Syrian forces backed by the United States for control of Syria."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HARF",
      "utterance": "Well, right. So, the Syrian Civil War is going to continue regardless of the fact that we've retaken Raqqa. But I think the real threat from ISIS -- and look, to respond Karl here, ISIS would never have existed if its precursor hadn't been able to flourish after we invaded Iraq back in the Bush administration. So, this has a longer history passed the Obama administration. But to be clear here, what I think is the biggest threat is ISIS ideology having spread to Europe, to Africa, to Asia and these lone wolves who've maybe never even gone to Syria."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "I want to put something up on the screen because you have a great point. This came from the MI-5 General Director Andrew Parker in the U.K. today. He says, \"The U.K. has seen a dramatic upshift in threats from Islamic terrorism this year reflecting attacks that have taken place in Westminster, Manchester, and London Bridge. He goes on to say, he said, \"That threat is multidimensional, evolving rapidly, and operating at a scale and pace that we have not seen before.\" That's a terrifying word."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HARF",
      "utterance": "It is. And unlike al-Qaeda, which really wanted people who are going to carry out terrorist attacks in the names, to commit them, to pledge allegiance, to train with them; ISIS doesn't care. They're fine if you go online and you get radicalized and then you commit a terrorist attack in their name. We don't even -- these people don't even have to go to Syria or Iraq, and it's much harder to find folks like that. So, this is going to be a very serious challenge in the west, across Africa and Asia."

But Iowa Senator Chuck Grassley, the Committee Chair; and South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham who sits on the committee, uncovered the document back in August, and quickly wrote a scathing letter to the newly appointed FBI Director Christopher Wray, saying: \"The outcome of an investigation should not be prejudged while FBI agents are still hard at work trying to gather the facts.\" The Comey letter, which was unclassified, yet heavily redacted, also calls into question the former FBI director's Senate testimony in June of this year when Comey said the reason he publicly announced the results of the Clinton probe in the summer of 2016 was to \"protect the credibility of the investigation after then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch and former President Bill Clinton had an unscheduled meeting on a tarmac in Arizona.\" But that meeting happened 56 days after the draft letter, reportedly exonerating Clinton, had already been sent.

The director, you know, the senior leadership of the FBI is in briefings for much of their day, reading papers about significant cases and very often producing those papers to push further up into the food chain. I was a participant in that, a recipient and a briefer at times. And so, these papers very often are the repository is maybe a portal, it's some sort of internal site that you have a number of living documents that detail the progress on significant cases."

So, I understand how you're sort of, you know, working on parallel courses, and you are kind of moving the evidence through.

But I think as you know, there has been a lot of discussion about intent, the intent element of the espionage statute that was at issue here whether Mrs. Clinton had violated that intent element, whether there should be an intent element. And I think that it could well be that James Comey, former Prosecutor. A person used to creating lengthy prosecution memos and detailing the weaknesses and strength of the case, could have been taking his own proactive steps here to document that very same thing, believing that the e-mails at the time or perhaps not showing that intent strongly enough for the FBI to recommend prosecution."

And two other people's sitting in on that meeting had been giving immunity. They were fact witnesses, they were given immunity, and they got to act as her attorney -- something that Director Comey also said in the history of his career he had never, ever seen before."

You could sort of ascertain whether or not it looked like a decision had already been made, because, of course, that's been a suspicion of a lot of people throughout the whole course of this, that it was just sort of going through the motions, and, yes, we know we have to do this investigation, but we know we're never going to prosecute."

You couple that with the fact that judicial watch put in a foyer request asking for documents relating to the tarmac meeting. Initially, the FBI comes back and says we don't have any documents. Only then, to probably be caught and come back say, well, actually, we have 30 of them -- 30 pages. And those too have been redacted. And I'm really counting on Michael Horowitz, the Department of Justice Inspector General; he has 450 employees, you haven't heard a leak from him. But come next year, I think he's going to come out with a definitive report.

They've never been able to make a deal. We're putting that in our tax plan. I think it's going to be over $3 trillion, it could be substantially more than that, because if I'm saying $2.5 trillion, and I've been saying it for many years, we know one thing, it's a lot more now.

Tonight, speaking to the Heritage Foundation, trying to rally their support, and their outreach as much as they can to support this bill as well. He was criticized for not doing this with health care, and he is definitely out there trying to make this happen for tax reform. So joining me now Marc Thiessen, former speechwriter for President George W. Bush, and Karl Rove back with us, former chief of staff to President Bush, both are Fox News contributors.

He hit the main points, cut the corporate tax rate to 20 percent. One point he didn't make that needs to make, he made it sort of gently, the people who pay the corporate tax rate are primarily the workers in the form of lower wages and smaller benefits, and secondarily, the consumers who were buying the goods or services of the company. So when we cut the corporate tax rate, the first people who are going to feel this are going to be the employees of the company. Larry Lindsey, a colleague of Marc and mine said taxes are paid by those who can't escape them. Actually, it's called the immobile factor of production and economics. Workers can't escape the fact that their companies are getting taxed. Then you talk about repatriation, the idea -- think about it, we're the only major industrialized country in the world that taxes the foreign profits of companies headquartered in it twice. If you're a German company that sells something to the United States, you pay a tax on the profit here, take it home and don't pay a tax there. But when you're an American companies sell something at a profit in Germany, you get taxed in Germany, and then you get taxed again in the United States. So having one of the largest, the highest corporate tax rates of any major industrialized country. The president misspoke a little bit, we're bringing it down into just below the middle of the industrialized countries. There are lots of countries that are below us, Korea, Denmark, others, they're below us, and then making it into a territorial tax system so we don't go back to this process of stranding these foreign profits. President said free trade. I've talked to a bunch of economists, they think it's an access of $4 trillion of American profits that are stranded abroad."

      "utterance": "First of all, I want to put Karl in charge of writing it because he's got the details of the thing down to a science. You could write the bill, Karl. Look, the problem we have right now -- first of all, this is a great speech. It's exactly what he had to do because he didn't do this on health care reform. He's using the bully pulpit to sell this to the American people, rally conservatives, rally ordinary Americans around it, and get it done. He's got to have more details like that. That $4,000 figure is a little bit shaky for most of the economist I talked to, and part of the problem is that we don't have a tax bill yet. We don't know what the rates are going to be for each individual group, and so he can't really go out there yet and say in a credible way, if you're making this and this amount of money, this is how much your tax bill is going to go down. If you're making this and this amount of money this is how much your tax bill. He's got to learn if he's going to pass this he's got to make it real for ordinary Americans. And the other problem he has to overcome in writing this bill is that -- during the Bush tax cut debate, as Karl remembers very well, President Bush was able to say every single American will get a tax cut, and that's not true yet of this bill. You had -- Cohen, I'm sorry, rather, going out there saying, well, if you're in the middle class some people might have a little bit of a tax increase. That's not going to work. You have to get a tax bill that cuts taxes for every single American and no one can argue with that and that's a winning sell."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "I mean, part of the issue here is that some loopholes would go away, and when you look at the doubling of the child tax credit and the standard deduction and all of that, some people it may come out to not benefit. Karl, when you put a number on that and say every family is going to get $4,000, if your family doesn't get $4,000, that's politically difficult, right?"

      "speaker": "ROVE",
      "utterance": "Yeah. Well, they said on average. And Kevin -- the author of the study, he's trying to make a point. He is engaged in this argument, who benefits from this. And look, economists agree largely that the taxes are mainly paid by the workers. The question is it 40 percent of the tax burden, is it 70 percent of the tax burden, is it more? But the argument is to who is paying the corporate tax as large have been settled, the president probably would have been better just focusing on that and not getting into the numbers games just yet."

One of the things we learned in ObamaCare is that 50 votes is not enough to get -- 52 Republicans is not enough to get a good agenda through, so he has to get some of those Democrats through."
