Welcome to the special final exam edition of \"Tucker Carlson Tonight.\" For more than a year, we've been bringing the top news professionals of our age onto the show and putting them to the test. We want to see which is a true hero of news knowledge. We are going to start tonight with one of the best final exam battles ever between Greg Gutfeld and Judge Jeanine Pirro. They got completely out of control as you will see, as they clashed over New York's squirrel census and much more.  You both know the rules as avid weekly viewers of this game. I'm going to repeat them for our viewers just tuning in. Contestants, hands on buzzers. I ask the questions. The first one of you to buzz in gets to answer the question. This is a tough one. You must wait until I finish asking in order to answer the question. Once I acknowledge you by saying your name, each correct answer is worth one point.",

ANNA KOOIMAN, CO-HOST, FOX & FRIENDS: Hi everyone. Merry Christmas and live from America's News Headquarters, I'm Anna Kooiman. The merriment continues tonight as people around the globe celebrate one of the most joyous days of the year. But at the Vatican, Pope Francis reminded thousands of pilgrims gathered in St. Peter's Square about the true meaning of this holiday. He pleaded for fraternity among people of all races and faiths. The pontiff also urged world leaders to put aside their political differences and find a solution to wars in Syria and Yemen and conflicts in Ukraine and the Korean peninsula. President Donald Trump spent part of today wishing American troops stationed around the country and the world a Merry Christmas. Speaking by videoconference to members of all five branches of the military, Mr. Trump acknowledged the great sacrifices our men and women in uniform make, far from home and away from their loved ones. The President spent a rare Christmas in Washington because of the ongoing budget stalemate with Congress. And Christmas celebrations traditionally filled with laughter and uplifting music were replaced by somber prayers for tsunami victims in an area slammed by waves that hit without warning, killing more than 420 people and leaving thousands homeless in Indonesia. The pastor of a Pentecostal church in the disaster zone says of the subdued holiday, our celebration is full of grief. Let's all count our blessings on this Christmas night. I'm Anna Kooiman, now back to Tucker Carlson Tonight. Merry Christmas, everybody.",

President Donald Trump says things will remain that way until Democrats agree to build a wall among the U.S.-Mexico border.

The 8-year-old boy from Guatemala was in custody in New Mexico with his father. Customs and Border officials say the child was taken into the hospital on Monday night after showing \"signs of potential illness.\" The boy was diagnosed with a fever, given medicine and released. But a short time later, he was readmitted and died early this morning. A 7-year- old boy - or rather a 7-year-old girl rather from the same country died at the border earlier this month. GoFundMe refunds more than $400,000 after a campaign meant to help a homeless veteran turned out to be a scam. More than 14,000 people donated after a New Jersey couple set up the page.

They got completely out of control as you will see, as they clashed over New York's squirrel census and much more. You both know the rules as avid weekly viewers of this game. I'm going to repeat them for our viewers just tuning in. Contestants, hands on buzzers. I ask the questions. The first one of you to buzz in gets to answer the question. This is a tough one.

Our Final Exam Christmas special continues in just a moment. Some of these contests go right down to the wire. Up next, our Sudden Death battle between Bret Baier and Ed Henry. We'll be right back. ANNA KOOIMAN, CO-HOST, FOX & FRIENDS: Hi everyone. Merry Christmas and live from America's News Headquarters, I'm Anna Kooiman. The merriment continues tonight as people around the globe celebrate one of the most joyous days of the year. But at the Vatican, Pope Francis reminded thousands of pilgrims gathered in St. Peter's Square about the true meaning of this holiday. He pleaded for fraternity among people of all races and faiths. The pontiff also urged world leaders to put aside their political differences and find a solution to wars in Syria and Yemen and conflicts in Ukraine and the Korean peninsula. President Donald Trump spent part of today wishing American troops stationed around the country and the world a Merry Christmas. Speaking by videoconference to members of all five branches of the military, Mr. Trump acknowledged the great sacrifices our men and women in uniform make, far from home and away from their loved ones. The President spent a rare Christmas in Washington because of the ongoing budget stalemate with Congress. And Christmas celebrations traditionally filled with laughter and uplifting music were replaced by somber prayers for tsunami victims in an area slammed by waves that hit without warning, killing more than 420 people and leaving thousands homeless in Indonesia. The pastor of a Pentecostal church in the disaster zone says of the subdued holiday, our celebration is full of grief. Let's all count our blessings on this Christmas night. I'm Anna Kooiman, now back to Tucker Carlson Tonight. Merry Christmas, everybody."

President Donald Trump says things will remain that way until Democrats agree to build a wall among the U.S.-Mexico border. The President made the announcement during the appearance with reporters at the Oval Office. Senate Democrats have not given in to the President, who wants more than $5 billion for border security. More than 800,000 federal employees are being impacted. Meantime, back at the border, U.S. officials say another young child has died. The 8-year-old boy from Guatemala was in custody in New Mexico with his father. Customs and Border officials say the child was taken into the hospital on Monday night after showing \"signs of potential illness.\" The boy was diagnosed with a fever, given medicine and released. But a short time later, he was readmitted and died early this morning. A 7-year- old boy - or rather a 7-year-old girl rather from the same country died at the border earlier this month.
