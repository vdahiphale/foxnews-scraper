We'll get to that later. But first, some 2020 politic, new reporting indicates the Democratic Party is worried over Bernie Sanders' surge. According to the New York Times, a good portion of Democratic super delegates do not want to hand Senator Sanders the nomination if he falls short of a majority of delegates before the convention.  And after saying she rejects socialism, Speaker Nancy Pelosi now says she will back Sanders if he becomes her party's presidential nominee.",

That was just in one hour, Juan.  That's why people are nervous on the Democratic side. His coalition -- in terms of the Electoral College is not as strong as he believes. If you think are seniors going to turn out for Bernie Sanders? Are suburban women going to turn out? Is he going to get black turnout in Charlotte, in Philadelphia, in Detroit? We'll see about that.   He wants to ban fracking. Is that going to help him in Pennsylvania? Are his Castro comments going to help him in Miami-Dade? Are union voters in Michigan, who have great healthcare plans going to vote for a guy who says you can't keep that plan? I don't know. I don't think he is positioned perfectly, well, not perfect. Donald Trump, when he was running, won 41 out of the 50 early contests. I don't think Bernie is going to hit 41. He is going to lose in South Carolina. And he's down by 20 points to Biden in Florida. Those are key contests. The rest of the Democratic voters, they have major differences with the core issues that Bernie supports. They are not behind the Green New Deal. They are not behind Medicare for all.  They are not behind free college. And they are not behind raising taxes on middle-class Americans to pay for it.",

And if Joe Biden all of a sudden does well in South Carolina and winning looks good on him and then on Tuesday, it's a mixed bag where you have Bernie win some, Sanders wins some, maybe Pete Buttigieg wins a couple. I don't see anyone else winning other states. Maybe Klobuchar wins her home state in Minnesota. Then the media is going to write this story that will help get this contest into another place, which what we've been talking about this possibility of a contested convention.  Watch very carefully what all of these candidates are saying. There is a question with the Democrats at their convention. Do you think you need to have a majority to win or a plurality to win? Because right now, it looks like none of these candidates are going to get to the convention with a majority plus one.

So -- and the convention is like that quick and dirty annulment you do before anybody finds out.  But I think people -- this is the period of reckoning for everyone who laughed at the Republicans in 2016. What the Democrats are feeling right now is what the Republicans felt almost to a T about Trump. First, you saw that it was a just a joke or a novelty. Then you realize it's more than a novelty as there is some kind of connection going on. Then, there's a sense of panic, that it's more than a connection. And as people drop out, the plurality just kind of grows and that the argument about him not having all the other people doesn't make sense, because all the other candidates aren't running together. So that thing goes away. And then, you have this resignation. But there was a difference.  Trump then won. That's the difference. And the thing is what's missing is the belief that Trump will win. But then, that was missing before. And the one good thing about Sanders is its getting people to think about socialism, right? That why is socialism popular among the young, because it offers free stuff? And then people start realizing that it's not really free.  It's a pretty good education, and you dig further into what his compliments about Cuba. You find it's actually re-education, literacy program in which they force you to digest communist propaganda and turning your parents. People start to learn these things. So I think it's helpful.

And at a minimum, it's going to depress voter turnout. That will 100 percent cement Trump's win. Not really like they needed any more reason, because there is no way that a large amount of those voters are going to turn out after that. They're going to blame it for everything.

So it was my absolute honor to be part of Helicopters for Heroes this weekend in Ennis, Texas, which is veterans and patriots honoring combat wounded vets with a helicopter hog hunt, tons of festivities, live music, and fellowship, and witnessing the impact that these organizations have on veterans. It's such a blessing. I was humbled to have given the opening remarks to these guys. And this year, the event included veterans who are beneficiaries of the Independence Fund, the foundation for Exceptional Warriors and Sons of the Flag. I got to share the stage with General Bolduc and I was floored, I have to say, when I received coins from U.S. Army Medal of Honor recipient Robert Patterson, and Lieutenant Colonel Bruce Stacy. I could not be more grateful for this experience. And I just want to tell you guys, if you have time, please go to my Instagram. Please go to Helicopters for Heroes Instagram so you can learn more. I put the names of every single veteran that was honored and participated and I think it's important that we all bear witness to them.",

We'll get to that later. But first, some 2020 politic, new reporting indicates the Democratic Party is worried over Bernie Sanders' surge. According to the New York Times, a good portion of Democratic super delegates do not want to hand Senator Sanders the nomination if he falls short of a majority of delegates before the convention.

He said that Castro was a great guy, even though he had Russian missiles pointed at our country, and says he wants to give taxpayer money to black Americans so they can grow and sell weed. That was just in one hour, Juan. That's why people are nervous on the Democratic side. His coalition -- in terms of the Electoral College is not as strong as he believes. If you think are seniors going to turn out for Bernie Sanders? Are suburban women going to turn out? Is he going to get black turnout in Charlotte, in Philadelphia, in Detroit? We'll see about that. He wants to ban fracking. Is that going to help him in Pennsylvania? Are his Castro comments going to help him in Miami-Dade? Are union voters in Michigan, who have great healthcare plans going to vote for a guy who says you can't keep that plan? I don't know. I don't think he is positioned perfectly, well, not perfect. Donald Trump, when he was running, won 41 out of the 50 early contests. I don't think Bernie is going to hit 41. He is going to lose in South Carolina. And he's down by 20 points to Biden in Florida. Those are key contests. The rest of the Democratic voters, they have major differences with the core issues that Bernie supports. They are not behind the Green New Deal. They are not behind Medicare for all. They are not behind free college. And they are not behind raising taxes on middle-class Americans to pay for it."

So if Bernie Sanders is their only ride out of town, you're going to buy the ticket and you will get on board and you'll help. But I don't think -- the story is not over yet. And one of the things that the media loves to write is anything that shows a pivot or a comeback. And if Joe Biden all of a sudden does well in South Carolina and winning looks good on him and then on Tuesday, it's a mixed bag where you have Bernie win some, Sanders wins some, maybe Pete Buttigieg wins a couple. I don't see anyone else winning other states. Maybe Klobuchar wins her home state in Minnesota. Then the media is going to write this story that will help get this contest into another place, which what we've been talking about this possibility of a contested convention. Watch very carefully what all of these candidates are saying. There is a question with the Democrats at their convention. Do you think you need to have a majority to win or a plurality to win? Because right now, it looks like none of these candidates are going to get to the convention with a majority plus one. So then the question is, well, Bernie Sanders says I should get it because I'm in the lead. But everybody else is, like, that's not the rule. You go to a second ballot, and in that case, I don't think Bernie Sanders --"

OK, the Democratic Party right now is the guy who wakes the morning after his bachelor party in Vegas, realizing he just married the bearded lady from the circus. You know, they are handcuffed in the hotel room to Bernie Sanders, and they realize he's got a lot of kinks, right? So -- and the convention is like that quick and dirty annulment you do before anybody finds out. But I think people -- this is the period of reckoning for everyone who laughed at the Republicans in 2016. What the Democrats are feeling right now is what the Republicans felt almost to a T about Trump. First, you saw that it was a just a joke or a novelty. Then you realize it's more than a novelty as there is some kind of connection going on. Then, there's a sense of panic, that it's more than a connection. And as people drop out, the plurality just kind of grows and that the argument about him not having all the other people doesn't make sense, because all the other candidates aren't running together. So that thing goes away. And then, you have this resignation. But there was a difference. Trump then won. That's the difference. And the thing is what's missing is the belief that Trump will win. But then, that was missing before. And the one good thing about Sanders is its getting people to think about socialism, right? That why is socialism popular among the young, because it offers free stuff? And then people start realizing that it's not really free. It's a pretty good education, and you dig further into what his compliments about Cuba. You find it's actually re-education, literacy program in which they force you to digest communist propaganda and turning your parents. People start to learn these things. So I think it's helpful.

And at a minimum, it's going to depress voter turnout. That will 100 percent cement Trump's win. Not really like they needed any more reason, because there is no way that a large amount of those voters are going to turn out after that. They're going to blame it for everything. And it's the kind of thing that gives rise to third parties. And even though it doesn't seem very plausible, it's 100 percent possible with the amount of anger and the amount of rage that would come out of the Bernie bros and that socialist aspect of the party. And then if they just kind of symbolically go against him and it's not enough to sink him, then after that, his entire campaign will have to divert their resources to patching up the party in addition to winning the general.

Brian Stelter tweeting this, since the dawn of the Trump era, countless experts have warned that the president's lack of credibility would imperil the country in the event of an emergency. As the Coronavirus outbreak worsens, those fears maybe coming true. That one tweet defines the media's dark desires for something bad to happen so that all of their previous Trump hatred is validated. The fears maybe coming true, Brian wish tweets, relying on the word all CNN's false fantasies bank on may. Every story that collapses hinges on may. Trump may resign. Trump may not leave office. Avenatti may run for president, Brian. It's a word that provides cover for the press' delusional dreams. And today, that dream is a disease. This time, people will surely die, but it will be Trump's fault. And then finally, I will be right and Jeff Zucker will give me a lollipop. It's a diabolical deal, welcoming a grim hell just to say I told you so. Meanwhile, Gail Collins in the New York Times says let's call the disease the Trump virus, to which I say let's rename dementia the New York Times. Because only a truly mindless paper would still run Gail's laughable drivel, an example of how they rather politicize than help. So as these jackasses claim to champion credibility, their own credibility is a joke. CNN, The Times, can't be trusted on any topic, because their deranged filter spits out the same answer on everything. Orange man bad, I would call it a plague, otherwise known as Gail Collins' disease. Nobody knows anything, Dana."

The correct answer is humanity is in a race against these biological changes. Mother Nature is, like, oh, you know what? I'm going to tweak this little virus. And those people who work in public health, thank goodness for them. They spend 24/7 racing against this virus. And if you look back in history, we've known that this was going to happen again. That's why you have public health. That's why you have doctors who are dedicated primarily to dealing with flu's and the Coronaviruses like this. I thought last night that the reporters in the briefing room were actually really respectful, smart, responsible, asked good questions.

And I think in things that actually matter, which is this public health and actually, you know, a threat of an actual fatality, then exasperation leads to zero tolerance. So when the Russia, Russia, Russia, and everything in the last three years that we've been fed by CNN and MSNBC and everything else in those commentators, you know, here we go again. Yes, everything is his fault. But when it's something like this where actually the public needs true, reliant information, no one is going to watch that.

But it seems like on the other side, the Trump haters, they don't have solutions. They just want to politicize, Gail Collins, Stelter.

And so then I think, there's a real argument here you can say is being politicized. But I would say the president, in terms of his own argument, has made a very political because he comes at it with calm down. I'm going to reassure you. No reason for any -- I like that. I like the president acting in that way because I think that's presidential. But on the other hand, I want to hear the facts.

We just don't know. The guy is a germaphobe who is tough on China and is a border hawk. He is the perfect president to take on this virus. And -- early travel restriction bought us time as now everybody acknowledges. Yet, he was called a racist for doing it. Now, the containment strategy so far is working. Not one single American has died in the United States. And according to Johns Hopkins University, America is the best prepared country in the entire world for this. Doctors and administrators have been mobilized. And I'm very, very happy with the fact that in a new year, we are going to have a vaccine. And in a couple months, you're going to have a therapeutic drug. Now, I think we are on the frontlines. We are the ones who have to wash our hands. We are the ones who have to cough like this, not go to China and make preparations. The federal government can only do so much.

He can introduce idiotic ideas that, you know, that people could just laugh at and he could just sit there for like, a couple of four years and then they get rid of them. But it's like, the thing is, the reason why so many people are interested in socialism is they see it as a buffet. It's like they don't have to take that, you know, the means of production, they just want a tax. They don't understand that the taxing actually affects the means of production and kind of screws up all the thing. What I want to see is I want to see somebody asked Bernie Sanders how you reconcile government-run health care and child care and forgiveness of loans with open borders? Because that is incompatible. A really good socialist who believes in government-run everything wants a closed system. You have to -- yes, you have to have a closed system because if you have -- you can't have both.

It's such a blessing. I was humbled to have given the opening remarks to these guys. And this year, the event included veterans who are beneficiaries of the Independence Fund, the foundation for Exceptional Warriors and Sons of the Flag. I got to share the stage with General Bolduc and I was floored, I have to say, when I received coins from U.S. Army Medal of Honor recipient Robert Patterson, and Lieutenant Colonel Bruce Stacy. I could not be more grateful for this experience. And I just want to tell you guys, if you have time, please go to my Instagram. Please go to Helicopters for Heroes Instagram so you can learn more.

They had 18,000 public school children come to Madison Square Garden and see Harper Lee's iconic book performed by Ed Harris, who's Atticus Finch right now. That's the main character. And it was amazing that they got a chance to do this. This is the first time that a Broadway play has been done in Madison Square Garden and I wish I'd been there."
