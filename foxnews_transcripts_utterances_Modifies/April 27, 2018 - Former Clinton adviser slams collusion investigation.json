Nonetheless, the president feels ahead of steam as you heard there. Because this report, of over more than 250 pages, by Chairman Devin Nunes and other Republicans on the House Intel panel asserts they \"found no evidence that the Trump campaign colluded, coordinated or conspired with the Russian government. Though the panel did \"find poor judgment and ill-considered actions by the Trump and Clinton campaigns.\" On that point, about Hillary Clinton, it was her campaign and the DNC that used intermediaries to hide their roles in paying for the anti-Trump opposition research from Russian sources that became the Steele dossier. None of those facts though stopped Democrat Adam Schiff today from insisting there has been a panel of what he called deception from Team Trump about their contacts with Russians that, in his words, suggest, \"wrongfulness, if not, illegality\".

You put the special counsel on notice that that is not an area that his report should go because it's not a constitutional question, and you could also potentially shut down this discussion is now, you know, just everywhere in the press and among Democrats as well, too. Because it's beginning to impede on other presidential abilities like impeachment -- I'm sorry, like pardons.

And we've articulated that in-depth. But what has taken place in front of us, this incredible sense of urgency that Kim Jong-un has displayed going back to the Olympics when it started with South Korea and he invited himself to the present. It is extraordinary and somewhat unprecedented. It reminds me of the sudden unexpected collapse of the Soviet Union when the wall in Berlin went down. That's the pace of what this is moving at; and it's hard to process all of it, to be frank.   And the next logical step, just dealing with the summit with Moon, that's taking place today and finishing up tomorrow, I think, is this: after they sign a peace treaty, North Korea, South Korea, China, United States, the next logical step would be to pull those very large armies that have been standing off against each other for one of the longest standoffs in history. Pull them away from each other because they're both on the border-- the majority of those armies. And that would be a major historic step forward as well. Clearly, Kim Jong-un is setting the framework because the meeting with moon came first and now the meeting with Trump. Clearly to put on the table denuclearization in his terms. And I think he probably would like to denuclearize, if he's serious, and we won't know until the president gets in the meeting. If he's serious, he would like to drag that out over a period of time and start making concessions almost immediately. The president won't let him get away with that. He's going to want to do it as rapidly as we possibly can with complete verification. If he is not serious at all, I take the president at his word is going to get up and leave. This much, I believe. I think the president has inside information here that he's not sharing us about what's going on with Kim Jong-un. And I think he got that from Director Pompeo in his discussions with him, because he keeps talking about something dramatic. But if it doesn't happen, I'm going to leave.

I also think and China's pivotal here as you indicate. But I also think there's absolute belief in China and North Korea, and South Korea, and with the Japanese that the president is dead serious about the use of military force if this comes down to no other option. I think if they are convinced that the United States has a plan to take out their nuclear systems and take out their ballistic systems as much as their artillery as possible.

And I think he's got credibility when he makes that statement, that I'm prepared to use military force if you leave me no other option.

The winner of that will take on Democratic Senator Joe Manchin in November. A seat that Republicans would love to pick up. The three candidates polling at 10 percent or higher will be participating. And we have invited them to appear here on THE STORY as well. We'll be joined by businessman Don Blankenship in just a moment. But first, Correspondent Peter Doocy on why this West Virginia race is being so closely watched around the nation. Hi, Peter.",

      "sentences": "Martha, the reason the stakes are so high in coal country is that the Republican who wins the West Virginia Senate Primary gets on a ballot against the Democratic Incumbent Senator Joe Manchin in a state where President Trump beat Hillary Clinton by 42 points. That makes it one of the Republicans' best opportunities to flip a seat. A Fox News poll finds the top three are Congressman Evan Jenkins, Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, and a former Colberan Don Blankenship. But a quarter of likely voters are undecided and 41 percent might change their minds. There is a fight between Jenkins, the Congressman; and Morrisey, the A.G., over who has been the most helpful to President Trump.  Jenkins brags that he was the only one to endorse Trump in the presidential primaries and he only one in D.C. right now casting votes to advance the Trump agenda. While Morrisey argues he's been doing more to help Trump by filing lawsuits to undo unfair Obama-era energy regulations seen as coal killers and some lawsuits that are reigning in the opioid epidemic.  In third place, it is the former Colberan Don Blankenship, known best at the contender who just did a year in jail on misdemeanor conviction of conspiring to violate mine safety laws after 29 miners were killed in an explosion at his company's upper big branch mine. That had some race watcher comparing Blankenship to Roy Moore who disappeared from the campaign trail in Alabama when allegations of sexual misconduct surfaced. But Blankenship tells me there's a big difference because Moore's accusers were women and his accusers were Obama allies with the suggestion being that he was punished by an administration with an unfavorable view of coal. Now some nervous Republican-linked Super PACs are spending hundreds of thousands of dollars against the Republican Blankenship to try to keep him off the ballot. But he is spending millions of his own. Martha?",

In his words, he wants them to end. Though, there are no signs that Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe is wrapping up any time soon. Nonetheless, the president feels ahead of steam as you heard there. Because this report, of over more than 250 pages, by Chairman Devin Nunes and other Republicans on the House Intel panel asserts they \"found no evidence that the Trump campaign colluded, coordinated or conspired with the Russian government. Though the panel did \"find poor judgment and ill-considered actions by the Trump and Clinton campaigns.\" On that point, about Hillary Clinton, it was her campaign and the DNC that used intermediaries to hide their roles in paying for the anti-Trump opposition research from Russian sources that became the Steele dossier. None of those facts though stopped Democrat Adam Schiff today from insisting there has been a panel of what he called deception from Team Trump about their contacts with Russians that, in his words, suggest, \"wrongfulness, if not, illegality\". The type of broad attack that has led Republicans like Trey Gowdy to call out Schiff for not delivering on alleged collusion. Watch."

I think Christopher Steele was part of the FBI when he leaked, lied, and then was fired. Page and Strzok are clearly biased. The head of the FBI was clearly biased. The head of the CIA appeared to be doing illegal leaks as well. This whole thing was corrupt. There is a doctrine called the fruits of the poisonous tree, that says when investigations get started like this, when searches and seizures are done on this basis, they should be thrown out. I think that's probably the best way to stop this thing because, otherwise, we're going all the way to the end and I don't think we should waste another year here."

Who is reporting a conversation that he had about a conversation that someone else had, who had (INAUDIBLE) professor who then had it supposedly with Russian agents which showed no collusion in the first place.

Oh, he didn't know who it was paid for to this day. That just was not true. And if it was true, how could he have used this information to launch this investigation it's preposterous. And here is he out making million dollars of dollars off a book, for a few meetings -- I met with the Clintons over 400 times. I never wrote a kiss-and-tell book like this.

      "speaker": "STRASSEL",
      "utterance": "Well, we were just talking about how there seems to be no there, there on the collusion question. The House report is now out. By all reporting, Mr. Mueller has not found anything there either. And so, the reports now say he's moving to the question of obstruction of justice. That requires an entirely new legal approach, one that goes right at that constitutional question. Because you talk to any constitutional lawyer, they will say that a president cannot be construed to obstructed justice while he was in the process of engaging in core constitutional powers, and that includes firing subordinates and directing law enforcement like Mr. Comey."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "You know, one of the things I find interesting we haven't heard directly, obviously, from Robert Mueller on this, but one of his spokes people said something to the effect of, you know, when you read about what we're doing, don't necessarily believe everything that you read, because we're not leaking about what we're doing in this special counsel investigation. And, you know, and they also said that they will issue at the end of it, a report. You know, that's what this is leading up to. This is not leading up to some sort of indictment. It's leading up to Mueller releasing a report. Probably, along the lines of what we heard James Comey do back in July before the election. To say here's what I looked at. This kind of looks like it could be obstruction of justice. This looks like it could be whatever. You know, nobody knows what he's going to say. But what's the process there? I mean, what do you expect to come out of that report once it hits the air?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STRASSEL",
      "utterance": "Well, we have no idea because they have been relatively quiet on exactly what that report will look like. But this is why it's so important for the Trump Team, Trump lawyers to go to a federal court get a declaratory judgment from that court that does make the point that presidents cannot be held for obstruction when exercising core functions. You put the special counsel on notice that that is not an area that his report should go because it's not a constitutional question, and you could also potentially shut down this discussion is now, you know, just everywhere in the press and among Democrats as well, too. Because it's beginning to impede on other presidential abilities like impeachment -- I'm sorry, like pardons. He came out and pardoned Scooter Libby, and you have all these Democrats saying, well, that's obstruction. He gives an order to his attorney general. They say it's obstruction. So, this is an issue that just needs to be clarified one way or the other."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "All right. So, you know, folks who are very concerned that there was some serious wrongdoing here are pointing mostly to the Michael Cohen part of the investigation. That these recordings that are on his several cell phones that he had are likely to lead down some road they believe that will entrap the president in some wrongdoing. The other issue that seems to be very much in the forefront is this meeting at Trump Tower. You know, when you look at what you've learned about those situations, how does that play into how you see the larger picture here or does it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STRASSEL",
      "utterance": "Well, the meeting at Trump Tower, if you look through this house intelligence report that just came out today, everybody involved in that was investigated, questioned, and the finding was that they essentially had this meeting. They thought it was going to be about something else beside it was. There was no collusion in the end. Again, this is why we supposedly had the special counsel was questions of collusion. And they seem to have been exonerated on that point by this House Intel report. The Michael Cohen thing, I'm not sure where that goes in any direction, because it's just not clear where exactly special counsel is looking. Is this a question of a campaign finance violation? Is there some suggestion that there was extortion that the president was aware of this? We just tonight know.

But today, they signed this joint declaration to end the seven-decade war and to pursue what they are calling complete denuclearization of the peninsula.

And we've articulated that in-depth. But what has taken place in front of us, this incredible sense of urgency that Kim Jong-un has displayed going back to the Olympics when it started with South Korea and he invited himself to the present. It is extraordinary and somewhat unprecedented. It reminds me of the sudden unexpected collapse of the Soviet Union when the wall in Berlin went down. That's the pace of what this is moving at; and it's hard to process all of it, to be frank."

      "speaker": "And the next logical step, just dealing with the summit with Moon, that's taking place today and finishing up tomorrow, I think, is this",
      "utterance": "after they sign a peace treaty, North Korea, South Korea, China, United States, the next logical step would be to pull those very large armies that have been standing off against each other for one of the longest standoffs in history. Pull them away from each other because they're both on the border-- the majority of those armies. And that would be a major historic step forward as well. Clearly, Kim Jong-un is setting the framework because the meeting with moon came first and now the meeting with Trump. Clearly to put on the table denuclearization in his terms. And I think he probably would like to denuclearize, if he's serious, and we won't know until the president gets in the meeting. If he's serious, he would like to drag that out over a period of time and start making concessions almost immediately. The president won't let him get away with that. He's going to want to do it as rapidly as we possibly can with complete verification. If he is not serious at all, I take the president at his word is going to get up and leave. This much, I believe. I think the president has inside information here that he's not sharing us about what's going on with Kim Jong-un. And I think he got that from Director Pompeo in his discussions with him, because he keeps talking about something dramatic. But if it doesn't happen, I'm going to leave. But we got a major event coming. And if it doesn't work out, we're going to leave. He has information he's not telling us."

But, when you kind of peal back that moment, you ask yourself, you point to history, what was the straw that sort of began to break the camel's back? And I think of the talks that President Trump and President Xi had, and the increase in sanctions and the pressure. There is evidence that the pressure economically on North Korea has been much more dramatic than it has been in the past. And that there are some elements of North Korean society. There is this small upper echelon that is connected to the leadership there, is not happy with the way things that are going -- the way things are going in North Korea. And perhaps, those initial meetings with President Xi set this ball in motion?"

      "speaker": "KEANE",

And there was so much large disenchantment inside the country that the elitists said we've got to change. I think the economic pressure absolutely -- you're right on the mark with that. I also think and China's pivotal here as you indicate. But I also think there's absolute belief in China and North Korea, and South Korea, and with the Japanese that the president is dead serious about the use of military force if this comes down to no other option. I think if they are convinced that the United States has a plan to take out their nuclear systems and take out their ballistic systems as much as their artillery as possible. And they have seen the president take action with limited military force. And I think he's got credibility when he makes that statement, that I'm prepared to use military force if you leave me no other option. So, you put China together the economic pressure, President Trump's military option, but mostly the reason why we are goings through this, and we've got to give him the credit for it is because of President Trump. That's the reality of it."

The winner of that will take on Democratic Senator Joe Manchin in November. A seat that Republicans would love to pick up. The three candidates polling at 10 percent or higher will be participating. And we have invited them to appear here on THE STORY as well. We'll be joined by businessman Don Blankenship in just a moment. But first, Correspondent Peter Doocy on why this West Virginia race is being so closely watched around the nation. Hi, Peter."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Martha, the reason the stakes are so high in coal country is that the Republican who wins the West Virginia Senate Primary gets on a ballot against the Democratic Incumbent Senator Joe Manchin in a state where President Trump beat Hillary Clinton by 42 points. That makes it one of the Republicans' best opportunities to flip a seat. A Fox News poll finds the top three are Congressman Evan Jenkins, Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, and a former Colberan Don Blankenship. But a quarter of likely voters are undecided and 41 percent might change their minds. There is a fight between Jenkins, the Congressman; and Morrisey, the A.G., over who has been the most helpful to President Trump. Jenkins brags that he was the only one to endorse Trump in the presidential primaries and he only one in D.C. right now casting votes to advance the Trump agenda. While Morrisey argues he's been doing more to help Trump by filing lawsuits to undo unfair Obama-era energy regulations seen as coal killers and some lawsuits that are reigning in the opioid epidemic. In third place, it is the former Colberan Don Blankenship, known best at the contender who just did a year in jail on misdemeanor conviction of conspiring to violate mine safety laws after 29 miners were killed in an explosion at his company's upper big branch mine. That had some race watcher comparing Blankenship to Roy Moore who disappeared from the campaign trail in Alabama when allegations of sexual misconduct surfaced. But Blankenship tells me there's a big difference because Moore's accusers were women and his accusers were Obama allies with the suggestion being that he was punished by an administration with an unfavorable view of coal. Now some nervous Republican-linked Super PACs are spending hundreds of thousands of dollars against the Republican Blankenship to try to keep him off the ballot. But he is spending millions of his own. Martha?"

And we need to make sure that decisions on that trade agreement are done in America's best interest and no personal best interest. It's no different than any corporation or any business entity. You want to make sure you don't have conflicts of interest in those decisions. There is no accusation there. It's just that it's important that everybody be doing what's best for the country."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So, that you said that there is no accusation, but you pointed out that Mr. McConnell's wife is the daughter of a prominent former Chinese businessman. So that suggestion -- sounds like you are suggesting that he has a conflict of interest because of that, is that what you were suggesting?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BLANKENSHIP",
      "utterance": "Well, yes. I mean, I'm not suggesting there is a conflict of interest in any business world that would be a conflict of interest. It's just a matter of whether you know it would impact his decision making or his position on these issues. He has in the past taken some strange positions. For example, after Tiananmen Square he was one of the Senators that I was in favor of letting trade continue with China despite our human rights violations and voted in that manner. So he has had votes and so forth relative to China that one could question. But the base issue here is that businesses are always concerned about conflict of interest when they are negotiating deals. In this case we just need to be aware of them."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BLANKENSHIP",
      "utterance": "Well, one thing is I have not been given a chance to turn it around and my two opponents have. And one had lobbied for drug companies and the other one is representing and has represented for 20 years the city that is worst in the nation per capita in opioid drug deaths. So, it is not easy to tell the difference. I have not had that opportunity. The company I ran we were drug-free. We were very tough on drugs. This country needs to be very tough on drugs and that is what I will be."

Relatively low turnout. Primary election among Republicans in a state that was historically Democratic. What matters here, these are the most intense voters. These are the people-- these are the activists. This is the core issue set folks. And they are going to be listening to the answers from Blankenship and Morrisey and Jenkins to the questions that you and Bret put to them next week very carefully. Words will matter, positions will matter. And if these folks detect any whiff of squishiness or back down the tube or anything like that. They will be unforgiven.

So, I would just point out that Manchin is well liked in this state. He is in the wrong party? But is he going to be a very, very tough out, because he is well-known. He is well-liked. And people in West Virginia are comfortable with sort of dynastic politics where you have multiple generations or your people who are in office for a long time.

Piazza Memorial Foundation that was set up in memory of her son, who died in February of 2017, after a night of hazing at a Penn State Fraternity. The sophomore wanted to be an engineer and he wanted to develop prosthetics for those who could not afford them. Now, his parents are keeping his dream alive. Through their foundation, the Piazza's were able to pay for a prosthetic leg for 7-year-old boy who lost the lower part of his leg in a tragic school bus accident. Lamont Hanna received this cool batman prosthesis two months ago and his mom says is he already back to being a kid again. Here now Lamont Hanna and his mother Wykeya Williams, good to see both of you. Thank you so much for being with us tonight. Hello Lamont and hello Wykeya. Wykeya, let me start with you, tell us a little bit of what happened and what Lamont's reaction was and how worried you all were about what his future was going to be like."

The Piazza family, the foundation reached out to us and they rewarded Lamont with a very cool batman leg. But, before the accident, we weren't sure was he able to walk again. Will he be able to walk again? That was my biggest worry would he be able to walk again, because to lose a foot, that is the main part of walking. So we were --"

I google her -- so I was just like so excited to meet her. And I was so thankful. Just like really honestly thankful. Because, without her, my son wouldn't have the opportunity to walk again. And I can never repay her for that. Like never. That is like --"

We now know the name of the new royal baby, Kensington Palace announcing that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge had named their son, Louis Arthur Charles. The name pays tribute to Lord Mount Baton, the great uncle of Prince Charles who was assassinated on his yacht by the IRA in 1979. Charles was devastated by his death and little Louis is a tribute to his memory. And that is the story on that. We will see you back here on Monday night at 7:00. Tucker Carlson is up next.
