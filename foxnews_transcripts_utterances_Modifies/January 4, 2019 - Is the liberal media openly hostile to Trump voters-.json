Now, Pelosi is the highest ranking Democrat in the United States. She's the leader of her party. So, we should not blow this off. We should take it seriously. As a matter of policy, Democrats believe a Border wall is immoral. And that raises the question, what do they consider moral?  Well American troops stuck forever in Syria, for one thing. That's just fine. Sex-selective abortions, paid for with tax dollars, can't get more moral than that. Antifa, rioting in the streets, all perfectly virtuous.   And turns out, even walls can be moral under the right circumstances. They just can't protect America. Democrats gladly signed off on border defenses for Jordan, Tunisia and Israel, no problem, glad to do it. But here, on behalf of our own people? No. Americans don't deserve that. They're immoral for asking. Those are the parameters of their morality. So, what religion is this exactly? Joining us now to explain it is Archbishop Chris Hahn. He's an attorney, radio host, and former aide to Senator Chuck Schumer, and he joins us tonight.  So, if you would, I think we've talked about this before. Nancy Pelosi has repeatedly called the wall immoral. And at first, I thought well, you know, she talks a lot, and I know the feeling, sometimes you misspeak.  But this is a talking point. This is something she's saying intentionally as the leader, now officially, of your party. So, Democrats believe Border walls are immoral. What does that mean?",

If Barack Obama wanted to build a wall, and he did it one time, as did Hillary Clinton, then they would be saying the wall is the greatest thing since sliced bread. It's political prostitution. And it's sad because we have a revolutionary economic and foreign policy cycle going on that's helping millions of people. And if they don't like it, they should criticize it on the principles.

Now they go to big cities, places like New York, San Francisco, Boston and, of course, Washington. In fact, those four cities accounted for the majority of the places last year's graduating class at Harvard went. Why? Because that's where the jobs are. Rural counties are shrinking. So that's a success for the cities, correct? But there is another side to it. Cities may have jobs for young people but they don't offer the life America used to be able to give children. Homes are much more expensive. Public schools are often awful, almost always awful. And if the jobs pay more, it's not enough to offset the rising cost of healthcare and servicing student loans. As a result of all this, something dramatic, and not very often noted, is happening in American cities. Even though that's where the young people live, nobody in the cities is having children. Birthrates are falling everywhere in America. But the most dramatic drop, by far, has been in urban areas. According to the CDC, from 2007 to 2017, birthrates in major cities fell by almost 20 percent. At this point, the City of San Francisco has more pet dogs than it has children. If this continues, if this trend persists, it doesn't matter how rich our cities get, or how many jobs they provide, if society can't reproduce itself, it has, by definition, failed. Our cities are failing by the most basic measure, and no one's paying attention. We are though. Well Bernie Sanders may run for president again this year. Before that campaign can even begin, the media are targeting him over deeds apparently committed in 2016. Not policy decisions made, but #MeToo matters. A series of New York Times reports accuses the Sanders Campaign of having a toxic sexist atmosphere, where women were routinely mistreated without any consequences.

A 2014 school incident report filed by that School Resource Officer, Scot Peterson, might hold the answer. The report indicates Peterson's boss, Broward County Sheriff, Scott Israel, had a son, who was a student at Stoneman Douglas, and according to the incident report, assisted in battery and, perhaps, sexual assault against a fellow student. Peterson called for the Sheriff's son to be suspended, instead of referring him for criminal prosecution, perhaps a favor, Sheriff Scott Israel never forgot. The parents of that student that was assaulted later said they were OK with law enforcement -- without law enforcement action because they felt it would have caused trauma to their son. Sheriff's Israel office confirmed that it received our request for a comment on the story. We did not hear back.

      "sentences": "Well there isn't just one drug crisis going on in America at the moment. There's one you read about a lot, drug overdoses, mostly by opioids, Fentanyl plays a big part. Those have been rising for years. They now kill more Americans every year than the entire Vietnam War did over a decade, so there's that. It's horrible and it needs more attention. But there's another drug crisis going on. It may not be as deadly, but it's worrying, and no one ever mentions it. At this moment, more than one in six American adults is on some kind of psychiatric drug. Among Americans over the age of 12, one in eight are taking antidepressants, a 65 percent increase compared to just 1999, 20 years ago. Among women, 16.5 percent are now on antidepressants. One in every six women in America is now taking a pill just to cope with feeling miserable. What is going on? After antidepressants, the most common psychiatric drugs are anti-anxiety medications like Xanax. These drugs are typically very addictive and abuse of them has soared along with the abuse of other opioids. Try to get off one of those benzo drugs, you can die from withdrawal. People do. But our frenzy for brain pills is hitting kids as well. Almost 10 percent of all American children are diagnosed with something called ADHD by the age of 17. Half of those kids, fully half, one in 20, overall nationally, take medication for it. And some of these drugs are very powerful, more than we may realize. One of the most famous anti-ADHD drugs is called Adderall. It's an addictive amphetamine. It's banned in Japan. It's rarely prescribed in Europe. But in America, millions of people have received diagnoses and received it. Since it can improve focus, there is an upside, Adderall is routinely abused by students to help with academic performance and also by adults to cope with demanding jobs. Forget using coffee to wake up in the morning, in this country, millions of people are taking amphetamines just to adequately service the market. Is this pill habit making the country happier? Is it making the country more sane? Of course, not. And the proof is in the numbers. The suicide rate is the highest it's been in half a century. It's still climbing. Among those who haven't taken their own lives, self-reported happiness is lower than it was a decade ago. This is particularly true in our country. This is not something that's happening worldwide. The OECD recently looked at antidepressant use in 25 wealthy countries, the U.S. was far ahead of every other except one, Iceland. Another study compared American children with German and Dutch kids. American children take three times as many psychotropic drugs to fight ADHD, three times as many antidepressants, about twice as many antipsychotic drugs. We don't have data for every country worldwide. But it seems possible that American children and adults are both the most medicated groups in the world. Why is this happening? And is the country doing anything about it? Well, to the extent the country is, we seem to be looking for another drug with a new high to fix our problems. Right now, legalizing marijuana is very popular. Lot of Republicans are behind it. The obvious downsides to this are suppressed. Politicians rave about the tax revenue. They're greedy. They always have been, always will be. While the advocates discuss the supposed medical benefits in medical marijuana, and there may be some, there probably are, but there are also downsides. Once it's legalized everywhere, we'll doubt we'll (ph) see some other illegal drug like Ecstasy or LSD touted as a fix for our country's problems. You're already seeing that with microdosing for LSD. At some point, you begin to wonder is it really America's brains that are sick or is there something bigger going on, maybe a problem with the society. Everywhere you look, things that make people happy seem to be vanishing. Americans report having fewer close friends. They're getting married less. They're having fewer children. Some are having no children because they can't in a lot of cases. They can't afford it. Their families are smaller and they live farther away. Confidence of government, also declining, so people feel like they lack control over their lives. Jobs confer (ph) less dignity if they can get them at all. Dramatic demographic change means many Americans don't recognize where they grew up. Their own towns are unrecognizable to them. Many can't relate to their own neighbors. Sometimes, they even can't understand the language. We're told that we're not supposed to worry about this. But, in real life, people do. And why wouldn't they? And then, of course, other physical problems, massive obesity ruining public health and causing misery as well. There's a lot of stuff going on. But the point is instead of trying to address these crises, politicians focus on economic growth rather than problems that caused all of this in the first place. Incomes in America more than doubled compared to 40 years ago, but are we better off? Probably not. Maybe we should stop and think about that for a minute. So, as we said, there's a lot going on in America, so it's the time to ask serious questions of America's leaders, maybe even the new Speaker of the House. CNN had a chance to talk to Nancy Pelosi yesterday. What did they ask? About her ice cream choices.",

Now, Pelosi is the highest ranking Democrat in the United States. She's the leader of her party. So, we should not blow this off. We should take it seriously. As a matter of policy, Democrats believe a Border wall is immoral. And that raises the question, what do they consider moral? Well American troops stuck forever in Syria, for one thing. That's just fine. Sex-selective abortions, paid for with tax dollars, can't get more moral than that. Antifa, rioting in the streets, all perfectly virtuous. And turns out, even walls can be moral under the right circumstances. They just can't protect America. Democrats gladly signed off on border defenses for Jordan, Tunisia and Israel, no problem, glad to do it. But here, on behalf of our own people? No. Americans don't deserve that. They're immoral for asking. Those are the parameters of their morality. So, what religion is this exactly? Joining us now to explain it is Archbishop Chris Hahn. He's an attorney, radio host, and former aide to Senator Chuck Schumer, and he joins us tonight. So, if you would, I think we've talked about this before. Nancy Pelosi has repeatedly called the wall immoral. And at first, I thought well, you know, she talks a lot, and I know the feeling, sometimes you misspeak. But this is a talking point. This is something she's saying intentionally as the leader, now officially, of your party. So, Democrats believe Border walls are immoral. What does that mean?"

Now they go to big cities, places like New York, San Francisco, Boston and, of course, Washington. In fact, those four cities accounted for the majority of the places last year's graduating class at Harvard went. Why? Because that's where the jobs are. Rural counties are shrinking. So that's a success for the cities, correct? But there is another side to it. Cities may have jobs for young people but they don't offer the life America used to be able to give children. Homes are much more expensive. Public schools are often awful, almost always awful. And if the jobs pay more, it's not enough to offset the rising cost of healthcare and servicing student loans. As a result of all this, something dramatic, and not very often noted, is happening in American cities. Even though that's where the young people live, nobody in the cities is having children. Birthrates are falling everywhere in America. But the most dramatic drop, by far, has been in urban areas. According to the CDC, from 2007 to 2017, birthrates in major cities fell by almost 20 percent. At this point, the City of San Francisco has more pet dogs than it has children. If this continues, if this trend persists, it doesn't matter how rich our cities get, or how many jobs they provide, if society can't reproduce itself, it has, by definition, failed. Our cities are failing by the most basic measure, and no one's paying attention. We are though. Well Bernie Sanders may run for president again this year. Before that campaign can even begin, the media are targeting him over deeds apparently committed in 2016. Not policy decisions made, but #MeToo matters. A series of New York Times reports accuses the Sanders Campaign of having a toxic sexist atmosphere, where women were routinely mistreated without any consequences. Asked about this recently, Sanders said he didn't know. He was busy trying to become president,"

Now, there's no indication, never was that the story the paper wrote was false. The problem with it was it offended powerful leaders in China. So, in the letter, The Times reportedly apologized for the \"Perception\" that the story had created about that totalitarian hellhole. Allie, is it I mean I -- I don't know what to say about this. I -- I don't want to believe this is true. But if it turns out to be the case that the publisher of The New York Times apologized to the fascist government of China for being rude, is there anything more craven than that?

Despite this, clearly a dereliction of duty, Peterson was not fired. He now draws over a $100,000 a year in a pension. Now, we have a hint as to why. Of course, Matt Finn is Fox's expert on Parkland.

The investigators on that Commission interviewed hundreds of people, and poured over massive amounts of evidence, and determined that that School Resource Officer, Scot Peterson's response was, \"Abysmal,\" and that law enforcement's response overall was a failure, and that the massacre would not have happened if the shooter Nikolas Cruz's mental health issues were adequately addressed. Also this week, the latest in a series of reports questioning how disgraced Parkland School Resource Officer, Scot Peterson, was able to retire with full benefits, a six-figure salary, even though he was caught on tape standing by outside, instead of rushing into the Parkland school to stop the shooter from murdering more students. A 2014 school incident report filed by that School Resource Officer, Scot Peterson, might hold the answer. The report indicates Peterson's boss, Broward County Sheriff, Scott Israel, had a son, who was a student at Stoneman Douglas, and according to the incident report, assisted in battery and, perhaps, sexual assault against a fellow student. Peterson called for the Sheriff's son to be suspended, instead of referring him for criminal prosecution, perhaps a favor, Sheriff Scott Israel never forgot. The parents of that student that was assaulted later said they were OK with law enforcement -- without law enforcement action because they felt it would have caused trauma to their son. Sheriff's Israel office confirmed that it received our request for a comment on the story. We did not hear back. Next week, Governor-elect Ron DeSantis will be sworn into office, and he has already indicated that he is considering suspending Sheriff Scott Israel. Tucker."

But in the body of the report, he described the felony as a misdemeanor to justify it to fit under the Promise Program, which would allow the Sheriff's son to skate any type of criminal prosecution or severe punishment, and he was allowed to be referred into the Promise Program, where he was then issued a three-day school suspension, instead of having a felony on his record, which would have -- should have been the outcome of that case."

    {

      "utterance": "Well there isn't just one drug crisis going on in America at the moment. There's one you read about a lot, drug overdoses, mostly by opioids, Fentanyl plays a big part. Those have been rising for years. They now kill more Americans every year than the entire Vietnam War did over a decade, so there's that. It's horrible and it needs more attention. But there's another drug crisis going on. It may not be as deadly, but it's worrying, and no one ever mentions it. At this moment, more than one in six American adults is on some kind of psychiatric drug. Among Americans over the age of 12, one in eight are taking antidepressants, a 65 percent increase compared to just 1999, 20 years ago. Among women, 16.5 percent are now on antidepressants. One in every six women in America is now taking a pill just to cope with feeling miserable. What is going on? After antidepressants, the most common psychiatric drugs are anti-anxiety medications like Xanax. These drugs are typically very addictive and abuse of them has soared along with the abuse of other opioids. Try to get off one of those benzo drugs, you can die from withdrawal. People do. But our frenzy for brain pills is hitting kids as well. Almost 10 percent of all American children are diagnosed with something called ADHD by the age of 17. Half of those kids, fully half, one in 20, overall nationally, take medication for it. And some of these drugs are very powerful, more than we may realize. One of the most famous anti-ADHD drugs is called Adderall. It's an addictive amphetamine. It's banned in Japan. It's rarely prescribed in Europe. But in America, millions of people have received diagnoses and received it. Since it can improve focus, there is an upside, Adderall is routinely abused by students to help with academic performance and also by adults to cope with demanding jobs. Forget using coffee to wake up in the morning, in this country, millions of people are taking amphetamines just to adequately service the market. Is this pill habit making the country happier? Is it making the country more sane? Of course, not. And the proof is in the numbers. The suicide rate is the highest it's been in half a century. It's still climbing. Among those who haven't taken their own lives, self-reported happiness is lower than it was a decade ago. This is particularly true in our country. This is not something that's happening worldwide. The OECD recently looked at antidepressant use in 25 wealthy countries, the U.S. was far ahead of every other except one, Iceland. Another study compared American children with German and Dutch kids. American children take three times as many psychotropic drugs to fight ADHD, three times as many antidepressants, about twice as many antipsychotic drugs. We don't have data for every country worldwide. But it seems possible that American children and adults are both the most medicated groups in the world. Why is this happening? And is the country doing anything about it? Well, to the extent the country is, we seem to be looking for another drug with a new high to fix our problems. Right now, legalizing marijuana is very popular. Lot of Republicans are behind it. The obvious downsides to this are suppressed. Politicians rave about the tax revenue. They're greedy. They always have been, always will be. While the advocates discuss the supposed medical benefits in medical marijuana, and there may be some, there probably are, but there are also downsides. Once it's legalized everywhere, we'll doubt we'll (ph) see some other illegal drug like Ecstasy or LSD touted as a fix for our country's problems. You're already seeing that with microdosing for LSD. At some point, you begin to wonder is it really America's brains that are sick or is there something bigger going on, maybe a problem with the society. Everywhere you look, things that make people happy seem to be vanishing. Americans report having fewer close friends. They're getting married less. They're having fewer children. Some are having no children because they can't in a lot of cases. They can't afford it. Their families are smaller and they live farther away. Confidence of government, also declining, so people feel like they lack control over their lives. Jobs confer (ph) less dignity if they can get them at all. Dramatic demographic change means many Americans don't recognize where they grew up. Their own towns are unrecognizable to them. Many can't relate to their own neighbors. Sometimes, they even can't understand the language. We're told that we're not supposed to worry about this. But, in real life, people do. And why wouldn't they? And then, of course, other physical problems, massive obesity ruining public health and causing misery as well. There's a lot of stuff going on. But the point is instead of trying to address these crises, politicians focus on economic growth rather than problems that caused all of this in the first place. Incomes in America more than doubled compared to 40 years ago, but are we better off? Probably not. Maybe we should stop and think about that for a minute. So, as we said, there's a lot going on in America, so it's the time to ask serious questions of America's leaders, maybe even the new Speaker of the House. CNN had a chance to talk to Nancy Pelosi yesterday. What did they ask? About her ice cream choices."

He always tweets about it. He tweets when I'm on too. So, that's really terrific that CNN's guy watches Fox. But, you have to understand, I know you get this, Tucker, so I don't want to sound, and I hope you didn't take that as condescending at all, but these are people who have grown up in Left-wing academia and have surrounded themselves with journalistic Left-wing media bubble types. I genuinely don't think, my friend, that they think any of this is unusual at all, like Nancy Pelosi is a good person just because she is. We've been indoctrinated around this Liberal nonsense for so long that it's the default position. Donald Trump is the automatic Skeletor to He-Man because we've been told that He-Man was the good guy the whole time. So, I don't really think they think there's anything unusual about that. They think, \"Oh, Nancy Pelosi, yes, this is great. The chocolate ice cream story, she's wonderful, you know, we should all do this, professionally make her look good because this is what we're supposed to do.\""

I think the last two decades we've seen a -- a genial -- general diminution of their credibility amongst the population in general. But I've always wondered, Tucker, from the start, in my last line of work, when I traveled around with a lot of media types, and you see them acting in their natural environment, you know, media people generally can't even do journalism like why are we taking their opinion on economics, healthcare economics, education, policy? None of this -- what makes them an expert, I'm really not sure. It's a serious question. If anyone in the media wants to tweet to me--"
