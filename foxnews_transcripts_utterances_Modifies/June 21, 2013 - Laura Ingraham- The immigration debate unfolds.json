Calls to their offices are overwhelmingly against the bill. But I have to say it looks like the fix is in, in the U.S. Senate. But I hope that House Speaker John Boehner is watching this drama carefully. Knowing that La Raza is co-directing this production he should announce that the House GOP is done with comprehensive immigration this year and simply pass a resolution urging President Obama to start enforcing the border to protect American prosperity and the national security interests. Republicans can then refocus the debate on helping increase the prosperity of all American workers - all legal immigrants and their families as well.   And that's \"The Memo.\"",
