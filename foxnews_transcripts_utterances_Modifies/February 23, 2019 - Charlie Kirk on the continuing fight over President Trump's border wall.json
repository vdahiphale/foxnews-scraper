Thanks so much for being with us. A big show on deck with a great guest lineup, including former Governor Mike Huckabee, David Bossie, Katrina Pierson, Jason Chaffetz, and Charlie Kirk to name a few and a lot to cover tonight as President Trump prepares to head overseas to Vietnam for his second historic summit with North Korea's Kim Jong-un, the crisis in Venezuela intensifying and Robert Mueller's sentencing memo on ex-Trump Campaign Chairman Manafort -- Paul Manafort is released.  And joining me now with reaction to a lot of the breaking news tonight and more, Florida Republican Congressman, Matt Gaetz. Congressman, thank you so much for being here.",

You'll remember that the Obama appointed Democratic Inspector General said that all of the major HR policies had been violated at the FBI and Department of Justice when you saw people move from the Hillary Clinton investigation on to the Robert Mueller investigation.  I think it's also important to note that when Peter Strzok and Lisa Page were texting one another about whether or not it would be a wise career move for Strzok to go and work for Bob Mueller, they said, there was no there, there. There was no evidence at all after 10 months of investigating of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. And now we see I think, a Special Counsel's team that includes a lot of people who are supportive of the Hillary Clinton campaign, who have supported Democratic candidates in the past, and as we look at the findings, we know that this is the result of tens of millions of dollars in taxpayer money that's been spent. But I believe it will take a very negative and unfair view of the President.",

And these elements with Paul Manafort largely arise either before Donald Trump ever contemplated running for President or so far after Paul Manafort's departure from the campaign that they couldn't be tied to the campaign. But you see, these themes with Manafort play out with other characters throughout this entire saga, whether it be Roger Stone, or George Papadopoulos, the process crimes are largely what drives the Special Counsel's activity, rather than being able to demonstrate any Americans who were conspiring with Russians and the Trump campaign in order to impact the outcome of the election or to steal e-mails from Hillary Clinton and her team. So I think that you largely see the Special Counsel trying to investigate people like Manafort like stone rather than actual crimes like collusion and obstruction of justice.",

He's a disruptive force in Washington for the Republicans and Democrats who in large part work together in an establishment coalition to keep everything the same in this country.

But it allows Nancy Pelosi to virtue signal to the radical left about their open borders, abolish I.C.E. agenda. I would be very disappointed to see Republicans break rank.   But at the same time, I mean, we have to acknowledge that this is an emergency. We just seized enough fentanyl at the border to kill 115 million Americans. That's more than a third of our country. And that's just what we caught, Katie. There is enough -- there are enough drugs and gangs and violent people crossing our border to do great harm to the families in the United States of America. And that's why this is an emergency. It's why the President has taken appropriate action and nothing about this vote will do anything other than signal to the far left of the Democratic base that Democrats still believe in open borders.",

They want to know, after all of this dust up, are there going to be some common sense solutions where both parties come together? Maybe make a little compromise and design an immigration system that works for the American economy and the American people?  Now, I thought Senator Lindsey Graham was really working hard to do that. He was trying to build a piece of legislation that would have secured our border, built the wall, dealt with the DREAMers in a way that was humane, but that did not invite more illegal immigration, and then even take a look at those citizens in our country who are here from temporary protected status, people who escaped war or natural disaster and to find a way for those folks to stay in our country if they follow the laws and if they act legally and properly. And so I think that there were people working on those things. But the barrier to the common sense reforms that most Americans would support is this -- really, I think, is this view on the left that we have to abolish I.C.E. Beto O'Rourke saying we have to tear down walls, that's the type of thing that really frustrates common sense progress.",

Thanks to you both for being here tonight.   Katrina, I want to start with you. President Trump won in part in 2016 because of his strong stance on the border, on national security and the rule of law when it comes to illegal immigration. This is not going away. How do you feel this is going to play when it comes to 2020?  KATRINA PIERSON, TRUMP 2020 SENIOR ADVISER: Well, you know, Katie, you're absolutely right. And I'll just piggyback off of what Representative Gaetz said about, you know, the messaging that Nancy Pelosi is sending by wanting to somehow stop the emergency action. But I'll take it a step further and say, you know, Nancy calls herself a masterful legislator. This is a messaging resolution not just to Democrats, though, but also to Republicans who still have not gotten the memo that you just spoke about, who still are not in touch with the base and get them on the record because she wants to add to her majority in the House and they want to take back some seats in the Senate.  And it's all on this false narrative that there's a manufactured crisis when just two months ago, they were all talking about the crisis we had on the border as the caravan was trying to rush through. There are more on the way.  We were just in El Paso, Katie and I spoke to several citizens who did not support President Trump and who did not support the wall, who all do not want the wall to come down in El Paso, and furthermore, they were dead silent when I asked them why their neighbors just 20 minutes from them did not deserve the same -- silence.",

But you know, Democrats and Republicans were for a wall/fence in 2006 with the 2006 Fence Act -- Chuck Schumer, Dick Durbin, even Barack Obama -- were on the Senate floor complaining that there actually wasn't enough fencing to secure the southern border. Barack Obama deployed National Guard troops. President Trump is sending a thousand more troops next week. What has changed now that the President is taking this situation a step further and taking it a little more seriously, and yet, here we are, with all of this opposition?",

The first of which, President Trump stole the base of the Democratic Party away from them, which is working class voters in the Midwest. So the Democrats have a serious political issue. And the only way they're going to try to make up for it is to try to continue the illegal immigration problem, which they turn a demagogue into a political issue, and they misrepresent it totally and make Republicans seem as if they're anti-immigration. And the second thing is just this hatred for Donald Trump. They simply oppose things just because the President is for them. And in short, they truly hate President Trump more than they want what's best for America. And it seems as if no matter what he poses, no matter what he puts forth, they are immediately and instantaneously and automatically in opposition of it. So those are two main things and a real applause for President Trump be able to really change the political makeup of this country and win states that Republicans hadn't won in 20 or 30 years, that's what I attribute the change in the illegal immigration debate tours in these recent couple of years.",

    {
      "speaker": "GAETZ",
      "utterance": "Well, when we receive the Special Counsel's report, I think it's very appropriate to evaluate it in context of how it was prepared and who prepared it. You'll remember that the Obama appointed Democratic Inspector General said that all of the major HR policies had been violated at the FBI and Department of Justice when you saw people move from the Hillary Clinton investigation on to the Robert Mueller investigation. I think it's also important to note that when Peter Strzok and Lisa Page were texting one another about whether or not it would be a wise career move for Strzok to go and work for Bob Mueller, they said, there was no there, there. There was no evidence at all after 10 months of investigating of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. And now we see I think, a Special Counsel's team that includes a lot of people who are supportive of the Hillary Clinton campaign, who have supported Democratic candidates in the past, and as we look at the findings, we know that this is the result of tens of millions of dollars in taxpayer money that's been spent. But I believe it will take a very negative and unfair view of the President."

      "speaker": "PAVLICH",
      "utterance": "We're certainly waiting on that report. We know now that it won't be released next week when the President is overseas. But I want to just point out that the sentencing memo talks about Paul Manafort violating a garden variety of crimes such as tax fraud, money laundering, obstruction of justice and bank fraud, but there's nothing in here that talks about, them worried about any kind of collusion just as the indictment showed before he went through a trial."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GAETZ",
      "utterance": "You're absolutely right. And these elements with Paul Manafort largely arise either before Donald Trump ever contemplated running for President or so far after Paul Manafort's departure from the campaign that they couldn't be tied to the campaign. But you see, these themes with Manafort play out with other characters throughout this entire saga, whether it be Roger Stone, or George Papadopoulos, the process crimes are largely what drives the Special Counsel's activity, rather than being able to demonstrate any Americans who were conspiring with Russians and the Trump campaign in order to impact the outcome of the election or to steal e-mails from Hillary Clinton and her team. So I think that you largely see the Special Counsel trying to investigate people like Manafort like stone rather than actual crimes like collusion and obstruction of justice."

But that's why I love our President so much. He's a disruptive force in Washington for the Republicans and Democrats who in large part work together in an establishment coalition to keep everything the same in this country. But the forgotten men and women of America wanted to see things done differently. That's why they elected Donald Trump and now you see the establishment of both parties fighting back and allowing these abuses at the FBI and Department of Justice to bias an investigation that never will be able to prove collusion because it didn't happen."

How Speaker Nancy Pelosi is rounding up Democrats to vote for a resolution against President Trump's national emergency. Some Republicans have said they are going to break ranks and vote with them to condemn the national emergency.

      "speaker": "GAETZ",

But it allows Nancy Pelosi to virtue signal to the radical left about their open borders, abolish I.C.E. agenda. I would be very disappointed to see Republicans break rank. But at the same time, I mean, we have to acknowledge that this is an emergency. We just seized enough fentanyl at the border to kill 115 million Americans. That's more than a third of our country. And that's just what we caught, Katie. There is enough -- there are enough drugs and gangs and violent people crossing our border to do great harm to the families in the United States of America. And that's why this is an emergency. It's why the President has taken appropriate action and nothing about this vote will do anything other than signal to the far left of the Democratic base that Democrats still believe in open borders."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAVLICH",
      "utterance": "Does Congress have any plans -- you're there, you're talking to your colleagues about doing something real on illegal immigration. We saw the funding bill which actually fuels this problem of the crisis of unaccompanied minors and family units and human trafficking at the border. But we see the resolution condemning the President's emergency declaration. Are there really any plans over the next two years to tackle this issue from a strictly illegal immigration perspective, not tied to a funding bill?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GAETZ",
      "utterance": "Well, that is the question that all Americans are asking, Katie. They want to know, after all of this dust up, are there going to be some common sense solutions where both parties come together? Maybe make a little compromise and design an immigration system that works for the American economy and the American people? Now, I thought Senator Lindsey Graham was really working hard to do that. He was trying to build a piece of legislation that would have secured our border, built the wall, dealt with the DREAMers in a way that was humane, but that did not invite more illegal immigration, and then even take a look at those citizens in our country who are here from temporary protected status, people who escaped war or natural disaster and to find a way for those folks to stay in our country if they follow the laws and if they act legally and properly. And so I think that there were people working on those things. But the barrier to the common sense reforms that most Americans would support is this -- really, I think, is this view on the left that we have to abolish I.C.E. Beto O'Rourke saying we have to tear down walls, that's the type of thing that really frustrates common sense progress."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAVLICH",
      "utterance": "Congressman, real quickly before we have to move on and let you go, you brought to the attention of the American people recently, something that House Democrats and the Oversight Committee actually voted against in terms of notifying I.C.E. when illegal immigrants or illegal aliens attempt to purchase guns in American gun stores. Can you quickly explain what that was about?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GAETZ",
      "utterance": "Yes, Democrats wanted to expand background checks and we were working on the elements of that legislation that we liked and didn't. We simply thought that if an illegal alien goes to buy a gun in this country that we should notify I.C.E. if the background check shows that and every single Democrat on the Judiciary Committee voted against notifying I.C.E. when an illegal alien wants to buy a gun to potentially do harm in our country. So it shows that like, they hate I.C.E. so much on the radical left, that they wouldn't even notify I.C.E. if an illegal alien would potentially commit a mass act of gun violence."

      "utterance": "All right, joining me now with more reaction to all of the developing news and more Trump 2020 senior adviser, Katrina Pierson and former Trump Deputy Campaign Manager, David Bossie. Thanks to you both for being here tonight. Katrina, I want to start with you. President Trump won in part in 2016 because of his strong stance on the border, on national security and the rule of law when it comes to illegal immigration. This is not going away. How do you feel this is going to play when it comes to 2020? KATRINA PIERSON, TRUMP 2020 SENIOR ADVISER: Well, you know, Katie, you're absolutely right. And I'll just piggyback off of what Representative Gaetz said about, you know, the messaging that Nancy Pelosi is sending by wanting to somehow stop the emergency action. But I'll take it a step further and say, you know, Nancy calls herself a masterful legislator. This is a messaging resolution not just to Democrats, though, but also to Republicans who still have not gotten the memo that you just spoke about, who still are not in touch with the base and get them on the record because she wants to add to her majority in the House and they want to take back some seats in the Senate. And it's all on this false narrative that there's a manufactured crisis when just two months ago, they were all talking about the crisis we had on the border as the caravan was trying to rush through. There are more on the way. We were just in El Paso, Katie and I spoke to several citizens who did not support President Trump and who did not support the wall, who all do not want the wall to come down in El Paso, and furthermore, they were dead silent when I asked them why their neighbors just 20 minutes from them did not deserve the same -- silence."

It does not mean anything except we get to put people on the record, which I appreciate because in 2020 when we go to reelect President Trump, we're going to be reelecting Republicans and Democrats and people who vote on the wrong side of this issue are going to be you know, in danger when it comes to 2020. So we're -- I'm excited about this vote. I want to see Republicans if there are any, and I want to see the Democrats put their money where their mouth is."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIERSON",
      "utterance": "Well, look, I mean, the President has already stated and many of us agree that this is essentially the greatest hoax on the American public. I mean, you have a guy that has unfettered power, unfettered access to funds. I do hope they include the amount of tax dollars that it costs once this report does come out. But the President is not concerned about this, Katie, because it has nothing to do with him. It has nothing to do with the campaign strategy. Donald Trump won this election. The left hates it. We are definitely in the age of hoaxes, apparently, all against Trump and Trump supporters. So again, the left is going to have egg on their face when this report comes out and the President once again will be vindicated. But this is not the first hoax and I'm pretty sure this will not be the last. I just hope that people start to pay a scriptwriter because not even Denzel could pull off some of the latest hoaxes we see out there."

Something that the world needs to have happen. This President is going over there to negotiate on behalf of all the American people. It's outrageous that Robert Mueller has not submitted this report and closed it down because the President doesn't deserve to go to this summit with this hanging over his head. This should be behind us, behind all Americans and the President should be able to do his job every day without worrying about this really ridiculous now charade of an investigation."

They want a legislation put on the Senate floor to protect the Special Counsel. Anytime the President or his supporters question Robert Mueller's motives or the people working for him, they were depicted as people who weren't interested in the truth. And now that Robert Mueller doesn't seem to be finding the collusion that Adam Schiff for example wants, they're now questioning the credibility and legitimacy of the Robert Mueller investigation and launching their own investigation with subpoenas ready to go."

Leader Kevin McCarthy, you know, tweeted several questions that he has for Adam Schiff, who has been claiming since the beginning that he has evidence of collusion, which by the way is not a crime. But here we are, again today, several months, probably two years now into this nightmare of a hoax on the American people. But I do think also that this investigation will see just how thorough it was because we also know that there was a campaign that was in fact colluding with foreign entities and a lot of people involved in the previous administration who were in an act of sedition, if you want my opinion on it, and I think that's what needs to come out of this investigation, too. If you're going to investigate collusion, let's investigate collusion and get on with it."

They want to get back to the business and that is what's important here. We're going to have a little bit of overreach in, my opinion. Congress is going to be able to see for themselves what the American people say, but Democrats in Congress are overreaching. They're going to be in danger. Once this Mueller report comes in, they're going to -- if they continue on this path, the boomerang effect is going to be there and it's going to benefit President Trump and he's going to be more successful in 2020 for their overreach."

His thugs in Venezuela had been burning aid trucks with medicine and food that are trying to come into the country on the Colombian border. The White House obviously is watching this very closely. Ambassador or former Ambassador John Bolton, National Security Advisor John Bolton tweeting, \"These four Venezuelan military members chose to stand with the people today. We were honored by their Commander-in-Chief, Juan Guaido and welcomed by the democratic world. The rest of the Venezuelan military should follow.\" What he's referring to is that there are now defections from the military which has been backing Nicolas Maduro at this point there now on the side of the President or the United States and democracies across the world are recognizing Juan Guaido, what is your response to the developments in Venezuela today?"

And ultimately, we see yet another rich nation turned into an impoverished nation because of socialism and corruption, you have to add that in. But we also see what a strong U.S. policy does. Even Jeb Bush today tweeted out commendation for President Trump's handling of the Venezuelan situation, and Jeb is no big supporter of President Trump. So I think that's very significant. But it's a very honest assessment. This wouldn't be happening if it weren't for the very strong policies toward freedom and encouraging the people of Venezuela to take charge and now we're seeing these defections. Katie, it is a seminal event there and it looks like it's unraveling in Venezuela against the regime."

What do you think the outcome is going to be here from a national security perspective for the United States, because it is getting very violent? Maduro doesn't seem like he's going to go there are defections from the military there. But it's a very serious violence situation that could get much worse."

Their economy is in the toilet. They don't want to live like this. They know what it was like when they had freedom and now they know what it's like under socialism and they're rejecting it. They're doing the same thing that people around the world have done and they're doing it at great expense and at great risk to themselves and their families, which show you the desperation of people who, having tasted freedom want to enjoy it yet again, and I hope that people will recognize that we're blessed to live in the United States. And frankly, we're very fortunate to have a President who doesn't just walk away and turn a blind eye to the horrors that are going on in the socialist Venezuela and is supplying help and assistance to try to get that freedom back for the people there."

But I'll tell you what I told your colleague, Harris, a few days ago. He has the same math problem he had in 2016. If not, it's probably worse. This is the first time we've had a record number of women, a record number of African-American candidates running and we have some strong candidates on the ticket. And if you look at places like South Carolina who ultimately decided on a nominee, many of the Democrats here in South Carolina have rejected the idea of Bernie Sanders and his some of his policies and positions. I think this socialism buzzword used by the right is because they want to make America scared again, because they have no agenda to put forth for the 2020 election."

We have some of them up on the screen here. You have Tulsi Gabbard, Julian Castro, Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, Klobuchar just got in there, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders -- do you think that they're really underestimating Bernie Sanders in the Democratic establishment considering how much money he raised and he's, I think a little bit upset that his socialist policies have kind of been hijacked, he's not really getting much credit for it out on the campaign trail."

If you look at the next candidate, which would be Senator Kamala Harris of California, she only raised about a million dollars. And if you look at Senator Elizabeth Warren, she only raised $300,000 in the 24 hours. So we should definitely look at this, but we shouldn't read too much into it because it's so early. We don't know who officially is all going to run. We are still waiting to hear former Vice President Joe Biden is going to get in the race as we've seen Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders seem to be the favorite, which is kind of ironic because the Democratic Party is the party of diversity, and therefore women and people of color, yet they're two front runners, Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden are older white men."

That's what all of the favorite candidates right now are running on that which is very dangerous, and it's not going to resonate with the American people, the working class support and as you mentioned, Antjuan, Bernie Sanders does have a problem with women voters, with minority voters, they're not going to come out to support him. And I wanted to answer your other question, which was which one of these candidates could beat President Trump? No one. You look at what is going on with the campaign. This is a well-oiled machine. They've been raising money since President Trump took office there. This is two years in the making. They've raised over $100 million. They have some $20 million in the bank. They have all of their ducks in a row. And also, if you look at what happened, the RNC passed a resolution that they would fully support President Trump in 2020. So we're not going to see this divided vicious primary that we're going to see on the Democratic side.

We saw them take the bait on Jussie Smollett. Kamala Harris, Cory Booker just got into that. Now, they don't really want to talk about it.

And look, the way I view it is no different than any other national emergency declarations that Presidents have done in the past, where there is a pressing need that is affecting the citizens of our country and he has it within his authority be able to solve that problem. And a porous southern border, this is something you and I have talked about so much, Katie is, having real impact on Americans. Whether it be the amount of fentanyl that is coming across the southern border or guns or drugs and what's most concerning also is the amount of children that are trafficked across the southern border. We don't talk enough about that. And this is his constitutional building authority to secure the southern border and look, he's also -- I mean, I'll totally challenge what Speaker Pelosi said, he is the promise keeper in chief. This is something he promised on the campaign trail. He went to Congress and got some startup funding for it, and now, he is using the 1970s era emergency declaration authority to be able to secure the southern border once and for all."

The first of which, President Trump stole the base of the Democratic Party away from them, which is working class voters in the Midwest. So the Democrats have a serious political issue. And the only way they're going to try to make up for it is to try to continue the illegal immigration problem, which they turn a demagogue into a political issue, and they misrepresent it totally and make Republicans seem as if they're anti-immigration. And the second thing is just this hatred for Donald Trump. They simply oppose things just because the President is for them. And in short, they truly hate President Trump more than they want what's best for America. And it seems as if no matter what he poses, no matter what he puts forth, they are immediately and instantaneously and automatically in opposition of it. So those are two main things and a real applause for President Trump be able to really change the political makeup of this country and win states that Republicans hadn't won in 20 or 30 years, that's what I attribute the change in the illegal immigration debate tours in these recent couple of years."

Can you tell us what happened leading up to that moment? Was there something that prompted this? Was there a confrontation prior to this video that was shot? What was going on here?"

      "utterance": "Yes, so we were just made aware of this a couple days ago, where we were doing an activism recruiting event at the University of California, Berkeley, with our Turning Point USA Chapter, just peacefully trying to recruit students. And we understand we're going to be in the ideological minority at UC Berkeley, but that doesn't mean you can't try and you can't keep on trying to grow your presence. And one of our activists there was met with physical confrontation actually, sucker punched right in the jaw there. And, and this is an unfortunate example of how violent the left has become, and put simply, the left hates the idea that there are other ideas and, you know, fighting on college campuses. We understand we're going to be in the ideological minority, but we never thought that we'd be met with physical confrontation and violence. It's a sad thing that this happened, but make a little bit news. I will be there next week, and we'll see what will happen and we're going to keep it very peaceful and I hope UC Berkeley does as well."

      "speaker": "PAVLICH",
      "utterance": "President Trump is standing his ground, refusing to allow an ISIS bride back into the country. Former Congressman and Fox News contributor, Jason Chaffetz joins me now to talk about it. So, Congressman, the attorneys for this woman who joined ISIS five years ago, went over to Syria, tweeted about killing innocence through the use of jihad. Her lawyers are saying that President Trump is the one who is denying her birthright citizenship. It was actually the Obama administration in 2016 that analyzed it and said that she doesn't actually have any kind of claim to birthright citizenship. Where are we on the story?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JASON CHAFFETZ, FORMER CONGRESSMAN",
      "utterance": "Well, she doesn't because her father was a diplomat. We don't recognize them as U.S. citizens and she made the elective choice to go from, you know, she was born in New Jersey but she was in Alabama and she got on a plane on her own volition and she went to Turkey and then she ended up -- next thing we know, she's fighting with ISIS and tweeting back to the United States for people to go drive by shootings. She advocated putting people in trucks and running them over on Fourth of July and Memorial Day. I mean, this is a sick, sick individual. She has been married a couple of times. She now has this 18-month-old that I read about, and she wants to come back to United States. But she shouldn't go back to United States. The President and Secretary Pompeo are exactly right, she should stay exactly where she is."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAVLICH",
      "utterance": "So her attorneys who are part of the Council on Islamic Relations, which also has ties to terrorism are arguing that the United States has an obligation to take her back and that she could maybe help us out by you know, going through therapy and talking to people about how not to become radicalized and that could be her debt to society. What's your response to that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHAFFETZ",
      "utterance": "Yes, I don't want to pay for that. I don't think anybody who's watching this program or lives in any part of this country should have to pay for that. If we want to put her at Guantanamo Bay, go ahead. But I'm not going to put her in Tampa Bay or some other place in the United States, and have this burden placed upon them for a conscious decision that she made to fight for the most radical group I can think of on the face of the planet. And as an adult, advocate the killing of Americans."

      "speaker": "PAVLICH",
      "utterance": "Right."

      "speaker": "CHAFFETZ",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAVLICH",
      "utterance": "Well, CAIR does, but moving forward on this and getting a little perspective on how we deal with this issue. She is not an American, according to the Obama administration in their analysis of it. But there are a number of Americans who did go to Syria, a number of Europeans who went to Syria and these people are now trying to come home. We still have Guantanamo Bay, but how do we deal with this issue, especially lawmakers on Capitol Hill?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHAFFETZ",
      "utterance": "Well, citizenship does matter and you deal with U.S. citizens differently than you do enemy combatants who may be coming from all different parts of the world. That's why Guantanamo Bay is so important, but again in this case, the ruling came down that she was not a United States citizen given her father's diplomatic status at the time that she was born. And I see no reason to bend on what the Obama administration ruling that they made."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAVLICH",
      "utterance": "Yes, I just find it interesting that they're trying to portray her as someone who is regretful of her decision. She left five years ago. She's back here five years -- she wants to come back five years, now, later, after the Caliphate has been crushed by the Trump administration. The timing seems to be a little suspicious. Last word real quickly."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHAFFETZ",
      "utterance": "She was quoted as saying that they were literally eating grass. Well, go ahead and keep eating that grass because when you advocate killing Americans, and you fight for ISIS, we don't need you here in the United States of America."
