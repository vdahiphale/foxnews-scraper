      "speaker": "DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES",
      "sentences": "Thousands of African-American citizens. The Democrat Party's war on cops has already led to surging homicides in Democrat-controlled cities, yet Biden supports imposing these failed policies nationwide. They ask him, what about nationwide? What about the fact that you just had your Democrat National Convention where, by the way, we had far many more viewers, millions and millions more than you? We had millions of more. I thought it was a great thing. Did anybody hear Herschel Walker that night? He talk about a good football player, he was some player, what a great guy; but all of them, everybody. First Lady did great, Ivanka did great, they all did - they did great. We had some incredible stories, some very sad stories when you look and see what happened. But Biden's plan is to appease the domestic terrorists, my plan is to arrest the domestic terrorists. Joe Biden is a weak person. He has always been a weak person. And that was in prime time and prime time was 25 years ago. And let me tell you, he's not old. I always defend him in this. I have friends that are 85, 89, 92, 95! And they are 100 percent. There is just something wrong with Joe. He is off. OK? He is off. And I have no problem saying it anymore when I watched thedisinformation, because this is not disinformation, this is fact. If he is elected, his radical supporters won't just be causing mayhem on the streets, they will be running to Department of Justice, Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Education, and most importantly, they will put many judges on the United States Supreme Court. We can't have that. We'll have a totally different country. Radical Left judges, and that has to do with your second amendment. It that has to do with right to life, it has the right to so many different things that will turn your world upside down, and they will have 1, 2, 3, or 4, whoever is the next president, hopefully that's going to be us, not me, us. It's us. But you know we put - I put, and think of this, by the end of the term, we will have approximately 300 brand new great federal judges, court of appeals judges, 300, which is a record, 300! Give or take a little tiny bit, but 300. Nobody thought that was possible. I want to thank President Obama. He left us 142 openings. Nobody gets left one opening. A federal judgeship is a big deal. Nobody gets left any openings. He gave us 142 openings. Thank you very much. What happened, they thought Hillary was going to win. So they didn't push it, and then they said wait a minute, these polls are getting a little close at the end. And they tried like hell to get some judges approved, but it didn't work. That's what happens. You got to go, and you have to act fast. You got to get it done, get it done, right, like we get things done like nobody has ever gotten it done. He was a great president, he was great. He left 142 judges for the Republicans. He was a great president, right? If you are of that side of the plate, if you are of that ideology and you had a president that left you 142 federal judgeships, I don't think you rate him as doing a good job. Hey, look at what happened in Iraq, look at what happened with ISIS, look at what happened with our military, look at what happened with our vets, our vets are better taken care of now than they have ever been in the history of our country. But never forget, they're coming after me because I am fighting for you. And that's true. That's true. And we are winning thefight and we are winning this election. This election, we are doing well. They refuse to say it, they refuse to say. And they hate to say it, it just drives them crazy. But that night, remember, they started off by saying, this will be a very short evening for Donald Trump. That was Donald Trump in those time. Now it's President Trump. I lost all my friends because of this position. I had friends, \"Hey, Don, let's go to dinner\". \"Okay, good, Richard. I'll go\". \"Hey, Don, let's go\". \"Okay, Larry, I'll see you later when we get a restaurant in New York\". Everybody was like nice and loose, you could have a great conversation, you don't want to know what we talked about. It's just none of your business, but we were loose. All of a sudden, I become president of the United States and these are a lot of - I know a lot of important people. I know - actually, the people I like the best are the people that are less successful, because it makes you feel so powerful. I always say, never go out with a successful person, you'll understand. But I know a lot of very successful people, very, very successful. And now they call me up, \"Mr. President, sir, would you like to get together sometime?\" I say, \"loosen up\", yes, \"call me Donald. You've known me for 30 years, call me Donald\". \"Oh, thank you so much. Thank you, Mr. President. I appreciate\". Now I lost all my friends because it's the respect for the office, let's face it. It's different. They used to be loose, they used to be great, you could sit back, I'm not a drinker, but you could sit back and have a drink, whatever the hell you are drinking. And now you can't do that anymore. You can't do it anymore. So, I have to rely on people in Congress to be my friends. And we just happen to have a couple tonight. And one of them who has been a great warrior, and he is doing a fantastic job. I just saw you on television, by the way, Bryan. Does everybody know? Bryan Steil. Bryan Steil, young, handsome, but a warrior. When the fake impeachment happened, it was a total fake, what did we finish up with the Republicans 197 to nothing right in the house. It was a fake impeachment. I got impeached over a perfect phone call of congratulations to the president of Ukraine, who I never met before, ok? I mean, if you're going to do something, at least know them a little bit, right? I never met him. And then they said it was eight times quid pro quo. That was Adam Schiff, shifty Schiff. And he went before Congress, and he repeated my conversation except that he made it all up. Remember, he repeated it and then I said, \"ah, fortunately, we had that whole thing essentially recorded\". I'm glad I did, but these are very deceptive, deceiving, sick people. And I said, \"Well, he lied, because there was no quid pro quo. It was a perfect conversation\". But by that time, it was too late, because they had already embarrassed themselves by doing it. And Nancy Pelosi was all set. She loved doing it, she - from day one, but she thought it was what Schiff said, when she saw the conversation, she said to her people, what the hell did you get me into? So they could've dropped it, but they said, let's give it a shot. So, we won and other than Mitt Romney, well, we lost a half of us, right? He's another beauty, Mitt Romney. He is a real beauty. He couldn't get elected dogcatcher, right now here in Utah. So, we have another great one, and he is really a friend of mine, he has been solid, he loves his country and he loves his state, Glenn Grothman. Glenn, thank you very much though. And a man who just got elected, and he is from an area that I know very well, we did very well, we got about big, bit, fat beautiful contract that produced lots of jobs. But he was taking a legend's place, so it's never easy to replace a legend, that's Duffy, in case anyone --. And he was running, and we did a lot of work for him and it was great. And he reacted very well under pressure. A lot of people don't react well under pressure. They choke, they choke. He was under a lot of pressure and he ended up winning by 18 points. And now he's your congressman, he's doing a great job. You got to vote for all of these people on November 3. Tom Tiffany. Tom? Thank you, Tom. And we have a great congressional candidate, Derrick Van Orden. Who is Derrick? Derrick, good luck. I hear good things, Derrick. You got my total support. I hear very good things. I can only support about - our records like 222-3. So, I don't like to have a loss and I support you 100 percent, you know that. You have my total endorsement. All right, I hear you. Fantastic. And your former congressman, who I hope is making a lot of money in the private sector, because he deserves it, especially his wife, Rachel, deserves it. She is fantastic, he is fantastic, because I know he's coming back into government in some form. He can come with us, he can stay here, he can maybe run for governor, or maybe do something. Sean Duffy. No, but he was the world champion, tree climber. And I love sports, right, anytime you are the world champion in anything but especially that. And I will never forget. I was asking about how was it? He said well, he broke his back numerous times, he broke a lot of bones. I said let me ask you a question, how much harder was it to go up the tree than down? He said it was easy going up, the hard part was coming down, because if he missed, that was where the danger was, right? That was where the danger. But many times, world champion, could you still do it today? A little bit heavier, he said. Could carry a little bit more weight. That's all right. That's not a good sign, right? And it was great job, we love having you Rachel. Thank you very much. You are a friend, Fox & Friends and plenty of other places, right? What a personality. What a personality Rachel has! She has been our friend from day one, I think from day one and a fantastic family too. Tonight, we're also praying for everyone in the path of Hurricane Sally, who are out there working very hard. We are working in Florida, and Alabama, and Georgia. We have (INAUDIBLE) we have everybody there. We just finished and I mean, take a look, we just went to Louisiana, Texas, we're getting hit some big hurricanes, but we have it under control really good. Our coast guard has been fantastic by the way, unbelievable, the bravery. They go into these storms, they go into these storms, I say how dangerous is it? Sir, it's very dangerous. I say, all right. They said, would you like to try it sometime? I said, at the moment, no thank you. I'll take a pass. I think they might have a problem with me doing it. But I will tell you, they are - in Texas, they saved 16,000 people two years ago, the coastguard, U.S. coast guard. I think there is no brand to me that has gone up more than the U.S. coast guard. So, it's great. Now we can welcome new ships. Those ships are all coming and nice new ones are built in (INAUDIBLE) most of them already are (INAUDIBLE) administration will be by their side through every step. We are working again very, very hard in thePanhandle. We love the Panhandle. It got hit hard. We spent the last four years reversing the horrible damage Joe Biden inflicted over the last 47 years. We passed record tax cuts and regulation cuts, nobody has ever done more, more than anybody else has ever done to keep our family, farms in the family. We virtually eliminated the unfair estate tax also known as the death tax. So if you die in a hundred years from now, and you have children who you love as opposed to children that you can't stand, is anybody here have children that they don't like or perhaps can't stand? Because if you do, don't listen to the rest of this. But if you have a family that you love and you have a small business or farm or whatever, they were being put out of business that have to go and borrow the money to pay the estate tax, the death tax. And it was a terrible thing. We got rid of it. So now you can leave your farm, your small business to your family. And just hope they remember you every once in a while. It's always a difficult situation, but it was, it was ruining farms. They would have to go out and sell the farm, they would have to go out and get partnerships, they would have to go out and borrow money from banks. And then all of a sudden, they are in foreclosure proceedings, and they've never done that before. They don't have to worry about that anymore. If you love your family, that's a big deal. They've been trying to get that. Sean, for what, 30 years they've been trying to get that, right? Especially for the farmers because it's that kind of a business. It's a great business, but it's day-to-day you have a bad crop, all of a sudden you can't pay interest and a loan to pay estate tax, right? They lose their farms, so we're not going to have that anymore. We achieved American energy independence for thefirst time, totally independent. We don't have to be in those faraway places unless we want to be. Biden pledged to abolish American oil, American jail, clean coal, natural gas. He said the fracking, I told you that. But we're not going to let him get away. We will be bringing that up on occasion. For 47 years, Joe Biden crushed the dreams of Wisconsin workers and enriched foreign countries. That's what happened. Before I got here, what was happening with Japan, and we pay our deep respects to Prime Minister Abe of Japan, a great friend of all of ours, a great friend of mine. He is going to be leaving office very soon, like in a matter of a day. And he was a great gentleman. He is a tough negotiator. I'll tell you that. They made very good deals against the United States, but he is somebody that's going to be missed. He's a great gentleman. He championed every special interest, Biden, every special interest. And he sold out on trade, he sold out like almost nobody ever before. Earlier this year, I kept my promise to American workers when we ended the NAFTA nightmare and signed a brand-new U.S., Mexico, Canada agreement into law. I saved the U.S. auto industry by withdrawing from the last administration's job killing catastrophe. The Trans-Pacific Partnership, if you ever hear that beauty, that would have really hit you. In 2017, I signed a historic executive order making government policy to Buy American and Hire American. And I'm watching this Biden, and he has got a sign in the front Buy American. I've been saying it for like 20 years, right? Where the hell has this guy been? They are actually accusing him of plagiarism. I also took the toughest ever action to stand up to China's rampant theft of Wisconsin jobs. And it's all jobs, but you got hit particularly hard. Biden has vowed to remove those tariffs and allow China to resume its pillaging. He wants to take the tariffs off that are paying us tens of billions of dollars a year. I thought like hell to keep him into the China deal and he wants to remove them. So, tens of billions of dollars, billions and billions, I gave it to the farmers, I gave it to a lot of people, but I gave most of it by far to the U.S. Treasury. He wants to take them off. So, let me just ask you just a very innocent question. There's a young man about four years old upfront, I think he could give the answer. Who do you think would like to have China, how do you think China would feel about this election? In one case, they pay billions of billions of dollars a month to the U.S., we never got ever $0.10 from China. In the other case, he said we're going to take them off. I think they might be inclined to go for sleepy Joe. This is like a dream for China. Joe Biden's agenda is made in China, my agenda is made in the USA. It's very simple.",

And what I am only struck by, because I have been a journalist for more than 35 years, and I've never seen a press core treat a president theway this president has been treated. And people get up in arms, they roar in outrage when I say that kind of thing and cast to some kind of Judas Iscariot, how could I betray the media by saying that? And of course, the response as always, well, Donald Trump did that to himself. But I just wasn't raised that way, right, I was raised that this is about the office of the president. This isn't just about Donald Trump. And from the beginning, the focus has always been, look at Donald Trump, look at all the terrible things he does and says, and how annoying he is. Just focus on him, and don't notice what we're doing in the meantime to your country. And that's pretty revealing, when you look at what is happening in many of these cities like Minneapolis, where the police have been defunded and in Austin where they are re-zoning single-family home areas, because they say that those are systemically racist. There's a lot of very quiet erosion of the principles upon which America was founded, that's been going on, while everyone has been so focused on whether Donald Trump is too tanned or not, or whether he said something that offended someone.",

It's less of a problem for Donald Trump, I think, and that he seems to thrive with a hostile media audience. But it's something that Republicans do need to think about, whether they will continue to allow themselves to be treated like second-class citizens by so many people in the media. It's also interesting that despite what the media are claiming about Donald Trump, you look at the headlines and the questions that they pick for these debates or whatnot, and they portray him as this evil monster who is a racist and whatnot. And yet at the same time, Donald Trump is doing better than he did in 2016 with various minority voters.

I mean they are walking through suburbs saying, out of your house, onto the streets. People are being attacked for the color of their skin. We are returning to a time in this country, which is, by the way, in the rearview mirror, it's seen as going backwards where the color of your skin is what defines you. And it concerns people. Quite honestly, Laura, it's so hypocritical that it's really quite nauseating. I have to agree with Mollie, it has become beyond reprehensible at this point. So if you imagine, if you are Democrat supporter now, you actually think that the violence in these cities is Trump's fault, that Russia collusion was really, even though Mueller didn't find evidence. And that everything of significance like guilty pleas from FBI attorneys for falsifying evidence, that none of that really mattered or was significant. And this is kind of the alternative universe that they have created for people who, if they're not looking for any outside view and they keep putting people forward like Adam Schiff who have lied and lied and lied.

So, let's see what happens with all of that stuff. I think Bill Barr is doing an excellent job. He is fighting a very bad establishment in Washington and there is some bad apples in that whole deal. But if you think that Biden opposed the mission to take out Osama Bin Laden, he was against it. He opposed to killing of Soleimani, he oversaw the rise of ISIS. What a mistake! And he cheered the rise of China as a very positive development for America and the world, but I don't think so. I don't think so and not been too positive. If we are up to sleepy Joe Biden, Bin Laden and Soleimani would still be alive, ISIS would still be on the rampage, and China would now be the dominant power in the world. And they are not even close, I will tell you. We have weaponry the likes of which nobody has seen, 2.5 trillion buys you some good stuff, especially when we have the finest scientific minds and military minds in the world. We have weapons, thelikes of which nobody has seen, and just hope to god we never have to use them. I say that, and I say it strongly. Hope that we never have to use them. My attitude was that and I have learned this a long time ago, by having them, we keep ourselves out of war as opposed to bringing ourselves into one. But we have built and created weapons thelikes of which this world has never seen before. And we don't have to talk about it too much, nor do I really want to talk about it. When I banned travel from China, Biden called it hysterical and xenophobic. He said he is xenophobic, what does that mean, Joe, tell me? Biden also opposed my plan to ban Europe, I saw what was happening in France and Spain and Italy and highly infected we banned Europe. If we had insisted and listened to Joe and insisted in doing what so many other people said to do, which is you don't have to do the ban, hundreds of thousands of more Americans would've died from the plague. Biden was willing to sacrifice American lives on thealtar of open borders. And now I hear him talking -- he should've followed me. You know, this guide did the swine flu, right. It was a catastrophe. And the man that headed up the swine flu, I won't use his name because I would like to have a nice evening, because I can't imagine theDemocrats are thrilled, he said it was a horrible job. We had no idea what we were doing. It was a disaster. He said it was a disaster. And now Biden is telling us how to do what we're doing so well on, what other countries are calling me and congratulating me on the incredible job. And I got sleepy Joe Biden trying to tell me how to do it. And his only man who headed in up, swine flu, its' H1N1 swine flu. Joe called N1H1. I keep saying Joe, Joe, it is H1N1, right?

I've been making documentaries, films, as most people know. I've got a new one, \"Trump Card,\" coming out next month. But I've been eager, and so my wife and I, my wife Debbie and I came up with the idea of doing a feature film, not a niche film for the Christian market or the conservative market, but a mainstream political thriller full of action that would confront issues that Hollywood would never touch. So Hollywood is really scared of radical Islam. If they ever feature a terrorist, it's typically some Russian or eastern Europe. It's la-la land, it's not even the real world. So we have a film, \"Infidel\" that is based on true events. It's based on a series of Americans who have been entrapped in radical Islam, captured, imprisoned in Iran. And we tell the story, which begins in Washington D.C. It takes you to Lebanon and it takes you to Cairo, and then on to Iran. It's starring Jim Caviezel who made \"The Passion of the Christ.\" It's very exciting, it's fun to watch. It's really a great film.",

      "utterance": "Thousands of African-American citizens. The Democrat Party's war on cops has already led to surging homicides in Democrat-controlled cities, yet Biden supports imposing these failed policies nationwide. They ask him, what about nationwide? What about the fact that you just had your Democrat National Convention where, by the way, we had far many more viewers, millions and millions more than you? We had millions of more. I thought it was a great thing. Did anybody hear Herschel Walker that night? He talk about a good football player, he was some player, what a great guy; but all of them, everybody. First Lady did great, Ivanka did great, they all did - they did great. We had some incredible stories, some very sad stories when you look and see what happened. But Biden's plan is to appease the domestic terrorists, my plan is to arrest the domestic terrorists. Joe Biden is a weak person. He has always been a weak person. And that was in prime time and prime time was 25 years ago. And let me tell you, he's not old. I always defend him in this. I have friends that are 85, 89, 92, 95! And they are 100 percent. There is just something wrong with Joe. He is off. OK? He is off. And I have no problem saying it anymore when I watched thedisinformation, because this is not disinformation, this is fact. If he is elected, his radical supporters won't just be causing mayhem on the streets, they will be running to Department of Justice, Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Education, and most importantly, they will put many judges on the United States Supreme Court. We can't have that. We'll have a totally different country. Radical Left judges, and that has to do with your second amendment. It that has to do with right to life, it has the right to so many different things that will turn your world upside down, and they will have 1, 2, 3, or 4, whoever is the next president, hopefully that's going to be us, not me, us. It's us. But you know we put - I put, and think of this, by the end of the term, we will have approximately 300 brand new great federal judges, court of appeals judges, 300, which is a record, 300! Give or take a little tiny bit, but 300. Nobody thought that was possible. I want to thank President Obama. He left us 142 openings. Nobody gets left one opening. A federal judgeship is a big deal. Nobody gets left any openings. He gave us 142 openings. Thank you very much. What happened, they thought Hillary was going to win. So they didn't push it, and then they said wait a minute, these polls are getting a little close at the end. And they tried like hell to get some judges approved, but it didn't work. That's what happens. You got to go, and you have to act fast. You got to get it done, get it done, right, like we get things done like nobody has ever gotten it done. He was a great president, he was great. He left 142 judges for the Republicans. He was a great president, right? If you are of that side of the plate, if you are of that ideology and you had a president that left you 142 federal judgeships, I don't think you rate him as doing a good job. Hey, look at what happened in Iraq, look at what happened with ISIS, look at what happened with our military, look at what happened with our vets, our vets are better taken care of now than they have ever been in the history of our country. But never forget, they're coming after me because I am fighting for you. And that's true. That's true. And we are winning thefight and we are winning this election. This election, we are doing well. They refuse to say it, they refuse to say. And they hate to say it, it just drives them crazy. But that night, remember, they started off by saying, this will be a very short evening for Donald Trump. That was Donald Trump in those time. Now it's President Trump. I lost all my friends because of this position. I had friends, \"Hey, Don, let's go to dinner\". \"Okay, good, Richard. I'll go\". \"Hey, Don, let's go\". \"Okay, Larry, I'll see you later when we get a restaurant in New York\". Everybody was like nice and loose, you could have a great conversation, you don't want to know what we talked about. It's just none of your business, but we were loose. All of a sudden, I become president of the United States and these are a lot of - I know a lot of important people. I know - actually, the people I like the best are the people that are less successful, because it makes you feel so powerful. I always say, never go out with a successful person, you'll understand. But I know a lot of very successful people, very, very successful. And now they call me up, \"Mr. President, sir, would you like to get together sometime?\" I say, \"loosen up\", yes, \"call me Donald. You've known me for 30 years, call me Donald\". \"Oh, thank you so much. Thank you, Mr. President. I appreciate\". Now I lost all my friends because it's the respect for the office, let's face it. It's different. They used to be loose, they used to be great, you could sit back, I'm not a drinker, but you could sit back and have a drink, whatever the hell you are drinking. And now you can't do that anymore. You can't do it anymore. So, I have to rely on people in Congress to be my friends. And we just happen to have a couple tonight. And one of them who has been a great warrior, and he is doing a fantastic job. I just saw you on television, by the way, Bryan. Does everybody know? Bryan Steil. Bryan Steil, young, handsome, but a warrior. When the fake impeachment happened, it was a total fake, what did we finish up with the Republicans 197 to nothing right in the house. It was a fake impeachment. I got impeached over a perfect phone call of congratulations to the president of Ukraine, who I never met before, ok? I mean, if you're going to do something, at least know them a little bit, right? I never met him. And then they said it was eight times quid pro quo. That was Adam Schiff, shifty Schiff. And he went before Congress, and he repeated my conversation except that he made it all up. Remember, he repeated it and then I said, \"ah, fortunately, we had that whole thing essentially recorded\". I'm glad I did, but these are very deceptive, deceiving, sick people. And I said, \"Well, he lied, because there was no quid pro quo. It was a perfect conversation\". But by that time, it was too late, because they had already embarrassed themselves by doing it. And Nancy Pelosi was all set. She loved doing it, she - from day one, but she thought it was what Schiff said, when she saw the conversation, she said to her people, what the hell did you get me into? So they could've dropped it, but they said, let's give it a shot. So, we won and other than Mitt Romney, well, we lost a half of us, right? He's another beauty, Mitt Romney. He is a real beauty. He couldn't get elected dogcatcher, right now here in Utah. So, we have another great one, and he is really a friend of mine, he has been solid, he loves his country and he loves his state, Glenn Grothman. Glenn, thank you very much though. And a man who just got elected, and he is from an area that I know very well, we did very well, we got about big, bit, fat beautiful contract that produced lots of jobs. But he was taking a legend's place, so it's never easy to replace a legend, that's Duffy, in case anyone --. And he was running, and we did a lot of work for him and it was great. And he reacted very well under pressure. A lot of people don't react well under pressure. They choke, they choke. He was under a lot of pressure and he ended up winning by 18 points. And now he's your congressman, he's doing a great job. You got to vote for all of these people on November 3. Tom Tiffany. Tom? Thank you, Tom. And we have a great congressional candidate, Derrick Van Orden. Who is Derrick? Derrick, good luck. I hear good things, Derrick. You got my total support. I hear very good things. I can only support about - our records like 222-3. So, I don't like to have a loss and I support you 100 percent, you know that. You have my total endorsement. All right, I hear you. Fantastic. And your former congressman, who I hope is making a lot of money in the private sector, because he deserves it, especially his wife, Rachel, deserves it. She is fantastic, he is fantastic, because I know he's coming back into government in some form. He can come with us, he can stay here, he can maybe run for governor, or maybe do something. Sean Duffy. No, but he was the world champion, tree climber. And I love sports, right, anytime you are the world champion in anything but especially that. And I will never forget. I was asking about how was it? He said well, he broke his back numerous times, he broke a lot of bones. I said let me ask you a question, how much harder was it to go up the tree than down? He said it was easy going up, the hard part was coming down, because if he missed, that was where the danger was, right? That was where the danger. But many times, world champion, could you still do it today? A little bit heavier, he said. Could carry a little bit more weight. That's all right. That's not a good sign, right? And it was great job, we love having you Rachel. Thank you very much. You are a friend, Fox & Friends and plenty of other places, right? What a personality. What a personality Rachel has! She has been our friend from day one, I think from day one and a fantastic family too. Tonight, we're also praying for everyone in the path of Hurricane Sally, who are out there working very hard. We are working in Florida, and Alabama, and Georgia. We have (INAUDIBLE) we have everybody there. We just finished and I mean, take a look, we just went to Louisiana, Texas, we're getting hit some big hurricanes, but we have it under control really good. Our coast guard has been fantastic by the way, unbelievable, the bravery. They go into these storms, they go into these storms, I say how dangerous is it? Sir, it's very dangerous. I say, all right. They said, would you like to try it sometime? I said, at the moment, no thank you. I'll take a pass. I think they might have a problem with me doing it. But I will tell you, they are - in Texas, they saved 16,000 people two years ago, the coastguard, U.S. coast guard. I think there is no brand to me that has gone up more than the U.S. coast guard. So, it's great. Now we can welcome new ships. Those ships are all coming and nice new ones are built in (INAUDIBLE) most of them already are (INAUDIBLE) administration will be by their side through every step. We are working again very, very hard in thePanhandle. We love the Panhandle. It got hit hard. We spent the last four years reversing the horrible damage Joe Biden inflicted over the last 47 years. We passed record tax cuts and regulation cuts, nobody has ever done more, more than anybody else has ever done to keep our family, farms in the family. We virtually eliminated the unfair estate tax also known as the death tax. So if you die in a hundred years from now, and you have children who you love as opposed to children that you can't stand, is anybody here have children that they don't like or perhaps can't stand? Because if you do, don't listen to the rest of this. But if you have a family that you love and you have a small business or farm or whatever, they were being put out of business that have to go and borrow the money to pay the estate tax, the death tax. And it was a terrible thing. We got rid of it. So now you can leave your farm, your small business to your family. And just hope they remember you every once in a while. It's always a difficult situation, but it was, it was ruining farms. They would have to go out and sell the farm, they would have to go out and get partnerships, they would have to go out and borrow money from banks. And then all of a sudden, they are in foreclosure proceedings, and they've never done that before. They don't have to worry about that anymore. If you love your family, that's a big deal. They've been trying to get that. Sean, for what, 30 years they've been trying to get that, right? Especially for the farmers because it's that kind of a business. It's a great business, but it's day-to-day you have a bad crop, all of a sudden you can't pay interest and a loan to pay estate tax, right? They lose their farms, so we're not going to have that anymore. We achieved American energy independence for thefirst time, totally independent. We don't have to be in those faraway places unless we want to be. Biden pledged to abolish American oil, American jail, clean coal, natural gas. He said the fracking, I told you that. But we're not going to let him get away. We will be bringing that up on occasion. For 47 years, Joe Biden crushed the dreams of Wisconsin workers and enriched foreign countries. That's what happened. Before I got here, what was happening with Japan, and we pay our deep respects to Prime Minister Abe of Japan, a great friend of all of ours, a great friend of mine. He is going to be leaving office very soon, like in a matter of a day. And he was a great gentleman. He is a tough negotiator. I'll tell you that. They made very good deals against the United States, but he is somebody that's going to be missed. He's a great gentleman. He championed every special interest, Biden, every special interest. And he sold out on trade, he sold out like almost nobody ever before. Earlier this year, I kept my promise to American workers when we ended the NAFTA nightmare and signed a brand-new U.S., Mexico, Canada agreement into law. I saved the U.S. auto industry by withdrawing from the last administration's job killing catastrophe. The Trans-Pacific Partnership, if you ever hear that beauty, that would have really hit you. In 2017, I signed a historic executive order making government policy to Buy American and Hire American. And I'm watching this Biden, and he has got a sign in the front Buy American. I've been saying it for like 20 years, right? Where the hell has this guy been? They are actually accusing him of plagiarism. I also took the toughest ever action to stand up to China's rampant theft of Wisconsin jobs. And it's all jobs, but you got hit particularly hard. Biden has vowed to remove those tariffs and allow China to resume its pillaging. He wants to take the tariffs off that are paying us tens of billions of dollars a year. I thought like hell to keep him into the China deal and he wants to remove them. So, tens of billions of dollars, billions and billions, I gave it to the farmers, I gave it to a lot of people, but I gave most of it by far to the U.S. Treasury. He wants to take them off. So, let me just ask you just a very innocent question. There's a young man about four years old upfront, I think he could give the answer. Who do you think would like to have China, how do you think China would feel about this election? In one case, they pay billions of billions of dollars a month to the U.S., we never got ever $0.10 from China. In the other case, he said we're going to take them off. I think they might be inclined to go for sleepy Joe. This is like a dream for China. Joe Biden's agenda is made in China, my agenda is made in the USA. It's very simple."

And what I am only struck by, because I have been a journalist for more than 35 years, and I've never seen a press core treat a president theway this president has been treated. And people get up in arms, they roar in outrage when I say that kind of thing and cast to some kind of Judas Iscariot, how could I betray the media by saying that? And of course, the response as always, well, Donald Trump did that to himself. But I just wasn't raised that way, right, I was raised that this is about the office of the president. This isn't just about Donald Trump. And from the beginning, the focus has always been, look at Donald Trump, look at all the terrible things he does and says, and how annoying he is. Just focus on him, and don't notice what we're doing in the meantime to your country. And that's pretty revealing, when you look at what is happening in many of these cities like Minneapolis, where the police have been defunded and in Austin where they are re-zoning single-family home areas, because they say that those are systemically racist. There's a lot of very quiet erosion of the principles upon which America was founded, that's been going on, while everyone has been so focused on whether Donald Trump is too tanned or not, or whether he said something that offended someone."

It's less of a problem for Donald Trump, I think, and that he seems to thrive with a hostile media audience. But it's something that Republicans do need to think about, whether they will continue to allow themselves to be treated like second-class citizens by so many people in the media. It's also interesting that despite what the media are claiming about Donald Trump, you look at the headlines and the questions that they pick for these debates or whatnot, and they portray him as this evil monster who is a racist and whatnot. And yet at the same time, Donald Trump is doing better than he did in 2016 with various minority voters.

We are returning to a time in this country, which is, by the way, in the rearview mirror, it's seen as going backwards where the color of your skin is what defines you. And it concerns people. Quite honestly, Laura, it's so hypocritical that it's really quite nauseating. I have to agree with Mollie, it has become beyond reprehensible at this point. So if you imagine, if you are Democrat supporter now, you actually think that the violence in these cities is Trump's fault, that Russia collusion was really, even though Mueller didn't find evidence. And that everything of significance like guilty pleas from FBI attorneys for falsifying evidence, that none of that really mattered or was significant. And this is kind of the alternative universe that they have created for people who, if they're not looking for any outside view and they keep putting people forward like Adam Schiff who have lied and lied and lied. Peter Strzok, John Brennan, they let them comment on the things in which they are complicit and if possibly broken the law and it's really quite astonishing. But in spite of all of that, Mollie is right, I mean, people are just not falling for it. It's really thanks to a group of young reporters out there risking their lives on the frontlines of Antifa's war against America, who that we know the truth about so many of the things that are happening on those streets, because honestly the media and many of those places are not doing their jobs.

So, let's see what happens with all of that stuff. I think Bill Barr is doing an excellent job. He is fighting a very bad establishment in Washington and there is some bad apples in that whole deal. But if you think that Biden opposed the mission to take out Osama Bin Laden, he was against it. He opposed to killing of Soleimani, he oversaw the rise of ISIS. What a mistake! And he cheered the rise of China as a very positive development for America and the world, but I don't think so. I don't think so and not been too positive. If we are up to sleepy Joe Biden, Bin Laden and Soleimani would still be alive, ISIS would still be on the rampage, and China would now be the dominant power in the world. And they are not even close, I will tell you. We have weaponry the likes of which nobody has seen, 2.5 trillion buys you some good stuff, especially when we have the finest scientific minds and military minds in the world. We have weapons, thelikes of which nobody has seen, and just hope to god we never have to use them. I say that, and I say it strongly. Hope that we never have to use them. My attitude was that and I have learned this a long time ago, by having them, we keep ourselves out of war as opposed to bringing ourselves into one. But we have built and created weapons thelikes of which this world has never seen before. And we don't have to talk about it too much, nor do I really want to talk about it. When I banned travel from China, Biden called it hysterical and xenophobic. He said he is xenophobic, what does that mean, Joe, tell me? Biden also opposed my plan to ban Europe, I saw what was happening in France and Spain and Italy and highly infected we banned Europe. If we had insisted and listened to Joe and insisted in doing what so many other people said to do, which is you don't have to do the ban, hundreds of thousands of more Americans would've died from the plague. Biden was willing to sacrifice American lives on thealtar of open borders. And now I hear him talking -- he should've followed me. You know, this guide did the swine flu, right. It was a catastrophe. And the man that headed up the swine flu, I won't use his name because I would like to have a nice evening, because I can't imagine theDemocrats are thrilled, he said it was a horrible job. We had no idea what we were doing. It was a disaster. He said it was a disaster. And now Biden is telling us how to do what we're doing so well on, what other countries are calling me and congratulating me on the incredible job. And I got sleepy Joe Biden trying to tell me how to do it. And his only man who headed in up, swine flu, its' H1N1 swine flu. Joe called N1H1. I keep saying Joe, Joe, it is H1N1, right?

The emails show that the office of Mayor John Cooper, a Democrat, hid data that undermined the rationale for keeping the city locked down, namely, that contact tracers were only able to link a small, small fraction of COVID cases to bars and restaurants, of course, that have been destroyed in Nashville. Only 22 out of thousands of cases were tied to bars and restaurants. Now, despite knowing this inconvenient truth as early as June 30th, the mayor still issued even stricter lockdown measures ahead of the July 4th weekend.

Yet he had theinformation at his fingertips that told him Broadway and the music scene is not what's creating the COVID-19 problem in Nashville. But yet he decided not to display that information to us, and instead, week after week lied to us and kept it under control, brought this town to its knees to try to put us into submission, thinking that his elitist arrogance could overcome a bunch of dumb country hicks that live in this town, and that he could override us with his will.

So Hollywood is really scared of radical Islam. If they ever feature a terrorist, it's typically some Russian or eastern Europe. It's la-la land, it's not even the real world. So we have a film, \"Infidel\" that is based on true events. It's based on a series of Americans who have been entrapped in radical Islam, captured, imprisoned in Iran. And we tell the story, which begins in Washington D.C. It takes you to Lebanon and it takes you to Cairo, and then on to Iran.
