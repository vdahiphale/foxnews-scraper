It started Sunday, then Monday the flag went back up, and then by Monday afternoon after some hubbub, it came back down after an order was issued. The president putting out a statement after being asked numerous times to comment, he did not, then put out, issued a statement, \"Despite our differences on policy and politics, I respect Senator John McCain's service to our country and in his honor have signed a proclamation to fly the flag of the United States at half-staff until the day of his interment. I have asked Vice President Mike Pence to offer an address at the ceremony honoring Senator McCain at the United States' Capitol this Friday.  At the request of the McCain family I have also authorized military transportation of Senator McCain's remains from Arizona to Washington, D.C., military pallbearers and a band support, and a horse and caisson transport during the service at the United States Naval Academy.   Finally, I've asked General John Kelly, Secretary James Mattis, and Ambassador John Bolton to represent my administration at his services.\" Our friend Amy Walter just tweeted, \"The amount of attention national media is paying to the Trump snub of McCain is disproportionate by a degree of 10 the amount voters care about this issue.\" So let's bring in our panel: Tom Rogan, commentary writer for the Washington Examiner; Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at The Federalist; and Charles Lane, opinion writer for The Washington Post.

The president, though, I don't think was doing that out of nowhere or in a personal -- it was personal, but it wasn't only meant personally. The president is really trying to remake this Republican party ideologically away from many of the things John McCain represented, in particular a compromise on immigration, the internationalism on foreign policy, and so there was always that connection between the policy and the personal.

I think it is worth noting that the McCain family had, or Senator McCain had requested President Trump not be at the funeral. And that is a very reasonable request for him to make. I think that what you see from the White House is an attempt partially to not be involved too much in the very appropriate ceremonies that are going to taking place here.
