Also tonight, the Republicans in the Senate are standing firm, as we were just talking about, Hannity and I, and they're signaling Trump's impeachment is DOA. Senator Rick Scott and Congressman Jim Jordan are here on the big Democrat backfire.  Plus, Doctors Fauci and Birxs have now embarked on a whirlwind rehab tour. Dr. Scott Atlas, the recipient of their finger pointing responds exclusively tonight.  But first, \"Biden's Race to the Bottom,\" that's the focus of tonight's Angle.  A long, long time ago, Joe Biden was against using executive orders to ram through what is properly left to the legislature.",

At times, it seems right that they understand more about the goodness, the promise and the opportunities of America than the vengeful native born leftists churning out race based executive orders for Biden. So you have to ask yourself, how did we get here? Well, for decades, radical academics have been teaching students to believe that white privilege is a greater threat to us than the CCP, Islamic terror, the former Soviet Union, unemployment, and certainly any virus.  And now giddy with a compliant Biden in the White House, they now want those who disagree to be shamed, reeducated punished, and in the case of Trump supporters, purged completely from society, I am not exaggerating that.  There'll be no end to the demands of these racial rabble rousers. I'm talking hundreds of billions if not trillions in new spending. They believe that dangling the prospect of reparations will obscure the fact that their policies, just to name a few, open borders and the offshoring of jobs, will make impoverished and working class Americans of all races poorer and left safe.

Now, why did Susan Rice as National Security Adviser sign on to sending our troops abroad to die for this country? Why would a rotten racist evil country be worth defending? Why would we want our systemically racist values to be exploited abroad? Now, let's face it, the Democrats know all too well that Trump grew his political support among all minorities, especially Latinos and Asians. Why did he do this? Because his policies delivered record low unemployment for Blacks and Hispanics, household income grew for all races and ethnicities.  But the Left has never been serious about growing the economy, has it? Biden has already killed thousands of good paying jobs with this attack on our energy sector. Nice go and Joe. Soon, companies are going to be moving once again jobs back to China and other countries to avoid his smothering regulations and crippling taxes. But Biden's handlers think they can still keep minority voters on the hook with identity politics, virtue signaling, diversity quotas, and the pipe dream of reparations. It's so cynical, and more than that, it's so insulting.   Like Biden's reported disdain for executive orders, this is all a fraud. It's a cruel hoax. It's cruel, both to minorities, and to the overwhelmingly good people who make up our American family. We on the Laura Ingraham - I keep saying Laura Ingraham show, \"The Ingraham Angle,\" we're going to continue to answer their twisted and poisonous claims.  And we'll do it with facts, love, patriotism and sometimes, yes - well, all the time, prayer, because unlike them, we haven't given up on America, and that's The Angle. Joining me now is Dr. Ben Carson, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary. Dr. Carson, your reaction, today's executive actions and Susan Rice's announcement of them. DR. BEN CARSON, FORMER SECRETARY OF HOUSING & URBAN DEVELOPMENT: Well, it's pretty amazing how people try to frame everything racially, and how they create divisions among our society.   I grew up in the 50s, and 60s, and I can tell you what real racism was like. It was an everyday event. The world is very different here in America right now. And, to use race as a mechanism to obtain power and position, I think it's really quite shameful. And in fact, race relationships have deteriorated? Why have they deteriorated? Because of the great emphasis, trying to create white guilt and black victimhood, those are two very bad things and when you put them together, it results in some policies that absolutely make no sense. So the real conflict here is between common sense and idiocy. That's what's really going on.",

While Wall Street profits off America's decline, you're going to be saddled with less income, higher taxes, higher energy prices, more crime, rolling lockdowns. But don't worry, Biden says there'll be millions and millions of green jobs to go around. They're never going to go to China though. Right? Joining me now is Newt Gingrich, former Speaker of the House, Fox News Contributor. Newt, Biden's busy tying down our own economy and military, while giving China, it looks like, free rein?",

When President Biden kills the pipeline, he creates more - almost a guarantee that the Canadians will now build the pipeline to the Pacific rather than to Texas. And when they go to the Pacific, they're going to sell Canadian oil and gas to the Chinese. The Chinese are thrilled that we're rejoining the Paris Peace Accords, because it was written to be totally pro-China and anti-American. It kills American jobs in return for a Chinese promise that someday in the future, maybe they will do something good. When he rejoins - when Biden rejoins the World Health Organization, he's rejoining an organization dominated by the Chinese, an organization which lied about the Chinese virus, COVID-19, which is a Chinese virus. And so once again, he puts the Chinese in charge.  President Xi's idea of multilateralism is a series of organizations, which the Chinese have been working very effectively to dominate and they're thrilled to convince us that we should be sort of their junior partners. Meanwhile, the Europeans, led by Chancellor Merkel, who you just heard a second ago, have signed a trade agreement with Beijing, which is remarkably anti-American, remarkably, pro-Chinese was driven through by the German Chancellor, and it's really almost a declaration that the Europeans would rather live in a world dominated by China than a world led by the United States.",

Now, according to Biden, you're a racist if you call it the Wuhan virus, understand? Write that down. Now, if you believe America is hopelessly racist, it's an irredeemable place, something must be wrong with our evil founders. Thus, Biden had to officially renounce any prior efforts to establish patriotic education and eliminate Trump's race blind approach to workplace training."

A discussion of the wonders of the American founding is now - I guess, he said, the words in Biden's view, a lie. So if you now believe what most of us were taught in school, that our founding fathers were brilliant, heroic men, no one's perfect, they made mistakes. They all had flaws, some big flaws. But if you thought they were brilliant, heroic men, you're ignorant. And if you praise the wisdom of the framers, you're a liar and probably a racist. Does Biden now renounce then his own Catholic education, his teachers, his professors, who celebrated, for instance, the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, as well as the men who signed them? The 1776 Commission understood that America is a great nation that nevertheless made some grave errors. Today's Left inverts that belief, insisting that we're a gravely evil nation that only occasionally does some good things, like elect Obama and Biden."

Now, I've had the privilege of getting to know many of these hard working and grateful new Americans, and they're from everywhere from Africa, Central America beyond. At times, it seems right that they understand more about the goodness, the promise and the opportunities of America than the vengeful native born leftists churning out race based executive orders for Biden. So you have to ask yourself, how did we get here? Well, for decades, radical academics have been teaching students to believe that white privilege is a greater threat to us than the CCP, Islamic terror, the former Soviet Union, unemployment, and certainly any virus. And now giddy with a compliant Biden in the White House, they now want those who disagree to be shamed, reeducated punished, and in the case of Trump supporters, purged completely from society, I am not exaggerating that. There'll be no end to the demands of these racial rabble rousers. I'm talking hundreds of billions if not trillions in new spending. They believe that dangling the prospect of reparations will obscure the fact that their policies, just to name a few, open borders and the offshoring of jobs, will make impoverished and working class Americans of all races poorer and left safe. But never fear, the woman who lied repeatedly about Benghazi will write all wrongs by assuming that if you're white, and you succeeded at something, it must be because you robbed someone else of a more deserving opportunity."

Now, why did Susan Rice as National Security Adviser sign on to sending our troops abroad to die for this country? Why would a rotten racist evil country be worth defending? Why would we want our systemically racist values to be exploited abroad? Now, let's face it, the Democrats know all too well that Trump grew his political support among all minorities, especially Latinos and Asians. Why did he do this? Because his policies delivered record low unemployment for Blacks and Hispanics, household income grew for all races and ethnicities. But the Left has never been serious about growing the economy, has it? Biden has already killed thousands of good paying jobs with this attack on our energy sector. Nice go and Joe. Soon, companies are going to be moving once again jobs back to China and other countries to avoid his smothering regulations and crippling taxes. But Biden's handlers think they can still keep minority voters on the hook with identity politics, virtue signaling, diversity quotas, and the pipe dream of reparations. It's so cynical, and more than that, it's so insulting. Like Biden's reported disdain for executive orders, this is all a fraud. It's a cruel hoax. It's cruel, both to minorities, and to the overwhelmingly good people who make up our American family. We on the Laura Ingraham - I keep saying Laura Ingraham show, \"The Ingraham Angle,\" we're going to continue to answer their twisted and poisonous claims. And we'll do it with facts, love, patriotism and sometimes, yes - well, all the time, prayer, because unlike them, we haven't given up on America, and that's The Angle. Joining me now is Dr. Ben Carson, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary. Dr. Carson, your reaction, today's executive actions and Susan Rice's announcement of them. DR. BEN CARSON, FORMER SECRETARY OF HOUSING & URBAN DEVELOPMENT: Well, it's pretty amazing how people try to frame everything racially, and how they create divisions among our society. I grew up in the 50s, and 60s, and I can tell you what real racism was like. It was an everyday event. The world is very different here in America right now. And, to use race as a mechanism to obtain power and position, I think it's really quite shameful. And in fact, race relationships have deteriorated? Why have they deteriorated? Because of the great emphasis, trying to create white guilt and black victimhood, those are two very bad things and when you put them together, it results in some policies that absolutely make no sense. So the real conflict here is between common sense and idiocy. That's what's really going on."

America is full of very good people, the vast majority of Americans are decent individuals. They will extend a helping hand to anyone who is in need, including their neighbors. They don't ask if you're a Democrat or Republican. But we have a political class and a media that does nothing, but specialize and stirring up anger and stirring up resentment. And I guess that makes them feel powerful and makes them feel needed. I would appeal to them to maybe listen to their better angels. This is a time when we can make tremendous progress. Everybody's talking about unity and working together. Let's actually do that. We create our own problems.

We're very concerned about housing and have removed many of the obstacles particularly for minorities, because it's the primary mechanism for wealth creation in this country. The average home owner is worth $200,000, the average renter is worth $5,000. Obviously, we want to change that dynamic, we need to work on the policies that will allow that to be done.

Now, the film projects are intended for audience of all ages, and will include a cartoon series called \"Antiracist Baby\" aimed at well, brainwashing preschoolers. So how are parents supposed to fight back against this insidious propaganda? Joining me now is Libby Emmons, Senior Contributor at \"The Federalist\" and Senior Editor at the \"Post Millennial.\" Libby, it's obvious that you can just cancel Netflix, but this is slowly taking hold of every institution and we see it in the curricula of our junior high schools, our high schools and increasingly our elementary schools.

And it's going to be directed by the person who did Doc McStuffins, which was a great show. But \"Antiracist Baby\" directs toddlers to confess their racism. And I think also, in putting these kinds of programming, feeding it to toddlers and little kids, we're teaching kids that the only way to look at the world is through a lens of race. We're teaching them that race is the most important factor about a person, that there are things you can tell and understand about a person based on looking at their racial - their skin color or--"

I think the idea is that white people are complicit for the racist sins of their ancestors, and that every white kid is responsible for this history and it's just not reasonable and it goes completely against everything that we were taught by the civil rights movement. In fact, Kendi has a big grant right now that I think was given to him by Jack Dorsey at Boston University, which is where Martin Luther King went to school himself. And this completely undoes King's legacy. It's just a reversal of everything that we understand about equality. We know that we were created equal under God. We know that there are no things that you can tell about a person based on looking at them. We all learned that you don't judge a book by its cover. And here we are being told to do exactly that. Not only to do that to others, but to do that to ourselves, to look at ourselves and say that for some reason, our skin color is definitive in some way."

And when they go to the Pacific, they're going to sell Canadian oil and gas to the Chinese. The Chinese are thrilled that we're rejoining the Paris Peace Accords, because it was written to be totally pro-China and anti-American. It kills American jobs in return for a Chinese promise that someday in the future, maybe they will do something good. When he rejoins - when Biden rejoins the World Health Organization, he's rejoining an organization dominated by the Chinese, an organization which lied about the Chinese virus, COVID-19, which is a Chinese virus. And so once again, he puts the Chinese in charge. President Xi's idea of multilateralism is a series of organizations, which the Chinese have been working very effectively to dominate and they're thrilled to convince us that we should be sort of their junior partners. Meanwhile, the Europeans, led by Chancellor Merkel, who you just heard a second ago, have signed a trade agreement with Beijing, which is remarkably anti-American, remarkably, pro-Chinese was driven through by the German Chancellor, and it's really almost a declaration that the Europeans would rather live in a world dominated by China than a world led by the United States."

So their view is they can afford to tear America apart. Take, for example, what the teachers unions are doing. If you want to guarantee that the Chinese are going to dominate the future, make sure that young American children don't get to go to school.

That includes things like early voting, same-day registration, and universal mail-in ballots. Those will be easy to verify. Joining us with reaction, Jim Jordan, ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee. Congressman, the Dems reply to a lack of trust in our elections by putting the federal government in charge? Taking away from the states?"

      "speaker": "REP. JIM JORDAN, (R-OH) RANKING MEMBER, HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE",
      "utterance": "Yes. They're going to make it worse. They want not only all the things that you just said, Laura, they want tax dollars to pay for the campaigns, and also including in that is you get the candidate running for office gets their child care paid for, gets health insurance paid for, for them and their staff. So such a deal. First they're going to let felons vote. They're going to have mail-in ballot universal. And then they're going to have you, the taxpayer, pay for the campaign itself. So such a deal for the taxpayer."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "What's the Republican plan to combat this? This is what I'm saying. Before the last election, everyone was talking about mail-in ballots, and there was not really a successful effort to rein in the abuses of lack of verification, and so forth."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JORDAN",
      "utterance": "This is real important. Here's what the Democrats did in the last election. They knew they couldn't beat President Trump without changing the rules, so at the last minute they changed the rules. But because they didn't control state legislatures in key states, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Georgia, they had to do it in an unconstitutional fashion. So they had partisan, Democrat-controlled supreme courts, Democrat secretaries of states. In Pennsylvania, the partisan supreme court said even though the law in Pennsylvania written by the legislature said Election Day ends at 8:00 Tuesday night, the supreme court said we're going to extended three days. It's going to end 5:00 on Friday. So they made all these changes. So the only way to beat it back is you have to elect Republican governors in those key swing states and make sure that constitutionally it is done in a constitutional fashion by the state legislatures. So we've got to win governorships in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, and make sure we can change it back to a fair election like it has always been in our country."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "They are really afraid that Trump is going to run again and win, aren't they? If they weren't afraid of that, they wouldn't be doing, Jamie Raskin is like, well, we admit it, basically, they're doing this to prevent him from running again. But gosh, where's their confidence? If everything they are doing, congressman, is going to solve racism and poverty and all the things, then they will win in a landslide. What are they afraid of?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JORDAN",
      "utterance": "I don't know. But, look, I think it's funny, too, this double standard. Remember, the guy leading the impeachment effort for the Democrats, Jamie Raskin, objected to Florida in 2017. Democrats objected to 11 states on January 6th, 2017, but somehow Republicans are wrong because we objected to a handful of states in 2021 where we know that those states changed their law in an unconstitutional fashion. Jim McGovern, Jim McGovern, the Democrat chair of the Rules Committee, guess which state he objected to? The first objector on January 6th, 2017, to President Trump's election, guess which state he objected to? Alabama. Because everyone, though, actually, Hillary Clinton won Alabama. So this is how ridiculous they are. And again, I think the American people see it for what it is."

It just got blocked because they didn't like the way you handle things. It was a tough situation. It really was. There are a lot of people in there who are really trying hard to get the right thing done, but it was very tough when you didn't have the leadership from above."

That man is the highest-paid person in the U.S. government, who I suppose gets paid to go on TV instead of stamping out this infectious disease.

And apparently, Dr. Atlas, you were providing these nefarious parallel forms of data to embarrass Dr. Birx and Fauci, or contradict their deities. What happened?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DR. SCOTT ATLAS, SENIOR FELLOW, HOOVER INSTITUTION",
      "utterance": "Thanks for having me, Laura. I'm shocked to hear anyone that thinks that they own a monopoly or should be the sole purveyor of information to the president. When you're an advisor to the president, there's a bunch of people inside the White House. There's a bunch of people in agencies. There's a bunch of people outside advising the president. To have this bizarre notion that she should be the only one providing information to the president is an exposure of tremendous insecurity. Here you have somebody who is a government bureaucrat for 30 years whose pontificating in front of 10 to 30 people in meetings multiple times a week, none of whom know a thing about medicine or science, for eight months. And then I come in in August, and I say, well, what about this? What about these papers? What about this data? And then you have input from people, the best of epidemiologists in the world from Stanford and Harvard, all over the country trying to help, which is appropriate for a crisis like this. So this is really just a bizarre, incredibly insecure, strange point that she's making. The second point I want to make is that it is a sick, vicious lie for anyone to say or imply that I ever gave the president of the United States false information, misleading information, some kind of strange information that was concocted out of nowhere. Every single thing I ever advised was direct CDC, HHS, or scientific literature data, period. And that is just a disgusting indication of the kind of people that are in Washington who have friends in places like CNN and \"The Washington Post,\" and they repeat these lies, or on TV, and then these things get repeated like their facts. It's a disgusting, vile place."

Almost every single state did the shutdowns, did the school closures, did the restrictions on groups, did the mass mandates. If they don't like the result of those policies, the first thing that these specific people should do is look in the mirror and loudly say they were wrong. Those of the policies that were implemented. They somehow feel like they should run away or complain. They advised those policies. They were implemented."

Joe Biden and his advisors, including Fauci, are saying we need testing in schools? Does that mean elementary school kids are going to get swabbed, Dr. Atlas? What?"
