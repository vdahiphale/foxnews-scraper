It is the biggest political scandal in modern America history. The FISA warrant is now out, and yes, we on this program were right. The Trump campaign was spied on by Obama's Justice Department using Russian lies, bought and paid forward by the DNC, and Hillary Clinton to obtain a FISA warrant against Trump campaign associate Carter Page, all in an attempt to rig, steel, whatever adjective you want, a presidential election. Carter Page will join us in just a moment.  Now, meanwhile, the mainstream media, they could care less about any of this as they have been peddling the American people lies, conspiracy theories, and anti-Trump hate since even before Donald Trump was ever elected. Instead, they are once again in panic crisis mode over the president's push to remove top security clearances from who? Many of the former deep state Obama era officials who propagated all of these Russian lies that were found in Hillary's bought and paid for a dirty dossier, and by the way, are still to this day politicizing and weaponizing the powerful tools of intelligence. It's all happening on fake news CNN, conspiracy TV MSNBC. In just a moment, we will be naming names, calling out comrade John Brennan and the leaker and liar himself, James Clapper. By the way, if you are friends, tell him to tune in.  And also tonight, new details on how President Trump is countering the Iranian trip with a policy of, yes, you guessed it, peace through strength. And we're going to show you how some in the media actually now seem more sympathetic to this evil regime in Iran than to our own sitting president. It's pretty pathetic.   And finally, while Democrats play politics on our southern border, President Trump is calling them out in a major way today. Stay tuned, our jam-packed news breaking opening monologue is straight ahead.",

      "sentences": "The now infamous Clinton dirty dossier was the single key piece of evidence that was used in four FISA applications by the FBI in order to spy on Trump campaign associates and, of course, the president- elect, and now the President Donald Trump.   Without the dossier, there would be no FISA warrant against Carter Page. He will join us in a few moments. This is an irrefutable fact. And, of course, we all know that this dirty dossier was created by a former foreign spy Christopher Steele who ultimately really was paid by Hillary Clinton and the DNC, all to dig up dirt and lies on Donald Trump. In other words, it was political op research, filled with all things Russian lies that even Steele himself has admitted was totally unverified and uncorroborated. And he even said at best, it was raw intelligence and only had a 50/50 chance of being true, most of which has now been totally debunked. And yet, it was passed off to you the American people and FISA court judges as real, credible evidence by top FBI, DOJ officials to obtain the FISA warrant to spy on the Trump campaign associate at the height of a presidential election in 2016. This is a national disgrace. This is an abhorrent abuse of power and very dangerous to our constitutional republic, all an attempt to turn the full force of your government against one person and of course, the people that supported him, Donald Trump with a vengeance. And this, by the way, all after top officials literally rig the investigation to save Hillary Clinton from certain indictments -- warranted indictments, necessary indictments, if we have equal justice under the law and equal application of our laws.  So, tonight, it's time. We call on everybody to demand the release of all 589 pages of these FISA documents, unredact, everything possible and, of course, our god-given rights as Americans are now on the line here, if we are to remain a free society.   The mainstream media filled with all opinion. There's no journalism on the so-called news channels. They are supposed to be investigating our governments, holding them accountable and they're nowhere to be found. The biggest story in their lives, they totally missed it. And meanwhile, everything we've been reporting for well over a year has now been confirmed for you. Instead, you've got the media carrying water for their beloved Barack Obama -- in other words, finishing the job. They did eight consecutive years of kissing his ass. Why should they stop now?  And as we speak, they are in full-on freak-out mode that several former high ranking deep state government bureaucrats all, who propagated the Russian lies found in Hillary's bought and paid for dossier might actually lose their precious security clearances. So, this week, rightly, the Trump administration announced that it was literally looking to strip top-secret government access from all those deep state actors you see on your screen, including Clapper, and Brennan, and Rice, Michael Hayden, and yes, James Comey and Andrew McCabe. And now, predictably, Democrats in the media -- they are once again peddling this move from President Trump as another oh, my gosh, earth- shattering, feign outrage moment, an unprecedented abuse of power. In other words, their typical daily Donald Trump freak-out.  We've got the video proof. Take a look.",

Did it occur to these people why a former official, no longer employed by the government, would still have top-secret clearance? They supposedly care so much about the dangers of Russia, Russia. Hillary Clinton paid for these Russian lies. It was nothing but a disinformation, propaganda campaign to manipulate the minds of the American people and steal an election. And the deep state help her every step of the way. Is that not abuse of power? You don't see the danger in this? And then you see the media, Democrats sticking up to the most corrupt people, their swamp friends that abused the power that we gave them, we the people? For example, one time CIA Director John Brennan hates Donald Trump, he is allowed to. He is a former communist. How he ever became a CIA director is unbelievable to me. He is also currently a paid hack over a conspiracy TV MSNBC, which is so appropriate.   But during his time as the CIA director, Brennan actually leaked the contents of this dossier before the election to then Senator Harry Reid who then subsequently alerted the public and an open letter to James Comey. Really, the CIA director? Sounds like the Pravda, sounds like the KGB.  After stepping down as CIA director, John Brennan took all of his hatred publicly on cable news, getting paid, which is OK. Even calling the sitting president of the United States a traitor, really? This one who leaked the Russian lies? Watch this.",

Saying what he just said, calling the president of the United States a traitor? And this no way undermines the CIA's mission, really?   What about him politicizing intelligence as an employee of NBC? That's pretty acceptable for a current CIA employee? I do not think so.  And that brings us to the well-known leaker and liar himself, James Clapper. Remember, he's the former director of National Intelligence, widely believed to have leaked details of the infamous dossier to CNN, where he is now employed. Fake news.

Oh, that is James Clapper's signature. He signed that in 2013, amazing piece of information.   It was Clapper who was at the center of the Obama administration's effort to scrub the clearance list in order to avoid leaking. But, of course, no media meltdown over that action. And as we stated, it was James Clapper who likely leak the classified information to the media in order to, yes, rig the election, years after he authored and signed that, quote, memo.  Unauthorized disclosures, he said, of classified information, including leaks of classified information to the media endanger vital intelligence sources and methods, and damage international relationships, aggressive action is required to better equip the United States government, elements to prevent unauthorized disclosures. So, it's clear that people like Clapper and Brennan and many other deep state sycophants, they should in no way, none of them have any access to our government secrets. As a matter of fact, we ought to -- they ought to all be under investigation, because their bias is so abusive clouded their judgment. They are the ones that stomped on the rights of the American people. They are the ones that tried to propagandize, misinform the American people, all to affect an election, and to this day, they still are, and to this day, breaking their own government policies that they signed off on.  Every American tonight, you need to demand that they not only lose their special government privileges, but they need to be held accountable for their blatant abuse of power. By the way, Robert Mueller, are you watching? Do you have your people watching? Because this is your Russia, Russia, Russia, Russia collusion story.  And, by the way, Jeff Sessions, where are you? Has anybody seen you? Except for school children?  Let's shift gears. Let's turn our attention to the hostile regime of Iran.  Over the weekend, the president issued a stern warning to the rogue state, tweeting, quote: To the president of Iran, Rouhani, he said, never, ever threaten the U.S. again, or you will suffer consequences the likes of which few throughout history have ever suffered before. We are no longer a country that will stand for your demented words of violence and death. Be cautious. Per usual, this tweet sent off, yes, predictable widespread, breathless panic from the left-wing media, shocking. Take a look.  REP.

I won't drag you into politics that the political commentary. Let me get your reaction. Number one, it was the bulk of information used to get a FISA warrant, Clinton's dirty dossier, full of Russian lies, you just heard Carter Page. Your thoughts? REP. DEVIN NUNES, R—CALIF., HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: Let's start with most people in the media never even bothered to read our three-page memo that was designed to be just a short compilation to protect sources and methods, because we only wanted to get out the main points. Which were what? That they used the dossier, the dirt from the Clinton campaign to make up the bulk of the FISA application. As a matter of fact, they lead with it in the FISA application. So, that's what we really wanted to get out to the American people, because we believe at that time that most Americans would agree, and I think that they would agree, if journalism wasn't so dead, as you said in your monologue. Most Americans, when you talk to them and they are not watching the other cable news networks, and you talk to them about is it OK for me as a politician to go out and pay someone to dig up dirt on my opposing candidate -- whether it is running for president, governor or president or something else and feed it to the FBI? An FBI that's controlled by my own party. That only happens in the banana republic. So, that was the point of the memo, and it's sad that the media has failed to cover it. But what's even more surprising now is now that we've been totally vindicated with the release of this FISA, just the pieces of the FISA applications over the weekend, you continue to see the media -- they're going absolutely crazy. And I have never seen anything like it. And I just -- I think your -- like you said, journalism is dead in this country and I don't know what to do about it.",

It is the biggest political scandal in modern America history. The FISA warrant is now out, and yes, we on this program were right. The Trump campaign was spied on by Obama's Justice Department using Russian lies, bought and paid forward by the DNC, and Hillary Clinton to obtain a FISA warrant against Trump campaign associate Carter Page, all in an attempt to rig, steel, whatever adjective you want, a presidential election. Carter Page will join us in just a moment. Now, meanwhile, the mainstream media, they could care less about any of this as they have been peddling the American people lies, conspiracy theories, and anti-Trump hate since even before Donald Trump was ever elected. Instead, they are once again in panic crisis mode over the president's push to remove top security clearances from who? Many of the former deep state Obama era officials who propagated all of these Russian lies that were found in Hillary's bought and paid for a dirty dossier, and by the way, are still to this day politicizing and weaponizing the powerful tools of intelligence. It's all happening on fake news CNN, conspiracy TV MSNBC. In just a moment, we will be naming names, calling out comrade John Brennan and the leaker and liar himself, James Clapper. By the way, if you are friends, tell him to tune in. And also tonight, new details on how President Trump is countering the Iranian trip with a policy of, yes, you guessed it, peace through strength. And we're going to show you how some in the media actually now seem more sympathetic to this evil regime in Iran than to our own sitting president. It's pretty pathetic. And finally, while Democrats play politics on our southern border, President Trump is calling them out in a major way today. Stay tuned, our jam-packed news breaking opening monologue is straight ahead."

      "utterance": "The now infamous Clinton dirty dossier was the single key piece of evidence that was used in four FISA applications by the FBI in order to spy on Trump campaign associates and, of course, the president- elect, and now the President Donald Trump. Without the dossier, there would be no FISA warrant against Carter Page. He will join us in a few moments. This is an irrefutable fact. And, of course, we all know that this dirty dossier was created by a former foreign spy Christopher Steele who ultimately really was paid by Hillary Clinton and the DNC, all to dig up dirt and lies on Donald Trump. In other words, it was political op research, filled with all things Russian lies that even Steele himself has admitted was totally unverified and uncorroborated. And he even said at best, it was raw intelligence and only had a 50/50 chance of being true, most of which has now been totally debunked. And yet, it was passed off to you the American people and FISA court judges as real, credible evidence by top FBI, DOJ officials to obtain the FISA warrant to spy on the Trump campaign associate at the height of a presidential election in 2016. This is a national disgrace. This is an abhorrent abuse of power and very dangerous to our constitutional republic, all an attempt to turn the full force of your government against one person and of course, the people that supported him, Donald Trump with a vengeance. And this, by the way, all after top officials literally rig the investigation to save Hillary Clinton from certain indictments -- warranted indictments, necessary indictments, if we have equal justice under the law and equal application of our laws. So, tonight, it's time. We call on everybody to demand the release of all 589 pages of these FISA documents, unredact, everything possible and, of course, our god-given rights as Americans are now on the line here, if we are to remain a free society. The mainstream media filled with all opinion. There's no journalism on the so-called news channels. They are supposed to be investigating our governments, holding them accountable and they're nowhere to be found. The biggest story in their lives, they totally missed it. And meanwhile, everything we've been reporting for well over a year has now been confirmed for you. Instead, you've got the media carrying water for their beloved Barack Obama -- in other words, finishing the job. They did eight consecutive years of kissing his ass. Why should they stop now? And as we speak, they are in full-on freak-out mode that several former high ranking deep state government bureaucrats all, who propagated the Russian lies found in Hillary's bought and paid for dossier might actually lose their precious security clearances. So, this week, rightly, the Trump administration announced that it was literally looking to strip top-secret government access from all those deep state actors you see on your screen, including Clapper, and Brennan, and Rice, Michael Hayden, and yes, James Comey and Andrew McCabe. And now, predictably, Democrats in the media -- they are once again peddling this move from President Trump as another oh, my gosh, earth- shattering, feign outrage moment, an unprecedented abuse of power. In other words, their typical daily Donald Trump freak-out. We've got the video proof. Take a look."

Hillary Clinton paid for these Russian lies. It was nothing but a disinformation, propaganda campaign to manipulate the minds of the American people and steal an election. And the deep state help her every step of the way. Is that not abuse of power? You don't see the danger in this? And then you see the media, Democrats sticking up to the most corrupt people, their swamp friends that abused the power that we gave them, we the people? For example, one time CIA Director John Brennan hates Donald Trump, he is allowed to. He is a former communist. How he ever became a CIA director is unbelievable to me. He is also currently a paid hack over a conspiracy TV MSNBC, which is so appropriate. But during his time as the CIA director, Brennan actually leaked the contents of this dossier before the election to then Senator Harry Reid who then subsequently alerted the public and an open letter to James Comey. Really, the CIA director? Sounds like the Pravda, sounds like the KGB. After stepping down as CIA director, John Brennan took all of his hatred publicly on cable news, getting paid, which is OK. Even calling the sitting president of the United States a traitor, really? This one who leaked the Russian lies? Watch this."

And that's why I use the term that this is nothing short of treasonous, because it is a betrayal of a nation. He is giving aid and comfort to the enemy and it needs to stop.

However, that's requires former CIA directors to behave like current CIA employees. What you just saw, does that seem like the behavior of a current CIA employee? Saying what he just said, calling the president of the United States a traitor? And this no way undermines the CIA's mission, really? What about him politicizing intelligence as an employee of NBC? That's pretty acceptable for a current CIA employee? I do not think so. And that brings us to the well-known leaker and liar himself, James Clapper. Remember, he's the former director of National Intelligence, widely believed to have leaked details of the infamous dossier to CNN, where he is now employed. Fake news.

Oh, that is James Clapper's signature. He signed that in 2013, amazing piece of information. It was Clapper who was at the center of the Obama administration's effort to scrub the clearance list in order to avoid leaking. But, of course, no media meltdown over that action. And as we stated, it was James Clapper who likely leak the classified information to the media in order to, yes, rig the election, years after he authored and signed that, quote, memo. Unauthorized disclosures, he said, of classified information, including leaks of classified information to the media endanger vital intelligence sources and methods, and damage international relationships, aggressive action is required to better equip the United States government, elements to prevent unauthorized disclosures. So, it's clear that people like Clapper and Brennan and many other deep state sycophants, they should in no way, none of them have any access to our government secrets. As a matter of fact, we ought to -- they ought to all be under investigation, because their bias is so abusive clouded their judgment. They are the ones that stomped on the rights of the American people. They are the ones that tried to propagandize, misinform the American people, all to affect an election, and to this day, they still are, and to this day, breaking their own government policies that they signed off on. Every American tonight, you need to demand that they not only lose their special government privileges, but they need to be held accountable for their blatant abuse of power. By the way, Robert Mueller, are you watching? Do you have your people watching? Because this is your Russia, Russia, Russia, Russia collusion story. And, by the way, Jeff Sessions, where are you?

And of course aggressively pursuing nuclear weapons and threatening all of our allies and this country. America must never allow these lunatics to develop nuclear weapons. All options must always remain on the table. And while the president puts Iran unnoticed, he also focusing on the critical part of our national security right here at home.

Look at this Gallup poll, President Trump just hit the highest approval rating of his presidency. And according to \"The Hill\", three-fourths of Americans will never vote for a socialist.

Congressman, the memo now has been totally and completely corroborated by you and people like Adam Schiff to me have been proven to be one of the biggest liars in the country. I won't drag you into politics that the political commentary. Let me get your reaction. Number one, it was the bulk of information used to get a FISA warrant, Clinton's dirty dossier, full of Russian lies, you just heard Carter Page. Your thoughts? REP. DEVIN NUNES, R—CALIF., HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: Let's start with most people in the media never even bothered to read our three-page memo that was designed to be just a short compilation to protect sources and methods, because we only wanted to get out the main points. Which were what? That they used the dossier, the dirt from the Clinton campaign to make up the bulk of the FISA application. As a matter of fact, they lead with it in the FISA application. So, that's what we really wanted to get out to the American people, because we believe at that time that most Americans would agree, and I think that they would agree, if journalism wasn't so dead, as you said in your monologue. Most Americans, when you talk to them and they are not watching the other cable news networks, and you talk to them about is it OK for me as a politician to go out and pay someone to dig up dirt on my opposing candidate -- whether it is running for president, governor or president or something else and feed it to the FBI? An FBI that's controlled by my own party. That only happens in the banana republic. So, that was the point of the memo, and it's sad that the media has failed to cover it. But what's even more surprising now is now that we've been totally vindicated with the release of this FISA, just the pieces of the FISA applications over the weekend, you continue to see the media -- they're going absolutely crazy. And I have never seen anything like it. And I just -- I think your -- like you said, journalism is dead in this country and I don't know what to do about it."

But the dossier, according to Steele himself, in an interrogatory in Great Britain, he says it's raw intelligence, never verified, never corroborated. But everybody that signed off on that warrant signed off on unverified, uncorroborated Russian lies that were literally designed to really steal an election after they rigged an investigation into what is irrefutable crimes incontrovertible evidence of obstruction and violation of the Patriot Act by Hillary."

So they went out of their way, instead of saying candidate two paid for this -- paid for this dirt on candidate one. Candidate two would've been Hillary Clinton. That would've been a very simple way to describe it in the FISA application for the judge. Now here is something that actually my colleagues, Mr. Gowdy and Mr. Ratcliffe from Texas who did allow these FISA warrants in his career and have the opportunity to look at this in quite detailed, he continually makes a point, which is a very good one. It's not so much how wrong it is and what they put into the FISA applications, that's really bad. But what's even worse is the exculpatory evidence that they left on the cutting room floor."

The fact that the attorney would be recording this and apparently without his client's knowledge and then using this later, and it also shows how far they are willing to go to squeeze people to try to get something out of them.

I honestly think that what they have done to him is wrong, I was not a client of his although, I did ask him legal questions on, we used to talk privately, and -- but we didn't have a business relationship.

He does not pretend to be a saint, but he is ferociously loyal to his people. It's really ridiculous that this guy was giving them legal advice and then recording them and then releasing the tapes. And one more thing, Sean, he better be damn sure Donald Trump was in New York for all those calls where one party consent state, because if he was in Florida or Mar-a-Lago on one of those 12 calls, Florida is a two-party consent state."
