Vice President Kamala Harris being called a bully with a poor work ethic, reports of dysfunction growing inside the VP's office where more high profile staffers are reportedly looking to the exits. Axios says there are staff concerns about being branded as a Harris person after working for her is leaving many A's to look for new jobs. This comes after a blistering report by \"The Washington Post\" where a former Harris staffer details how bad working there can be, quote, \"It's clear that you're not working with somebody who is willing to do the pre and the work. With Kamala, you have to put up with a constant amount of soul-destroying criticism and also her own lack of confidence. So you're constantly sort of propping up a bully and it's not really clear why.\" Those kinds of accusations seem to go against President Biden after taking office. This is what he said.",

This sounds like a bunch of whiners that are intimidated by a strong woman of color. I think they are probably misogynist and probably racist because after all that's what they would say if you had the same criticism. This is a problem for society to have. When we find out that we have an awful leader in the second-highest office in the land is also a person of color, that is a sign of progress, right? She has reached a point in society where she is no better than obnoxious white old guys. That is really -- I mean the -- look, look, this this is a true achievement and diversity, and we can't ignore it. She is just as awful as all the white guys that can't -- this is like then moon landing for identity politics, right? A woman of color has finally gone where no woman of color has ever gone before. She can be a complete utter jerk just like a Kennedy can, just like anybody can. But the bigger lesson here is that you cannot judge people by a single variable, in this case identity, because then you'll never find out who the person really is, right? So, many -- so many mistakes are made by following this of single variable of identity. Liz Warren screwed up her life, you know, pretending to be a Native American because she thought that was -- that was the variable. The elevation of Jacob Blake, that was because a single variable, identity, the choice of blending an SUV over a criminal was based on the single variable, identity. So, all of the biggest mistakes that we're making are based on one variable in which all you see is identity. Kamala is teaching you that this doesn't work in the employment world. You cannot rely on diversity quotas to find out if somebody is competent or not. It's just --",

We saw this under the Donald Trump administration. We're seeing it again. And I think we're -- and listen, as a Democrat, I have some honest criticisms against the vice president, one being how they -- how we treated the Haitian migrant at the southern border after the State Department issued policy we're moving some of our diplomats from Haiti because it was unsafe. But with that being said, I think where we need to see some improvement in her office is she needs to come up with a narrative for the American people and an argument for the American people of why she is there and what she's working on and make that very clear so she can push back against a lot of the palace entry.",

They did nothing to ask former staffers what they think of here, what her main issues are, why it was so important to her to be doing -- to be locking people up in California as a prosecutor but all of the sudden changed her mind when it came to her own policies and those of Joe Biden, why she changed her opinion on Joe Biden being a racist, for example. They didn't vet her at all when it came to those issues.

There's also -- we got to lay a lot of blame on the virtue signalling companies who when this crap went down said that they were supporting the activists and that property destruction was not violence. Marc Jacobs excused the looting in my neighborhood, he has a store there, my neighborhood got destroyed, millions of dollars in damages, people laughed about it on the set. And he said the damage isn't violence. And it was easy to say that when you were super rich, you own the stores and you were insured. Meanwhile, your entire neighborhood is gone. So \"The New York Times\" had an interesting piece where they link today's heinous crimes to the evolution of the criminality during the Floyd and Kenosha riots. So, you have thieves, groups, gangs exploiting the media's redefinition of riots as protests, right? We talked about that. They exploded the law enforcement simultaneously as they were stretched thin trying to deal with the protests but also being demoralized and being filmed in case they ever did try to stop any kind of crime. So, this never was about protests. This was about profit. Even the stores that were victimized, they did not want to discuss it. So, the Democrats have strayed so far from my sensible worldview. When you can't see that no cash bail in this leftist DAs are incentivizing more crime, you are not fit to run anything. AOC, I have always defended her.

Vice President Kamala Harris being called a bully with a poor work ethic, reports of dysfunction growing inside the VP's office where more high profile staffers are reportedly looking to the exits. Axios says there are staff concerns about being branded as a Harris person after working for her is leaving many A's to look for new jobs. This comes after a blistering report by \"The Washington Post\" where a former Harris staffer details how bad working there can be, quote, \"It's clear that you're not working with somebody who is willing to do the pre and the work. With Kamala, you have to put up with a constant amount of soul-destroying criticism and also her own lack of confidence. So you're constantly sort of propping up a bully and it's not really clear why.\" Those kinds of accusations seem to go against President Biden after taking office. This is what he said."

This sounds like a bunch of whiners that are intimidated by a strong woman of color. I think they are probably misogynist and probably racist because after all that's what they would say if you had the same criticism. This is a problem for society to have. When we find out that we have an awful leader in the second-highest office in the land is also a person of color, that is a sign of progress, right? She has reached a point in society where she is no better than obnoxious white old guys. That is really -- I mean the -- look, look, this this is a true achievement and diversity, and we can't ignore it. She is just as awful as all the white guys that can't -- this is like then moon landing for identity politics, right? A woman of color has finally gone where no woman of color has ever gone before. She can be a complete utter jerk just like a Kennedy can, just like anybody can. But the bigger lesson here is that you cannot judge people by a single variable, in this case identity, because then you'll never find out who the person really is, right? So, many -- so many mistakes are made by following this of single variable of identity. Liz Warren screwed up her life, you know, pretending to be a Native American because she thought that was -- that was the variable. The elevation of Jacob Blake, that was because a single variable, identity, the choice of blending an SUV over a criminal was based on the single variable, identity. So, all of the biggest mistakes that we're making are based on one variable in which all you see is identity. Kamala is teaching you that this doesn't work in the employment world. You cannot rely on diversity quotas to find out if somebody is competent or not. It's just --"

But she is being attacked by Democrats who wanted to work for her, many of whom are women, and many of whom are people of color. So, that doesn't make sense she either hired sexist bigots or it is what it seems like to be, and this is what it seems like to be. She has impostor syndrome. She knows she's not qualified to be the vice president, so she is trying to make her way through. And she try to fake away through the second most powerful job in the country, you're gonna fall flat a lot. And so, when she falls flat, she takes that out on her staff.

And what we see happening here to Kamala over and over, story after story, is the Washington media is doing what they do best. They're creating an arch of the narrative for you with quotes from folks who are all anonymous, right, which is the palace intrigue which we're used to. We saw this under the Donald Trump administration. We're seeing it again. And I think we're -- and listen, as a Democrat, I have some honest criticisms against the vice president, one being how they -- how we treated the Haitian migrant at the southern border after the State Department issued policy we're moving some of our diplomats from Haiti because it was unsafe. But with that being said, I think where we need to see some improvement in her office is she needs to come up with a narrative for the American people and an argument for the American people of why she is there and what she's working on and make that very clear so she can push back against a lot of the palace entry."

I mean they built her up as the first woman of color to be the vice president, the first woman to be the vice president. They did nothing to ask former staffers what they think of here, what her main issues are, why it was so important to her to be doing -- to be locking people up in California as a prosecutor but all of the sudden changed her mind when it came to her own policies and those of Joe Biden, why she changed her opinion on Joe Biden being a racist, for example. They didn't vet her at all when it came to those issues. But I will say, you know, what the staffers are accusing her of, not reading briefings, really shows up when she does these interviews and starts laughing uncontrollably and that also goes to show that maybe she is a little bit insecure about the issues she's talking about.

And for Dr. Fauci, again, to go out and scare the entire country in the world to thinking this is going to be the death everything again did immeasurable harm and these policies that he has been implementing by default because people are listening to him, including the teacher's unions and everything else, have caused an insane amount of harm, including when the New York governor, because of this new variant said, no more elective surgeries.

I don't -- or any politician or any activist or -- I'm not upset at the criminals, because they are reacting to the incentives, criminals criminalized. It's those -- it's AOC, it's the leftist Das, the far left activists who provide the incentives, no bail -- no cash bail is one of them. But I'm also -- you know, this caused me to go back and read some of the stuff that is out about these smash-and-grab. There's also -- we got to lay a lot of blame on the virtue signalling companies who when this crap went down said that they were supporting the activists and that property destruction was not violence. Marc Jacobs excused the looting in my neighborhood, he has a store there, my neighborhood got destroyed, millions of dollars in damages, people laughed about it on the set. And he said the damage isn't violence. And it was easy to say that when you were super rich, you own the stores and you were insured. Meanwhile, your entire neighborhood is gone. So \"The New York Times\" had an interesting piece where they link today's heinous crimes to the evolution of the criminality during the Floyd and Kenosha riots. So, you have thieves, groups, gangs exploiting the media's redefinition of riots as protests, right? We talked about that. They exploded the law enforcement simultaneously as they were stretched thin trying to deal with the protests but also being demoralized and being filmed in case they ever did try to stop any kind of crime. So, this never was about protests. This was about profit. Even the stores that were victimized, they did not want to discuss it. So, the Democrats have strayed so far from my sensible worldview. When you can't see that no cash bail in this leftist DAs are incentivizing more crime, you are not fit to run anything. AOC, I have always defended her. I thought she's got charisma and charm and -- but to say something there that to the people that have experienced it, she is no good, she's a bad person."

I will never forget there was a video interview of a woman named Stephanie disabled in Minneapolis last summer who was interviewed, not a white woman, and she was crying because the stores that she was able to walk to, that she could be on her own and be self-sufficient with, were destroyed and nobody cared about it."

And I think when you have -- and I think it's very important that Democrats in this moment as we see an increase in crime don't play lip service and say here's how we're actually going to address that crime. Here's what we know. We know there's certain cases in which cash -- having cash bail works and there's some case where it doesn't work. When you have crimes of desperation, when people go into grocery stores and steal baby formula, that is a crime of desperation that should be met with cash bail. When you have somebody with a rap sheet that's as long as the pair of pants that I have on right now, right, you those people aren't supposed to get cash bail. Those people that we should find a way to say, listen, you will get punished or will give you incentives. And incentives also do work. Remember, the first step back was all about providing incentives those folks who made mistakes and are trying to correct their lives. So, we have to have a delineation between those two things."

You can't say to the American people it's not happening when it's happening. And you're seeing it on local TV every day at 5:00 or 6:00. You're seeing it on Facebook, seeing it on cable news. You can't say it's not happening. Remember, Antifa is this -- doesn't exist. Jerry Nadler said it was the mayor from chopper chase (PH). It's the summer of love until there's a couple homicides. CNN say, these are mostly peaceful protest. So, they have to make a decision are they going to own up and address some of these stupid policies or they're going to deny and deflect. The difference is this time as opposed to the summer of 2020, there's no righteous racial component to the riots. These are professional criminals doing targeted heists. It's not about Trump.

And we talked to this woman today. Her name is Rachel Michelin. She's a California Retail Association. She said to AOC, it absolutely is happening. And one of the problems that she sees is that -- imagine that you have a big box store like a Nordstrom, and then small businesses will try to get as close as they can to that Nordstrom so that they can be within walking distance or get that foot traffic. And if nobody's going to the stores, then it doesn't -- you know, maybe Nordstrom can afford it though they shouldn't have to, but the small business owners, they're the ones who can't do it. The last thing i would say is we really have to focus on this. And I want to do a story on it soon. This idea that you can -- one of the reasons are getting all these fancy material luxury goods is because there's no policing of the resale on the internet. So, you can go -- you can make up your own like, Amazon store or on eBay, and then you're selling these fancy bags for less expensive price.

And he's like, oh yes, he's really good but he's gone now, everybody, I'm available. And then there was another bit where he said -- I asked somebody who was on a show, has CNN lost trust on this? And it was like, of course, they have,. but it's not Cuomo alone, right? It's like -- it's like asking if CNN has lost trust. How can you say that when you've actually -- your fingerprints -- CNN's fingerprints are all over the corpse of trust. They are -- I mean the five-year collusion hoax, fine people hoax, drinking bleach, every day is worse than Watergate, Smollett, Covington, Kavanaugh. All of these things build up a case that CNN's trust is gone. I think this is an opportunity for this network, and I know they listen to me for advice, Zucker will call me but I'm often busy. This is the time for them to regain their lost luster by perhaps cleaning house, maybe deciding that the oppression olympics isn't the way to go, stop pitting people against each other, identities against identities. Maybe return to the fact that we're all Americans. I know that's not their profit model. The profit model is that get this group against this group. But if you had -- you know, if you just finally realized that Americans could really return to just being Americans, that would be a good start."

But what I do know is that the war between Andrew Cuomo and Zucker has completely started -- Andrew -- Chris Cuomo, excuse me. Chris Cuomo is not going to go down alone and he might have a point. It was a very beneficial relationship that Andrew Cuomo was the governor of -- governor of New York, was a foil against Donald Trump, and CNN had him on whenever he wanted because he was the brother of Chris Cuomo. We all watched it happen. We watched it play out until it was no longer inappropriate because things started going downhill for the governor, and now there's all these allegations of what an -- what an internal investigation found from an outside law firm which they conveniently left out of the announcement when they said that he had been fired, that they didn't say exactly what all the problems were. But I think that the executives knew a lot more than they're willing to let on. And there'll be lots of lawyers involved to find out and lots of leaking going on about what was found and what that death by a thousand cuts because. If it really is a thousand cuts, a lot of people would like to know what the thousand cuts are."

And what makes this really sad is because when you're a journalist, especially in an anchor chair, there's ethics that you're supposed to abide by. Journalism is undergirded by truth, right? It's built around the idea of transparency, accountability, and disclosure. When a reporter fails to lead into those values, they continue to sow the seeds of distrust and mistrust towards the media. And our job is to shine light into dark places and to illuminate smoke-filled rooms and Cuomo did the opposite on all of those."
