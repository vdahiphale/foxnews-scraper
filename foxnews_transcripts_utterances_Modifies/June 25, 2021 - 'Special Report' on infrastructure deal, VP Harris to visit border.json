And when you approach a big reform bill with its infrastructure immigration on either side of the aisle, you have got to get two things right. Number one is substance, and number two, the politics.  I think Vice President Harris has gotten some of the substance and not a lot of it right with the way she has looked at the root causes. But the politics she has not gotten right. Hopefully this acts as accelerant, her traveling to the border and visiting there, because it is a crisis at the border.  But I might add in just a moment of levity here and perhaps lightness here, if visiting the border would solve our border challenge and border immigration challenge, then we would have solved this problem a long, long time ago. President Trump visited. Even Cruz and Graham and all the senators who do all this big complaining, they have all gone down and we have not solved anything. This has to be viewed as part of a long-term solution, a big solution to a long-term problem. Remember, the last time we had immigration reform in this country was 35 years ago, and that president was Ronald Reagan. A lot has changed. A lot has gotten worse. And we are going to need a big package to get it right.",

But it's not sufficient to go down there, have a laugh, and keep things goings the same way that they are. It would be better if she visited Fort Bliss, one of these contractor facilities, where 2,000 teenagers are being held where there are lice outbreaks and strep and flu and COVID-19 and the food is substandard, where she actually saw the pain caused by the policies of the Biden administration.   And what's happening is because of the Biden administration, a series of executive orders, a decision not to turn anyone away, and even now welcoming people, not just unaccompanied minors but single people, families. And making a visit to a place where there is not much of a problem isn't going to do anything. You need to actually have her understand the problem, the pain and all of the problems caused by having an open, porous border, or else it's not worth a trip at all.",

I think that Mitch McConnell is wise to be skeptical of this. Barry Goldwater urged Republicans to offer a choice, not simply an echo. And I think that the senators pushing for this are really offering an echo. They don't care about how much is being spent. They don't care whether we can really afford to pay for it. They just want to make sure the money is spent on their priorities as well as Democratic priorities. And I think the voters deserve better than that. This is part of a much larger Biden agenda, to take us back to World War II level spending, Mike. The last time I checked we were not at war, let alone a war on the scale of what was going on 80 years ago. This is what this bill is really about, and I don't think that the American public would have split the Senate 50-50 if this is what they wanted."

      "utterance": "So, a couple things. I think our foreign policy, we have to begin to look at the border as a national security challenge as part of a broader foreign policy challenge. And when you approach a big reform bill with its infrastructure immigration on either side of the aisle, you have got to get two things right. Number one is substance, and number two, the politics. I think Vice President Harris has gotten some of the substance and not a lot of it right with the way she has looked at the root causes. But the politics she has not gotten right. Hopefully this acts as accelerant, her traveling to the border and visiting there, because it is a crisis at the border. But I might add in just a moment of levity here and perhaps lightness here, if visiting the border would solve our border challenge and border immigration challenge, then we would have solved this problem a long, long time ago. President Trump visited. Even Cruz and Graham and all the senators who do all this big complaining, they have all gone down and we have not solved anything. This has to be viewed as part of a long-term solution, a big solution to a long-term problem. Remember, the last time we had immigration reform in this country was 35 years ago, and that president was Ronald Reagan. A lot has changed. A lot has gotten worse. And we are going to need a big package to get it right."

      "utterance": "That's exactly right. It is good to go to the border. It's good that she was finally pressured into going to the border because President Trump is visiting. But it's not sufficient to go down there, have a laugh, and keep things goings the same way that they are. It would be better if she visited Fort Bliss, one of these contractor facilities, where 2,000 teenagers are being held where there are lice outbreaks and strep and flu and COVID-19 and the food is substandard, where she actually saw the pain caused by the policies of the Biden administration. And what's happening is because of the Biden administration, a series of executive orders, a decision not to turn anyone away, and even now welcoming people, not just unaccompanied minors but single people, families. And making a visit to a place where there is not much of a problem isn't going to do anything. You need to actually have her understand the problem, the pain and all of the problems caused by having an open, porous border, or else it's not worth a trip at all."

I see this as part of what was going on earlier this week with the administration's sudden discovery that we have a violent crime problem in many of our big cities. This president came in and thought he would do the opposite of everything Donald Trump was doing. So if Trump had played up violent crime, he would play it down. If Trump played up a border problem, he would play it down. But these are real problems, and now he is suddenly realizing that, and he has to do something about them. So, I think they are playing catch up here."

And in fact, as people have moved to mail-in balloting, people need to have confidence that it's not just that people are free to vote but that also that it is difficult to cheat. So this is a very salient issue, and Republicans are finding that despite all of the propaganda press in favor of Democrats plan, it's not very popular with the people.
