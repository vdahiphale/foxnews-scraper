The flight from New York to Dallas made an emergency landing in Philadelphia this morning. And in the thick of it all, a harrowing rescue in midair. There are multiple reports, witnesses saw a piece of shrapnel from the engine blow out a window and a female passenger was then partially sucked out of that window hull before her fellow flyers scrambled to her rescue. She, unfortunately, later died. Still unknown what her injuries were that caused her death, sadly. But, listen to one passenger describe his horror story.",

The FAA says the emergency landing on flight 1380 happened at 11:20 this morning after the crew reported damage to one of the aircraft engine, the fuselage and the window. Passengers are seen exiting the plane using those air stairs. Some of the passengers have been sharing their harrowing stories on social media, such as Marty Martinez, he briefly, in fact, went live even on Facebook. And there you see him wearing an oxygen mask. And in his post he wrote this, engine exploded in the air and blew open window three seats away from me. Imagine that being one of his friends on Facebook reading that. He says the explosion injured a female sitting in the seat next to the window.  The plane departed from New York, LaGuardia Airport, tracking data from flight where dotcom shows the flight was heading west over New York southern tier before abruptly turning toward Philadelphia. But, Dana, when you look back at these pictures, you have to wonder how incredible and how many heroes were on board that plane, not just the pilots to land that thing with one engine, but the crewmembers and the passengers on board that tried to save this woman. Sadly, she later died at the airport -- at the hospital.",

And before that, you go back to, like, 2006, and it was a small plane coming out of Kentucky, and it had a short runway, didn't quite get up and then crashed. And then you lose -- I think in both cases, you lost 45, 50 people. In this case, you're in a big plane, a Boeing 737. They never have problems.

It looks like there were a lot of heroes out there. You take safety for granted when you fly in this country. This never happens in America, and it shouldn't happen in America. We're too advance and too well-regulated. And, obviously, this was a freak accident. And the investigation is going to show what happened.  But you hear about this in other countries a lot, in Africa, in Egypt, in Malaysia, or Ukraine. And, it just speaks to how kind, you know, kind of advanced and proficient the American airline industry is. I hope Southwest does right by these passengers and gives them more than a free upgrade for the next flight. They have to take care of these people. This is one of the things that will leave you, you know, scarred forever. And the stock price has taken a huge slide today, recovered a little bit. But Southwest is ranked really high, according to the other airlines.  But, at the same time, they've had a lot of P.R. disasters. They've had computers crashed. They've had these emotional support dogs bite people. They've had fights. They've had to drag women out, they were fighting and kicking and screaming, they serial overbooked flights. They don't do that anymore. So, hopefully, Southwest can recover from this, and all these people I hope are recovering too.",

There's always California, and there's always the rest of the country. That's not new. And the Border Patrol, they're just getting freed up by the National Guard. The National Guard is not out there apprehending people. They're doing stuff in the back office off the front lines to support. Now, listen, if I was an illegal alien and I was poor and I had no future, I'd come to this country, too. At the same time, you have to respect the line. You have to respect the law. You can't let everybody come in, or else that cheapens the entire system. California is paying the price of this, though. I mean, the cost of illegal immigration, according to the latest study, $23 billion. That is a lot of money that taxpayers are paying for illegal immigration. And you can't say they make up with it from the farmworkers.",

So she went to court, waited in line, filled out paperwork, but sadly, she was denied. You can call this art or self-promotion. I call it clueless. She's doing this as we just dropped missiles on Syria for using chemical weapons on kids. So her actions actually ignore Trump's real response to actual suffering, as opposed to what's going on in her head. She's also not up-to-date on world events. The risk for nuclear war is actually shrinking. North and South Korea are now planning serious talks. Who spurred that? More important, chances are we all know women -- moms, sisters, coworkers -- faced with threats who have had to file restraining orders. It's not comedy. It's terror. That Maria was in a government office, wasting valuable time, perhaps while other women were waiting to get real restraining orders against real threats makes this joke less funny.

A terrifying ordeal in the skies at 30,000 feet, a Southwest Airlines jet blew an engine today, midair, while on its way to New York City, leaving an opening in the plane that nearly sucked somebody out. One passenger is dead. Julie Banderas joins us from our newsroom with the full story. Julie."

The flight from New York to Dallas made an emergency landing in Philadelphia this morning. And in the thick of it all, a harrowing rescue in midair. There are multiple reports, witnesses saw a piece of shrapnel from the engine blow out a window and a female passenger was then partially sucked out of that window hull before her fellow flyers scrambled to her rescue. She, unfortunately, later died. Still unknown what her injuries were that caused her death, sadly. But, listen to one passenger describe his horror story."

The FAA says the emergency landing on flight 1380 happened at 11:20 this morning after the crew reported damage to one of the aircraft engine, the fuselage and the window. Passengers are seen exiting the plane using those air stairs. Some of the passengers have been sharing their harrowing stories on social media, such as Marty Martinez, he briefly, in fact, went live even on Facebook. And there you see him wearing an oxygen mask. And in his post he wrote this, engine exploded in the air and blew open window three seats away from me. Imagine that being one of his friends on Facebook reading that. He says the explosion injured a female sitting in the seat next to the window. The plane departed from New York, LaGuardia Airport, tracking data from flight where dotcom shows the flight was heading west over New York southern tier before abruptly turning toward Philadelphia. But, Dana, when you look back at these pictures, you have to wonder how incredible and how many heroes were on board that plane, not just the pilots to land that thing with one engine, but the crewmembers and the passengers on board that tried to save this woman. Sadly, she later died at the airport -- at the hospital."

But you see here, again, it's the human spirit, people jumping and trying to help one another, and the thoughts and reflections about, you know, your life. You get up in the morning and we expect we're going to go to bed that night just gives you a bit of pause to say sometimes totally random things can happen out of the blue, and in the blue, like this particular situation. But, they'll do a full and thorough investigation, get all the forensics, find out what happened, and then they'll be issues as to whether or not there's any culpability, liability in part of Southwest. Was there any -- in terms of the engine logs or the records, maintenance logs for the airplane to determine if there was any kind of forewarning that something might have been wrong before this happened."

The small planes -- we go back to '09, there was a small plane I think that had a de-icing problem in Buffalo. And before that, you go back to, like, 2006, and it was a small plane coming out of Kentucky, and it had a short runway, didn't quite get up and then crashed. And then you lose -- I think in both cases, you lost 45, 50 people. In this case, you're in a big plane, a Boeing 737. They never have problems. I think -- I don't know when the last time an engine exploded, but you never hear this. This is really an extraordinary event for people who fly airplanes because we all think American aviation is so safe. And the big planes never have a problem."

And, you know, I guess, maybe one of the lessons is when they're doing the safety demonstration to pay attention, because if you're in the exit row and you don't know what you're doing or you don't know to operate you air mask, that's very important. It looks like there were a lot of heroes out there. You take safety for granted when you fly in this country. This never happens in America, and it shouldn't happen in America. We're too advance and too well-regulated. And, obviously, this was a freak accident. And the investigation is going to show what happened. But you hear about this in other countries a lot, in Africa, in Egypt, in Malaysia, or Ukraine. And, it just speaks to how kind, you know, kind of advanced and proficient the American airline industry is. I hope Southwest does right by these passengers and gives them more than a free upgrade for the next flight. They have to take care of these people. This is one of the things that will leave you, you know, scarred forever. And the stock price has taken a huge slide today, recovered a little bit. But Southwest is ranked really high, according to the other airlines. But, at the same time, they've had a lot of P.R. disasters. They've had computers crashed. They've had these emotional support dogs bite people. They've had fights. They've had to drag women out, they were fighting and kicking and screaming, they serial overbooked flights. They don't do that anymore. So, hopefully, Southwest can recover from this, and all these people I hope are recovering too."

But, to your point, it was just a very good point because you have the video and stuff that makes it more interesting.

      "speaker": "GUILFOYLE",
      "utterance": "Well, right. Obviously, there's probably going to be a tremendous amount of, like, you know, civil lawsuits. But it's going to depend on the results of the investigation, what they determined happened, whether it was human error, whether there was any kind of conscious disregard for unknown risk, you know, acting in defiance of that, or just negligence, or saying, OK, we'll let this plane fly for however many more hours when perhaps they should have back. We don't know this yet. But these are the type of things they will be looking for in terms of the record. Now, we are pretty scrupulous in terms of how we keep our records and all of the flight tracking, maintenance. It's very important because one time is one time too many. If you let a plane go up in the air and you cleared it to fly and something is, you know, terribly amiss. So, things can happen in general. So, if there's any idea of something that's malfunctioning, or engine lights going on, or something like that, very curious to see the flight history for the past, you know, say, 50 to 100 flights that this particular airplane went on. Generally speaking, phenomenal aeronautics for a 737, and they've been proved to be very reliable, have a tremendous safety record, so now we'll have to see what went wrong here and how Southwest can improve upon it. They do a lot of short flights, quick commuter flights, that's saying with their airplanes."

Mr. Trump chided the state's governor this morning on twitter saying looks like Jerry Brown and California are not looking for safety and security along their very porous border. He cannot come to terms for the National Guard to patrol and to protect the border. The high crime rate will only get higher. Responding to the president this morning, Governor Brown said he believes there is a compromise to be made on sending National Guard troops to the border to help the feds, but believes the administration is waging war against his state."

Far from it, we destroyed the indigenous people and had nothing with immigration. That's the story of California. I think we ought to remember that as we chart our rules.

California has been at war with the federal government for years. They've been at war over immigration, climate, marijuana, everything. There's always California, and there's always the rest of the country. That's not new. And the Border Patrol, they're just getting freed up by the National Guard. The National Guard is not out there apprehending people. They're doing stuff in the back office off the front lines to support. Now, listen, if I was an illegal alien and I was poor and I had no future, I'd come to this country, too. At the same time, you have to respect the line. You have to respect the law. You can't let everybody come in, or else that cheapens the entire system. California is paying the price of this, though. I mean, the cost of illegal immigration, according to the latest study, $23 billion. That is a lot of money that taxpayers are paying for illegal immigration.

When Comey brings the memos outside the FBI headquarters and leaks them, under both FBI standards and the Federal Records Act, those memos belong to the FBI. You can hit him with theft of government property. That's a misdemeanor. Only a year and a small fine. Or disclosure of classified information. That's a felony. Ten years, 250k. That's a little more serious. So according to the law -- and I know Comey is a strict guy, he's an ethical guy, he does everything by the book.

And so there are consequences being paid by FBI agents for the very thing that we're talking about with other FBI agents, including McCabe. The other thing is, is that what he has done has alienated himself so much. I'm sure the book will sell. That -- that goal is not a problem. But that if you, I don't think he's trying to win any friends, necessarily. The Democrats are more mad at him then the Republicans. And kind of for good reason.

So he better hope he knows better than if he made prior consistent, inconsistent statements, in classified or unclassified materials. Then on the book, then with George Stephanopoulos. And he's just talking, talking, talking. NPR, all of the above. I've got to tell you something. You're supposed to get approval for a book like this, especially in the middle of an investigation. But Comey is actually favoring, you know, profits and personal, you know, pandering to actually being concerned about justice and allowing the investigation to go forward that Mueller is doing. This puts the witnesses, the whole investigation in jeopardy. Who are they going to be able to put forward that's going to be credible? People are now going to have all of these different things that they can be impeached on.

So she went to court, waited in line, filled out paperwork, but sadly, she was denied. You can call this art or self-promotion. I call it clueless. She's doing this as we just dropped missiles on Syria for using chemical weapons on kids. So her actions actually ignore Trump's real response to actual suffering, as opposed to what's going on in her head. She's also not up-to-date on world events. The risk for nuclear war is actually shrinking. North and South Korea are now planning serious talks. Who spurred that? More important, chances are we all know women -- moms, sisters, coworkers -- faced with threats who have had to file restraining orders. It's not comedy. It's terror. That Maria was in a government office, wasting valuable time, perhaps while other women were waiting to get real restraining orders against real threats makes this joke less funny. I doubt the women there had the time for clever PR stunts. But because Maria is cool and hates Trump, she'll be cheered by her peers. Not so much by victims seeking real protection.
