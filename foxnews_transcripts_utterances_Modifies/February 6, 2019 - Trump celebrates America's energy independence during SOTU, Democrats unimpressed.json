      "sentences": "Good evening and welcome to “Tucker Carlson Tonight.” The President delivered his second State of the Union address last night. He hit a panoramic range of topics as they always do. Everything from economic growth to childhood cancer. As notable as what he said was though, more interestingly was the reaction he got. Even on topics where you'd expect to find some bipartisan agreement -- record low black unemployment for example or the country's thrilling and totally unexpected energy boom that has made us independent, Democrats, as they heard these words, sat in angry silence. Watch this response to the suddenly controversial suggestion that it's wrong to kill children.",

      "sentences": "Imagine that. For Democrats, it was an awfully grim night as you just saw. The only flashes of cheerfulness came when the President noted that a record number of women had won election in the last cycle, and at that, Democrats stood and cheered heartily for themselves. Some of them danced. Winning elections is what really matters. They didn't hide that. We'll have more details from the speech in just a minute. But first tonight, we have still more news to bring you from that chaotic developing nation formerly known as the Commonwealth of Virginia.  As of tonight, Virginia's three highest ranking public officials, all of them Democrats, are embroiled in potentially career-ending scandals and it seemed to come out of nowhere just last week.   First you'll remember, Democratic Governor Ralph Northam casually endorsed infanticide while defending a Democratic bill to legalize abortion right up to the minute of birth. Then just hours after he said that, a little over a day, I think, Northam was found to have a picture of man wearing a Klu Klux Klan uniform and blackface on his med school yearbook page. Oops. Almost immediately, pretty much the entire Democratic Party leadership called on Ralph Northam to resign his office and among the most vocal was the Attorney General of Virginia, Mark Herring.   Herring was appalled - appalled that Northam would do this. He just couldn't believe that someone could be that racist, and then today, Herring admitted that he too has appeared in blackface, which apparently is the equivalent of business casual for Democrats in Virginia. Will Herring resign over this revelation? Will party leaders ask him to resign? We're still waiting to find out. But in the meantime, we are mesmerized as well by the saga of Virginia Lieutenant Governor Justin Fairfax. Just days ago, Fairfax thought he was going to replace Ralph Northam as Governor. Then it turned out that he too may be forced to resign from office because a Professor in California called Vanessa Tyson says that Fairfax violently sexually assaulted her at the 2004 Democratic National Convention in Boston where both of them were volunteering because both are fervent Democrats. At the time, Fairfax was a quote, \"Body man for disgraced Senator John Edwards\" because the details here are just too perfect to make up. Tyson came forward a couple of days ago, and when she did, according to two sources who were in the room, Fairfax's first response to the story from Vanessa Tyson was quote, \"F that (EXPLETIVE).\" It's not really the classic feminist reaction to an allegation of sexual assault.  Now, Lieutenant Governor -- rather, Tyson - Vanessa Tyson has released a highly detailed account of what she says happened to her and how it has affected her life ever since. It's all online and it makes for a harrowing reading if you care to read it.   For Democrats though, the response to all of this ought to be really obvious because they just went through something amazingly similar a few months ago. Another Professor from California accused another public figure of far less serious crimes with far fewer corroborating details. Democrats know they have to believe all women. They have told us that countless times, but this time, they don't believe all women. They don't care about Vanessa Tyson. \"F her\" in the words of the Lieutenant Governor. She is in the way.  Watch presidential candidate Cory Booker, a self-described very good person dismiss Tyson completely today as unimportant. Watch this.",

So say goodbye to air travel and the car in your driveway, not to mention, a huge part of our economy. How is that for a platform? Austan Goolsbee is an economist, University of Chicago. He chaired the Council of Economic of Advisors for President Obama. He joins us tonight. Austan, thanks a lot for coming on. So I'm confuse by this. I understand that there are some forms of energy that people find preferable to others. That's totally fair. But the United States is now by some measures, the biggest energy producer in the world, a net exporter of it, no longer dependent upon Middle East oil. This was the goal we were striving towards. We achieved it, and Democrats look mad about that. Why?",

Now, we've got to be crystal clear at the top. These were the so-called snap polls that are not giving us a wide swathe of the electorate, just a tiny little snapshot of the people who actually watched the speech. Millions of people, but it's not the entire electorate. And if the polls show the public hated the speech, you can imagine some anchors might have reported that bad news with glee. Instead, the CBS poll for example, showed among those who watched the speech, 76% approved of what the President said overall, and get this, 72% said they specifically approve of the President's ideas on immigration. CNN had an instant poll, 59% said they were quote-unquote \"very positive\" about the speech; 17% said they were somewhat positive. That gives the president at 76% positive rating.

      "sentences": "A woman named Stacey Abrams gave the Democratic rebuttal to the State of the Union address last night. Abrams is not an office holder, she's a former state legislator from Georgia. She lost the governor's race there in the last election. Nevertheless, party leaders clearly have big plans for Abrams. Her speech last night wasn't much. She talked mostly about herself. But far more interesting is a piece that Abrams wrote in this month's \"Foreign Affairs\" magazine. The piece is called \"Identity Politics Strengthens Democracy\" and if you want to understand what the Democratic Party seeks for this country, you ought to read the piece. Abrams went to Yale Law School, so the article itself is a chore to get through. It's written in that cloying indirect academic style that passes for erudition among our credentialed elites. Lots of meaningless adjectives, very few declarative sentences, but you'll get the point anyway. It's crystal clear. Quote, \"By embracing identity,\" Abrams writes in the final sentence, \"Americans will become more likely to grow as one.\" So ponder that for a second. The less we have in common, the more united we will be. Is that true? Well, of course not. It's absurd. Even Stacey Abrams doesn't really believe it. Nobody does. Abrams doesn't bother to defend that premise, much less explain how exactly identity politics will unite this country. Unity is definitely not what Stacey Abrams is interested in. Just the opposite. What she's selling is bitter division. Abrams spends the bulk of the piece calling what she describes as the marginalized to unite against the quote, \"dominant groups.\" So who is marginalized and who is dominant? That's not a small question. In the scheme of identity politics, it's the only question that matters. Everything rides on who is the victim and who is the oppressor, that's the entire equation. And Abrams spells out the answer in very clear language. \"The marginalized,\" she writes include, quote, \"Women, Native Americans, African-American, immigrants and the LGBTQ community.\" The dominant are everyone who is left. So do the subtraction. That is only one group. You know exactly who they are, and so does Stacey Abrams. She says these people, these unnamed people are responsible for the suffering of everyone else, and we need to overthrow them. She uses language of violence and war to describe what must come next, quote, \"Politics is the most effective method of revolt.\" Revolt. People get hurt in revolts. That's the natue of revolts. Stacey Abrams knows that. She wants one anyway. She doesn't hide it. Demagoguery like this would make a certain kind of sense if your only interest was in winning elections and you didn't care what happened afterwards. That's where Democrats are right now. The Democratic Party is a highly unstable collection of interest groups. Many of them with radically different interests and goals. It's not a natural coalition. There's no reason all of these groups should be voting for the same candidates in every election. The only way to keep a fractious group like this together is by inventing a common enemy that everyone can oppose. You're one of us if you hate these people. And this often works in the short term. It worked for Democrats in the Jim Crow South for about a hundred years. And that's why they still do it. The problem is that these people, these dominant groups as Stacey Abrams, says, aren't some foreign invader from a faraway land, they're your countrymen. You're not supposed to hate them or hurt them, or revolt against them. They is us. We're in this together. We're all Americans. That's the most important thing, really the only important thing. Stacey Abrams doesn't see it that way, neither do the leaders of her party. They think they can win the next election by telling Americans they must hate their neighbors for the color of their skin. It's possible this will work one more time. But then what happens after the election? Abrams doesn't answer that question in her piece, she doesn't care. But the rest of us should think about it. No election is worth the hatred and the division of identity politics, not if you plan to live here anyway. Elections in this country used to be based on issues or that was the common agreement anyway. But what would happen to a country in which power is allocated on the basis of qualities you couldn't control. Things you were born with. Your skin color, your gender, your genetics. That would be called identity politics. The Heritage Foundation's David Azerrad has been studying this question and he joins us tonight with the answer. David, thank you very much for coming on. So what happens to a country that is run with identity politics?",

He hit a panoramic range of topics as they always do. Everything from economic growth to childhood cancer. As notable as what he said was though, more interestingly was the reaction he got. Even on topics where you'd expect to find some bipartisan agreement -- record low black unemployment for example or the country's thrilling and totally unexpected energy boom that has made us independent, Democrats, as they heard these words, sat in angry silence. Watch this response to the suddenly controversial suggestion that it's wrong to kill children."

The only flashes of cheerfulness came when the President noted that a record number of women had won election in the last cycle, and at that, Democrats stood and cheered heartily for themselves. Some of them danced. Winning elections is what really matters. They didn't hide that. We'll have more details from the speech in just a minute. But first tonight, we have still more news to bring you from that chaotic developing nation formerly known as the Commonwealth of Virginia. As of tonight, Virginia's three highest ranking public officials, all of them Democrats, are embroiled in potentially career-ending scandals and it seemed to come out of nowhere just last week. First you'll remember, Democratic Governor Ralph Northam casually endorsed infanticide while defending a Democratic bill to legalize abortion right up to the minute of birth. Then just hours after he said that, a little over a day, I think, Northam was found to have a picture of man wearing a Klu Klux Klan uniform and blackface on his med school yearbook page. Oops. Almost immediately, pretty much the entire Democratic Party leadership called on Ralph Northam to resign his office and among the most vocal was the Attorney General of Virginia, Mark Herring. Herring was appalled - appalled that Northam would do this. He just couldn't believe that someone could be that racist, and then today, Herring admitted that he too has appeared in blackface, which apparently is the equivalent of business casual for Democrats in Virginia. Will Herring resign over this revelation? Will party leaders ask him to resign? We're still waiting to find out. But in the meantime, we are mesmerized as well by the saga of Virginia Lieutenant Governor Justin Fairfax. Just days ago, Fairfax thought he was going to replace Ralph Northam as Governor. Then it turned out that he too may be forced to resign from office because a Professor in California called Vanessa Tyson says that Fairfax violently sexually assaulted her at the 2004 Democratic National Convention in Boston where both of them were volunteering because both are fervent Democrats. At the time, Fairfax was a quote, \"Body man for disgraced Senator John Edwards\" because the details here are just too perfect to make up. Tyson came forward a couple of days ago, and when she did, according to two sources who were in the room, Fairfax's first response to the story from Vanessa Tyson was quote, \"F that (EXPLETIVE).\" It's not really the classic feminist reaction to an allegation of sexual assault. Now, Lieutenant Governor -- rather, Tyson - Vanessa Tyson has released a highly detailed account of what she says happened to her and how it has affected her life ever since. It's all online and it makes for a harrowing reading if you care to read it. For Democrats though, the response to all of this ought to be really obvious because they just went through something amazingly similar a few months ago. Another Professor from California accused another public figure of far less serious crimes with far fewer corroborating details. Democrats know they have to believe all women. They have told us that countless times, but this time, they don't believe all women. They don't care about Vanessa Tyson. \"F her\" in the words of the Lieutenant Governor. She is in the way. Watch presidential candidate Cory Booker, a self-described very good person dismiss Tyson completely today as unimportant. Watch this."

So when you looked at the allegations against Justice Kavanaugh and when you looked at the allegations against Lieutenant Governor Fairfax, you have to look at them with the same eye. That is, for me as a prosecutor, would I bring this case? Does this make a prosecutable case? Are the allegations credible? What do both parties say?

When you say things like \"Believe all women,\" and then the other side is saying, \"There's something wrong with her because she didn't come forward many years ago,\" which is common among sexual assault survivors, it just shows victims that they can't trust anyone, and that's my biggest concern here. It is that when victims come forward and many, many studies have shown that survivors delay reporting abuse for years or even decades. We are telling them that they should never come forward and we can't have that as a nation if we expect to protect survivors and prosecute abusers."

And they are proposing to shut the whole thing down, the entire energy sector -- the fossil fuel sector -- in a dozen years. Ban oil, ban coal, ban natural gas.

Now, we've got to be crystal clear at the top. These were the so-called snap polls that are not giving us a wide swathe of the electorate, just a tiny little snapshot of the people who actually watched the speech. Millions of people, but it's not the entire electorate. And if the polls show the public hated the speech, you can imagine some anchors might have reported that bad news with glee. Instead, the CBS poll for example, showed among those who watched the speech, 76% approved of what the President said overall, and get this, 72% said they specifically approve of the President's ideas on immigration. CNN had an instant poll, 59% said they were quote-unquote \"very positive\" about the speech; 17% said they were somewhat positive. That gives the president at 76% positive rating.

And what exactly did he do with all of that power? Those are the questions you might ask yourself about John Brennan after watching him on TV, and it's not reassuring at all. Well, identity politics is the new rallying cry of the Democratic Party, but what happens to a country where basic questions are decided on the basis of a DNA? Can country like that function? We'll investigate after the break."

      "utterance": "A woman named Stacey Abrams gave the Democratic rebuttal to the State of the Union address last night. Abrams is not an office holder, she's a former state legislator from Georgia. She lost the governor's race there in the last election. Nevertheless, party leaders clearly have big plans for Abrams. Her speech last night wasn't much. She talked mostly about herself. But far more interesting is a piece that Abrams wrote in this month's \"Foreign Affairs\" magazine. The piece is called \"Identity Politics Strengthens Democracy\" and if you want to understand what the Democratic Party seeks for this country, you ought to read the piece. Abrams went to Yale Law School, so the article itself is a chore to get through. It's written in that cloying indirect academic style that passes for erudition among our credentialed elites. Lots of meaningless adjectives, very few declarative sentences, but you'll get the point anyway. It's crystal clear. Quote, \"By embracing identity,\" Abrams writes in the final sentence, \"Americans will become more likely to grow as one.\" So ponder that for a second. The less we have in common, the more united we will be. Is that true? Well, of course not. It's absurd. Even Stacey Abrams doesn't really believe it. Nobody does. Abrams doesn't bother to defend that premise, much less explain how exactly identity politics will unite this country. Unity is definitely not what Stacey Abrams is interested in. Just the opposite. What she's selling is bitter division. Abrams spends the bulk of the piece calling what she describes as the marginalized to unite against the quote, \"dominant groups.\" So who is marginalized and who is dominant? That's not a small question. In the scheme of identity politics, it's the only question that matters. Everything rides on who is the victim and who is the oppressor, that's the entire equation. And Abrams spells out the answer in very clear language. \"The marginalized,\" she writes include, quote, \"Women, Native Americans, African-American, immigrants and the LGBTQ community.\" The dominant are everyone who is left. So do the subtraction. That is only one group. You know exactly who they are, and so does Stacey Abrams. She says these people, these unnamed people are responsible for the suffering of everyone else, and we need to overthrow them. She uses language of violence and war to describe what must come next, quote, \"Politics is the most effective method of revolt.\" Revolt. People get hurt in revolts. That's the natue of revolts. Stacey Abrams knows that. She wants one anyway. She doesn't hide it. Demagoguery like this would make a certain kind of sense if your only interest was in winning elections and you didn't care what happened afterwards. That's where Democrats are right now. The Democratic Party is a highly unstable collection of interest groups. Many of them with radically different interests and goals. It's not a natural coalition. There's no reason all of these groups should be voting for the same candidates in every election. The only way to keep a fractious group like this together is by inventing a common enemy that everyone can oppose. You're one of us if you hate these people. And this often works in the short term. It worked for Democrats in the Jim Crow South for about a hundred years. And that's why they still do it. The problem is that these people, these dominant groups as Stacey Abrams, says, aren't some foreign invader from a faraway land, they're your countrymen. You're not supposed to hate them or hurt them, or revolt against them. They is us. We're in this together. We're all Americans. That's the most important thing, really the only important thing. Stacey Abrams doesn't see it that way, neither do the leaders of her party. They think they can win the next election by telling Americans they must hate their neighbors for the color of their skin. It's possible this will work one more time. But then what happens after the election? Abrams doesn't answer that question in her piece, she doesn't care. But the rest of us should think about it. No election is worth the hatred and the division of identity politics, not if you plan to live here anyway. Elections in this country used to be based on issues or that was the common agreement anyway. But what would happen to a country in which power is allocated on the basis of qualities you couldn't control. Things you were born with. Your skin color, your gender, your genetics. That would be called identity politics. The Heritage Foundation's David Azerrad has been studying this question and he joins us tonight with the answer. David, thank you very much for coming on. So what happens to a country that is run with identity politics?"

      "utterance": "In the short term, it kind of works because the majority group doesn't play along with it, and kind of keeps quiet and does the public self-flagellation to atone for the sins of the father. But in the long run, it's untenable. How much longer until whites say, \"Why don't we get to have an identity?\" And the day that happens, then you get some form of Yugoslavia or Rwanda, you get Balkanization and you get ethnic tribalism, groups fighting against one another. So it's tenable in the short term. I just don't see how you can still have a country in the long run with identity politics. And the great paradox is, it may well create namely white nationalism what they claim to oppose today."

So have you ever seen -- so Stacey Abrams, but it's not -- I don't mean to pick on Stacey Abrams, she represents much larger group of people who tell us the same thing, which is, \"This works. We must embrace it.\" The question is, does it work? Have you -- you studied this question extensively, you're a scholar. Is there a country in which this way of looking at the world has produced a stable nation?"

I mean, if you want to have a strong united country, you want the citizens to be united. Now, we'll have a free country. You don't want everyone to be the same. You need to make an allowance for pluralism. But it is not good to promote division. I am fine having hyphenated Americans, what bothers me is if you emphasize the part that comes before the American part. I think you can recognize hyphenated Americans. But you emphasize the commonalities, the shared history, the shared devotion to Republican principals, the love the country, and if there is one thing that identity politics is very strong on is making you hate your country, making you despise your past, making you hate your fellow countrymen."

There's a lot of kinds of immigration, but we should say because it's true that a lot of people who would help this country and ought to be allowed to stay here are prevented by the government bureaucracy from doing so. After the break, we're going to meet a Harvard graduate who spent more than a decade trying to get a green card, but for reasons that weren't clear and incredibly stupid, didn't.

We already get a lot of legal immigrants, nearly two million came to this country in 2017, and most of them came on the basis of a single fact. Did someone from their family get here first? So basically, it's a system based on genetics, rather than merit, and that has a downside. One that we have not talked about much on the show. Many qualified people who should be living here and would benefit the United States if they did are denied admission or the ability to stay. Christine Mikolajuk is one of those people. She did not make the cut. She spent a decade following the rules. She went to Harvard. She speaks fluent English. She's highly qualified.

Seventy percent of green cards are given to people because of their family and whether they have a connection to citizen already. And that's fine. You know, you should be able it bring in a spouse.

And this happens to a lot of people, so 14% of my graduating class was foreign. And these are people who have big dreams of coming to America, you know, going to its great schools. They want to create a life here. They love it here. And then once they graduate, they have to leave. And most of those people, most of those 14% now live elsewhere, and they can go elsewhere.

You know what's coming out here, I think due to opposition research, Tucker, is we're starting to find out the outlines of this grift, you know. It starts like a small-time criminal, you know starts with shoplifting. She starts out with that cookbook, the plagiarized recipes. Nobody calls her out on it. Now she files this application with the Texas Bar. Nobody calls her out on it. So she just keeps upping the ante and so a year later, she puts in that she's an Indian in the American law school directory and ding-ding-ding, Tucker. You know what happens, she's suddenly at the University of Pennsylvania Ivy League Law School, then she's at Harvard making major wampum for many moons. You know, $350,000.00 a year. And she has gotten away with it, but you're right, she's all done now. She's announcing her candidacy on Saturday then she's got to go to seven different states.
