She's also a model for Talbots for the past several years to raise money for the nonprofit Dress for Success, but she specializes in fishing, Adriana Cohen is here. Adriana, I want to start with you on this one. James Clapper not only lied in 2013, to the senate panel. In 2010 -- I don't know if you remember this, I distinctly remember watching this interview. James Clapper as the DNI at the time, as well, was being interviewed by Diane Sawyer, and she said, hey, what about these London bombers that were just caught? He had no idea that the London bombers were just caught three hours earlier. So here's a guy who are now -- we're interviewing him, the left wing media interviewing him as an expert, but the guy is number one uninformed, and number two has lied to us."

I mean, before congress, under oath he said, he denied knowing anything about intelligence surveillance of average civilians. And then we've found out through Snowden, that's not the case. The government is doing this massive metadata collection. So he's lost the American people's trust there. And even with Benghazi, he wasn't exactly forthcoming. And so, I don't know why these left-wing leaning media outlets continue to have him on, other than to disparage Donald Trump, which is what the left-wing media has been trying to do and has been doing, actually, quite successfully since he was inaugurated."

OK, last week you said you didn't do anything, and you probably didn't do anything, but what if you did do something? Should you be brought up on that? It's just the same question."

I actually think a lot of these problems that the White House is seeing are their own creation, Eric. I think they've got a lot of competing narratives. I think they're -- inefficient messaging coming out of the White House. And maybe to President Trump's point, that can be eradicated, right. If there's a singular messaging going on, one that is more consistent with something the people can understand more plainly because right now I think that's part of the problem."

So this desire for disruption is equal among those on the left and the right. Let me add one other thing, though, back to our last topic, which is it is so funny that now the media, and even situations like this, want to focus on an election that is 18 months away, saying, oh, his approval rating is 38 percent. That means Republicans are going to be destroyed in the next election. They didn't know 18 minutes before the election results what was going to happen. And now we have a media that wants to obsess over how Donald Trump is doing right now based off polling numbers that they're coming out with. And that's why Gates' comments are so credentialed building for President Trump. That he's doing the right thing. That he is the disruptor that Americans ultimately voted for."

She wanted to see a mix-up, a change, and she didn't feel that she'll get that for Secretary Clinton. But, also to Gates' point, the way goes about, right. That matters, too. And I'm not going to accuse the president of anything. We don't have any evidence of anything at this point. But there are those of us, E, that are looking to see what that looks like. And I want to talk about the approval rating, right now 29 percent approve of the way Comey was fired. You've got 38 percent that get approve. But, you know what, 32 percent are like me. We don't have enough information yet. And, you know, the ACLU coming out and asking for this information through the freedom of information act. I think that would actually do the White House a favor. That would (INAUDIBLE) Buchanan's point on the program last week. Take some of that cloud of suspicion perhaps away."

Wait so long and then do it all of a sudden, why he's in L.A.? The reason you didn't treat Hillary Clinton fair enough when you were smiling and nodding and people we're saying lock her up. I mean, people are going to have these questions, and if they're not satisfied, then we should get answers to these questions in order to move on. There's no legislative or executive way to make the minds of Americans stop thinking about something. And they're still thinking about that."

There's been polling done recently that said if we could have the election again right now, the majority of Trump supporters would be all in and vote for him, yet, again. But, you know, going back to just the rigged media, which is the left-wing media, has been totally unfair to this president. I mean, since day one, they have tried to delegitimize his presidency, and they have floated all this fake news about him, from, you know, palace intrigue stories that were never true, to the Russian dossier which was unsubstantiated. I mean, there's so much fake news out there, that I feel terribly sorry for this administration because they're really up against a hostile enemy."

So when we talk about false facts around the president, they're never fair, they're never right, but I think in Donald J. Trump's case he's got to take it as well as he gave it."

I'm going to start with you, David. So personally, I'm not a fan of just flat out refusing to appoint these critically important positions. I didn't like not offering Judge Garland a confirmation vote either. But here's the question, are there instances where special prosecutor is important?

And being more open instead of -- and I understand if people were telling me that I was colluding with Russia all day long and I totally didn't do it, I would probably get irritated with it a lot also.

If we don't have trust in these bodies of government, the department of justice, FBI, we have a bigger problem on our hands. And I submit that we do.

Boko Haram alone has displaced over two million Nigerians. And then look at all the millions of refugees coming out of Iraq and Syria. We have to address it, for their own safety, innocent civilian safety. But then also, we're going to keep having this horrific refugee crisis on our hands.

      "utterance": "But I don't know, Kat, if that's what she was saying. She happens to work for the government. I don't -- I didn't get from her comment that she's thinking that everyone's health care has to come from the government as much as it should come from their job and their place of employment, whether that's private or public sector. I think the problem for me is yes, I think you should work and you should have health care accordingly. I hate that there are many of us that do work and get out of bed, and that's why we have the working poor, many of whom voted for Donald J. Trump, because they believe, as people that participate in our economy in this way, health care should be something that they can afford."

      "utterance": "For most Americans, it's not about privilege or right. It's about service. And if you can't get to a doctor because of the doctor shortage we face; if your insurance company has left because they don't want to be a part of Obamacare any more, you can't get service. And when you do, you want to make sure it's good quality. That's why junk lawsuits need to be dealt with. Look, there are many things the Republicans in Congress need to deal with with health care, and it starts with service. It's not about privilege. It's not about right."

My wife, on Mother's Day. The doctor, a fantastic doctor -- Dr. Dorphy (ph), you're amazing -- he pulled me aside. He said, \"You know what's going on here? Good doctors are take -- are pushing back on insurance. They're saying, 'I'm going to do a private -- private practice without insurance' because of the bureaucracy and all the hurdles they're making our doctors go through.\" You're 100 percent right. They're having a doctor shortage."
