You are looking live at Los Angeles, where 2020 Democrat Joe Biden is about to speak, as Michael Bloomberg officially bows out of the presidential race, throwing his support to Biden.  And Joe ain't the only one surging. Look at stocks. Some are calling this the Biden buy. Whatever the fact is, we are up 1,171 points today, just today, Wall Street betting that if a Democrat were to beat President Trump, Biden's policies that would be better than, well, at least those of Bernie Sanders for the markets.  They might be getting ahead of themselves, but here's where we stand.  Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto. And say it is so, Joe. Given up for dead, Joe Biden the front and center front-runner right now.  We have got you covered with our Alex Hogan in New York, where Michael Bloomberg has just folded his wallet, and FOX Business' Deirdre Bolton on the candidate who is now off to the races.

You're going to see on your screens on the exact breakdown, so, Biden 566, Sanders at 501, and you can see, heavily trailing, Warren and then, as we know, Bloomberg has stepped out.  Now, Florida and Michigan is yet to come, arguably the next most important contests. In Michigan, Sanders scooped Hillary Clinton in the primaries, and then President Trump beat Hillary Clinton by the narrowest of margins, 0.23 percent in the general election. Now, as we go and move forward to Florida, you will see, of course, that we know President Obama carried it twice, narrowly, perhaps the most purple state in the nation, we could say. And then President Trump flipping the state narrowly in 2016, beating Hillary Clinton by just a little bit more than 1 percent.   One takeaway, though, Neil from last night, Democratic voters may not be as focused on Medicare for all as a single issue, because, otherwise, Senator Sanders would have won more delegates. Sanders wants everyone to have the same insurance plan provided by the government. Private insurance plans under his Medicare for all would be prohibited. That may be too extreme for many Democrats because we saw -- we can -- saw it on the chart -- Biden won more votes last night. The markets' reaction also showing relief today, UnitedHealth's best performance in more than a decade, Cigna, Anthem both higher as well with big gains, health care by far the biggest contributor to the S&P 500 today.  Neil, so there does seem to be a little bit of relief in this rally that Biden at least for the moment is in the pole position, but, as you alluded to, much more to go now -- Neil, back to you.",

So, at that point, I think a payroll tax could actually help inject some cash flow to both consumers and them. On the other hand, it doesn't change behavior. When it's been used as stimulus before, it really hasn't achieved that.  And so I think maybe my best advice, just in totality, is, one, let's get the diagnosis right in the economy as we watch what happens on the supply chains, which industries are affected, how it affects those small and medium-sized businesses. Secondly, though, I think one thing has become very clear. Right in the president's, I think, book here is, we need a medicines made in America strategy, where we take a look at our regulations and tax code to see what we can do to drive more of the medical development and manufacturing back here to the United States, not just for the medicines themselves, but the technologies, the treatments, the equipment that goes with it, yes.",

The 78-year-old is the 23rd Democratic nominee to drop out of race, and he's just the latest to endorse the former V.P., who surprised many critics in a sweeping win of states different votes, of course, on Super Tuesday yesterday.

      "utterance": "Yes, that is exactly right, Neil. So it's still early, some pretty big contests to come. So here's where we stand right now. We all know 1,991 delegates needed to win. You're going to see on your screens on the exact breakdown, so, Biden 566, Sanders at 501, and you can see, heavily trailing, Warren and then, as we know, Bloomberg has stepped out. Now, Florida and Michigan is yet to come, arguably the next most important contests. In Michigan, Sanders scooped Hillary Clinton in the primaries, and then President Trump beat Hillary Clinton by the narrowest of margins, 0.23 percent in the general election. Now, as we go and move forward to Florida, you will see, of course, that we know President Obama carried it twice, narrowly, perhaps the most purple state in the nation, we could say. And then President Trump flipping the state narrowly in 2016, beating Hillary Clinton by just a little bit more than 1 percent. One takeaway, though, Neil from last night, Democratic voters may not be as focused on Medicare for all as a single issue, because, otherwise, Senator Sanders would have won more delegates. Sanders wants everyone to have the same insurance plan provided by the government. Private insurance plans under his Medicare for all would be prohibited. That may be too extreme for many Democrats because we saw -- we can -- saw it on the chart -- Biden won more votes last night. The markets' reaction also showing relief today, UnitedHealth's best performance in more than a decade, Cigna, Anthem both higher as well with big gains, health care by far the biggest contributor to the S&P 500 today. Neil, so there does seem to be a little bit of relief in this rally that Biden at least for the moment is in the pole position, but, as you alluded to, much more to go now -- Neil, back to you."

So is all of this celebration in order? Democratic strategist David Burstein, FOX News contributor Deneen Borelli, and The New York Post's Kelly Jane Torrance. Deneen, what do you think of that, that maybe the markets are anticipating something that would, if a Joe Biden got elected, mean the end of a president who was been the wind at their back, strong markets, strong economy?

I have always said these guys aren't red or blue. They're green. They love money. They have made a lot of money under this president, just as they made a lot of money under Bill Clinton, didn't want to see him go.

Joe Biden is not as bad on, say, fracking as Bernie Sanders, but I think he is going to be pushed by his party to get tougher, and that would mean killing jobs in places like Pennsylvania. So, yes, the idea is, he's not as crazy as Bernie Sanders, but it's not just about Joe Biden. It's also about where his party is pushing him.

And losing very badly would mean dragging down down-ballot cases. And that's one of the things that people have become more and more focused on. When you talk to the Democrats who are elected in congressional districts who got the House to the majority, and the people who got -- are in close Senate races coming up, they would much rather be running with someone like Joe Biden than someone like Bernie Sanders.

If you talk to Richard Shelby, the chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee from Alabama, he will tell you it's $7.7 billion. If you talk to Nita Lowey, the chair of the House Appropriations Committee, she will tell you it's $8.3 billion. One of the big issues here is how this impacts local communities.

That's not to say that there won't be people who will become very ill with this virus. But, thus far, the case fatality rate is fairly low. We're being quoted figures as high as 3.5 percent by WHO and others, but that doesn't take into account those people who become infected and have only mild disease or no disease and never come to medical attention and never receive a diagnosis.

Think about taking on a World War and a Depression at the same time, quietly, bravely, without fanfare and without fanning the flames.

And I remember my mother saying to us when we were little, oh, my favorite cousin was killed at Iwo Jima. And when you're a kid, you think, where is that? What does that even mean? How is it relevant to me? But I do remember at one point saying to her, so, wait, Harry was 18 years old, and he was killed at Iwo Jima in his first day ever heading to the front line. And it just really moved me when I read the letters that he wrote. And what you were talking about in the beginning, I think, is one of the things that just grabs me so much to these stories, is just the humility of these men, the fact that they put something else before themselves all the time. And the way that they wrote their letters was -- you know, Harry would write letters home saying , we built a foxhole, it's really secure, mom, so don't worry about me.

The question would be, how quickly can we do that and with what models that can then enable us to move to human testing and all. At that point, I am certain that the regulatory authorities will work with industry and with developers to use -- under emergency use authorization, to be able to structure protocols that will enable us to go through that type of evaluation much faster than normal. And I would think it would be -- it can be shortened from beyond the year- and-a-half, maybe closer to a year. But time will tell."

Payroll tax cut?"

      "speaker": "REP. KEVIN BRADY (R-TX)",
      "utterance": "Hi, Neil. How are you? So, look, that's one of these mixed types of ideas. One, certainly, three to six months from now, we will see our small- and medium-sized businesses that may have some capital-type issues because of this health care challenge. We don't know that yet. So, at that point, I think a payroll tax could actually help inject some cash flow to both consumers and them. On the other hand, it doesn't change behavior. When it's been used as stimulus before, it really hasn't achieved that.  And so I think maybe my best advice, just in totality, is, one, let's get the diagnosis right in the economy as we watch what happens on the supply chains, which industries are affected, how it affects those small and medium-sized businesses. Secondly, though, I think one thing has become very clear. Right in the president's, I think, book here is, we need a medicines made in America strategy, where we take a look at our regulations and tax code to see what we can do to drive more of the medical development and manufacturing back here to the United States, not just for the medicines themselves, but the technologies, the treatments, the equipment that goes with it, yes."

We have had, as you know, 10 of these major health challenges the last three decades. There is some familiarity with them. Let's give the chance to look at this. The other thing, I do think we look at moving manufacturing of medicines back. We can look at a lower business rate to bring those manufacturing plants here. I think we should be muscling up a research and development tax credit anyway to become a lot more innovative. And I think we ought to be making..."

But I was awfully encouraged and impressed by just the response on the immediacy of this, how fast they are accelerating the tests out to the state and local areas, what they're doing on vaccine development and antivirals.

Now, usually reliable younger Bernie backers might have been fired up, but fewer actually turned out. And that made a big difference for Joe Biden. Should it be a big worry then for Donald Trump? To GOP pollster Lee Carter on why sleepy Joe maybe anything but. It's interesting.

So he's changed the math on that, but he's still the same guy, right? He's still the same candidate who has the flubs and everything else. But we were talking to a number of these Democratic backers and those who like Joe Biden and said, we don't care about the flubs.

Certainly, we will know more after next Tuesday. If Biden has good Tuesday next Tuesday, then we're going to see him to be the likely candidate. And Elizabeth Warren is hopefully going to be jockeying for something, maybe his vice president. Who knows if she's going to try to -- if they're going to try to pick up all sides and please all sides of the aisle. I think that the question right now, are Bernie's supporters going to get really energized? Because what they might be seeing right now is getting really ticked off, saying the establishment is against us, really working against us.

According to the World Health Organization, the coronavirus is three times more deadly than the flu. At least 10 virus-related deaths in the U.S. are linked to a nursing home in Seattle. An employee at nearby Amazon headquarters also tested positive. And President Trump and Vice President Pence met today with airline executives to discuss what they're doing to better protect passengers and managing the impact in airline travel. And among the things they talked about, improved cleaning procedures to better contain the virus. And that's an idea, Neil, that they're applying here in New York City as well.
