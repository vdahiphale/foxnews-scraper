And he has made it a goal to have American energy dominate on the global stage. And to that end, this afternoon, he will sign two executive orders aiming to boost oil and gas production by cutting red tape and easing regulations. A big one is the Clean Water Act. States are supposed to approve or deny applications to build pipelines within one year. But some states have delayed that decision and those projects for years by repeatedly asking for revisions or new studies. As a senior administration official told us, many states implement Section 401 faithfully. However, the implementation on occasion has caused delays in the permitting and development of energy infrastructure that would have broad regional and national benefits. This afternoon, the president will direct the EPA to review and update its guidelines for the Clean Water Act, so not overriding it or getting rid of it, but trying to force states to either approve or deny projects in a more timely fashion. Environmental groups argue that rushing the approval process is dangerous and it could lead to environmental disasters. But even some Republican governors have expressed concern that the administration is eroding states' rights with this move. So, like many of the president's executive orders, these could end up in the courts. And you can see behind me, though, you have the hardhats and yellow vests on the stage, the president expected to arrive here in just a few minutes, where he will speak here at an engineer training facility -- Charles.",

In the meantime, joining us now, Texas Republican Congressman Dan Crenshaw, who is a member of the Homeland Security Committee. Congressman, before we get into the president's visit to Texas today and talk about his border strategy, I would like your reaction to the attorney general today testifying that there was indeed the spying on the Trump campaign and that he's looking into it."

Representative Crenshaw, we heard about people finding dead bodies on their ranches, people afraid to go to their gates, homes -- afraid to answer their own doors. This is your part of the country. You know it well. Just how shocking these stories are, I don't think the American public has ever heard them before."

Just this year, just this fiscal year alone, there's been more apprehensions than in an entire over the last five years. We're at absolute crisis levels. OK? So, there's a problem and we need to fix it. And there's a real issue with the fact that we don't have partners on the other side of the aisle who even have a desire to fix it. All right? They didn't want the wall. OK?"

People are taking complete advantage of the asylum process. OK? They're coming over with families because they know if they bring a kid with them, it's basically their ticket across. And they know they will be released into the homeland. Well, that's an unsustainable policy. And it's not fair to legal immigrants. It's not fair to cut in front of them. It's not fair to these migrants. We should be telling them that they can claim asylum in their home countries or in Mexico, so they don't have to make this dangerous journey across the border, which, by the way, is completely controlled by drug cartels. This is resulting in human trafficking. It's resulting in kids being used and recycled over and over again by different adults to cross the border."

We need more immigration judges immediately. These cases need to be adjudicated fast. And if they're not found to be valid, then they can be deported right away. But, instead, what's happening is that we're being overwhelmed, and then everyone's just being released. OK? And then -- and then that's it."

      "speaker": "CRENSHAW",

All right, every immigrant who comes across has a different reason for wanting to come across, but it certainly isn't climate change. And that's just a ridiculous statement. They have gotten to this point where they want to blame climate change for quite literally everything now. And, sorry, but the Green New Deal is not going to solve that. Well, it will wreck our economy. So maybe we won't -- they -- immigrants won't want to come here anymore. So maybe that's what she's getting at."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CRENSHAW",
      "utterance": "Yes. Like I said, we need to reform the way our asylum process works immediately. We have to take into account the real problem here, which is that people are taking advantage of this process. OK, so what do we do? Well, we need more detention facilities immediately, OK? We need to actually be able to house these people while their cases are adjudicated, and we need the resources to adjudicate those cases. We need more immigration judges there now. And then they can be turned around and deported if their cases are not found to be valid. They should be taking asylum cases up in Mexico. They should be allowed to wait in Mexico, as the Trump administration wanted. We shouldn't allow activist judges to overturn that decision. By the way, there's precedent for that. President Clinton did the same thing with Haiti. OK, this is not -- this is not some crazy idea. It makes sense."

They called it -- it was Romneycare in Massachusetts. It was the Chafee health care bill in 1993. But, generally, it was the Republican side of the aisle's attempted health care reform, and it didn't work. We see premiums increased, a lack of coverage across the board. Obamacare is broken. The next step is not to simply repeal Obamacare and not put anything in its place, but rather to expand the Medicaid pool to cover more individuals, lower costs, and make sure that everyone has a baseline right to health care coverage."

So why would we go through with a terrible idea like this? But I want to point out, most of the issues that Democrats run on basically can be fixed with the job. I know lots of people that have good health insurance through their employer. And that can help. Now, for me, I know many people think, hey, why would you take Medicare for all and make it a mandate, instead of picking it and making it compete against private health insurance? Can they do that?

We pull all our troops out, and the Taliban will guarantee that ISIS and the Al Qaeda would not establish a safe haven from which to attack the United States.

      "utterance": "Well, Charles, as you well know, the booming energy sector is a big reason why the economy has been so strong since President Trump took office. And he has made it a goal to have American energy dominate on the global stage. And to that end, this afternoon, he will sign two executive orders aiming to boost oil and gas production by cutting red tape and easing regulations. A big one is the Clean Water Act. States are supposed to approve or deny applications to build pipelines within one year. But some states have delayed that decision and those projects for years by repeatedly asking for revisions or new studies. As a senior administration official told us, many states implement Section 401 faithfully. However, the implementation on occasion has caused delays in the permitting and development of energy infrastructure that would have broad regional and national benefits. This afternoon, the president will direct the EPA to review and update its guidelines for the Clean Water Act, so not overriding it or getting rid of it, but trying to force states to either approve or deny projects in a more timely fashion. Environmental groups argue that rushing the approval process is dangerous and it could lead to environmental disasters. But even some Republican governors have expressed concern that the administration is eroding states' rights with this move. So, like many of the president's executive orders, these could end up in the courts. And you can see behind me, though, you have the hardhats and yellow vests on the stage, the president expected to arrive here in just a few minutes, where he will speak here at an engineer training facility -- Charles."

Let's get reaction from market watcher Scott Martin. It's been a pretty good year for West Texas Intermediate. But it's not always -- it's not reflected always with these oil companies, because they need to get the oil out faster, and they need to get it to the market even more so. And they have got some issues there."

That's why I'm glad, per Garrett's report, that we are making some steps forward on how to get this stuff kind of built and flowing. I mean, in West Texas alone, there's thousands of oil wells, Charles, that are drilled, but not producing. So, yes, with respect to infrastructure pipelines that need to be built, that absolutely needs to get out there, because, yes, you're right. It has been a great year for West Texas crude, but, my goodness, even a better year for West Texas, just given that now the Permian Basin is the world's largest oil producer."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "MARTIN",
      "utterance": "Yes, it's a good thing. And I think really the reason that stocks and the economy, I guess, Charles, are taking it so well, as you put it, is because this is actually real energy policy. Before, the energy policy was, yes, we don't have -- we have energy, we have oil, we have natural gas off Florida, but the policy was, let's just not use it and, instead, let's rely on OPEC countries -- or OPEC, whose member countries with whom we have very poor relations. Let's rely on like a cartel like OPEC and Venezuela and all these other countries that are having terrible civil wars to regulate price and put pressure on us and our economy, instead of having our own energy policy, our own reliance on energy here. So the fact that this is back to the United States as being an energy powerhouse or say the United States being an energy powerhouse for the first time in decades, I think, is exciting for the economy and exciting for stocks."

It's not something that needs to be completely far off, where we're not going to do anything, and it doesn't need to be free-flowing either. It's something in the middle. And that's where I think a lot of things will come together, as Garrett reported, with some of the states feeling maybe like their rights are being compromised. I mean, things will come to the middle, and that's where we will come to a solution here. But the fact that we have things to work with respect to gas, with respect to oil, as we talked about, how much supply is out there, is really exciting to be in America today to actually have energy that we can rely on, that we will produce here."

As you know, we talk a lot about this on FOX Business. Markets backfill. They rise and then they come back to levels, and then rise again and go to highs.
