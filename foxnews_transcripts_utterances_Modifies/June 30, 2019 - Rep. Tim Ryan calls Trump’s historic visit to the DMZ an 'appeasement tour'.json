Joining me exclusively straight ahead right here on \"Sunday Morning Futures,\" Republican House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy with new reaction this morning to President Trump's historic crossing into North Korea to meet Kim Jong-un and the temporary trade cease-fire the president brokered with China's Xi Jinping.  Plus, 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Congressman Tim Ryan of Ohio is here.  Democratic Congressman Ro Khanna of California is here. He sits on the House Armed Services Committee and co-chairs the Bernie Sanders campaign.  Also ahead, Mike Pillsbury, who has been advising President Trump and trade adviser Peter Navarro on China trade talks. Plus, Ken Cuccinelli is here, acting director for U.S. citizenship and immigration services, on the crisis at our southern border.  All that right here, right now, as we look ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" And we begin this Sunday morning with President Trump making history as the first sitting American president to set foot in North Korea.  Kim Jong-un accepted a last-minute invitation to meet at the DMZ, which the president tweeted out just before leaving the G20 in Japan for South Korea. Both leaders agreed to restart the stalled nuclear talks between Washington and Pyongyang.   KIM JONG-UN, NORTH KOREAN LEADER (through translator): I believe, just looking at this action, this is an expression of his willingness to eliminate all the unfortunate past and open a new future.",

But to restart these talks after he rightfully walked away in Vietnam, this is the correct way. And, really, even those who dislike this president are going to have to give him credit.

And remember when we had the Soviet Union, and President Reagan went to Moscow, went to the Soviet Union, sat with Gorbachev with Iceland, but had to get up and walk away, because it didn't bring the freedom that everybody looked for.  The liberal media criticized him. But, in a few short years, the Berlin Wall collapsed, and so did the Soviet Union. No way would this happen in the short term, but just think, where were we four years ago? Where were we in the Obama administration or the Clinton administration or the Bush administration?  We started this with people criticizing the president when he called him rocket man, but he brought him to the table. He was able to walk away in Vietnam and reset the stage. People said that was a terrible thing to do. But you look at Kim Jong-un, that he sat and he -- on his face, that he smiled with this president. This president did it in a manner that let him save face, but now is bringing people to negotiate to denuclearize, that he showed him, because we're in a stronger hand today, their economics are in a very difficult position.   So America's in a stronger position to make the world safer, and the president did it with style that others have not been able to do it. And I give him a tremendous amount of credit. Even though they dislike him, those who dislike him have to give him credit on what he was able to achieve. Now, it is not the end. But it is the restarting that, when we look back in history, this will be the moment, this will be the moment that turned the tables, just like in Iceland with Reagan walking away from Gorbachev.",

So it's going to be -- have to be probably in a phased, in a gradual step-by-step process. But to restart it, to be in doubt before, makes it even stronger. And, remember, what had taken place since he left Vietnam? North Korea was then trying to become closer to Russia and closer to China. But this president has reset that stage.

There will be -- all the North Koreans will try to be moving in across that border. They don't want to have a destabilization over there as well. And they know for what President Trump has been trying to achieve. He's been utilizing China, at the same time trying to get to North Korea as well. He's put America in a stronger position in negotiations with China, where many people criticized him for putting the tariffs on, saying we couldn't sustain ourselves.   But, really, when you looked at it, this is where other presidents would not go. China had more to lose. If China maintains this position, the supply chain will leave China, will go to Vietnam, will go to other places, and will not come back.  You look at new car sales in China dropping by more than 15 percent. You look at the sales when it comes to domestically clothing dropping as well. They are in a tough position.

I think what had to happen is, President Xi's team made clear in their media that he needs something on Huawei at this meeting. He also needed to have the tariffs at least not imposed at this meeting. Otherwise, he would be saying no to any further talks. That's what President Trump did. It is a brilliant stroke. The president deserves a lot of credit. He hasn't spelled out the details of the Huawei matter. He hasn't said, you know, Huawei can be in 5G now around the world.

So he doesn't want Huawei to get into sensitive sectors around the world. Our government is still banned from buying Huawei products. But it's something different to say we want to bankrupt and destroy Huawei. That's what the president has not done. I actually had a meeting in London last month with the Huawei leadership. They make a distinction between keeping alive, like ZTE did, with 70,000 jobs for China, vs. being put out of business entirely. I think that's the needle the president has threaded.

Joining me exclusively straight ahead right here on \"Sunday Morning Futures,\" Republican House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy with new reaction this morning to President Trump's historic crossing into North Korea to meet Kim Jong-un and the temporary trade cease-fire the president brokered with China's Xi Jinping. Plus, 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Congressman Tim Ryan of Ohio is here. Democratic Congressman Ro Khanna of California is here. He sits on the House Armed Services Committee and co-chairs the Bernie Sanders campaign. Also ahead, Mike Pillsbury, who has been advising President Trump and trade adviser Peter Navarro on China trade talks. Plus, Ken Cuccinelli is here, acting director for U.S. citizenship and immigration services, on the crisis at our southern border. All that right here, right now, as we look ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" And we begin this Sunday morning with President Trump making history as the first sitting American president to set foot in North Korea. Kim Jong-un accepted a last-minute invitation to meet at the DMZ, which the president tweeted out just before leaving the G20 in Japan for South Korea. Both leaders agreed to restart the stalled nuclear talks between Washington and Pyongyang."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCCARTHY",
      "utterance": "To be the first president to stop -- to take a step into North Korea. Historians will study this night. They will study this week, because this is significant. This is the change of direction for the next 25 years, first the restarting of talks with China for trade on our -- really on our standards. But to restart these talks after he rightfully walked away in Vietnam, this is the correct way. And, really, even those who dislike this president are going to have to give him credit. This is what he said when he talked about the art of the deal, that this could make America and the world fundamentally different for the next century."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Wow. So talk more about the significance of it, because, you know, the critic wills push back and say, look, let's not forget the fact that North Korea has not done anything just yet in terms of denuclearization. The president has been trying to prod denuclearization and trying hard to get Kim Jong-un to think differently. The significance of this meeting is what?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCCARTHY",
      "utterance": "The difference is, they are no longer testing the places. And study it in history. And remember when we had the Soviet Union, and President Reagan went to Moscow, went to the Soviet Union, sat with Gorbachev with Iceland, but had to get up and walk away, because it didn't bring the freedom that everybody looked for. The liberal media criticized him. But, in a few short years, the Berlin Wall collapsed, and so did the Soviet Union. No way would this happen in the short term, but just think, where were we four years ago? Where were we in the Obama administration or the Clinton administration or the Bush administration? We started this with people criticizing the president when he called him rocket man, but he brought him to the table. He was able to walk away in Vietnam and reset the stage. People said that was a terrible thing to do. But you look at Kim Jong-un, that he sat and he -- on his face, that he smiled with this president. This president did it in a manner that let him save face, but now is bringing people to negotiate to denuclearize, that he showed him, because we're in a stronger hand today, their economics are in a very difficult position. So America's in a stronger position to make the world safer, and the president did it with style that others have not been able to do it. And I give him a tremendous amount of credit. Even though they dislike him, those who dislike him have to give him credit on what he was able to achieve. Now, it is not the end. But it is the restarting that, when we look back in history, this will be the moment, this will be the moment that turned the tables, just like in Iceland with Reagan walking away from Gorbachev."
    },
    {

    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCCARTHY",
      "utterance": "First of all, they haven't been testing long-term missiles anymore. So, that's a safer place to be."

      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "OK."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCCARTHY",
      "utterance": "They are economically in a tougher position. The president had shown them that he's willing to step across, that he's willing to go further than others. So, you have go to build that trust. And that takes time. And I think these two men have built this trust that could make a stronger decision together. So it's going to be -- have to be probably in a phased, in a gradual step-by-step process. But to restart it, to be in doubt before, makes it even stronger. And, remember, what had taken place since he left Vietnam? North Korea was then trying to become closer to Russia and closer to China. But this president has reset that stage. And look at what we are doing with China. This G20, this last week, historians will study what the president has been able to achieve, just in this week, is so important."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Yes. How significant a role do you think President Xi Jinping played in this? Obviously, he met with Xi Jinping at the G20 on the sidelines. Do you believe the conversation came up toward North Korea? And is this one of the reasons that the president was encouraged to go to DMZ?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCCARTHY",
      "utterance": "Only history will tell us in the end that that took place, but I believe it probably did, because China doesn't want to have North Korea collapse, because what will happen? There will be -- all the North Koreans will try to be moving in across that border. They don't want to have a destabilization over there as well. And they know for what President Trump has been trying to achieve. He's been utilizing China, at the same time trying to get to North Korea as well. He's put America in a stronger position in negotiations with China, where many people criticized him for putting the tariffs on, saying we couldn't sustain ourselves. But, really, when you looked at it, this is where other presidents would not go. China had more to lose. If China maintains this position, the supply chain will leave China, will go to Vietnam, will go to other places, and will not come back. You look at new car sales in China dropping by more than 15 percent. You look at the sales when it comes to domestically clothing dropping as well. They are in a tough position. And the president used this opportunity to reset the stage to get us on a more level playing field for negotiations."

    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Yes. No, I understand what you are saying. From a national security perspective, this seems like this could be huge, but what about the China conversation? It looks like the president is lifting some of these pressures on Huawei. We have been talking about the national security risk that Huawei represents and that China in particular represents, broadly speaking. So what did the president just agree to with Xi Jinping?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCCARTHY",
      "utterance": "Well, I have talked to the president a couple days when he's been over there in the negotiation. I talked to him right before he went in with President Xi Jinping. But I don't know exactly what he's done, but I do know what the president has said all before. Huawei has a real problem. Huawei has the backdoor on the others. The president realizes that. I think what the president allowed them to do is actually let American products sell to them for a short term, to make sure the negotiation is back on track. But what he -- I know this president. He is not going to allow Huawei to get in across this world, because, as you have done -- and you're probably one of the leaders on this. I have watched the Huawei executives in with you, where it shows the 55 different backdoors these other countries have bought this product. That's a real concern to me, because no one else has ever stood up to them. And if it is 10 years from now, we will have lost if we allow Huawei continue to grow and be a..."

So, what should we think about? U.S. companies can still supply Huawei with the technology components that they need. Do you worry that the president is lifting the..."

      "utterance": "Yes."

That is still in a strong position of where -- and when the president comes back, I'm sure he will sit and explain it to the rest of the world."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Let me move on to another issue that you have certainly been vocal about, and that is social media and our right to privacy and our right to know who is selling our data and to whom. Tell me where you are in terms of upcoming legislation on social media. And what do you want to see?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCCARTHY",
      "utterance": "Well, this is what we started in the last Congress, because the power of social media today -- if anything on the Internet is offering you something for free, you are not the customer. You are the product. They are taking your data. And it is not just the entity that's taking your data, who they are selling it to and the third parties and others. And there are -- there are certain companies that have so much control, Google -- 90 percent of all searches go through Google. The power of what they have, 95 percent of the people could drop off if your ad is on the second page."

We need legislation such as that, and that's something that I'm working on, because I look at what the Democrats are offering, they think just to break companies up. That does nothing about privacy. They think to over- regulate it, where you create a utility and then you have no innovation. That's really like a Dodd-Frank world of what they wanted to happen. I'm more concerned about, one, the privacy, but also the competitiveness."

And that's the censoring of conservative conversation. I spoke with the president last week. And he's worried about this, particularly going into the next election, that the social media companies are going to choose a side and put their finger on the scale. Listen to my conversation with the president this week."

But now that we found out from after the election that they did want to influence the election -- I know the Democrats try to go on this hoax of where Russia and other things are happening, but right with inside own country, the power with Twitter and others. And that's why we brought these CEOs in to Congress last Congress. And every time before a company came in, they would deny something is happening, and the day before, then they would admit it. You had people who worked at Facebook, Republicans, who had to create their own group because they were fearful because of their own philosophy of whether they could work within that job. You had what Google did to naming the California Republican Party, that our ideology was Nazism."

I have no idea why he's shaking hands with a dictator who just in May was sending missiles into the Sea of Japan. I mean, you don't reward that kind of behavior with a visit to your country from the president of the United States. There's been no progress at all. They have done nothing, talking about -- it is historic, but what has been done? Nothing. And the whole deal with China, backing down on Huawei? Are you kidding me? What China has been doing with cybersecurity, what Huawei has been doing all over the world, and we're going to back down? I thought that was the one piece that we could count on President Trump to hold the line on for national security purposes. And he's loosening what he did. I think this is very, very dangerous. I'm very disappointed in the president. Even those of us who really disagree with him on so much thought that, on the national security piece, he would at least hold the line, and he folded like a cheap suit."

And, right now, the Republicans had two plans they pushed, Maria. Both of them kicked 22 million people off of their health care. Thank God it didn't get far enough. But they are getting rid of preexisting conditions. So what's coming out of the Republican Party right now is taking health care away from American citizens. That needs to be the focus. How do we make sure that people in America can have accessible, affordable health care? And I support a public option for people to be able to do that. I think that's entirely appropriate."

And I don't believe we should be taking people's private insurance away. But, look, when you see what the pharmaceutical industry are doing, I was just at my mom's a few weeks ago. She's paying 1,000 bucks a month in prescription drug costs. She's a working-class person, and just outside of Youngstown, Ohio."

They can't withstand a $400 emergency, or they economically unravel. That's my focus. And I will tell you that my phone has been ringing off the hook, not just after our debate on Wednesday, but also the debate on Thursday, as President -- Vice President Biden was slipping a little bit. My phone's been ring off the hook, because people are seeing me as the person who can emerge about a working-class agenda in the industrial Midwest, be able to be the top of the ticket, to go in to places like Kentucky, to beat McConnell, to go into places like South Carolina to beat Lindsey Graham."

My next guest advised President Trump and Trade and Manufacturing Policy Director Peter Navarro ahead of the summit. Michael Pillsbury is with me right now.

The talks really faced extinction at that point. They were taking back a lot of major points and were refusing to go further on the enforcement mechanism. And so it was a pretty bleak situation. I think what had to happen is, President Xi's team made clear in their media that he needs something on Huawei at this meeting. He also needed to have the tariffs at least not imposed at this meeting. Otherwise, he would be saying no to any further talks. That's what President Trump did. It is a brilliant stroke. The president deserves a lot of credit. He hasn't spelled out the details of the Huawei matter. He hasn't said, you know, Huawei can be in 5G now around the world. But he has focused on American technology suppliers of parts to Huawei. This gives President Xi the face he needs to face down his hawks in China and restart the talks. So it's a huge success for the president."

He's talked about the national security threat from Huawei eavesdropping, backdoors, surveillance, a series of things that are just not acceptable. So he doesn't want Huawei to get into sensitive sectors around the world. Our government is still banned from buying Huawei products. But it's something different to say we want to bankrupt and destroy Huawei. That's what the president has not done. I actually had a meeting in London last month with the Huawei leadership. They make a distinction between keeping alive, like ZTE did, with 70,000 jobs for China, vs. being put out of business entirely. I think that's the needle the president has threaded. He's not given up in any way. This fake news that this is somehow a catastrophe and he's surrendered on Huawei, it's just not true."

This should be an American issue. It is a dangerous situation. We need to engage in diplomacy to resolve it. And President Carter, who I had met with a few months ago, had actually met with Kim Jong-un's grandfather and had been working towards a framework to get to denuclearization."

Not only is it going to cost upwards of $32 trillion, but it's also going to knock out 180 million people who currently get their insurance from the private sector. How do you justify that, sir?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KHANNA",
      "utterance": "Well, two things. First of all, the current system costs $49 trillion. So you have to look at it in comparison. What Medicare for all will do will reduce a lot of the pharmaceutical costs, a lot of the hospital costs, a lot of the insurance costs. Second, if you read actually the bill, it allows for supplemental insurance. So, here's what it does. Medicare for all, you get health care. You get dental. You get vision."
    },

      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",

But if you still -- after you get everything, and you still want private insurance, you can have it under the bill in the House that I'm a co-sponsor of."

Recapping our top story this morning, President Trump is making history, and he made history overnight, becoming the first sitting U.S. president to set foot in North Korea. As we monitor these incredible pictures from the world's most dangerous border, we turn our attention to our own southern border with Mexico. My next guest has just returned from El Paso, Texas, the same place that I was at the end of April, you might remember. We went and we saw the crisis firsthand. Congress has just passed a $4.6 billion funding bill to help ease the conditions at overcrowded migrant holding facilities. One of the biggest unresolved factors in all of this, the loopholes in our asylum system. Joining me right now is the man in charge of that policy, Ken Cuccinelli. He is the acting director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and the former attorney general of Virginia. Mr. A.G., it's so great to see you this morning. Thanks very much for joining us."

      "utterance": "Well, first of all, the folks in Border Patrol are doing phenomenal work with almost no legitimate help. You mentioned the supplemental bill that went through this past week. But it does absolutely nothing to solve the problems that cause this crisis. And particularly in the House of Representatives, that's intentional. We saw this picture of the father and daughter who tragically died earlier this week. They came here because they wanted to exploit those loopholes. And Congress owns that responsibility. And we need to change our laws, and that means Congress, to close the loopholes that are attracting this mass migration north that we are not staffed or nor do we have the facilities to handle."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Well, why isn't this getting done? I know that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is going to the border tomorrow. And a lot of my sources at the border are not so happy about it, because she doesn't believe anything she sees, and she sort of belittles it."

      "speaker": "CUCCINELLI",
      "utterance": "Right. That's right. And that's a problem as well. I mean, you think about the logistics of screening these people who come across uncontrolled into our country. You have medical screening. They have got to be held. And, remember, the Border Patrol was designed and their facilities are designed basically to intercept, capture, process and return adult Mexican males. And they could do that in hours, literally in hours. But now we're talking about people coming through Mexico to the border, and the Border Patrol..."

      "utterance": "Ken Cuccinelli, stay with us. We have got to talk about that when we come right back. And we are back with acting Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Ken Cuccinelli. Ken, I want to show you this shot of the debate the other night. When all 10 candidates were asked, in your plan, will the government provide health care for illegal aliens, every one of them raised their hand yes, providing health care for illegals. Your reaction to that? And is this an incentive for those people in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador to say, oh, let me go to America, I can get free health care?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CUCCINELLI",
      "utterance": "Of course. Of course it is. And it's those incentives that are the problem here that Congress refuses to fix and that take statutory fixes. We can't just issue memos, like President Obama did. Courts strike those down when President Trump does it. And they defend the memos of President Obama, even when they were illegal, even acknowledged to be by the president, meaning President Obama himself, like DACA. So we don't have these options. Congress has to fix these loopholes. And that means closing them. And I run the asylum system. We have over a 300,000-case backlog as we continue to be rushed at the border. We're doing everything we can to knock that backlog down. But until Congress fixes the loopholes, meaning gets rid of them, and offers more incentives instead here, like the health care for illegals, we are not going to see an end to this crisis."
