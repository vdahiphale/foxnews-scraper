Straight ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures\": President Biden is facing multiple challenges in the new year, mainly due to his own decision-making. Inflation is running rampant, at nearly a 40-year high. The humanitarian crisis continues at the Southern border, with no end in sight. COVID cases are sharply rising, with tests in short supply. And murder rates are up in a number of major cities across the country, after progressives pushed to defund police departments. Coming up, Senator from Kansas Roger Marshall on the president's first year in the White House and what Republicans need to do to retake control of Congress in this year's midterms. Then: China and Russia are testing the Biden administration's commitment to protecting freedom around the globe, as former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo explained last month with Maria.",

Plus: As the Omicron and Delta variants cause COVID cases to spike, President Biden says a one-size-fits-all approach to handling the pandemic may not be the best solution, this despite his campaign promise to shut down the virus. New York Congresswoman Nicole Malliotakis is here on that and the impact bail reform has had on the crime spike across America. Then: The liquor industry is facing a scarcity of beer, wine and spirits due to continuing problems with the global supply chain. Jon Taffer from \"Bar Rescue\" is here on how bars across the country are coping with the supply and labor shortages. All that and more, as we look ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" President Biden's first year in office is just about in the books, and it was highlighted by a series of crises, mostly caused by the administration's own policies, from inflation eating away at whatever wage increases Americans have received, to millions of migrants crossing the wide-open Southern border illegally. Voters are giving a thumbs-down to the president's job performance. In a recent FOX Business poll, a majority of voters disapprove of President Biden's handling of the pandemic, the economy, taxes, crime, government spending, and immigration. Other than that, it's just going great. Joining me now to take a closer look at the president's first year in the White House is Republican Senator Roger Marshall. Senator, thank you so much for joining us. The president has been in office just shy of one year. But the poll numbers and the people you talk to on the street, I don't -- I can't point to a single thing that people are excited about Joe Biden and what he's doing.",

So, you just take a scan around the country, around the world at the crises created by this White House, a crisis at the border, a culture of lawlessness across the country, inflation, the price of gasoline, the inability to deal with COVID, national security issues.

And when you look at these issues, you can't look at them in little silos. There's always overlap.

We have created artificial supply chain disruption by telling people we're going to pay you more to stay at home than to go to back to work. At one point in time, the federal government was paying a family of four $108,000 a year to not work. Can you imagine? So we need to get people back to work. And then we need to go back to President Trump's energy policies. The price of gasoline, the cost of your utilities are up significantly over the past year. And all those are results of this -- of this president's policies. So those would be two simple solutions. Let's get back to energy independence. Let's turn American innovation loose again.",

Tell us about that. But I got to tell you, as I go and talk to people across America, some vaccinated, some not, I think they're fed up with these mandates.

And then, just yesterday, I think we were up to almost 500,000 as well. So, the mandates don't work. What we did in the NDAA, the National Defense Authorization Act, bipartisan legislation, is, we know that the White House wants to give our military personnel a dishonorable discharge if they're separated because of their refusal to take the vaccine. I think, as an Army doctor myself, former Army doctor myself, I respect religious freedoms. I think that this should be a decision between the Army doctor, the military doctor, their chaplain, and the soldiers as well. So what we did is, we are able to slip in some legislation that was approved that would prevent that soldier being separated from getting a dishonorable discharge. Again, I support the vaccine, but I think it should be a personal choice.",

But people get to make these types of decisions for themselves, not the government. It's amazing to me that so-called liberals are so adamant that they have to do this, that the government is going to take control their bodies. All right, let me -- let me go ahead and segue into something else. The reason the Democrats can run the table on many of these things is because they control the House, the Senate and the presidency. But there are a number of retiring senators out there, most of which are Republicans. If we pull up the graphic here, we have got a number of people that are retiring, only Senator Leahy on the Democratic side of the aisle. What's the strategy for -- in the Senate to actually wrangle back control and give that gavel back to Mitch McConnell?",

Just America is looking at their policies. So I'm very, very optimistic. And I'm optimistic at the polls I'm seeing. You look at generic ballots right now, and what we're seeing is -- in purple states is people are shifting over in these generic ballots to supporting Republicans for the first time in my career. We have never been and above a minus-six since I have been on Capitol Hill for five years right now, so to be shifting to the positive realm in personal -- in purple states and with educated women, with independents. So those are all huge, huge victories for us. And those retirement seats you have got up there, I think that we can we can jot down Missouri as a victory, Alabama as a victory. I think we're going to be OK in North Carolina. I think we're really solid in Ohio. We have got some work to do in Pennsylvania. But we're going to go on the offense. Rick Scott is doing a heck of a job running the NRSC, the National Republican Senate Committee. He has a strategy, reaching out to those independent voters, to Hispanic voters, reaching out and growing the party. The Democrat Party has left traditional Republicans, and as well as the Democrats. So I think that we have a great opportunity here to pick up seats in Arizona, as well as Georgia. And there will be a couple of jokers that we will pull out the hat -- out of the hand as well.",

China's investing in its military, trying to exceed the United States in our military capabilities, so that they can hold us at bay. In technology, they're investing in technology, in part to advance their surveillance society, by which they use their authoritarian powers to repress their people, but also to reach outside of China and to affect those who -- like democracies like ourselves that they see as a threat.

And I can tell you, from a state like New York, where we have one-party rule and we see restrictions and mandates and people being fired, losing their livelihood if they choose not to vaccinate, these restrictions have done nothing to really reduce the level of these positive cases. As you said earlier, we're seeing record positive cases once again. And I believe it's time that this administration focus on therapeutics, focus on treatments. And I have been pushing for that, because the reality is, is that this virus is here to stay. It's various variants, various forms. But we need to learn to live with it.

And, basically, President Biden has allowed the drug cartels to run our Southern border. We are seeing record individuals being smuggled over the border, but also we're seeing drugs. Fentanyl, as you know, is now the leading cause of deaths in a new report among 18-to-45-year-olds. So, we can talk about COVID, but among that age group, it is fentanyl. And that stuff is pouring over our border. The drug cartels are making billions and billions of dollars a month just doing that. And so we need to secure our border. It is shocking to me that President Biden continues to push the Supreme Court to allow him to repeal once again the remain in -- order. He doesn't want to comply with it, despite the fact that it was effective in keeping people in Mexico until their asylum cases can be heard and it's -- they're properly vetted. Now, locally, we have -- New York City, of course, is, sadly, a sanctuary city. We continue to protect those who are here illegally committing crimes. In fact, someone who was arrested, a Mexican national who was committing drug trafficking, allegedly, fentanyl, here in New York City, was released by a judge back onto the streets. So we need our mayor to appoint good judges to the bench, number one. But we also need to ensure that he fights for changes to the disastrous bail reform in Albany that has led to individuals constantly being put on -- back on the streets despite having dozen, two dozen, three dozen prior arrests and convictions. Unfortunately, in New York City, in 2021, we saw five -- nearly 500 murders, which is the most we have seen in a decade here in New York City. And categories of crime, everything from shootings, to rape, to robbery, to car thefts, have all skyrocketed. In fact, it will be interesting to know that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's home borough of the Bronx is where a third of the shootings took place in New York City, and she is one of the leading advocates of the defund the police movement.",

And if you can get them, you're paying 40 cents each for them. So, now you have to buy bulk ketchup. Seems simple. What do you put the bulk ketchup in? Now you have to buy ramekins to put the ketchup in, but you can't get the ramekins. So, now you have this compounded issue, because of one little shift in a condiment within a restaurant. Then you look at chicken, for example, Jason. A chicken breast is typically unavailable to many restaurants today. Either it's thinner, it's thicker, it's bigger, or you can't get it at all. So they're changing to chicken thighs, and they're trying to modify recipes. But if you don't know what you're not going to get until you don't get it, you don't have the opportunity to change and modify your operations, your recipes, your processes, your plates. It's a nightmare. And then, in a liquor business, Jason, it's equally as bad and no better for business. And here's the big problem. To produce, let's say, a whiskey, well, you need the grain. There's an issue getting certain grains now. Then you have to distill the product. Then you have to have a label. The label has to be approved by the federal government. That's taking longer than ever before. Then you got to find somebody to produce the label. And if you get that done, good luck getting glass. Most bottles come from China. There is now factories being built and starting to produce in Mexico. But, Jason, you will wait a year for glass. Now that you got the label, you got the glass, now you got whiskey. Whiskey has to age typically for five years or longer. So, this reduction in our supply of many of these spirits is not short- term. It's longer-term. But think of that restauranteur who comes in on a Monday morning: I can't get this. I got to get that. I can't get that. This won't fit on my plate. This won't fit in my bun. This doesn't fit in my glass. It's compounded every day. Then top of it with not as many employees as we'd like to have, and it's a nightmare.",

      "sentences": "Well, first of all, let me explain what income is in a restaurant. If you work in a casual restaurant, a year or so ago, Jason I wanted to promote a waiter to a host. And I had to duplicate his income to do so. So, we sat down together, we added up his tips. He did about 20 tables a shift. Every table tipped him about $20. We put it all together, he was making $40 an hour as a waiter. I can't pay that to a host. So, I abandoned that concept. The restaurant industry provides cash every day. If you just do the math as a consumer and say, this guy has four to five people in his -- tables in his station, he's going to serve X-amount of hundreds of guests during a period. Do the math. It's pretty darn good income in full-service restaurants. Hours are flexible. So, believe it or not, I'm a believer in higher wages, but I don't believe they should be federally determined. Every state, every region needs to know determine the payroll levels that works for it. As you know, in Tennessee mountains, I would pay somebody less than I would in downtown Manhattan. And I should because the prices are different in those two markets. So I might be the first one to say this, but I think the labor model needs to follow the pricing model on a regional or state basis. That makes sense. That protects the worker, because they're being paid at a rate that bounces to the income levels and purchasing of their community, and the business is protected. So there's a logical way to go about this. But the job market has been disheveled. And, Jason, if you were looking to buy a widget, and the widget market had been disheveled, you would have an open mind to new widgets. So, people are looking for more money. They're looking for more flexibility. They're looking for jobs that they like. They're dealing with child care. They're dealing with health issues. They have a lot of expectations as to what they want their future to be. And when the market is so disrupted, people think about change. They think about what they can do to make it better. I suggest they reevaluate the restaurant business. If you're a single mom, the flexible hours, the income per hour, the work environments are all pretty terrific.",

Jon Taffer from \"Bar Rescue\" is here on how bars across the country are coping with the supply and labor shortages. All that and more, as we look ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" President Biden's first year in office is just about in the books, and it was highlighted by a series of crises, mostly caused by the administration's own policies, from inflation eating away at whatever wage increases Americans have received, to millions of migrants crossing the wide-open Southern border illegally. Voters are giving a thumbs-down to the president's job performance. In a recent FOX Business poll, a majority of voters disapprove of President Biden's handling of the pandemic, the economy, taxes, crime, government spending, and immigration. Other than that, it's just going great. Joining me now to take a closer look at the president's first year in the White House is Republican Senator Roger Marshall. Senator, thank you so much for joining us. The president has been in office just shy of one year. But the poll numbers and the people you talk to on the street, I don't -- I can't point to a single thing that people are excited about Joe Biden and what he's doing."

These numbers show that America is living a nightmare, a nightmare created by the policies from this White House. I just remind people not too long ago it was President Obama said never underestimate Joe's ability to mess something up. So, you just take a scan around the country, around the world at the crises created by this White House, a crisis at the border, a culture of lawlessness across the country, inflation, the price of gasoline, the inability to deal with COVID, national security issues. All these policies are coming to roost right now. And we're all living that nightmare."

As you look at these numbers, as we pull up this graphic here, Senator, I got to tell you, most Americans are showing that they're very, very concerned about so many issues that are facing the country. And I -- the president campaigned on the idea that he had a plan, but I think most Americans, they don't see what this plan supposedly is."

And when -- again, when you're a socialist, when you're a big government socialist government, you see every problem, you try to hit that with a sledgehammer. Then there's collateral damage, creating four more problems. And then you try to take care of those four problems, and you create 16 more problems. So we see a compounding of errors now. And when you look at these issues, you can't look at them in little silos. There's always overlap. So, whether it's COVID and how their mandate is impacting the military, how it's impacting your health care workers, how it's impacting national security, so we're seeing a compounding of errors right now by this administration."

    {
      "speaker": "MARSHALL",
      "utterance": "Yes, well, it is. Actually, the biggest issues in Kansas right now are inflation and the mandate. That's the biggest impact, right? And, again, those challenges overlap with each other. So, number one, we need to get people back to work. We have created artificial supply chain disruption by telling people we're going to pay you more to stay at home than to go to back to work. At one point in time, the federal government was paying a family of four $108,000 a year to not work. Can you imagine? So we need to get people back to work. And then we need to go back to President Trump's energy policies. The price of gasoline, the cost of your utilities are up significantly over the past year. And all those are results of this -- of this president's policies. So those would be two simple solutions. Let's get back to energy independence. Let's turn American innovation loose again."

      "speaker": "CHAFFETZ",

But I want to segue here and talk a little bit about the mandates that you mentioned, because you have authored a bill to try to get rid of the mandates that are being imposed on our military. Tell us about that. But I got to tell you, as I go and talk to people across America, some vaccinated, some not, I think they're fed up with these mandates. They just don't think that the federal government should be telling them to get an injection. And, if they do or they don't, and they can or cannot go into a restaurant, they think that's a bridge too far."

And then, just yesterday, I think we were up to almost 500,000 as well. So, the mandates don't work. What we did in the NDAA, the National Defense Authorization Act, bipartisan legislation, is, we know that the White House wants to give our military personnel a dishonorable discharge if they're separated because of their refusal to take the vaccine. I think, as an Army doctor myself, former Army doctor myself, I respect religious freedoms. I think that this should be a decision between the Army doctor, the military doctor, their chaplain, and the soldiers as well. So what we did is, we are able to slip in some legislation that was approved that would prevent that soldier being separated from getting a dishonorable discharge. Again, I support the vaccine, but I think it should be a personal choice."

But people get to make these types of decisions for themselves, not the government. It's amazing to me that so-called liberals are so adamant that they have to do this, that the government is going to take control their bodies. All right, let me -- let me go ahead and segue into something else. The reason the Democrats can run the table on many of these things is because they control the House, the Senate and the presidency. But there are a number of retiring senators out there, most of which are Republicans. If we pull up the graphic here, we have got a number of people that are retiring, only Senator Leahy on the Democratic side of the aisle. What's the strategy for -- in the Senate to actually wrangle back control and give that gavel back to Mitch McConnell?"

      "speaker": "MARSHALL",
      "utterance": "Yes, Jason, well, I'm very bullish that will get the majority back in the Senate. And I think we start by just giving the Democrats more rope, right? Just America is looking at their policies. So I'm very, very optimistic. And I'm optimistic at the polls I'm seeing. You look at generic ballots right now, and what we're seeing is -- in purple states is people are shifting over in these generic ballots to supporting Republicans for the first time in my career. We have never been and above a minus-six since I have been on Capitol Hill for five years right now, so to be shifting to the positive realm in personal -- in purple states and with educated women, with independents. So those are all huge, huge victories for us. And those retirement seats you have got up there, I think that we can we can jot down Missouri as a victory, Alabama as a victory. I think we're going to be OK in North Carolina. I think we're really solid in Ohio. We have got some work to do in Pennsylvania. But we're going to go on the offense. Rick Scott is doing a heck of a job running the NRSC, the National Republican Senate Committee. He has a strategy, reaching out to those independent voters, to Hispanic voters, reaching out and growing the party. The Democrat Party has left traditional Republicans, and as well as the Democrats. So I think that we have a great opportunity here to pick up seats in Arizona, as well as Georgia. And there will be a couple of jokers that we will pull out the hat -- out of the hand as well."

This administration, as Marsha Blackburn was just saying, has a decision to make as to how we invest in our military capabilities, in our technology capabilities to counter what China is doing. China's investing in its military, trying to exceed the United States in our military capabilities, so that they can hold us at bay. In technology, they're investing in technology, in part to advance their surveillance society, by which they use their authoritarian powers to repress their people, but also to reach outside of China and to affect those who -- like democracies like ourselves that they see as a threat. This president has an opportunity to both hold them at bay and make America strong, and he needs to commit himself to that now."

That's certainly what we have in Taiwan. This president has shown his weakness, both in Afghanistan in responding to Russia in response to their threats to Ukraine. So, certainly, China sees this as an opportunity. This administration needs to turn to our allies and bolster the world democracies to oppose Chinese efforts to invade Taiwan and to -- as you said, reunification, but also just impose their authoritarian will on Taiwan. But I think this is a great opportunity and role for Congress and I think why these elections next year are going to be so important. Taking that gavel from Nancy Pelosi, I think, will make a huge difference in the House in being able to reinvest in our military, make America strong again, impose on this administration controls on our border, and set us back on the path to a strong America."

I believe that, worldwide -- I'm not just talking United States -- worldwide, $60 trillion of damage, $60 trillion. China doesn't have $60 trillion.

China has blocked any attempt for a full investigation inside its border, while no evidence has emerged that the virus was of natural origin. House Intel Committee ranking member Mike Turner is back with us. Congressman, it's pretty shocking to me, with all the deaths of COVID and how it's impacted the world, that the United States Congress -- Democrats are in charge of both the House and the Senate -- there is no investigation into the origins of COVID-19. I can't believe it."

So, one thing we know, that this virus came from China. And we also know that, as you indicated, there's been no nexus or proven source for the virus naturally. And one thing that I think needs to happen, as you read all the articles of the scientists that are debating it, is, the United States needs to declassify all the information that it has that the intelligence community has gathered, because this needs to be part of our public debate to hold China accountable. We need to look at what we do know and enter that into the public debate, so people can understand that this is not just conjecture as to the origins. There are things that are known.

This is a real threat to NATO and the United States and certainly democracies.

But how in the world are you going to deal with Adam Schiff? I mean, my own personal belief, Adam Schiff and Eric Swalwell, I don't even know how they have security clearances.

I mean, even across all media outlets, people understand that the information that he was leaking and even the public statements he was making did not comport to what we knew about the Russia hoax and what was happening in the Intelligence Committee. But I think what's really important here is that Adam Schiff's use of both the Intelligence Committee and the intelligence community for political purposes and political gain really shows the whole risk of why we need to hold the intelligence community accountable. We give them powerful tools, both in technology and an ability to gather information about individuals.

Florida is also seeing record high cases. Meanwhile, the Biden administration has promised to deliver 500 million at- home tests soon, despite the administration reportedly rejecting a proposal from testing experts in October to ramp up production before the holidays. The president has denied that report. For more on this, let's bring in New York Congresswoman Nicole Malliotakis. She's a member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. Congresswoman, thank you so much for joining us on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" Look, the president has been all over the map. He promised to shut it down. In July, he said essentially it was shut down. Now he's saying it's really up to the states.

We're not seeing it come to fruition now. In fact, he was so critical of President Trump, yet we have had more deaths in 2021 under President Biden. And he had the benefit of the vaccination, which we know reduces the symptoms that somebody experiences if they test positive. And I can tell you, from a state like New York, where we have one-party rule and we see restrictions and mandates and people being fired, losing their livelihood if they choose not to vaccinate, these restrictions have done nothing to really reduce the level of these positive cases. As you said earlier, we're seeing record positive cases once again. And I believe it's time that this administration focus on therapeutics, focus on treatments. And I have been pushing for that, because the reality is, is that this virus is here to stay. It's various variants, various forms. But we need to learn to live with it. And the best we're going to do, by both vaccinating people who want to be vaccinated and making sure they have access to it, but also ensuring that we have the therapeutics and the treatment to treat people, including those positive patients that do end up getting sick, even despite having the vaccination."

You have people now that are saying the wrong way to track this is by the number of new cases. How convenient for the new president to be able to take on this role. But it also strikes me, Congresswoman, that it is not a very targeted approach. To just blanketly send out 500 million tests, why not target those that are the most vulnerable? Why not target the people that actually are showing symptoms? I just don't understand why that isn't the prevailing thought there in Washington, D.C."

Eighty-two million Americans would be affected by it, and many will lose their livelihoods as a result.

Fentanyl, as you know, is now the leading cause of deaths in a new report among 18-to-45-year-olds. So, we can talk about COVID, but among that age group, it is fentanyl. And that stuff is pouring over our border. The drug cartels are making billions and billions of dollars a month just doing that. And so we need to secure our border. It is shocking to me that President Biden continues to push the Supreme Court to allow him to repeal once again the remain in -- order. He doesn't want to comply with it, despite the fact that it was effective in keeping people in Mexico until their asylum cases can be heard and it's -- they're properly vetted. Now, locally, we have -- New York City, of course, is, sadly, a sanctuary city. We continue to protect those who are here illegally committing crimes. In fact, someone who was arrested, a Mexican national who was committing drug trafficking, allegedly, fentanyl, here in New York City, was released by a judge back onto the streets. So we need our mayor to appoint good judges to the bench, number one. But we also need to ensure that he fights for changes to the disastrous bail reform in Albany that has led to individuals constantly being put on -- back on the streets despite having dozen, two dozen, three dozen prior arrests and convictions. Unfortunately, in New York City, in 2021, we saw five -- nearly 500 murders, which is the most we have seen in a decade here in New York City. And categories of crime, everything from shootings, to rape, to robbery, to car thefts, have all skyrocketed. In fact, it will be interesting to know that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's home borough of the Bronx is where a third of the shootings took place in New York City, and she is one of the leading advocates of the defund the police movement."

      "utterance": "Yes, this idea of the bail reform, getting these people back out on the street as quickly as possible, I think, is not the right way to solve this. And you have to have prosecutors that are actually going to prosecute these crimes. In Los Angeles, with the district attorney, Gascon, you have seen it as rampant as can possibly be. And the solution ends up just being just absolutely horrendous in terms of its consequences. I want to turn now. Let's listen to Governor Abbott. He was interviewed by Maria Bartiromo. And I want you to listen to this and give me your reaction to it."

It is an issue that the Texas Department of Public Safety is working to crack down upon.

The crime, COVID, fentanyl, open borders, they all kind of mesh together. But you're left with states like Texas, where Governor Abbott has got his hands full.

And that is why the Biden administration has been forced to reinstate the remain-in-Mexico. The sad thing is, is that now they're even fighting to try to get the Supreme Court to revisit it again, so they can no longer enforce the remain-in-Mexico policy that was clear and was working. The reality is -- and this is what I asked on the floor to my colleagues and the president of the United States, whose side are you on? Are you on the side of the drug cartels, or are you on the side of the American people? When you see those numbers, out of 18-to-45-year-olds, the leading cause of death is fentanyl, you know it's streaming over our border. You have a responsibility to do something."

Service industries like restaurants and bars have been particularly hard-hit by the shortage of workers. Jon Taffer of \"Bar Rescue\" knows a thing or two about running a business. He's coming up next. Stay with us."

      "utterance": "President Biden unveiled a plan to tackle the global supply chain crisis back in October. But issues continue to plague most industries across the United States this new year. The alcohol industry is no exception, with one data and market analysis firm showing liquor shortages at about 11 percent. And, in November, consumers paid nearly 1 percent more for drinks than a year earlier, according to the Labor Department. So, when will things improve? And what do bar owners do in the meantime? Joining us now is Jon Taffer, host of \"Bar Rescue.\" And if you haven't seen this on the Paramount network, I got to tell you, it's a lot of fun. Because you put some energy into this. And you know how to run a business, run a bar, run a restaurant. So, thanks for joining us on \"Sunday Morning Futures,\" and happy new year. JON TAFFER, HOST, \"BAR RESCUE\": Happy new year, Jason. Good to be with you."

      "utterance": "All right, you're talking to people that are actually out there doing it. They're on the streets. They have got their restaurants. They have got their livelihood on the line. Tell us the reality of the supply chain. What does it look like across America? And how real is it in this industry?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TAFFER",
      "utterance": "Well, it's compounded by itself. Let me explain what I mean. For example, you can't get ketchup packets right now. There's a real crisis. And if you can get them, you're paying 40 cents each for them. So, now you have to buy bulk ketchup. Seems simple. What do you put the bulk ketchup in? Now you have to buy ramekins to put the ketchup in, but you can't get the ramekins. So, now you have this compounded issue, because of one little shift in a condiment within a restaurant. Then you look at chicken, for example, Jason. A chicken breast is typically unavailable to many restaurants today. Either it's thinner, it's thicker, it's bigger, or you can't get it at all. So they're changing to chicken thighs, and they're trying to modify recipes. But if you don't know what you're not going to get until you don't get it, you don't have the opportunity to change and modify your operations, your recipes, your processes, your plates. It's a nightmare. And then, in a liquor business, Jason, it's equally as bad and no better for business. And here's the big problem. To produce, let's say, a whiskey, well, you need the grain. There's an issue getting certain grains now. Then you have to distill the product. Then you have to have a label. The label has to be approved by the federal government. That's taking longer than ever before. Then you got to find somebody to produce the label. And if you get that done, good luck getting glass. Most bottles come from China. There is now factories being built and starting to produce in Mexico. But, Jason, you will wait a year for glass. Now that you got the label, you got the glass, now you got whiskey. Whiskey has to age typically for five years or longer."

      "speaker": "So, this reduction in our supply of many of these spirits is not short- term. It's longer-term. But think of that restauranteur who comes in on a Monday morning",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHAFFETZ",
      "utterance": "Well, I want to get into that. I want to get into the labor shortages that you're facing and that you're seeing within the industry. But stay with us, because we're going to have more with Jon Taffer in just a moment, as we look ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\""
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHAFFETZ",
      "utterance": "We are back with Jon Taffer, host of \"Bar Rescue.\" Jon, that is the best explanation I have heard about the supply chain, bar none. That was great. Talk to us now. Give us that same type of analysis on the labor shortages. What are minimum wages doing to the reality? What are tips like for people? Because I have heard that, hey, as minimum wage goes up, people say, ah, you're earning more, you don't need a tip. What's the reality of what's going on in the street?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TAFFER",
      "utterance": "Well, first of all, let me explain what income is in a restaurant. If you work in a casual restaurant, a year or so ago, Jason I wanted to promote a waiter to a host. And I had to duplicate his income to do so. So, we sat down together, we added up his tips. He did about 20 tables a shift. Every table tipped him about $20. We put it all together, he was making $40 an hour as a waiter. I can't pay that to a host. So, I abandoned that concept. The restaurant industry provides cash every day. If you just do the math as a consumer and say, this guy has four to five people in his -- tables in his station, he's going to serve X-amount of hundreds of guests during a period. Do the math. It's pretty darn good income in full-service restaurants. Hours are flexible. So, believe it or not, I'm a believer in higher wages, but I don't believe they should be federally determined. Every state, every region needs to know determine the payroll levels that works for it. As you know, in Tennessee mountains, I would pay somebody less than I would in downtown Manhattan. And I should because the prices are different in those two markets. So I might be the first one to say this, but I think the labor model needs to follow the pricing model on a regional or state basis. That makes sense. That protects the worker, because they're being paid at a rate that bounces to the income levels and purchasing of their community, and the business is protected. So there's a logical way to go about this. But the job market has been disheveled. And, Jason, if you were looking to buy a widget, and the widget market had been disheveled, you would have an open mind to new widgets. So, people are looking for more money. They're looking for more flexibility. They're looking for jobs that they like. They're dealing with child care. They're dealing with health issues. They have a lot of expectations as to what they want their future to be. And when the market is so disrupted, people think about change. They think about what they can do to make it better. I suggest they reevaluate the restaurant business. If you're a single mom, the flexible hours, the income per hour, the work environments are all pretty terrific."

      "utterance": "Yes. Well, look, it is a tough business. And I know, sometimes, you got to go in there and you just tell them, hey, you got to shut it down. But, Jon Taffer from \"Bar Rescue,\" if you want to learn how business works, how -- the reality of what's going on in a restaurant, I highly recommend this. You do a great job. I think you have some of the best analysis out there. Happy new year, and thanks for sharing your insight on how it actually does work."
