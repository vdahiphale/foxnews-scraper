Coming up, joining us straight ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures\" right here, Republican Senator John Hoeven on President Trump's new offer to end the partial government shutdown.  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says he intends to act on the bill this week, but can it pass?  Meanwhile, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi already says the president's proposal is a nonstarter. So, what will bring Democrats to the bargaining table? We will hear from Congresswoman Debbie Dingell, co-chair of the House Democratic Policy and Communications Committee.  Also with us, Freshman Congressman Jeff Van Drew on why he didn't support Nancy Pelosi for a second time. Then Congressman John Ratcliffe from the House Judiciary Committee reacting to new revelations this week that Bruce Ohr did tell his DOJ colleagues about the salacious and unverified anti-Trump dossier that it was linked to the Clinton campaign. So, why didn't they tell the FISA court before wiretapping an American citizen?  All that and more coming up right now, as we look ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\"   And we begin with President Trump unveiling a new proposal yesterday to end the government shutdown. It would include temporary protections for DACA recipients, in exchange for border wall funding. The president urging Democrats to get on board.",

In fact, there's a caravan starting in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, this morning, already on their way, as many as 1,000 or more, according to the relatives. But what you're seeing now, it's hot out here. It's 90-plus degrees. And this is -- earlier this morning in Huixtla, there was about seven or eight buses that picked up people. It was being provided by, by the local government of Huixtla. So this is the Mexico level government assisting this caravan. But you see people piling on to these vehicles, which is dangerous. And if you walk here, you can see them trying to get into this truck as well, and get there any way they can.  It's interesting. We saw just a few days ago, Maria, that Mexico said they were going to enforce their southern border, but yet we saw open gates temporarily. So they made very little effort to stop that. And now you have this situation here playing out. Now, we talked just 15 minutes ago to a gentleman off camera in Spanish that said he was part of the first caravan, made it to Tijuana, went across in San Diego, got deported. And he's making the second trek. Just to give you some idea, the southern border of Mexico all the way to Tijuana is essentially 2,500 miles, the equivalent of walking from Washington, D.C., to Los Angeles. So this gentleman I'm just describing did that trek. Now he's doing it again in so many weeks. But, as you can see, this just isn't a safe situation for these people, as both local folks here, as well as the local governments, seem to be helping to assist this migrant caravan. So there is another one started, as I mentioned. And, interestingly enough, in Honduras today, we're told there's a call for a national strike against President Juan Orlando Hernandez. That's part of the reason why they're fleeing. They don't trust what they say is a corrupt president there.",

Bruce Ohr said under oath that, before the Russia investigation was ever opened, on July 30, 2016, he sat down with Christopher Steele. He knew that Christopher Steele had put together this dossier, at the direction of Hillary Clinton and the Democrats. He knew that Christopher Steele was biased and determined to stop Donald Trump. And that's why he wasn't willing to vouch for the credibility or the reliability of Christopher Steele and the dossier. And we know that he told that to the number two person at the FBI, Andy McCabe, then Lisa Page, then Peter Strzok, then Andrew Weissmann, most of whom ended up on Bob Mueller's special counsel team.

And I get there may be some back and forth. But they need to work with us now to get it done. And let's get it done this week."

And that's something that they have voted for before. That is just commonsense part of national security, border security."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "OK. So, let me ask you what the justification would be, in terms of not providing the money for border security, given that all of these things have already been things that they voted on. And, frankly, there's already a border wall in Nancy Pelosi's state, which we're going to talk about with Congresswoman Debbie Dingell right after we discuss this. So -- so, tell me your thinking in terms of what your colleagues will push back on."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HOEVEN",
      "utterance": "Well, that's it. This is just basic common sense. First, it's just part of national security. Second, they have voted for it before. We have existing border wall, border fence, whatever you want to call it. They have fund -- Democrats have funded it for previous presidents, including President Obama. There's no reason to turn this down, particularly now, when we're reaching out and compromising on things that they want."

      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",

    },

      "speaker": "HOEVEN",
      "utterance": "Well, you have seen it. I saw earlier you were talking about the stock market going up. That's because the economy is so strong. We ended the year with more than 3 percent growth. That -- that comes because we have cut taxes and because we have reduced the regulatory burden. So, if we can continue to focus on these fundamentals that get our economy to grow, and then make sure we do the things that people want, find ways to reduce costs in terms of the overall cost of government, to have strong security, support our military, our law enforcement, do the things - - address the health care issues, bring down the cost of prescription drugs. Those are the kind of fundamentals that help our people in their everyday lives across the country."

      "utterance": "Well, obviously, it will have some negative effect. But the key is the underlying fundamentals, which I just talked about a minute ago. As long as we keep those fundamentals strong in terms of good economic policy and keep that job growth going, the economy will grow. And you're seeing wage growth, which is so important, because then people feel it right in their pocketbook."

But, at the end of the day, we have got to continue to work to find that compromise and get it done. And this package that the president's put forward -- and we worked with him on to do it -- is a good package. We can get to a resolution, end the border shutdown, make sure -- or -- excuse me -- end the government shutdown, make sure we have border funding for security, and cover a lot of priorities that Democrats have said they very much want to get done."

It's part of defending our country, making sure that, as our adversaries increase their capabilities, both in terms of their offensive weapons and their missile defense systems, that we can defeat them. We always have to have the technological edge, so that we can not only defend our country, but keep our troops safe. When they're out there defending us, we need to make sure that they have superiority in terms of technology and weapons systems."

And then that BuzzFeed report the claims President Trump instructed his former personal attorney Michael Cohen to lie to Congress is getting rare pushback from the special counsel, Robert Mueller's team. We will talk about that when we come back. Follow me on Twitter @MariaBartiromo, @MariaBartiromo on Instagram and @SundayFutures. Let us know what you would like to hear about the rest of the show.

Hundreds more Central American migrants setting their sights on the United States, a new caravan crossing into Mexico on their journey toward the southern border in the U.S. Griff Jenkins is live right now in Mexico. He's in Huixtla, Mexico, with the caravan. Griff, what's the latest there? And is there another caravan behind this one?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GRIFF JENKINS, CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Well, Maria, we're about -- there is. In fact, there's a caravan starting in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, this morning, already on their way, as many as 1,000 or more, according to the relatives. But what you're seeing now, it's hot out here. It's 90-plus degrees. And this is -- earlier this morning in Huixtla, there was about seven or eight buses that picked up people. It was being provided by, by the local government of Huixtla. So this is the Mexico level government assisting this caravan. But you see people piling on to these vehicles, which is dangerous. And if you walk here, you can see them trying to get into this truck as well, and get there any way they can. It's interesting. We saw just a few days ago, Maria, that Mexico said they were going to enforce their southern border, but yet we saw open gates temporarily. So they made very little effort to stop that. And now you have this situation here playing out. Now, we talked just 15 minutes ago to a gentleman off camera in Spanish that said he was part of the first caravan, made it to Tijuana, went across in San Diego, got deported. And he's making the second trek. Just to give you some idea, the southern border of Mexico all the way to Tijuana is essentially 2,500 miles, the equivalent of walking from Washington, D.C., to Los Angeles. So this gentleman I'm just describing did that trek. Now he's doing it again in so many weeks. But, as you can see, this just isn't a safe situation for these people, as both local folks here, as well as the local governments, seem to be helping to assist this migrant caravan. So there is another one started, as I mentioned. And, interestingly enough, in Honduras today, we're told there's a call for a national strike against President Juan Orlando Hernandez. That's part of the reason why they're fleeing. They don't trust what they say is a corrupt president there."

Look, you have spoken with a lot of these migrants. I saw you on the air yesterday. You were talking with one. And he said, oh, they're going to just sneak in. Tell me what you're getting. What are their intentions, Griff? Because you have been talking to both -- both caravan buses and talking with some of the people in there.

And they -- I ask almost all of them. The first question I say is, do you know that the United States is trying to make it harder for you to get in, that you won't qualify, 95 percent of you won't qualify for asylum in the United States, just because of needing a job? And they all say they don't care. They're coming anyway. So whether or not you're one of the 3,600 that got a temporary work visa..."

But I want to get your take specifically on the southern border, and specifically this wall in Tijuana, because this is a very tense -- dense area, rather, with three million people in one -- outside and another three million on the other side.

I guess the question that I would have Maria, is why now, almost two years into the special counsel's tenure, does he take this extraordinary action to correct a fake news or false news article about the special counsel, when there have been a dozen of them over the last two years? So is that just a coincidence? Or does it have something to do with the fact that that happened two days after an attorney general nominee said for the first time, I'm going to grade the special counsel's homework, and I'm going to get to the bottom of all of this and bring a fair and expeditious conclusion to this matter?"

First week in February, I think, is what we talked about. But let me get your take on this, because you never bought into that story that BuzzFeed reported, right? You never believed that the president asked Michael Cohen to lie?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RATCLIFFE",
      "utterance": "No. Listen, if there was a conspiracy with the president of the United States to lie to Congress, that's the first thing Michael Cohen would have led with months ago, and it's the first thing the special counsel would have included. Michael Cohen wouldn't have pled to lying to Congress. He would have led to a conspiracy to lie to Congress that involved the president. So I never for a second thought there was anything to that BuzzFeed story. And I'm glad the special counsel corrected the record."

OK, let me move on, because we did also get some revelations from Bruce Ohr's closed-door interview with you and your colleagues, transcribed interview, with congressional investigators. And I want to talk about that, because it really does put a spotlight on something whereas the people on the left and your detractors in terms of saying, this is nonsense -- Jim Comey continues to call all of this nonsense. You just -- we had Jim Himes on last week, one of your colleagues on the Intel Committee. And I talked about FISA abuse with the Democratic congressman. Listen to what he said."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "RATCLIFFE",
      "utterance": "Well, my reaction is that Jim Himes probably wishes he'd waited a week to come on your show, because, as you said, Maria, Bruce Ohr, parts of his testimony became publicly available this week. And he said just the opposite of what Jim's -- Jim Himes told you. Bruce Ohr raised his right hand and, under penalty of perjury, said what the FBI and the Department of Justice knew and when they knew it about Christopher Steele and the Steele dossier. And, again, it's the opposite of what Jim Himes said last week. It was the opposite of what Adam Schiff put in a memo that he released to the American public last year on that subject. But, then again, those of us on Capitol Hill know that when -- Adam Schiff and the truth have always had a very strained relationship and haven't always gotten along very well."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "Let's go through these transcripts, because you say to Bruce Ohr",
      "utterance": "\"OK, so, again, so the record is clear, what the Department of Justice and the FBI were aware of prior to the first FISA application was your relationship with Christopher Steele and Glenn Simpson, your wife's relationship with Christopher Steele and Glenn Simpson, Mr. Steele's bias against Donald Trump, Mr. Simpson's bias against Donald Trump, your wife's compensation for Glenn Simpson and Fusion GPS, correct?\""
    },
    {
      "speaker": "And then he answers you, say -- his lawyer gets -- gets involved and says",
      "utterance": "\"Can I have a second?\""
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Then Mr. Ohr, Bruce Ohr, answers you and says",
      "utterance": "\"Right. So, just again, to reiterate, when I spoke with the FBI, I told them my wife was working for Fusion GPS. I told them Fusion GPS was doing research on Donald Trump. You know, I don't know -- I -- know if I used the term opposition research, but certainly that was my -- what I tried to convey to them.\" So explain this exchange and what you got from it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RATCLIFFE",
      "utterance": "Well, remember, Bruce Ohr is the number four person at the Department of Justice at the time. And why this is important, Maria, is what we have been hearing from Jim Himes and from Adam Schiff, and, frankly, from the FBI and the Department of Justice was that the FBI and the Department of Justice really didn't know much about the Steele dossier until much, much later, in the fall of 2016. Bruce Ohr said under oath that, before the Russia investigation was ever opened, on July 30, 2016, he sat down with Christopher Steele. He knew that Christopher Steele had put together this dossier, at the direction of Hillary Clinton and the Democrats. He knew that Christopher Steele was biased and determined to stop Donald Trump. And that's why he wasn't willing to vouch for the credibility or the reliability of Christopher Steele and the dossier. And we know that he told that to the number two person at the FBI, Andy McCabe, then Lisa Page, then Peter Strzok, then Andrew Weissmann, most of whom ended up on Bob Mueller's special counsel team. So, again, all of this flies in the face, most importantly, of what was submitted to the FISA court months later. None of this was revealed."

      "speaker": "RATCLIFFE",
      "utterance": "Yes. You have to ask yourself, if you're interested in finding the truth, would the first witness that you bring in be someone to testify to Congress right before he goes to prison for testifying to Congress untruthfully? That's not where I would go."

Reputations only are good indicators of future conduct. But it's not a promise of that. What I heard Lindsey Graham do there was get a promise from Bill Barr that, if he becomes the attorney general nominee, he will get to the bottom of this and that he's concerned about FISA abuse. And so I'm very heartened by that. And I think the American people should be there's an attorney general nominee who is interested in finally getting to the bottom of all of this."

      "utterance": "That is -- well, if we all feel this way, I mean, if we really do feel this way, this is just not some amorphous philosophical issue. These are real people that can't pay real bills. Then we have got to get this done. So, that doesn't mean we just..."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Now, have you spoken -- have you spoken with Speaker Pelosi about this?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "VAN DREW",
      "utterance": "A small amount, yes, I have, actually."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "VAN DREW",
      "utterance": "And I have spoken about it in caucus and spoken about it through both -- both of those caucuses that you have mentioned as well. The bottom line is..."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "I guess what I'm asking is, are there -- is there a wing of your party that is pushing back against Speaker Pelosi saying, look, let's not go the resist route, and let's actually come up with border security?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "VAN DREW",
      "utterance": "I think there is a part of the party that is beginning to really push this, because it's been taking so long, without question. And I think you will see more and you will hear more. And it doesn't mean we're fractured and everybody is split apart. It just means that we need to get this done."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "VAN DREW",
      "utterance": "And, real quickly, I think that there's ways to do that. So, if we all know that we want to do something about DACA, we all know that we immediately want to open up our government, then we know that the problem is border security. So let's sit down. Maybe we need a panel that both sides agree upon that would determine what the border security would look like."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "VAN DREW",
      "utterance": "And then we move forward. But we just keep doing this."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Because -- because the truth is, the truth is, Congressman, there are some fractures within the party, by the way, on the left and the right. But, specifically on the left, when the vote was happening for Nancy Pelosi, you voted no."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "So I want you to explain that for a moment, because initially, when you vote -- like John Ratcliffe, we just had on, he voted Kevin McCarthy. The majority obviously voted Nancy Pelosi, and that's why she's the speaker. What were you trying to say when you just said no?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "VAN DREW",
      "utterance": "I was trying to say that we needed -- I thought we needed a better process, that we really needed something that represented what at least my constituents wanted. When I spoke to them, they said, we really hope that we get somebody new that doesn't have maybe some of the preexisting ideas and feelings and attitudes towards some of the folks that are there from the past."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Are you willing -- are you willing to allocate some money toward some kind of a barrier fencing, given the fact that Nancy Pelosi already has a wall in her own state?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "VAN DREW",
      "utterance": "Yes. I have made that clear. We are a nation of the rule of law, and we do need some type of barriers. And, as we have all said ad nauseum, in some places, it may be electronic, some places, it may be drone, some places, it may be an actual wall, but we do need to ensure our security. That is part of the deal, and it's something that we should do. And I think that there's a great number of Democrats as well that really believe that that is accurate."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Yes. And, real quick, do you think $5.7 billion seems reasonable?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "VAN DREW",
      "utterance": "If it's spent in an appropriate and reasonable way. And that's what we have to negotiate."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Yes. OK. We have got to jump there."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "VAN DREW",
      "utterance": "And it shouldn't take long."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Congressman, it's great to have you on the program. I hope you will come back soon. Thanks so much, sir."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "VAN DREW",
      "utterance": "I will. Thank you."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Good to see you. \"Sunday Morning Futures,\" that will do it for us. Thanks for being here. Have a great weekend, everybody. Next week in Davos, FOX Business. Join us.
