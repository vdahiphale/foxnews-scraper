How about just six years ago to 2015? And it has nothing to do with the price of gas back then or who the president was back then or another guy teeing up a run for president back then.  No, 2015 was the last time we heard from a singer simply known as Adele, an iconic musical voice whose album \"25\" would be the last we'd hear from her for years, years, six long years. That is until now, because inflation may be back, and you can't change that. But so is Adele. And, really, why would you ever even think about changing that?  Today, today, FOX on top of a pop star back and teasing her return with a single song. I'm sorry. I can so lost. Adele, she's back. There's hope for the world.  Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto. And I know what you're thinking because you did this last time I had an obsession about her. This Adele fixation of yours, Cavuto, is weird. Maybe it makes some of you uncomfortable. Last time I got into this Adele thing, some of you said it was downright creepy. You're old enough to be her father.  True enough. But I'm old enough as well to appreciate this remarkable singer's impeccable timing as well. So, today, today, all of these predictable stories that dominate our national discourse, the mess in Washington, the soaring prices, the spending craziness, well, they're all taking a backseat to a front-and-center superstar that might ever so briefly take our minds off what ails us and might very well unite us, if even for a little while.   Look what it did to the markets today. They're calling it the Adele rally. OK, maybe they're not, but I am. That's why I'm making a big deal of all this, not because of some weird, even disturbing obsession, although it does disturb my wife and so many others, but because of the calming, captivating lyrics Adele brings to a beleaguered world that needs the welcome distraction.   That's why this is so big, because something good is back. What better way to jump into a weekend, right? By the way, you're welcome, America. The world is watching, at least \"Your World.\" So, will \"Easy on Me\" be an easy win for Adele? The world wants to know.  To David Lee Miller on this phenomenon that is Adele -- David Lee.",

      "sentences": "Neil, three words. It's a hit. Adele's video for her new song, \"Easy on Me,\" has already been viewed on YouTube more than 33 million times. And that makes it the ninth most watched video in the first 24 hours of release, that list, by the way, dominated by K-pop. The only other artists on it are Ariana Grande and Taylor Swift.  And the 24 hours, well, that's not even up yet. She still has about three more to continue to climb the list. The entire album, called \"30,\" is set for release on November 19. And like her previous albums, the name is a reference to a certain period of time in her life. In this case, it's when the 33-year-old singer was 30 years old. If early reaction is any guide, it could do better than her last albums, which was the bestselling album of the year 2015, the fourth bestselling album so far this century, selling 22 million copies. It won the Grammy for best album of the year.  Adele recently told an interviewer with Vogue magazine -- she was the cover story as well -- the song \"Easy on Me\" is about what she refers to as her inner turmoil. It deals with life-changing events. The song is dedicated to her 9-year-old son, and she says she hopes the song will help him understand her reason for a recent divorce.  The song and the album seem destined for both commercial and critical success. But Adele is resisting comparisons to her previous blockbuster hit. And she told Vogue -- quote -- \"There isn't a bombastic 'Hello.'\" The new album is expected to be the first time Adele's music can be listened to on a streaming service, by the way, upon its initial release.  And, Neil, I know you're a fan. This won't surprise you. But a recent quote from Adele, she said: \"I didn't write songs about a specific elusive thing.   I write about love, and everyone knows what it's like to have your heart broken\" -- Neil.",

Well, we did reach out to Adele on this stunning development here, because this began at FOX Business, which, if you don't get, you should demand. Of course, Adele already gets it. So she heard about the fuss.  Anyway, she got back to one of my producers on FOX Business, Kevin Fitzgerald. And they said: \"Hi, Kevin. Thanks for reaching. As it turns out, this isn't possible. Best, Benny,\" who is a top P.R. representative. Now, I had told Kevin, let them know you're calling. It's Neil Cavuto. And, all right, he did four or five times.

And, as you say, there's no shortage of particularly women singers and singer-songwriters through history who've done this to great effect.

First, we pushed through regulation and laws and taxes so much manufacturing out of the United States. We haven't done a great job of training our youth how to become tradesmen and tradeswomen. We need welders and plumbers and carpenters and truck drivers. And we should have spent as much time and money on them as we have on college loan programs, where we create doctors of philosophy that have never made anything with their hands. And I don't want to disparage them because I happen to believe that we need real deep thinkers in this country. But, right now, for example, if you're a truck driver on the West Coast, and you want to go into the Port of Long Beach to pick up cargo containers, you have to have a special certification from the government that -- I think it's called a WIC (ph) certificate. And if you're living in Portland, Oregon, for example, there's only one place you can go to get fingerprinted for that. And the lines are horrendous. And the drivers don't want to go there and stand in line, because every day they're standing in that line trying to get fingerprinted, they're not on a road making money. The average truck driver right now is running probably 3, 300 miles a week, up to 7,000 miles a week. They're getting paid 38 cents to 52 cents a mile for that. My goodness gracious, really good McDonald's managers are making damn near twice that. This is craziness that we have got such a dislocation of talent and need against our national interests. And I wish we would start working as hard. Forget infrastructure for the next six months and start working on, how are we going to bring manufacturing back to the United States strategically?

And because of that, we're hearing that he could go home as early as today, maybe even tomorrow. Now, we know President Clinton was admitted to the hospital here in the city of Orange, California, on Tuesday. And he's reportedly getting treatment with for what's said to be a urinary tract infection that had reportedly spread into his bloodstream. His doctors tell us his white blood cell count is trending down and he's responding well to those antibiotics. Now, we're being told this is a pretty common thing to happen to folks who are over the age of 75. So, he should be OK. We also know the former president's wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, is here in California, and she's been seen leaving the hospital after a visit with her husband and former President Bill Clinton. We should also mention, Neil, that President Clinton has had some heart issues in the past. He's had a quadruple bypass surgery. But doctors here say that it has nothing to do with his heart, has nothing to do with COVID. And they're hoping that he gets to go home very soon -- Neil.",

How about just six years ago to 2015? And it has nothing to do with the price of gas back then or who the president was back then or another guy teeing up a run for president back then. No, 2015 was the last time we heard from a singer simply known as Adele, an iconic musical voice whose album \"25\" would be the last we'd hear from her for years, years, six long years. That is until now, because inflation may be back, and you can't change that. But so is Adele. And, really, why would you ever even think about changing that? Today, today, FOX on top of a pop star back and teasing her return with a single song. I'm sorry. I can so lost. Adele, she's back. There's hope for the world. Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto. And I know what you're thinking because you did this last time I had an obsession about her. This Adele fixation of yours, Cavuto, is weird. Maybe it makes some of you uncomfortable. Last time I got into this Adele thing, some of you said it was downright creepy. You're old enough to be her father. True enough. But I'm old enough as well to appreciate this remarkable singer's impeccable timing as well. So, today, today, all of these predictable stories that dominate our national discourse, the mess in Washington, the soaring prices, the spending craziness, well, they're all taking a backseat to a front-and-center superstar that might ever so briefly take our minds off what ails us and might very well unite us, if even for a little while. Look what it did to the markets today. They're calling it the Adele rally. OK, maybe they're not, but I am. That's why I'm making a big deal of all this, not because of some weird, even disturbing obsession, although it does disturb my wife and so many others, but because of the calming, captivating lyrics Adele brings to a beleaguered world that needs the welcome distraction. That's why this is so big, because something good is back. What better way to jump into a weekend, right? By the way, you're welcome, America. The world is watching, at least \"Your World.\" So, will \"Easy on Me\" be an easy win for Adele? The world wants to know. To David Lee Miller on this phenomenon that is Adele -- David Lee."

And the 24 hours, well, that's not even up yet. She still has about three more to continue to climb the list. The entire album, called \"30,\" is set for release on November 19. And like her previous albums, the name is a reference to a certain period of time in her life. In this case, it's when the 33-year-old singer was 30 years old. If early reaction is any guide, it could do better than her last albums, which was the bestselling album of the year 2015, the fourth bestselling album so far this century, selling 22 million copies. It won the Grammy for best album of the year. Adele recently told an interviewer with Vogue magazine -- she was the cover story as well -- the song \"Easy on Me\" is about what she refers to as her inner turmoil. It deals with life-changing events. The song is dedicated to her 9-year-old son, and she says she hopes the song will help him understand her reason for a recent divorce. The song and the album seem destined for both commercial and critical success. But Adele is resisting comparisons to her previous blockbuster hit. And she told Vogue -- quote -- \"There isn't a bombastic 'Hello.'\" The new album is expected to be the first time Adele's music can be listened to on a streaming service, by the way, upon its initial release."

I mean, there's kind of a lot of backlash actually from some of her female fans, which she seems a bit irritated by, because I think she sort of did it for herself. She wasn't doing it to impress anyone or to kind of conform to that Hollywood stereotype. And she's just really done it for herself. But you're right. I think that she does look different. Some people think she likes too thin. I have got to say, I think she's kept it really classy with her style. She looks like old Hollywood glamour in her recent Vogue cover, which reminded me a bit of Brigitte Bardot with the hair curls."

And I told you about the Adele rally on Wall Street, no doubt excitement about this album. There are a lot of you saying the Wall Street rally had nothing to do with Adele. I'd like you to prove that to me. But that's a separate issue. I want to go to Dr. Joe Bennett. He's quoted a great story in The Wall Street Journal today, Berklee College of Music professor, forensic musicology. So he knows of what he speaks. And, Doctor, one of the things I found fascinating is, you go back in history to prove that songs about breakups and divorces, they cut across the musical spectrum here with some of the biggest names. And those songs ended up doing quite well, don't they?"

If you can write about a universal human emotion, in Adele's case, like heartbreak, one that we have all experienced, and if you can do that in a way that communicates to people, it's a very good recipe for a hit, because you're, by definition, talking to something that a large number of people find relatable. And, as you say, there's no shortage of particularly women singers and singer-songwriters through history who've done this to great effect. Adele is the one we're talking about now, but if it had been decades ago, we could have been talking about Edith Piaf or Judy Garland or Dionne Warwick or K.D. Lang."

And, clearly, when you're talking about your own personal autobiographical experience as a songwriter, there's a certain emotional risk there to the artist putting themselves on the line in that way. And yet there's also an opportunity there for the songwriter to mine that experience for the emotional truth that it conveys and to put it down in a lyric that people are much more likely to find understandable and relatable."

A lot of those sounds on \"Rumours\" sound deceptively cheerful when you just listen to the music, but it's only when you get into the lyric analysis when you realize how brutal some of those sentiments really are."

I'm thinking, as I'm ready to go to you, William, it's a good thing that we stream music these days. Because if she had to depend on -- that is, Adele -- I'm sure you're into this as much as I am -- and about this through C.D.s or DVDs delivered to you, they would be waiting on some cargo ship.

But it is important to put the president's announcement on Wednesday into some perspective, right? The ports alone do not make this decision to make America's largest port, Long Beach in L.A., go 24/7. In fact, each port has several terminals, each independently owned. And even though the administration says that Long Beach had already gone to 24/7, and that L.A. Would -- quote -- \"meet that effort,\" only one terminal out of six in Long Beach added the third shift, and only four days, not seven. So it's misleading to suggest that they immediately doubled capacity, as was claimed, 50 percent, anyways. Well, they're trying to get all the players on the same page. But their timetable is 80 days. That's two to three months, not weeks, to scale up to 24/7."

      "utterance": "Yes, we are in a terrible dilemma, Neil. And this has been 30, 35 years in the making. First, we pushed through regulation and laws and taxes so much manufacturing out of the United States. We haven't done a great job of training our youth how to become tradesmen and tradeswomen. We need welders and plumbers and carpenters and truck drivers. And we should have spent as much time and money on them as we have on college loan programs, where we create doctors of philosophy that have never made anything with their hands. And I don't want to disparage them because I happen to believe that we need real deep thinkers in this country. But, right now, for example, if you're a truck driver on the West Coast, and you want to go into the Port of Long Beach to pick up cargo containers, you have to have a special certification from the government that -- I think it's called a WIC (ph) certificate. And if you're living in Portland, Oregon, for example, there's only one place you can go to get fingerprinted for that. And the lines are horrendous. And the drivers don't want to go there and stand in line, because every day they're standing in that line trying to get fingerprinted, they're not on a road making money. The average truck driver right now is running probably 3, 300 miles a week, up to 7,000 miles a week. They're getting paid 38 cents to 52 cents a mile for that. My goodness gracious, really good McDonald's managers are making damn near twice that. This is craziness that we have got such a dislocation of talent and need against our national interests. And I wish we would start working as hard. Forget infrastructure for the next six months and start working on, how are we going to bring manufacturing back to the United States strategically? This is so, so important, not only because we need to have U.S.-made goods, but we need to have jobs for our citizens."

We have a shortage of strategic development of truck drivers with a pay that's fair and honest. At least a restaurant manager gets to go home every night. A guy running a truck up and down the highway is criticized nonstop for the way they drive, and they never see their family. It's a very difficult lifestyle. And we do nothing to help them."

No Republican in the House of Representatives was allowed to negotiate on this deal and work in a bipartisan way. And so it's very difficult for Republicans in the House to support this bill.

So what do you think American companies and businesses are going to do? They're going to take their business overseas, which means fewer jobs, lower wages for American employees in this country. It's all around going to be -- it's going to go from bad to worse economically for our country if we allow Bernie Sanders and AOC, self-avowed socialists, to write this budget, like Biden's letting them do."

Thank God for Democrats like Kyrsten Sinema and Joe Manchin that are holding their own and holding the line and holding all the cards right now to try to reduce that, that spending figure, that, if it does pass, it'll be lower than 3.5 even. So, it's very difficult to say what's going to happen. It's really easy. I have to tell you. A lot of people say, well, what about all these difficult votes this year? Voting no is the easiest thing to do. The question is going to become is, when Republicans are in power, when we win the majority in 2022, what are we going to do with it? Are we going to do, as we have always done, which is increase the debt ceiling, like we have 98 times since World War II? Are we going to increase taxes?

Ahead of that particular curve was the mayor of Miami, Francis Suarez, who joins us right now. Mayor, you were very keen before many others on having the city be able to pay its workers in Bitcoin.

And I think people want a currency or a store of value that is devoid of all that.

The fact that China doesn't control it, and that's why they want to ban it, is something that I think should give all Americans a desire to want to know more about it. And, certainly, from the perspective of mining, which is how you authenticate the Bitcoin transactions, before, China was a powerhouse in mining. They had -- they were sort of the superpower, if you will, in mining. And they did it with dirty energy. We're doing it here in the United States. We have just eclipsed China as the number one country in the world in mining. And what's amazing is, we're doing it with clean energy.

      "speaker": "JEFF PAUL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Yes. Yes, Neil, President Clinton is said to be doing dramatically better and getting back to his usual self. And because of that, we're hearing that he could go home as early as today, maybe even tomorrow. Now, we know President Clinton was admitted to the hospital here in the city of Orange, California, on Tuesday. And he's reportedly getting treatment with for what's said to be a urinary tract infection that had reportedly spread into his bloodstream. His doctors tell us his white blood cell count is trending down and he's responding well to those antibiotics. Now, we're being told this is a pretty common thing to happen to folks who are over the age of 75. So, he should be OK. We also know the former president's wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, is here in California, and she's been seen leaving the hospital after a visit with her husband and former President Bill Clinton. We should also mention, Neil, that President Clinton has had some heart issues in the past. He's had a quadruple bypass surgery. But doctors here say that it has nothing to do with his heart, has nothing to do with COVID. And they're hoping that he gets to go home very soon -- Neil."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "DR. SYRA MADAD, NEW YORK CITY HEALTH AND HOSPITALS",
      "utterance": "Well, I think based on information that's available and looking at, obviously, some information coming out, he's on the mend. And, as mentioned, it's a UTI. So it's a non-COVID-related illness, and it is treatable. So, wishing President Clinton health and a speedy recovery."

      "utterance": "What do you make, meanwhile, of what's been happening on the COVID front in this country, where cases are markedly going down? I believe, just in the last week, Doctor, four million more Americans have gotten some form of a shot, all the way up from their first COVID vaccine shot to a booster shot. What did you make of that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MADAD",
      "utterance": "Yes, this is an exciting time in the pandemic, in a sense, where we have so much great data, and you're seeing FDA's advisory committee meet today, yesterday, and they're going to meet tomorrow. There's a lot that's on the agenda in terms of talking about the booster shots. So, as we know, there's the recommendation from the advisory committees to move ahead with booster doses of Moderna, J&J, and then they're going to also be talking about the mixing and matching. And so, all told, as you have mentioned, cases are decreasing, hospitalizations are decreasing, same thing with death, but we're still seeing an increasing number of cases in certain parts of the United States. So it's just important to continue to be vigilant and continue to abide by the public health guidance, because we want to make sure we get out of this safely as a nation, as well as around the world."

      "speaker": "MADAD",
      "utterance": "Well, I'm a mother as well. I'm a mother of three children, and all three would qualify for that pediatric vaccine. So I'm certainly excited and looking forward to it. But I want to also see the data. Right now, the top-line data that we have is from these press releases from Pfizer, for example. And it looks like it's great in terms of its effectiveness, in terms of its tolerability and the immune response, but I also want to see the data. And once I -- once the FDA committee also meets and CDC meets, and they provide their recommendation, I certainly am looking forward to getting my children vaccinated. We want to go back to normalish as soon as possible for our children as well."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Yes, I like that, normalish. You're right. I mean, we don't know what that is anymore, right? But, Doctor, another thing that has occurred to me, with this booster push, I was surprised so many people who are getting that without consulting their doctors. In other words, they're getting it on their own. I guess it's OK to do that. I assume it doesn't hurt. But are you surprised by that, that a lot of people just going, signing up with CVS or Walgreens or any one of these outlets to get it without discussing it with their doctor?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MADAD",
      "utterance": "You know, it's easy to go ahead and get a COVID-19 vaccine, whether it's your first, second, third or your booster shot."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MADAD",
      "utterance": "You don't really have to show much in terms of getting, that dose, if you will. And it's a lot on the honor system, like from the beginning of the pandemic. I think what's the -- where we need to continue to improve is on that science communication. And people are going to try to make the best decision for themselves and their family, in the absence of any public health guidance. And we have been relatively slow in giving this information because we're waiting on data, which is important. But it's making people get nervous and wanting to go ahead and be active and take that next step. And so I would just urge Americans to talk to your provider just to ensure that you meet the criteria and it's what's best for you. But we know these vaccines are safe and effective."

Tom Maoli not at all surprised, a car dealership owner, kind enough to join us. Tom, this is a pattern. What's going on?"

      "utterance": "Well, listen, you got to chip issue. You got the supply chain issue. And they can't get these vehicles manufactured fast enough. The -- all the plants shut down due to COVID. Then we have the chip issue. We have the supply chain issue. And the manufacturers just can't produce the product. And add to it the labor factor, Neil."

We're at -- inventory levels are at an all-time low. Historically, we kept a 90-day supply on our dealerships' parking lots. Right now, we're less than 30-day supply. And I have to tell you, there are not enough used cars out there either. People are holding on to their cars. They're not selling their used cars. So it's a very interesting dynamic. It's an epidemic."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "A lot of dealerships are calling in leases, in other words, telling people, even if they have many months to go on the lease, bring their car in. And even if they don't get a new car, I guess the strategy is, sell that car."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MAOLI",
      "utterance": "Well, listen, people are turning in leases, and dealerships are trying to buy them because they need product to sell to their customers. They need used cars."

      "utterance": "Right."

But I have to tell you, I just got back from Las Vegas. I was at several dealer meetings with the manufacturers. And this is not going to end soon. They're talking about into 2022, possibly into 2023."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "MAOLI",
      "utterance": "And it's unbelievable. People are willing to wait one year. And I have to tell you something. It's basic economics. It's supply and demand. What's going on in the marketplace today is that prices are rising on a monthly basis. The manufacturers are pushing the price up because they have less supply, and they need to make more money."

So, we will be following that. Also updating you on any calls that we might be getting from Adele on the release of her song \"Easy on Me.\" This thing has been downloaded, what, better than 25 million times. Someone was telling me more like 50 million times. The new thinner, ridiculously thinner Adele -- I think she's lost way too much weight, but it has not impacted her voice at all. I'm going to play a little bit of her song. Let you know that, well, she will probably be on my live Saturday show, or at least we will have an update for you. My staff is telling me, Neil, the message light is on, on your phone. So, I know what that means. But, again, tomorrow, we're focusing on that. We're focusing on all these car delays and shipment delays and cargo problems. But, you know, as bad as things are, the good news, is Adele is back.
