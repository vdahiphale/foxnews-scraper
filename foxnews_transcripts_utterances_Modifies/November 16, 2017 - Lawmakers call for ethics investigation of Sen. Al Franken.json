It's 5 o'clock in New York City and this is \"The Five.\" Another bombshell of sexual harassment allegation rock Capitol Hill, this time a sitting senator is the accused. Al Franken, a Democrat from Minnesota, has apologized after a woman came forward with damning accusations today. Leeann Tweeden, a news anchor at a radio station in L.A., accuses the senator of harassing and groping her when they were on a USO tour together in 2006 before Franken was a member of congress, and she has some proof. She posted this picture along with a column titled, Senator Al Franken kissed and groped me without my consent and there's nothing funny about it. Here is more from Tweeden.",

It's completely inappropriate. Senator majority leader Mitch McConnell has called for an ethics committee investigation of Franken and so has the senator himself. He says he will gladly cooperate. A second accuser name Melanie Morgan also came forward today alleging Franken harassed her years ago.  All right. Indeed, rapidly developing story, Greg, because we have two accusations now, and also proof. We're talking about this yesterday with the juxtaposition of Roy Moore, and people want -- OK, let's do a full due process investigation, find out what's going on.

So clearly this kind of thing was weighing on her for a while and it upset her. And you look at the picture and my first thing, OK, that's -- it's humiliating because you don't know that it's happening, but if he's touching her then that's actual assault, but I can't tell if he's touching her or not. But regardless, it is a humiliating thing that somebody is doing something without your knowledge. And of course, that's separate from what else he did when he forced a kiss from her in the green room, which I happen to think she's telling the truth because look what we're saying there. My senses that there's going to be more of these stories, and they're going to affect all occupations. I think that there need to be some kind of process. One of the encouraging things out of this one that I see is that she came forward with this. He apologized. She accepted his apology, which I find kind of interesting. Could this be the start of a new process in dealing with these problems? Because right now, in the realm of public opinion, everything is equal, all men are created equal, but not all accusations are equal. We have no way of prioritizing what is severe and what is stupid. And I think there have to be a process for this other than just saying, like, we're all putting all of this stuff in the same file. Does that make sense? I guess? I don't know.",

It doesn't matter what the rest of the general public thinks. It's incumbent about the woman who is victimized or the person who was victimize to comes to term with that. A quick point of the macro picture here is I think all of the stuff, from Bill Cosby, years ago, through Harvey Weinstein, Roy Moore, Al Franken, this moment really highlights that I think the harassment of women and assault of women is not just a women's issue. It's something that the entire American population has to grapple with. And it's also certainly not a political issue. Too often, lately, we turn to focusing on the perpetrator's identity and their politics. And that does a disservice to everybody, because this is not a political issue. Rate victims, assault victims, I really don't care whether the perpetrators are liberals, or conservatives, Republicans, or Democrats. This is a much more important issue. It transcends politics. And I think our discussion is not just like here at the table, but the American discourse should reflect that.",

Greg makes a great point because we're putting pedophilia, allegedly, drugging women, raping women, exposing yourself in a basket of a grope, or a kiss, or something like that unwanted. The whole thing is a mess. So Franken has supported victims of sexual assault throughout his career, which makes him a hypocrite. But it also, for the left, makes them more reluctant to hang the guy. Now sending Franken to the senate ethics committee is a complete whitewash. The ethics committee cannot do a good job. They're not transparent. There's no accountability. There's only been one action taken by the senate ethics committee in the last five years and it was a sternly worded letter to some senator. So the senate can't police itself, that's one thing. And congress needs to get off its high horse because congress, like the rest of the institutions in this country, has a problem with sexual harassment. They settled, I believe, 260 cases since the late 90s of sexual harassment and discrimination to the tune of $15 million. That's over ten settlements per year. That's our money. We don't know who settled these cases. We have a right to know since we're paying for it. So I'd like to see what those results are.",

What I would say to you, Kimberly, that this comes in an atmosphere that really is at the moment, Harvey Weinstein, and now Roy Moore down in Alabama.

She actually had a friend who said afterwards she saw her with a bloody mouth and she was rattled. You had a settlement with Paula Jones for almost a million dollars for sexual harassment. And then, Kathleen Wiley said she was groped in the White House. Right now, you don't see Republicans trying to destroy the accusers personally in the Alabama situation. Yet, during those whole -- when the women came through with these allegations against Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton herself called Monica a narcissistic loonie-toon. Hillary Clinton called Gennifer Flowers a failed cabaret singer. And James Carville famously said of Gennifer Flower, drag a $100 bill through a trailer park.

ISIS is nearly destroyed as Syria institutes terrorist rehab. Hope there's yoga. So what's the difference there? Trump. Back here consumer confidence is high, reflecting a country's mood under a new president. If you think the guy wants to do business, you're more inclined to do it too. That's Trump. There's other stuff: Illegal immigration is down, Trump. Our energy policy seems adult for once. That's Trump. Yet, what do we see? The same names and faces unloading bitter comedy that they presume is edgy when it's actually the opposite. Joe Scarborough, a poor man's Sonny Bono, is releasing a record called \"A Very Drump Christmas.\" Drump was the name that liberals tried to stick on Trump. It failed because it wasn't memorable -- much like Joe. And Alec Baldwin said in a speech that you can't be mean enough to Trump, which raises the question, how can you be meaner than chopping off his head? So what you're saying is more cognitive bias, clouding how they see everything. If Trump does good it's pure dumb luck. But if he does bad, it's because he's evil. But try explaining that allusion to Joe or Alec. The world's moved on without them. They're like comedians doing jokes about Y2K or Britney Spears. The material is moldier than a dorm room shower curtain. But to them it's still smells new, but also Trump is funnier.",

I will say the thing that gives me, that makes me think there's hope for the bill, is that President Trump has really put in a lot of skin in the game. One of the reasons health care didn't work out for him, according to the Hill, is that he kind of farmed out the details to them. And said, \"McConnell, Ryan, you guys figure it out. I'm just telling you what I want. You have to figure out how to make it happen.\" On this, from day one, he's been right there every step away, from issuing that 70-point that he had the White House staff draft up, to today when he went for this kind of pep rally in the last -- in the home stretch.

      "utterance": "Hello, everyone. I'm Kimberly Guilfoyle along with Juan Williams, Jesse Watters, Gillian Turner, and Greg Gutfeld. It's 5 o'clock in New York City and this is \"The Five.\" Another bombshell of sexual harassment allegation rock Capitol Hill, this time a sitting senator is the accused. Al Franken, a Democrat from Minnesota, has apologized after a woman came forward with damning accusations today. Leeann Tweeden, a news anchor at a radio station in L.A., accuses the senator of harassing and groping her when they were on a USO tour together in 2006 before Franken was a member of congress, and she has some proof. She posted this picture along with a column titled, Senator Al Franken kissed and groped me without my consent and there's nothing funny about it. Here is more from Tweeden."

      "speaker": "LEANN TWEEDEN, BROADCASTER",
      "utterance": "He came at me and before I've even knew it, he put his hand on the back of my head and came towards me and matched his face against my mouth and stuck his tongue in my mouth. And, you know, I sort of pushed him back and I said don't ever do that to me again. And I was so angry, and I walked out of there."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUILFOYLE",
      "utterance": "Franken doesn't deny some of the allegations, along with his apology. He said this in a statement, I respect women. I don't respect men who don't. I don't know what was in my head when I took that picture, and it doesn't matter. There is no excuse. I'll look at it now and I feel disgusted with myself. It isn't funny. It's completely inappropriate. Senator majority leader Mitch McConnell has called for an ethics committee investigation of Franken and so has the senator himself. He says he will gladly cooperate. A second accuser name Melanie Morgan also came forward today alleging Franken harassed her years ago. All right. Indeed, rapidly developing story, Greg, because we have two accusations now, and also proof. We're talking about this yesterday with the juxtaposition of Roy Moore, and people want -- OK, let's do a full due process investigation, find out what's going on. She's come forward with proof, a picture they say is worth a thousand words."

      "utterance": "I've to say, I've known Leeann going way back. She's a good friend of mine. She's used to do -- all the time. She once gave me combat boots for Christmas. So she's no snowflake. So clearly this kind of thing was weighing on her for a while and it upset her. And you look at the picture and my first thing, OK, that's -- it's humiliating because you don't know that it's happening, but if he's touching her then that's actual assault, but I can't tell if he's touching her or not. But regardless, it is a humiliating thing that somebody is doing something without your knowledge. And of course, that's separate from what else he did when he forced a kiss from her in the green room, which I happen to think she's telling the truth because look what we're saying there. My senses that there's going to be more of these stories, and they're going to affect all occupations. I think that there need to be some kind of process. One of the encouraging things out of this one that I see is that she came forward with this. He apologized. She accepted his apology, which I find kind of interesting. Could this be the start of a new process in dealing with these problems? Because right now, in the realm of public opinion, everything is equal, all men are created equal, but not all accusations are equal. We have no way of prioritizing what is severe and what is stupid. And I think there have to be a process for this other than just saying, like, we're all putting all of this stuff in the same file. Does that make sense? I guess? I don't know."

      "speaker": "GUILFOYLE",
      "utterance": "Gillian, what do you think about that in terms of saying there have to be a process, and perhaps this new, sort of, template or framework for how people can go forward? You make the accusation, you have the proof, the person apologizes, where do you go from there and what do you think about this story?"

      "speaker": "GILLIAN TURNER, GUEST CO-HOST",
      "utterance": "I think the more cases where you have a perpetrator who acknowledges what happened and then apologizes, if the victim can personally forgive them, then that is a path forward. It doesn't matter what the rest of the general public thinks. It's incumbent about the woman who is victimized or the person who was victimize to comes to term with that. A quick point of the macro picture here is I think all of the stuff, from Bill Cosby, years ago, through Harvey Weinstein, Roy Moore, Al Franken, this moment really highlights that I think the harassment of women and assault of women is not just a women's issue. It's something that the entire American population has to grapple with. And it's also certainly not a political issue. Too often, lately, we turn to focusing on the perpetrator's identity and their politics. And that does a disservice to everybody, because this is not a political issue. Rate victims, assault victims, I really don't care whether the perpetrators are liberals, or conservatives, Republicans, or Democrats. This is a much more important issue. It transcends politics. And I think our discussion is not just like here at the table, but the American discourse should reflect that."

And then like Greg said, perhaps it provides a framework going forward. And it's educational, Jesse, so people understand, you know, this is not acceptable."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JESSE WATTERS, CO-HOST",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. And he should be held accountable, which I believe he will be. The initial apology, if anybody read it, was really bad. He trivialized it and said something along lines of, you know, I'm really sorry that she misremembered it or remembered it differently than I did."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUILFOYLE",
      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "And then acted like it was a skit that was done in poor taste. The second apology was much better, and she accepted it. So there's no lawsuit. There is an accepted apology. Greg makes a great point because we're putting pedophilia, allegedly, drugging women, raping women, exposing yourself in a basket of a grope, or a kiss, or something like that unwanted. The whole thing is a mess. So Franken has supported victims of sexual assault throughout his career, which makes him a hypocrite. But it also, for the left, makes them more reluctant to hang the guy. Now sending Franken to the senate ethics committee is a complete whitewash. The ethics committee cannot do a good job. They're not transparent. There's no accountability. There's only been one action taken by the senate ethics committee in the last five years and it was a sternly worded letter to some senator. So the senate can't police itself, that's one thing. And congress needs to get off its high horse because congress, like the rest of the institutions in this country, has a problem with sexual harassment. They settled, I believe, 260 cases since the late 90s of sexual harassment and discrimination to the tune of $15 million. That's over ten settlements per year. That's our money. We don't know who settled these cases. We have a right to know since we're paying for it. So I'd like to see what those results are."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST",
      "utterance": "Well, I think he reacted pretty well, especially when he apologized. I think that was appropriate. The thing about it is, this was on some USO tour. I'm not sure what's going on between entertainers and the like, but what was clear, and I think this is picking up on what Greg said, she felt that somehow he had crossed the line then she deserved an apology. It should be clear that in doing her job, she doesn't have to put up with that kind of foolishness. What I would say to you, Kimberly, that this comes in an atmosphere that really is at the moment, Harvey Weinstein, and now Roy Moore down in Alabama. The political context is so important for us at this moment. And in that context, we see things like the liberals, and I'll speak to that as a Democrat here, liberals saying, hey, you know what? We should have paid attention to Bill Clinton. Oh, my gosh. Writer for the box, writer from the New York Times saying, you know, I'm going back and I'm looking back on this and I believe Juanita Broderick and all the rest."

I think the left is doing this because they fear that Republicans, the conservatives will say, hey, you didn't go after your guys but you want to go after Judge Moore, and therefore you're a hypocrite. How dare you do this?"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "So -- but my point to you is, I think that when you look at what's going on on the right with Judge Moore at the moment, you see the same kind of -- I don't know, angst or upset President Trump today, can't say a word. Not say a word. Guess what? Steve Bannon still can't say a word. But Drudge said, Steve Bannon was no. Then Breitbart comes out and says fake news coming from Drudge. No, Steve Bannon is not abandoning Roy Moore. And we see in the polls, Moore's numbers going down. But I don't see any big change in terms of the Republican Party establishment on Moore, and I think Republicans in some extent are delighting in the trouble that now beset Al Franken, say, oh, this is equivalent. Well, again, Greg's point, this ain't equivalent."

And I think that also having a senate that -- votes that he wins, and the senate votes to expel him with a two-thirds majority vote, that's even worse in a sense because then he becomes the first senator since like the civil war, since the 19th century, to be expelled, and the first one ever to be expelled for these kinds of charges. He's an albatross around the GOP's neck at this point."

Even if Donald Trump himself said Moore has got to go, I think Moore might still stay in there. Juan also brought up the Clinton situation and that's interesting because I'd like to talk about that. Multiple women have had consensual affairs with Bill Clinton. That's not the issue. It was the Juanita Broaddrick accusation of rape. She actually had a friend who said afterwards she saw her with a bloody mouth and she was rattled. You had a settlement with Paula Jones for almost a million dollars for sexual harassment. And then, Kathleen Wiley said she was groped in the White House. Right now, you don't see Republicans trying to destroy the accusers personally in the Alabama situation. Yet, during those whole -- when the women came through with these allegations against Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton herself called Monica a narcissistic loonie-toon. Hillary Clinton called Gennifer Flowers a failed cabaret singer. And James Carville famously said of Gennifer Flower, drag a $100 bill through a trailer park. You never know you'll find Stephanopoulos, even said these are just bimbos. Remember the whole bimbo eruption. You had Gloria Steinem, feminist icon, defend Bill Clinton."

This is now officially allegation nation. And we lack the deliberate body to assess matters. So it's going to come and it's going to hurt everybody unless we learn to find a process that says when an allegation happens, instead of it being followed by media hysteria, that there some kind of deliberate way of assessing it. What you're seeing with Franken is at least the beginning of something because you saw -- she came out with it. He responds. She accepts it. I don't know where it goes from there, but at least it's something. Seems like progress. I don't know."

George Bush -- George Herbert Walker Bush just got accused again for grabbing a woman butt. And you see that that's lumping. Dustin Hoffman was accused of something, something creepy to an intern. That's lumped in. We're in the media. We're throwing it all into one pot stirring it up."

      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "If you look beyond the sea of scandals, you see some pretty positive things. First, look abroad. China is sending an envoy to North Korea. Why? Donald Trump. ISIS is nearly destroyed as Syria institutes terrorist rehab. Hope there's yoga. So what's the difference there? Trump. Back here consumer confidence is high, reflecting a country's mood under a new president. If you think the guy wants to do business, you're more inclined to do it too. That's Trump. There's other stuff: Illegal immigration is down, Trump. Our energy policy seems adult for once. That's Trump. Yet, what do we see? The same names and faces unloading bitter comedy that they presume is edgy when it's actually the opposite. Joe Scarborough, a poor man's Sonny Bono, is releasing a record called \"A Very Drump Christmas.\" Drump was the name that liberals tried to stick on Trump. It failed because it wasn't memorable -- much like Joe. And Alec Baldwin said in a speech that you can't be mean enough to Trump, which raises the question, how can you be meaner than chopping off his head? So what you're saying is more cognitive bias, clouding how they see everything. If Trump does good it's pure dumb luck. But if he does bad, it's because he's evil. But try explaining that allusion to Joe or Alec. The world's moved on without them. They're like comedians doing jokes about Y2K or Britney Spears. The material is moldier than a dorm room shower curtain. But to them it's still smells new, but also Trump is funnier."

Some of these issues don't really have a solution that I can see. So I don't know what they're going to do there. I will say the thing that gives me, that makes me think there's hope for the bill, is that President Trump has really put in a lot of skin in the game. One of the reasons health care didn't work out for him, according to the Hill, is that he kind of farmed out the details to them. And said, \"McConnell, Ryan, you guys figure it out. I'm just telling you what I want. You have to figure out how to make it happen.\" On this, from day one, he's been right there every step away, from issuing that 70-point that he had the White House staff draft up, to today when he went for this kind of pep rally in the last -- in the home stretch.
