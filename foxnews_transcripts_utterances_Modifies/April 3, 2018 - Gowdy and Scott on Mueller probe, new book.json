Also, those swirling rumors on the Hill that many Republicans are ready to give up on their conservative agenda until after the midterm elections. But first tonight, the latest on two stories that are breaking right now. At the U.S.-Mexico border, where the president said today he will send our military, as a caravan of migrants in a coordinated effort to try to cross through Mexico and to the United States border to then demand asylum in the United States. And also, tonight in California where authorities are trying to figure out what let a woman to open fire on fellow employees at YouTube headquarters leaving several people injured before shooting and killing herself. Trace Gallagher joins us now live from our West Coast Newsroom with the developments as we get started tonight on 'The Story.' Hi, Trace.",

San Bruno, as you know, was just on the northern edge of the Silicon Valley, an area that certainly remains a driving force in the economy, and the shooting there has gathered great response. The president tweeting: 'Was just briefed on the shooting at YouTube's headquarters in San Bruno, California, our thoughts and prayers are with everybody involved. Thank you to our phenomenal law enforcement officers and first responders that are currently on the scene.' Apple CEO Tim Cook writing: 'From everyone at Apple, we send our sympathy and support to the team at YouTube and Google, especially the victims and their families.'

Let me start actually by showing both of you this tweet from Vicente Fox. He says to President Trump, \"To militarize the southern border is to provoke more hate and distance even further our nation. Somebody has to talk some sense into him. He's elevating his hate towards Mexico causing a greater conflict.\" And yet, Juan, you know, you heard from the ambassador to the United States from Mexico last night, he said we get it. You know, we have the same kind of problems that we want an orderly immigration system. There's every reason to understand why Americans and the president might be alarmed at what's going on.   JUAN HERNANDEZ, FORMER ADVISER TO MEXICAN PRESIDENT VICENTE FOX (via Skype): Well, yes, I was expecting that President Trump after Easter Sunday to have a little bit more of a humanitarian Christian attitude. I mean, we're talking about a few hundred people; some it's up 1200 people from Central America -- mostly from Honduras. They're looking for some type of help, asylum in the United States.

But it doesn't really matter if it's only a few hundred people or if it's thousands of people. What we heard from the ambassador to Mexico last night, when he spoke with Bret, was that Mexico turns back tens of thousands of people back over that Honduras border. So, I mean, it just, it sort of raises a lot of questions about the process here.

What they do for us, is they free up our resources. If you look at this multibillion dollar industry, with the smugglers and the cartels do, is they cross these asylum-seekers, if you will, across the border illegally instead of through the ports of entry, and what that does is that ties our hands because we then have to respond, we have to takes those individuals into custody, it takes manpower out of the field and it leaves gaps in the border which then allows the smugglers to run their higher profit products through the border like opioids, drugs, and other contraband.

The first look we're getting at this memo that was buried deep in a 57-page court filing by Robert Mueller, it was submitted by the special counsel showing that his authority was widened to covered a lot more than just Paul Manafort's alleged coordination with Russia officials, specifically this may give President Trump more fodder for his criticism that this investigation has gotten too far in its scope. The bottom line is, specifically, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein authorized Mueller to investigate any crimes related to payments that Manafort receive from the government of the Ukrainian president who served from 2010 to 2014. So, not in Russia. And long before the Trump campaign was in business. That news came as we saw the first sentencing in the probe today, 32-year-old Dutch attorney, Alex van der Zwaan, sentenced for the lying to federal investigators. That carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison. But the attorney whose father-in-law is a Russia oligarch with ties to President Vladimir Putin got 30 days in prison, a $20,000 fine, and two months of supervised release. He worked with Rick Gates who's a former business partner, of course, of Manafort, and is now cooperating with the special counsel. The council now probing contacts between Gates, Manafort, and the lawyer, and a suspected operative for Russian intelligence as well. Meanwhile, the wife of fired FBI Deputy Director, Andrew McCabe, went on the record for the very first time, calling last year a nightmare for her family. Remember, she ran unsuccessfully for Virginia State Senate seat in 2015. Now insist her husband did not campaign for her despite this photo we so many times it appeared to show otherwise. As for the more than $600,000 she received in campaign money with help from then Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe -- of course, a close Clinton ally. She says, the FBI concluded there was no conflict for her husband because he was overseeing the Clinton email investigation after the campaign was over. Now, in a Washington Post op-ed, she writes: 'I have spent countless hours trying to understand how the president and so many others can share such destructive lies about me. I want people to know that the whole story, that everything is based on just false and utterly absurd.' Now, critics of McCabe believe the ethics findings were off-base and that McCabe's real problem is that he had those unauthorized leaks to the media which were found by the FBI Office of Professional Responsibility and he lied to investigators.

That really has had a major impact and I think we'll have a ripple effect throughout this country for years to come. Number two, African-American unemployment has not seen this level, 6.9 percent, in probably two decades, if I'm right, maybe three decades. So, the economic policies of this administration have led us to a level of prosperity that we cannot -- we would not have imagined two years ago.

Barr's praise of President Trump in this show is also huge focus of the attention it's getting. But my next guest is not surprised that this reboot is resonating in America, and it could possibly signal some of what we might see that could also surprise people in the 2018 midterms. Mark Penn writing, quote, Roseanne is bringing conservative American women out of the closet. Here now, Mark Penn, presidential pollster and advisor to Bill and Hillary Clinton, and author of the new book, 'Microtrends Squared,' the new small forces driving the big disruption today.

Let me start actually by showing both of you this tweet from Vicente Fox. He says to President Trump, \"To militarize the southern border is to provoke more hate and distance even further our nation. Somebody has to talk some sense into him. He's elevating his hate towards Mexico causing a greater conflict.\" And yet, Juan, you know, you heard from the ambassador to the United States from Mexico last night, he said we get it.

The United States, I think, is probably the most benevolent nation in the world, when you look aid that goes to other countries. But it doesn't really matter if it's only a few hundred people or if it's thousands of people. What we heard from the ambassador to Mexico last night, when he spoke with Bret, was that Mexico turns back tens of thousands of people back over that Honduras border. So, I mean, it just, it sort of raises a lot of questions about the process here. I mean, imagine people were coming across the border from Mexico, and then buses and caravans were being arranged for them to go straight into Canada.

It was his number one domestic policy when he was campaigning and he's followed through on that. When he talks about putting the military on the border, we've done that before. President Obama did that. We did that during the Vicente Fox's time as president in Mexico. So, he's not escalating any hate. He's not any escalating any discontent. What he's trying to do is he's trying to secure a sovereign nation from people that are crossing the borders illegally.

That's the border -- that's my job, that's Border Patrol agents' job. It's our job to actually determine whether or not somebody is here in the United States illegally. What they do for us, is they free up our resources. If you look at this multibillion dollar industry, with the smugglers and the cartels do, is they cross these asylum-seekers, if you will, across the border illegally instead of through the ports of entry, and what that does is that ties our hands because we then have to respond, we have to takes those individuals into custody, it takes manpower out of the field and it leaves gaps in the border which then allows the smugglers to run their higher profit products through the border like opioids, drugs, and other contraband. And so, the smugglers know exactly what they're doing and they're using these asylum-seekers as pawns. That's why we have to do something to secure the border so that we have an orderly immigration process. And without that, we're going to continue to talk about this year after year, after year, and it's always going to be a topic of presidential campaigns."

He knows he's a thug, he knows he's a bully, he knows he's ambitious, he's aggressive, he knows that Russia is becoming more capable and more dangerous. He knows he's manipulated world leaders, he wants in that room with him. He knows he also had to deal with guys like this."

That's what Obama walked away from. Bush won the war in Iraq. Obama lost the piece. The same thing and Libya. We deposed Gaddafi. The new regime came in, elected by his people, wanted some help to deal with the radicals. We've said no; we lost the whole country. We were out of there and we lost our embassy.

Why is the United States the only bill payer here? In NATO, in other places. The other participants have got to ante up and this is their neighborhood.

      "speaker": "ED HENRY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Martha, great to see you. The first look we're getting at this memo that was buried deep in a 57-page court filing by Robert Mueller, it was submitted by the special counsel showing that his authority was widened to covered a lot more than just Paul Manafort's alleged coordination with Russia officials, specifically this may give President Trump more fodder for his criticism that this investigation has gotten too far in its scope. The bottom line is, specifically, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein authorized Mueller to investigate any crimes related to payments that Manafort receive from the government of the Ukrainian president who served from 2010 to 2014. So, not in Russia. And long before the Trump campaign was in business. That news came as we saw the first sentencing in the probe today, 32-year-old Dutch attorney, Alex van der Zwaan, sentenced for the lying to federal investigators. That carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison. But the attorney whose father-in-law is a Russia oligarch with ties to President Vladimir Putin got 30 days in prison, a $20,000 fine, and two months of supervised release. He worked with Rick Gates who's a former business partner, of course, of Manafort, and is now cooperating with the special counsel. The council now probing contacts between Gates, Manafort, and the lawyer, and a suspected operative for Russian intelligence as well. Meanwhile, the wife of fired FBI Deputy Director, Andrew McCabe, went on the record for the very first time, calling last year a nightmare for her family. Remember, she ran unsuccessfully for Virginia State Senate seat in 2015. Now insist her husband did not campaign for her despite this photo we so many times it appeared to show otherwise. As for the more than $600,000 she received in campaign money with help from then Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe -- of course, a close Clinton ally. She says, the FBI concluded there was no conflict for her husband because he was overseeing the Clinton email investigation after the campaign was over. Now, in a Washington Post op-ed, she writes: 'I have spent countless hours trying to understand how the president and so many others can share such destructive lies about me. I want people to know that the whole story, that everything is based on just false and utterly absurd.' Now, critics of McCabe believe the ethics findings were off-base and that McCabe's real problem is that he had those unauthorized leaks to the media which were found by the FBI Office of Professional Responsibility and he lied to investigators. Martha."

And to Jesse Lee Evans, Trey's grandmother, who shared with artists a love of South Carolina and a profound faith in God.

The truth of the matter is that the southern heart has come so far in such a short period of time. And when we were born, we would not have been able to play together, lunch together, drink out from the same water fountain, but 50 years later, the good Lord and the good people of South Carolina have transformed who we are, and that has provided an unlikely friendship to start and to blossom. So much so that after the church shooting, Emanuel, another church shooting, the first person I turned to was Trey Gowdy, a white guy from the very state that has a provocative, and yet, rich history on race. And it's just a testament on how far we can come if we focus on the things that we have in common. And in 'Unified' we try to help people understand though we differ on some parts of law enforcement, some part of education, spiritually we're in different corners at times, the fact of the matter is if you focus on the things you have in common, our country as polarizing as it's seems today, could still be one nation under God, indivisibles with the best and brightest days of our future ahead of her."

After the Charlottesville situation, he and I were on very different pages as it relates to the provocative history of race in this country. He invited me to the oval office to have a conversation about it. One of the things that came out of that conversation was legislation that I was pushing. It was investing in opportunity to focus on distressed communities. President Trump said yes, let's find a way to work for those folks who are stuck, who lack the same opportunities that he had and that I have had. That really has had a major impact and I think we'll have a ripple effect throughout this country for years to come. Number two, African-American unemployment has not seen this level, 6.9 percent, in probably two decades, if I'm right, maybe three decades. So, the economic policies of this administration have led us to a level of prosperity that we cannot -- we would not have imagined two years ago. So, the truth of the matter is, the president had said some things that I totally disagree with on a racial perspective, but he's also done some things from a policy perspective that is undeniably in the best interest of this country long term, and I think a good economy makes a lot of things possible."

So, look, what is a constitutional crisis? The lowest unemployment rate between Hispanics and African-Americans ever recorded? A stock market that continues to go up? A president who's defending our borders? Cutting taxes for Americans and businesses across the country? What is the constitutional crisis? Putting America first? The constitutional crisis is that we're not globalists anymore. That we're unapologetic to be Americans. That this president has said we're not here to be the policeman of the rest of the world, that we're going to protect our own people first. If that's a constitutional crisis that Friedman thinks is in front of us, then he's absolutely right. This president is here to protect Americans, sometimes maybe he should think about more often."

You say let Trump be Trump, right? It definitely rankles a lot of people. It's a process, you know, what happened with Rex Tillerson, and now, perhaps, Scott Pruitt who appears to be and a somewhat tenuous position. People are uncomfortable.

Does Tom Friedman disagree with relocating the embassy in Israel? Is that the constitutional crisis that he's opposed to? You know, these guys love the hyperbole of attacking this president. The bottom line is this, this president, like every president, has the right to have the cabinet that he wants surrounding him, so that they can make decisions. And this president, more than any other, loves to have different individuals give them their opinion, and then he makes the final decision. Now, maybe it's not the decision that 30 years of government in Washington, D.C. dogma has been entitled to. But I can tell you this, we know, unequivocally, if Hillary Clinton would have been elected, we would not have a potentially denuclearized North Korea, we wouldn't have a leader that has cut taxes for the American people, unemployment rates for African-Americans and Hispanics would not be at historic lows.

He's going to release the burden on American individuals and corporate America from an overzealous government bureaucracy, and the EPA has been one of the worst proprieties of that problem. And, look, you know what California loves? They love to have it both ways. They love to attack the president, but when there's a natural disaster, when there's a tragedy, when something terrible happens, they call the federal government and they asks for their help and support. And every cycle time, this president has responded because it's the right thing to do. But, look, you know, this is a political football that the attorney general wants to use.

There's, you know, issues of how Roseanne's grandson is dressing at school. That he's dressing, kind of, like a little girl instead of a little boy. And all sort of things that people talk about that affect American families in this show. So, I think he's selling it a little-bit short in terms of what's included in it. But, you know, I think it liberates people to a certain extent to say, you know, that's like the debate we have at my house or your house, you know. What do you think the impact is when people go to the polls in the midterms? I mean, do you think that this translates that far out?"

      "utterance": "Look, I think it's a little far to say this is going to definitely translate into vote. I think that this is a cultural outlet that they've been 50 shows that are anti-Trump. The reason this got 25 million viewers is because there are 50 million closet conservatives. There are a lot of people say, hey, I want to have a cultural connection to what I believe in, and that's incredibly important. And I also think people are sick and tired of being demeaned for their political views, so they like to see someone who really stands up for what she believes, and whose beliefs are close to theirs. And I think that is very good for democracy, very good for environment, regardless of whether you're a Democrat or Republican. This is better and this lets people express their real views. That's what the first amendment is about."

His words spoken on the eve of his assassination are the quote of the night. He said, like anybody, I like to live a long life. Longevity has its place. But I'm not concerned about that now. I just want to do God's will. And he's allowed me to go up to mountain and I looked over and I've seen the Promised Land. I may not get there with you, but I want you to know, tonight, that, we, as a people, we'll get to the Promised Land, words of Martin Luther King Jr. That is our story for tonight. We'll see you right back here tomorrow night, thought, at 7 o'clock. Hope you'll join us. Tucker Carlson is up next."
