And, today, his comments are getting a lot of attention. Welcome, everyone.

What's left of the Champlain Towers South, that brown building that you can see there. On the other side of it, that's where the pile of rubble, all pancaked concrete, is. And that's, of course, where the hunt for survivors continues. But no survivors have been found in the rubble since early last Thursday morning, just shortly after the building partially collapsed. The search- and-rescue operation is intense. It is massive. All eight state of Florida urban search-and-rescue teams are here in Surfside. And this is an around-the-clock operation. One more body was recovered today, on top of the for more body found Sunday, bringing the confirmed death toll to 10, nine of them identified, with 151 people still unaccounted for. This remains a search-and-rescue situation. It's still not a -- quote -- \"recovery situation.\" But everyone is well aware that the window of survivability is shrinking. Over the weekend, crews on the scene dug a 40-foot trench in the pancaked pile, hoping to find some voids and gaps where somebody might be able to breathe and survive, but the results so far not as hoped. Voids have been found, but no survivors have been discovered. As has been the case every day, the county mayor, the governor and congresswoman who represents Surfside addressed the media and the public, updating the numbers and updating everything being done to aid families and find survivors.",

Senator Lieberman, what's really interesting is, obviously, we're exchanging fire in Syria with these militia.

So I'm troubled, of course. I was against the Iran nuclear agreement that President Obama negotiated. As chairman of United Against Nuclear Iran, I'm very concerned about the Biden administration going back into negotiations. The Iranians want to remove economic sanctions that bipartisan majorities in Congress have put on them for a years, because they're hurting them.

I think they have been developing it even during the agreement before President Trump thankfully pulled us out of it. But they have not abandoned their desire for a nuclear weapon. It's got to be never, not -- I appreciate what you said about his watch. Incidentally, Charles, I think one of the important things about this meeting with President Rivlin of Israel and meetings that have occurred, Secretary Blinken and the foreign minister of Israel, conversations between the new prime minister, Bennett, and President Biden, is that America is talking to the Israelis.

At a cost of $60,000 a year, the city of San Francisco provides a tent in one of its safe sleeping villages, on top of that, bathroom and shower facilities, security and food. Few political leaders have suggested the city shouldn't be doing something about its homelessness crisis, but plenty have questioned that cost, including Supervisor Hillary Ronen, who told a Budget and Finance Appropriations Committee meeting last week -- quote -- \"It is a big deal to have showers and bathrooms. And I don't dispute that, but the cost just doesn't make any sense.\" That cost about $5,000, per month per tent ,is almost double the median cost of renting a one bedroom apartment in San Francisco, an apartment that would presumably come with its own bathroom. And according to the real estate Web site Zillow, city officials could even rent a high-end apartment in a luxury building with 24-hour security, pool, Jacuzzi, sauna, and gym for the less -- for less than the cost of one tent in the safe sleeping encampment. It's a similar story here in L.A., as we reported a few weeks ago. Each of these tents and the 12-by-12 taped square each sits in cost more than a one-bedroom apartment. And perhaps, Charles, the biggest concern for taxpayers in L.A. and San Francisco is the ongoing cost. San Francisco, for instance, plans to spend more than $1 billion -- billion with a B -- on the homelessness crisis in just the next two years -- Charles.",

And that's, of course, where the hunt for survivors continues. But no survivors have been found in the rubble since early last Thursday morning, just shortly after the building partially collapsed. The search- and-rescue operation is intense. It is massive. All eight state of Florida urban search-and-rescue teams are here in Surfside. And this is an around-the-clock operation. One more body was recovered today, on top of the for more body found Sunday, bringing the confirmed death toll to 10, nine of them identified, with 151 people still unaccounted for. This remains a search-and-rescue situation. It's still not a -- quote -- \"recovery situation.\" But everyone is well aware that the window of survivability is shrinking. Over the weekend, crews on the scene dug a 40-foot trench in the pancaked pile, hoping to find some voids and gaps where somebody might be able to breathe and survive, but the results so far not as hoped. Voids have been found, but no survivors have been discovered. As has been the case every day, the county mayor, the governor and congresswoman who represents Surfside addressed the media and the public, updating the numbers and updating everything being done to aid families and find survivors."

People about -- how they feel about how he's handling violent crime, that's on the rise, too. And so he's got a lot of issues that he's got to address.

With reconciliation, the difficulty here is that you're asking senators like Senator Manchin or Senator Sinema to agree to support something that they haven't necessarily seen what's exactly going to be in it yet. I'm not sure I get where they're coming from where they're saying that's not really responsible legislating to do that, not -- I'm not putting words in their mouth, but it's a difficult balance that you have to -- we knew this is the way this was going to go with that 50/50 Senate.

Nancy Pelosi just recently said that she is not going to pass this bipartisan bill if it's not going to be accompanied with a Democrat-only bill, which we know is not going to happen with Senator Mitch McConnell at the helm of the party. So, with this being the case, one must ask, what is it that Joe Biden is really attending? Is he going to allow the progressives in his party and the activists to push him in whatever direction that they want, as they said they would before he was elected? Or is he going to stand up and be a leader and pass an infrastructure bill that's meant for infrastructure? That's usually what an infrastructure bill is all about, vs. climate change and all these other initiatives Democrats want to push? And that's a tough question for Joe Biden at this particular time."

Violent crime is a really big issue; 69 percent of Americans say that they feel, they personally feel that violent crime is increasing. When you have Americans who are afraid about their personal and physical safety, that's a real issue. And the president needs to address it. And he can't pass all of this off on Republicans and gun control, because this isn't just about violent crime when it comes to guns. Violent crime on all measures in urban centers is increasing, whether it's from assault, other issues that are not related to guns. And so I think he's missing the boat here. People are very concerned. And I think Republicans have a real opportunity to address this with their own policies."

Our Jennifer Griffin reporting militias have just fired rockets at U.S. forces in Syria. And it's all as the White House continues to try and revive the Iranian nuclear deal. Where's all of this going? Let me bring in former Democratic V.P. nominee Joe Lieberman to weigh in. Senator Lieberman, what's really interesting is, obviously, we're exchanging fire in Syria with these militia. But even before this, we know that Iran is the sponsor of terrorism throughout the region, that they're racing against the clock for a nuclear weapon, and that they have been emboldened, not only by this new president that they have elected, but I think also by the results of our election.

So I'm troubled, of course. I was against the Iran nuclear agreement that President Obama negotiated. As chairman of United Against Nuclear Iran, I'm very concerned about the Biden administration going back into negotiations. The Iranians want to remove economic sanctions that bipartisan majorities in Congress have put on them for a years, because they're hurting them. But as soon as they get a few sanctions off that allow their economy to come back, they're going to walk away from the table, because the one thing they don't want to do is give up their nuclear weapons program."

But, really, the statement that I'd like to hear is, Iran will never get a nuclear weapon, because they're a dangerous anti-American country. And part of the problem with the Iran nuclear agreement of 2015 was that it kind of put the brakes on their nuclear weapons program for maybe 10 years, maybe a little longer. I think they have been developing it even during the agreement before President Trump thankfully pulled us out of it. But they have not abandoned their desire for a nuclear weapon. It's got to be never, not -- I appreciate what you said about his watch. Incidentally, Charles, I think one of the important things about this meeting with President Rivlin of Israel and meetings that have occurred, Secretary Blinken and the foreign minister of Israel, conversations between the new prime minister, Bennett, and President Biden, is that America is talking to the Israelis.

This man is a real extremist. He presided over the trial, fake trials and execution of thousands of people who rose up against the extremist government of Iran in the late 80s. I happen to know that he supported the publication and a multipart documentary that was essentially the notorious anti-Semitic Elders of Zion story again. He's a real step back by the Iranian government. And it shows where the mind and heart of the one man who really counts in Iran, the supreme leader, Khamenei, is.

Few political leaders have suggested the city shouldn't be doing something about its homelessness crisis, but plenty have questioned that cost, including Supervisor Hillary Ronen, who told a Budget and Finance Appropriations Committee meeting last week -- quote -- \"It is a big deal to have showers and bathrooms. And I don't dispute that, but the cost just doesn't make any sense.\" That cost about $5,000, per month per tent ,is almost double the median cost of renting a one bedroom apartment in San Francisco, an apartment that would presumably come with its own bathroom. And according to the real estate Web site Zillow, city officials could even rent a high-end apartment in a luxury building with 24-hour security, pool, Jacuzzi, sauna, and gym for the less -- for less than the cost of one tent in the safe sleeping encampment. It's a similar story here in L.A., as we reported a few weeks ago. Each of these tents and the 12-by-12 taped square each sits in cost more than a one-bedroom apartment.

      "speaker": "JOE CARDINALE, FORMER NYPD LIEUTENANT",
      "utterance": "He still doesn't get it. We have gone from a proactive police department to a reactive police department to a cautionary reactive police department. That's where we have we have come -- the point we have come to. I mean, I don't know what planet Bill de Blasio lives on, but if he was reading the papers, if he was doing what he was supposed to be doing, this could have been resolved way -- a long time ago, but yet they choose to defund the police and handcuff the police. Look, the bottom line is, Charles, we need to get street crime back out there. You need to implement stop and frisk again, and these guns will come off the street. You just can't address something after it happens. You have to get proactive with these approaches, the way they did under the Giuliani administration. I mean, look what we took Times Square from."

      "utterance": "So, what do you make of it? You say you don't know what planet de Blasio lives on. He's not the only one who lives there. Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez saying that all this talk about crime spikes, it's called hysteria. What do you make of that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARDINALE",
      "utterance": "She is hysteria. She creates the hysteria. I mean, tell her to get up and go into her own backyard and see what's happening up in the Bronx, all right, instead of hiding in the walls of Congress, and just dropping her opinion on everybody as each day goes on. She has to wake up and realize that it's the Democratic-run cities that have these problems, and she has to step up to the plate and do something. But, no, it doesn't fit the agenda, the agenda of the people that are out there. And this is the problem we have right now. It's getting to what he says. It's -- de Blasio says it's summertime. And of course it's summertime, but people do want to feel safe when they come there."

      "speaker": "PAYNE",
      "utterance": "Right."

      "speaker": "CARDINALE",

      "speaker": "PAYNE",
      "utterance": "Sure."

In the meantime, though, Neil will be back tomorrow, folks. Getting a quick check of Wall Street today, we had a couple of records for you, the Nasdaq and the S&P closing at all time highs.
