      "sentences": "Welcome to WATTERS' WORLD. I'm Jesse Watters. It doesn't add up. That's the subject of tonight's Watters' Words. To quote Hillary Clinton, \"What happened?\" I'm supposed to believe Joe Biden is going to be President? President of the United States, Joe Biden? There's something that just doesn't feel right about this. You feel it, too.  Joe Biden didn't earn it. He didn't really even campaign. He thought he was going to lose. You could see it. He ran a losing campaign.  So 10 days after the election, how is he ahead? Let's try to put this all together.  Trump was cruising to re-election. He beat Mueller. He beat impeachment. He unleashed the hottest economy on the planet. His numbers were sky high, until the China virus hit. He had to shut down the economy. Then the riots exploded. Biden slept through the whole summer. But the Democrats had a plan, hide Biden raise money and scare Americans into voting by mail.  In the fall, Trump got sick, recovered, then smoked Joe at the second debate. The Hunter scandal broke. It got censored, but Trump was on the march. The economy shot back up and Biden was making a lot of mistakes. He was spewing gibberish to tiny little rallies.' On Election Night, Trump trounced Joe in Florida and was ahead in nearly every battleground, then the states stopped counting. And for the next four days, Trump lost his lead in slow motion. Boatloads of mail ballots pushed Biden ahead.  If you called the race on Election Night for Biden, I am fine with that.   But four days later, his lead gets flipped in notoriously dirty Democrat precincts like Philly and Detroit, I'm sorry, but that's hard to swallow. Especially when Republican poll watchers are being denied meaningful access to count rooms. If everything is on the up and up, why can't we see it? And WATTERS' WORLD is gong to address all the fraud allegations in the next block. So be patient. I just have a gut feeling something went down. It's like a feeling a parent gets when something happens to their child when they aren't there. You just know it.   Seventy-eight-year-old Joe Biden, the guy with no base, no slogan, no crowds, no enthusiasm, no ground game, no charisma, no vision, and no ideas got more votes than Donald Trump? Not only that, he got more votes than Barack Obama and the first female nominee Hillary Clinton? And Trump does five points better with blacks and seven points better with Hispanics and he still loses. But the rest of the Republican Party had a great night? Something isn't adding up here. Maybe Biden won on the airwaves, maybe Big Tech and Big Media and his donors dragged Joe cross the finish line. Maybe COVID and the economic shock rattled Americans to kick Trump out. Maybe people wanted a break from the Trump Show.  But my instincts tell me something was fishy. Now, I could be wrong, and maybe I misjudged the mood of America. I'm not in the field anymore, so it's possible.   But the sheer volume of mail ballots bothers me. It does. Scaring voters away from the polls to vote by mail: that's how it all started. Partisan government bureaucrats ordering ballots from printing companies based off dusty old voter rolls was a bad idea.  Ballot harvesting, bad idea. Democrat Judges changing rules, extending deadlines and saying signatures don't have to match, ludicrous.  And ballots coming in without postage is insane.  There's just too much temptation to fool around with mail ballots in the first place. And then when you add tens of millions more ballots into that system, what do you expect? The massive volume of mail ballots was too big. There's too many hands on them besides the voter.  Most of those hands are in big blue counties, too. They spied, they smeared, they sued, censored and impeached him, and so what makes you think they wouldn't cheat him?   The Secretary of State and Attorney General in Pennsylvania for instance, in charge of executing elections, they are guests on Rachel Maddow's Show and say Trump isn't a legitimate President. The Secretary of State in Arizona in charge of elections called Trump a Nazi, and we're supposed to be comfortable with their vote counts? They think Trump is evil and that means they'll take him out by any means necessary. Republicans need to get a handle don these mail ballots going forward.  Democrats think they struck gold. They'll do mass mail election every time.  Republicans don't trust this process. Democrat machines counting for days after Election Day with no transparency, no chain of custody. Absolutely not. We need to know who is President on Election Night. This can never happen again. All Americans need to have confidence in our elections.   This is the first time the country had a mass mail election, and it needs to be sorted out. The Trump campaign has every right to investigate fraud, irregularities, abnormalities, computer and machine glitches, the sworn affidavits, all of it. We're big boys, we can take a loss. But we need to know if it was fair and square. When it's over this winter, no matter what happens, I want a full audit of the election in all 50 states.  Appoint a commission. Take a year. Take two. Let the lawyers go wild.  Democracy is too valuable to take the word of some creepy Commissioner who got his job from a patronage mill in a Democrat run city with a cigarette dangling from his mouth and a Biden-Harris sticker on his flabby chest. Oh, don't come too close to the count room, he tells you. Stand back. Nothing to see here.   I remember when Democrats cared about the integrity of elections.",

I'm not going to lie, but it's a fight worth fighting for this election and beyond. Now, he needed to win the Georgia recount, win lawsuits to trigger in Arizona recount and get help in Pennsylvania from the Supreme Court. That's the combo.

So that's the heart of the Democratic Party's election manual and we're watching it play out in Atlanta. And you'll notice, they are always in big cities: in Atlanta, in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, in Detroit, in Milwaukee, all of these things are coming about exactly the same. In Nevada, the whole state was involved because the governor and the Democratic legislature passed a series of rules. I've been told by attorney  -- former Attorney General Adam Laxalt, that there are 600,000 ballots in Nevada that no Republican has ever seen. That's the -- This has to be -- people shouldn't give up until every ballot has been looked at by two human beings, one Republican, the other Democrat, and we find out how many holes there are in the system. And frankly, in five of the six states that are contested, you have Republican legislators and they will spend early next year changing the election laws for the future and eliminating this stuff. But it also proves if I might, why the Georgia Senate runoffs are important because if we get Senator Perdue and Senator Loeffler re-elected and McConnell is in charge of the Senate, we're going to be able to continue to reform things. If they win with their two radical candidates and Schumer is in charge, they'll try to pass a National Bill to make the whole country behave in the crazy way that these cities have behaved.",

There's always been a little election fraud in every election, but because it's mostly people voting in person, you just don't have access and opportunity the way you have in a COVID election. And what the Democrats I predict will do is make every national election a COVID election and say, hey, this works great for us this time. Let's do it again, in 2024 and let's pump these states with so many ballots, you're not going to be able to have a chain of custody. And loosen up these rules, because you know, we want everyone to vote, we want to make it so easy. But you're also making it easy to cheat and they need to get their hands on this or else this is going to doom the Republican Party because as you said, a lot of this stuff is happening in these deep blue precincts where people, there's no transparency, and there's so many more votes coming in, as opposed to those little smaller red counties where there's not the sheer volume of ballots.",

His legal team is moving full steam ahead with legal challenges in five states. And here's where they stand: Georgia doing a recount. A team will count all ballots by hand, conduct an audit and re-canvass of the presidential race. The deadline is November 20th. In Pennsylvania, five legal challenges have been filed alleging thousands of ballots that should have been rejected under state law for missing information were counted anyway. In two victories there, the Supreme Court ruled ballots received after Election Day be segregated. And just Thursday, a state judge ruled the Secretary of State lacked authority to change deadline two days before the election. So ballots previously set aside will not be counted. And in Michigan's Wayne County, a Federal case was filed by the campaign to block statewide election certification accompanied with several sworn affidavits alleging fraud, just to name a few; ballots being fed multiple times into scanners, ballots counted that couldn't be connected to a voter record, poll workers adding marks to ballots where there were no marks for a candidate. And ballots being counted that had no signature. \"Tucker Carlson Tonight\" documented proven cases of dead people voting.  Affidavits that allege that suspicious bags of ballots appeared out of nowhere, and several sworn affidavits for many different states asserted poll watchers were denied meaningful access to count rooms. In Arizona, the counting continues. The Trump team also filed a lawsuit alleging poll workers wrongfully rejected certain ballots, costing the President thousands of votes. The Arizona Republican Party filed a lawsuit to enforce a hand count by precinct, not voting center alleging it would provide a more precise sampling of votes. So the question now is, with these legitimate legal challenges, is there a path to victory for President Trump? Joining me now, Fox News contributor Andy McCarthy and Tom Fitton, President of Judicial Watch. All right, Tom, what is the most disturbing fraud allegation that you've seen so far?

So those ballots are our suspect. You had the delay in counting, which is suspect. You have the counting that changes results from the Election Day that is suspect, and if I'm in Pennsylvania, and I'm a court, I would be worried about blessing a process that is so rife with apparent opportunities for fraud. And remember, in the end, it's the state legislature of Pennsylvania under the Constitution that decides whether to bless this mess or not. And then subsequently, it's Congress that decides whether to take up Electoral College votes and bless them despite the evidence of a blown election in Pennsylvania, in terms of the processes caused by having, as you pointed out, all these mail ballots coming in and flooding the system in a way that they knew was going to break it.",

To quote Hillary Clinton, \"What happened?\" I'm supposed to believe Joe Biden is going to be President? President of the United States, Joe Biden? There's something that just doesn't feel right about this. You feel it, too. Joe Biden didn't earn it. He didn't really even campaign. He thought he was going to lose. You could see it. He ran a losing campaign. So 10 days after the election, how is he ahead? Let's try to put this all together. Trump was cruising to re-election. He beat Mueller. He beat impeachment. He unleashed the hottest economy on the planet. His numbers were sky high, until the China virus hit. He had to shut down the economy. Then the riots exploded. Biden slept through the whole summer. But the Democrats had a plan, hide Biden raise money and scare Americans into voting by mail. In the fall, Trump got sick, recovered, then smoked Joe at the second debate. The Hunter scandal broke. It got censored, but Trump was on the march. The economy shot back up and Biden was making a lot of mistakes. He was spewing gibberish to tiny little rallies.' On Election Night, Trump trounced Joe in Florida and was ahead in nearly every battleground, then the states stopped counting. And for the next four days, Trump lost his lead in slow motion. Boatloads of mail ballots pushed Biden ahead. If you called the race on Election Night for Biden, I am fine with that. But four days later, his lead gets flipped in notoriously dirty Democrat precincts like Philly and Detroit, I'm sorry, but that's hard to swallow. Especially when Republican poll watchers are being denied meaningful access to count rooms. If everything is on the up and up, why can't we see it? And WATTERS' WORLD is gong to address all the fraud allegations in the next block. So be patient. I just have a gut feeling something went down. It's like a feeling a parent gets when something happens to their child when they aren't there. You just know it. Seventy-eight-year-old Joe Biden, the guy with no base, no slogan, no crowds, no enthusiasm, no ground game, no charisma, no vision, and no ideas got more votes than Donald Trump? Not only that, he got more votes than Barack Obama and the first female nominee Hillary Clinton? And Trump does five points better with blacks and seven points better with Hispanics and he still loses. But the rest of the Republican Party had a great night? Something isn't adding up here. Maybe Biden won on the airwaves, maybe Big Tech and Big Media and his donors dragged Joe cross the finish line. Maybe COVID and the economic shock rattled Americans to kick Trump out. Maybe people wanted a break from the Trump Show. But my instincts tell me something was fishy. Now, I could be wrong, and maybe I misjudged the mood of America. I'm not in the field anymore, so it's possible. But the sheer volume of mail ballots bothers me. It does."

Democrat Judges changing rules, extending deadlines and saying signatures don't have to match, ludicrous. And ballots coming in without postage is insane. There's just too much temptation to fool around with mail ballots in the first place. And then when you add tens of millions more ballots into that system, what do you expect? The massive volume of mail ballots was too big. There's too many hands on them besides the voter. Most of those hands are in big blue counties, too. They spied, they smeared, they sued, censored and impeached him, and so what makes you think they wouldn't cheat him? The Secretary of State and Attorney General in Pennsylvania for instance, in charge of executing elections, they are guests on Rachel Maddow's Show and say Trump isn't a legitimate President. The Secretary of State in Arizona in charge of elections called Trump a Nazi, and we're supposed to be comfortable with their vote counts? They think Trump is evil and that means they'll take him out by any means necessary. Republicans need to get a handle don these mail ballots going forward. Democrats think they struck gold. They'll do mass mail election every time. Republicans don't trust this process. Democrat machines counting for days after Election Day with no transparency, no chain of custody. Absolutely not. We need to know who is President on Election Night. This can never happen again. All Americans need to have confidence in our elections. This is the first time the country had a mass mail election, and it needs to be sorted out. The Trump campaign has every right to investigate fraud, irregularities, abnormalities, computer and machine glitches, the sworn affidavits, all of it. We're big boys, we can take a loss. But we need to know if it was fair and square. When it's over this winter, no matter what happens, I want a full audit of the election in all 50 states. Appoint a commission. Take a year. Take two. Let the lawyers go wild. Democracy is too valuable to take the word of some creepy Commissioner who got his job from a patronage mill in a Democrat run city with a cigarette dangling from his mouth and a Biden-Harris sticker on his flabby chest. Oh, don't come too close to the count room, he tells you. Stand back. Nothing to see here. I remember when Democrats cared about the integrity of elections."

Nancy, you know, the Speaker sent a signal when they introduced H.R. 1 at the very beginning of 2019, because H.R. 1 was an outline of how to steal an election. I did several podcasts about it. And if you look, step by step, even though they haven't been able to pass it, different places have done things. I just learned today, for example that the Republican Secretary of State in Georgia signed a Consent Decree that does not allow us to check and verify absentee ballots. Now, how insane is that?"

I've been told by attorney -- former Attorney General Adam Laxalt, that there are 600,000 ballots in Nevada that no Republican has ever seen. That's the -- This has to be -- people shouldn't give up until every ballot has been looked at by two human beings, one Republican, the other Democrat, and we find out how many holes there are in the system. And frankly, in five of the six states that are contested, you have Republican legislators and they will spend early next year changing the election laws for the future and eliminating this stuff. But it also proves if I might, why the Georgia Senate runoffs are important because if we get Senator Perdue and Senator Loeffler re-elected and McConnell is in charge of the Senate, we're going to be able to continue to reform things. If they win with their two radical candidates and Schumer is in charge, they'll try to pass a National Bill to make the whole country behave in the crazy way that these cities have behaved."

It's just too much opportunity for mischief. There's always been a little election fraud in every election, but because it's mostly people voting in person, you just don't have access and opportunity the way you have in a COVID election. And what the Democrats I predict will do is make every national election a COVID election and say, hey, this works great for us this time. Let's do it again, in 2024 and let's pump these states with so many ballots, you're not going to be able to have a chain of custody. And loosen up these rules, because you know, we want everyone to vote, we want to make it so easy. But you're also making it easy to cheat and they need to get their hands on this or else this is going to doom the Republican Party because as you said, a lot of this stuff is happening in these deep blue precincts where people, there's no transparency, and there's so many more votes coming in, as opposed to those little smaller red counties where there's not the sheer volume of ballots."

But we're seeing them inch closer and closer to what we've been talking about for last four years. This is not your mother and your father's Democratic Party.

And that power was taken from them because of what, Jesse, not because of white supremacy, not because of racism, not because of, you know, this tide of misogyny that came across the country. It is because of their very own failures. Because of the failures of Barack Obama when America believed in his vision of unity. Fool America once, shame on you. You're not going to fool us twice.

      "utterance": "Georgia doing a recount. A team will count all ballots by hand, conduct an audit and re-canvass of the presidential race. The deadline is November 20th. In Pennsylvania, five legal challenges have been filed alleging thousands of ballots that should have been rejected under state law for missing information were counted anyway. In two victories there, the Supreme Court ruled ballots received after Election Day be segregated. And just Thursday, a state judge ruled the Secretary of State lacked authority to change deadline two days before the election. So ballots previously set aside will not be counted. And in Michigan's Wayne County, a Federal case was filed by the campaign to block statewide election certification accompanied with several sworn affidavits alleging fraud, just to name a few; ballots being fed multiple times into scanners, ballots counted that couldn't be connected to a voter record, poll workers adding marks to ballots where there were no marks for a candidate. And ballots being counted that had no signature. \"Tucker Carlson Tonight\" documented proven cases of dead people voting. Affidavits that allege that suspicious bags of ballots appeared out of nowhere, and several sworn affidavits for many different states asserted poll watchers were denied meaningful access to count rooms. In Arizona, the counting continues. The Trump team also filed a lawsuit alleging poll workers wrongfully rejected certain ballots, costing the President thousands of votes. The Arizona Republican Party filed a lawsuit to enforce a hand count by precinct, not voting center alleging it would provide a more precise sampling of votes. So the question now is, with these legitimate legal challenges, is there a path to victory for President Trump? Joining me now, Fox News contributor Andy McCarthy and Tom Fitton, President of Judicial Watch. All right, Tom, what is the most disturbing fraud allegation that you've seen so far? And what kind of impact do you think that's going to have?"

So those ballots are our suspect. You had the delay in counting, which is suspect. You have the counting that changes results from the Election Day that is suspect, and if I'm in Pennsylvania, and I'm a court, I would be worried about blessing a process that is so rife with apparent opportunities for fraud. And remember, in the end, it's the state legislature of Pennsylvania under the Constitution that decides whether to bless this mess or not. And then subsequently, it's Congress that decides whether to take up Electoral College votes and bless them despite the evidence of a blown election in Pennsylvania, in terms of the processes caused by having, as you pointed out, all these mail ballots coming in and flooding the system in a way that they knew was going to break it."

So I think, you know, as Tom was mentioning, under a cloud, probably about 650,000 to 680,000, something like that votes in Pennsylvania. There's 1.2 million in Michigan, there's no way the courts are going to throw out the hundreds of thousands of votes in any one county, because of suspect fraud. What they may do is allow more scrutiny of the pile of votes that's suspect, and if you can knock out individual particularized ballots because of their irregularities, you'll be able to do that. But the thing is, they are so far behind in Pennsylvania and Michigan that I think it's too high a mountain to climb."

They need to look at the machines. They need to see if processes were followed here. This is the first election this country has ever had with like more people voting by mail than people showing up on Election Day.

Joining me now, Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz and Ned Ryun, CEO of American Majority. All right Ned, traditionally, the Republican Party consists of three pillars.

I'm the only Republican in Congress that doesn't take any Federal PAC money because I find that entire process to be disgusting. Joe Biden has indicated that he wants to reach out to Republicans, but he is reaching in all the wrong places. It seems he wants to import the foreign policy of Dick Cheney and the trade policy of Paul Ryan. That's what President Trump got us away from. We're no longer a movement that wants to invade every cave in wherever- istan while we impoverish our people with bad trade deals and invite every illegal immigrant across our borders illegally. The populism that President Trump has installed in the Republican Party germinates from the enthusiasm of our voters and if we are faithful to our voters, not the K Street PACs, then I think we can maintain the America First brand for political generations to come."

Big Tech as you say, Twitter, Facebook, they were slanted. They warped the news. The pollsters were not reflecting but massaging, public opinion. No need to get into the media controversies there. So against all of those odds and then he was still, I think in the last polls, still was going to overcome that in the polls that were reliable. And then all of a sudden, you know, we saw these things we couldn't explain. Much more votes than last time. He was not an anchor, he was a buoy on downstate balloting that doesn't really happen when a President loses, so there was a lot of suspicion there. It's kind of like he is a Jacksonian figure. He is a national populist. Andrew Jackson, they did the same thing. They being the establishment in 1824, in the so-called crooked bargain, corrupt bargain. And guess what? He came back four years later in say, a heroic figure that -- and Donald Trump was always going to be four years younger than Joe Biden."

      "utterance": "That's true. You know, I didn't remember the crooked bargain. It's one of the President's favorite adjectives. And he's been compared to Andrew Jackson. It does seem like throughout history, you get this cycle of populism, and then you know, the redistribution of wealth and then the trust busting and then the booms and the bust. It just seems like we're at a crossroads now and I think you nailed it. I think you did. Victor, thank you very much. I appreciate it."

      "utterance": "Well, I wish there was some kind of definitive, finalized feeling that we could all have and we can only get to that point, though, once all the votes are counted and codified, and we do it fairly. So hopefully, you know, we're down that road and the opposition isn't making their irrational arguments that we shouldn't be trying to honestly count every vote. Hopefully, we can get to that point where we can really intelligently talk about how we feel about the election."

      "speaker": "PALIN",
      "utterance": "Yes, like they always do. Yes, right. You know, of course, there is -- there is fraud. And people are going to find out through the studies of the algorithms, everything else that was plugged into some of these voting programs. People are going to realize that this hasn't been a fair election. And I think all of us know personally, you know, cases of fraud or illegal voting. When I was governor of the state, I remember that Obama's right-hand man, his Chief of Staff, Pete Rouse, claimed to be an Alaskan voter. He hadn't been to Alaska in a couple of decades, except once for a funeral, yet bragged about ha-ha, I am getting to vote in Alaska. And I tried to make a big darn deal about it. But nobody really took me up on it because they said it's just one vote. And I said precisely, it is one vote. But Lieutenant Governor's Offices and Secretaries of State across our nation, they are in charge of elections. They need to make sure there is great accountability in their division of elections so that we can have -- so we can have trust in those in authority calling the shots for us."

      "utterance": "Absolutely. You can't have only Democrats trusting the election when they win and then half the country scratching their head. You brought up Barack Obama. Well, he has a memoir out. Only Volume 1. There is going to be two. He has got a lot to say. He took a shot at you, he says, \"Through Palin, it seemed as if the dark spirits that had long been lurking on the edges of the modern Republican Party, xenophobia, anti-intellectualism, paranoid conspiracy theories and antipathy toward black and brown folks -- were finding their way to center stage.\" Wow, it's kind of nasty."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PALIN",
      "utterance": "Right. Nasty, pretty dark words there. In fact, he uses the word even dark as like, ooh, really? Am I that spooky? Obama, boo. Listen, Obama knows that in 2008, it was our campaign, our movement that began this voice of the people being heard. And since then, even more activism within that movement, whether you call it the Tea Party, or the deplorables, or the chumps, or whatever they want to call us. There has been great activism. And remember, in 2008, too, I know Obama didn't like this. I dubbed the hardworking patriotic, conscientious fed up moms across America. I dubbed them our Mama Grizzlies. And I don't think that the left can admit yet even though the numbers show that those Mama Grizzlies, they roared into more activism. They roared into office. And now we have more diversity within the G.O.P. than we've ever had. We've had more diversity in participation in the G.O.P. this last election than we have since 1960."
