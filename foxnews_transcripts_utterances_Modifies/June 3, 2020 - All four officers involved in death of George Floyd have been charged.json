He has succeeded in now taking three more Minneapolis police officers, criminally charging them in the death of George Floyd.  So, they join Derek Chauvin in that regard. Furthermore, he is requesting bail be set at $1 million for each officer. Again, when he gets to that podium, we will take you to that podium.  Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto, and this is YOUR WORLD.  Fast and furious developments in this world and the entire Floyd case. We begin with the latest from Minneapolis and how all of this is being taken in by crowds.  Garrett Tenney is there -- Garrett.",

But what we know right now, based on a tweet from Senator Amy Klobuchar, is that Derek Chauvin, he has now been charged with second-degree murder, and that the three officers involved, we know, based on court files -- court documents that have been filed, is that they have been charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder.   Now, those charges, in Minnesota, they face a maximum sentence of 50 years in prison and a fine of up to $20,000 if they are convicted on both counts. In the criminal complaint, it lays out a lot of what we already knew, that George Floyd was held on the ground for nearly nine minutes. Derek Chauvin had his knee on his neck. Alexander Kueng, one of the other former officers, was pressing down on his back. Thomas Lane was holding his legs. And former Officer Tou Thao watched and kept a growing crowd at bay. As you mentioned, bail set at a million dollars. And these two counts that they have been charged with, this is much of what the protests over the last week have been, is protesters have been calling for the three other officers involved to be charged, as well as Derek Chauvin.   And it looks like Attorney General Ellison is going to be coming up to the podium in just a moment. But it is worth noting that the family of George Floyd, as well as demonstrators, have been demanding first-degree murder charges, though, today, second-degree murder. Here's the attorney general.",

      "speaker": "KEITH ELLISON, MINNESOTA ATTORNEY GENERAL",
      "sentences": "First of all, thank you, ladies and gentlemen of the press. Myself and my friend Mike Freeman want to share some information with you.  I want to begin with a reminder. And that is that we're here today because George Floyd is not here. He should be here. He should be alive, but he's not.  About nine days ago, the world watched Floyd utter his very last words, \"I can't breathe,\" as he pled for his life. The world heard Floyd call out for his momma and cried out, \"Don't kill me.\" Just two days ago, when I became the lead prosecutor in the murder of Mr. Floyd, I asked for time to thoroughly review all the evidence in the case. And we looked at the case, the evidence that is available, and the investigation is ongoing at this time.  I also said that I know it's asking a lot of people to give us time, particularly people who have suffered for decades and centuries of injustice, to be patient.   And yet we did get that time. And together, a very strong, experienced team, which included county attorney Mike Freeman, his team and my team, we reviewed the evidence, together with the BCA, and we have something to announce today. Before I announce it, I want to say, thank you for the patience of the people who -- they have shown me and our entire team in pursuit of justice. And I'm here to make these announcements right now. First, today, I filed an amended complaint that charges former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin with murder in the second degree for the death of George Floyd. I believe the evidence available to us now supports the stronger charge of second-degree murder. We have consulted with each other, and we agree.  Second, today, arrest warrants were issued for former Minneapolis police officers J.A. Kueng, Thomas Lane, and Tou Thao.  Finally, I'd like to announce that, today, Hennepin County attorney Michael Freeman and I have filed a complaint that charges police officer Kueng, Lane, and Thao with aiding and abetting murder in the second degree, A felony offense. I strongly believe that these developments are in the interest of justice for Mr. Floyd, his family, our community and our state.   I'm the lead prosecutor in this case, I will be speaking and addressing the public. And this is -- but this is absolutely a team effort. We're working together on this case with only one goal, justice for George Floyd. I want to thank first Mr. Hennepin County attorney Mike Freeman, who has been a true partner in this matter at every step of the way. His experience and insight have been invaluable and will continue to be counted on by the team.  I also want to thank county attorney Freeman's professional staff, who have cooperated and work together with my staff and the investigating officers every -- from the very minute this case started.  I also want to thank Superintendent Drew Evans of the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension and his professional staff for the care and speed with which they are conducting this investigation. And I want to thank especially U.S. attorney Erica MacDonald and Special Agent in Charge Rainer Drolshagen, who are conducting a parallel federal color of law investigation. I have heard directly from the leadership of the Department of Justice that there is full support for her leadership in pursuit of her investigation and, as she put it so well, one team, one goal, one mission.   I agree 100 percent.  As I said earlier, I think Mr. Floyd's family, I think -- and I can speak for Mr. -- Mr. Freeman and I jointly thank them, along with U.S. attorney MacDonald. We thank the community for their patience in allowing us the time and space we need over these days to lay these charges. As it is so hard to do, I now ask for continued patience. This case continues to be under investigation. We will not be able to say very much publicly about the investigation, except that we encourage anyone who believes that they have evidence in this case to come forward and to be cooperative with the investigation.  As we develop the case for a prosecution, which will also not be -- we will not be able to say very much publicly about it, because our job is to seek justice and to obtain a conviction, not to make statements in the press, but to put -- do our talking in court.  So, I ask for your patience again, while we limit our public comments in pursuit of justice. I also ask for your trust that we are pursuing justice by every legal and ethical means available to us. I also want to add a word of caution. The investigation is ongoing. We are following the path of all of the evidence, wherever it leads. We are investigating as quickly as we can, because speed is important.  We're also investigating as thoroughly as we can, because being complete and thorough is critically important, but it takes time. The reason thoroughness is important is because every single link in the prosecutorial chain must be strong. It needs to be strong, because trying this case will not be an easy thing. Winning a conviction will be hard. In fact, county attorney Freeman is the only prosecutor in the state of Minnesota who has successfully convicted a police officer for murder.   And he can tell you that it's hard. I say that -- I say this not because we doubt our resources or our ability. In fact, we're confident in what we're doing.  But history does show that there are clear challenges here. And we are going to be working very hard and relying on each other and our investigative partners in the community to support that endeavor. To the Floyd family, to our beloved community and to everyone that is watching, I say, George Floyd mattered. He was loved. His family was important. His life had value. And we will seek justice for him and for you, and we will find it. The very fact that we have filed these charges means that we believe in them. But what I do not believe is that one successful prosecution can rectify the hurt and loss that so many people feel.   The solution to that pain will be slow and difficult work of constructing justice and fairness in our society. That work is the work of all of us. We don't need to wait for the resolution and investigation of this case to start that work. We need citizens, neighbors, leaders in government and in faith communities, civil and human rights activists to begin rewriting the rules for a just society now. We need new policy and legislation and ways of thinking at the municipal, state and federal levels. The world of arts and entertainment can use their cultural influence to inspire change that we need. There is a role for all who dream of a justice that we haven't yet experienced.   In the final analysis, a protest can shake a tree and can make the fruit fall down, but, after that fruit is in reach, collecting it and making the jam must follow.  The demonstrations and the protests are dramatic and necessary, but building just institutions is more of a slow grind, but equally important, and we have to begin that work as well. We need your energy and we need everyone's help right now.  Thank you very much. We will take a few questions.  Yes, ma'am.",

I have been arguing throughout the week, and I do in my piece at FOXNews.com tomorrow morning, that this could very well be first-degree murder. The planning required for first-degree murder actually occurred during the commission of the murder, and that, when one of the now co- defendants said to him, hey, Derek, don't you think we should let him go, and he said no, at that point, he made up his mind that the plan would continue until George Floyd was dead.

However, I don't think the case is going to be tried, Neil. I don't know how the defendant could possibly get a fair trial. How are you going to find 12 people in the state of Minnesota that don't have an opinion on this? And that's another reason to charge first-degree murder, because that will induce pretty much, I think, a guilty plea to second-degree murder, which has a maximum of 40 years. That's plenty of time in jail for this. First in Minnesota is life in prison without parole. Second is 40 years. The reason they're exposed to 50 here is because of that underlying crime, well, it was an accident, it was negligent. They can't be convicted of both. They can either be convicted of second-degree murder, intending his death, or committing the felony of assaulting him and the death was an accident. It can't be both intentional and accidental. It's one or the other. So they're either going to get 10, it was accidental, or 40, it was intentional.

Several thousand people have gathered here to make their anguish and pain known regarding the case of George Floyd. This is following, though, a pattern that we have seen over the last couple of days here, Neil, and that is that it is a very peaceful protest, that the police are giving the protesters time and space to make their anger known. And what we have seen over the past 48 hours, Neil, is that the LAPD -- and, in this case, it'll also be the West Hollywood Sheriff's Department -- are trying to let the protesters have the time that they want and saying to them, in effect, OK, if you respect the curfew, we will respect your right to be in these streets to make your voices heard. We have seen it over and over again in Hollywood yesterday and now here in West Hollywood. There have also been protests today down in Orange County, Neil. So far, those have all been peaceful too. So there has been a distinct change in both the protesters and the policing since the violence we saw over the weekend. What I have got the sense of, being on the streets every one of those days, Neil, is that the protesters have started self-policing, that they have been able to identify the criminal elements, and not allow them to infiltrate their legitimate protests. And the police, as I say, have stepped back. They have given these protesters time. And in one instance that I witnessed just a couple of days ago, Monday night, Neil, an officer, a commander walked helmetless on his own into the middle of a large crowd on Sunset Boulevard. He said: \"We feel your anguish. We feel your pain. Let's collaborate. Let's work together. I will take a knee with you, if you then walk out peacefully when the curfew comes.\" They did exactly that. That is clearly the hope, that that will happen again tonight here in West Hollywood. If it doesn't, Neil, there has been strict enforcement of the curfew. There will be arrests of those who go beyond the curfew once again, but, so far, all peaceful here in West Hollywood -- Neil.",

The new 8:00 p.m. curfew that went into effect last night seemed to really dial down the number of arrests and looting. Even though thousands of protesters broke the curfew last night to march in the streets, things looked and felt much different than it did two nights before. And we will see what happens after today's developments. A mass of people got stuck on the Manhattan Bridge for hours last night as they tried to get from Brooklyn into Manhattan. But they were met by the NYPD, who were not allowing entrance into the city. Now, the NYPD is telling us today they had at least 280 arrests over the course of the night.

Mayor de Blasio said Cuomo owed the men and women of the NYPD an apology, which, according to reports, and we have seen some of the video, it did happen last night, everyone saying they're ready to move on. And, as you can see here, they're doing some minor tweaks here to the razor wire here at Saks Fifth Avenue, getting ready for another night, hopefully, with no action here on Fifth Avenue or anywhere in New York City when it comes to looting.

He has succeeded in now taking three more Minneapolis police officers, criminally charging them in the death of George Floyd. So, they join Derek Chauvin in that regard. Furthermore, he is requesting bail be set at $1 million for each officer. Again, when he gets to that podium, we will take you to that podium. Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto, and this is YOUR WORLD. Fast and furious developments in this world and the entire Floyd case. We begin with the latest from Minneapolis and how all of this is being taken in by crowds. Garrett Tenney is there -- Garrett."

But what we know right now, based on a tweet from Senator Amy Klobuchar, is that Derek Chauvin, he has now been charged with second-degree murder, and that the three officers involved, we know, based on court files -- court documents that have been filed, is that they have been charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder. Now, those charges, in Minnesota, they face a maximum sentence of 50 years in prison and a fine of up to $20,000 if they are convicted on both counts. In the criminal complaint, it lays out a lot of what we already knew, that George Floyd was held on the ground for nearly nine minutes. Derek Chauvin had his knee on his neck. Alexander Kueng, one of the other former officers, was pressing down on his back. Thomas Lane was holding his legs. And former Officer Tou Thao watched and kept a growing crowd at bay. As you mentioned, bail set at a million dollars. And these two counts that they have been charged with, this is much of what the protests over the last week have been, is protesters have been calling for the three other officers involved to be charged, as well as Derek Chauvin. And it looks like Attorney General Ellison is going to be coming up to the podium in just a moment. But it is worth noting that the family of George Floyd, as well as demonstrators, have been demanding first-degree murder charges, though, today, second-degree murder. Here's the attorney general."

He will not be able to answer any questions about evidence or how evidence is evaluated, any question about witnesses, any question about the timeline of events that led to Mr. Floyd's death or any investigative detail. It is all under investigation. It is currently confidential. So I just want to set that expectation right now. With that, Attorney General Ellison."

      "speaker": "KEITH ELLISON, MINNESOTA ATTORNEY GENERAL",
      "utterance": "First of all, thank you, ladies and gentlemen of the press. Myself and my friend Mike Freeman want to share some information with you. I want to begin with a reminder. And that is that we're here today because George Floyd is not here. He should be here. He should be alive, but he's not. About nine days ago, the world watched Floyd utter his very last words, \"I can't breathe,\" as he pled for his life. The world heard Floyd call out for his momma and cried out, \"Don't kill me.\" Just two days ago, when I became the lead prosecutor in the murder of Mr. Floyd, I asked for time to thoroughly review all the evidence in the case. And we looked at the case, the evidence that is available, and the investigation is ongoing at this time. I also said that I know it's asking a lot of people to give us time, particularly people who have suffered for decades and centuries of injustice, to be patient. And yet we did get that time. And together, a very strong, experienced team, which included county attorney Mike Freeman, his team and my team, we reviewed the evidence, together with the BCA, and we have something to announce today. Before I announce it, I want to say, thank you for the patience of the people who -- they have shown me and our entire team in pursuit of justice. And I'm here to make these announcements right now. First, today, I filed an amended complaint that charges former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin with murder in the second degree for the death of George Floyd. I believe the evidence available to us now supports the stronger charge of second-degree murder. We have consulted with each other, and we agree. Second, today, arrest warrants were issued for former Minneapolis police officers J.A. Kueng, Thomas Lane, and Tou Thao. Finally, I'd like to announce that, today, Hennepin County attorney Michael Freeman and I have filed a complaint that charges police officer Kueng, Lane, and Thao with aiding and abetting murder in the second degree, A felony offense. I strongly believe that these developments are in the interest of justice for Mr. Floyd, his family, our community and our state. I'm the lead prosecutor in this case, I will be speaking and addressing the public. And this is -- but this is absolutely a team effort. We're working together on this case with only one goal, justice for George Floyd. I want to thank first Mr. Hennepin County attorney Mike Freeman, who has been a true partner in this matter at every step of the way. His experience and insight have been invaluable and will continue to be counted on by the team. I also want to thank county attorney Freeman's professional staff, who have cooperated and work together with my staff and the investigating officers every -- from the very minute this case started. I also want to thank Superintendent Drew Evans of the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension and his professional staff for the care and speed with which they are conducting this investigation. And I want to thank especially U.S. attorney Erica MacDonald and Special Agent in Charge Rainer Drolshagen, who are conducting a parallel federal color of law investigation. I have heard directly from the leadership of the Department of Justice that there is full support for her leadership in pursuit of her investigation and, as she put it so well, one team, one goal, one mission. I agree 100 percent. As I said earlier, I think Mr. Floyd's family, I think -- and I can speak for Mr. -- Mr. Freeman and I jointly thank them, along with U.S. attorney MacDonald. We thank the community for their patience in allowing us the time and space we need over these days to lay these charges. As it is so hard to do, I now ask for continued patience. This case continues to be under investigation. We will not be able to say very much publicly about the investigation, except that we encourage anyone who believes that they have evidence in this case to come forward and to be cooperative with the investigation. As we develop the case for a prosecution, which will also not be -- we will not be able to say very much publicly about it, because our job is to seek justice and to obtain a conviction, not to make statements in the press, but to put -- do our talking in court. So, I ask for your patience again, while we limit our public comments in pursuit of justice. I also ask for your trust that we are pursuing justice by every legal and ethical means available to us. I also want to add a word of caution. The investigation is ongoing. We are following the path of all of the evidence, wherever it leads. We are investigating as quickly as we can, because speed is important. We're also investigating as thoroughly as we can, because being complete and thorough is critically important, but it takes time. The reason thoroughness is important is because every single link in the prosecutorial chain must be strong. It needs to be strong, because trying this case will not be an easy thing. Winning a conviction will be hard. In fact, county attorney Freeman is the only prosecutor in the state of Minnesota who has successfully convicted a police officer for murder. And he can tell you that it's hard. I say that -- I say this not because we doubt our resources or our ability. In fact, we're confident in what we're doing. But history does show that there are clear challenges here. And we are going to be working very hard and relying on each other and our investigative partners in the community to support that endeavor. To the Floyd family, to our beloved community and to everyone that is watching, I say, George Floyd mattered. He was loved. His family was important. His life had value. And we will seek justice for him and for you, and we will find it. The very fact that we have filed these charges means that we believe in them. But what I do not believe is that one successful prosecution can rectify the hurt and loss that so many people feel. The solution to that pain will be slow and difficult work of constructing justice and fairness in our society. That work is the work of all of us. We don't need to wait for the resolution and investigation of this case to start that work. We need citizens, neighbors, leaders in government and in faith communities, civil and human rights activists to begin rewriting the rules for a just society now. We need new policy and legislation and ways of thinking at the municipal, state and federal levels. The world of arts and entertainment can use their cultural influence to inspire change that we need. There is a role for all who dream of a justice that we haven't yet experienced. In the final analysis, a protest can shake a tree and can make the fruit fall down, but, after that fruit is in reach, collecting it and making the jam must follow. The demonstrations and the protests are dramatic and necessary, but building just institutions is more of a slow grind, but equally important, and we have to begin that work as well. We need your energy and we need everyone's help right now. Thank you very much. We will take a few questions. Yes, ma'am."

For second degree felony murder, you have to intend a felony and then death be the result without necessarily having it be the intent. So that is the -- that's the state of the law.

He brought in three more Minneapolis police officers, criminally charged now in the death of George of Floyd. Derek Chauvin, the officer who you might recall had his knee on the neck of George Floyd, those charges were upgraded from third-degree murder to second-degree. And that has raised some questions here. It's a tougher issue to get by a jury. But, in the meantime, the other three officers have been -- on a number of counts, two additional counts of aiding and abetting second-degree murder. If found guilty on both those counts, those officers could be in prison for 50 years. Let's get Judge Andrew Napolitano and his on all of this. Judge, first off, the upgrade to second-degree murder. Is that not a tougher charge to get through a jury, certainly unanimously? Your thoughts?"
    },

      "speaker": "ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST",
      "utterance": "Well, yes, it is a tougher charge, but there seems to be -- first of all, good afternoon, Neil. There seems to be more-than-adequate evidence here for -- from which a jury could find second-degree murder. The pressing of the knee for eight minutes and 43 seconds obviously shows intent. I have been arguing throughout the week, and I do in my piece at FOXNews.com tomorrow morning, that this could very well be first-degree murder. The planning required for first-degree murder actually occurred during the commission of the murder, and that, when one of the now co- defendants said to him, hey, Derek, don't you think we should let him go, and he said no, at that point, he made up his mind that the plan would continue until George Floyd was dead. So, the short answer your question is, yes, second-degree murder is more difficult to convict for than manslaughter. But the longer answer is, there's more than enough evidence here from which a jury can find that."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Judge, Ellison was talking about how this could take many, many months. It's just started here. He kind of dismissed any ideas of making a deal or anything, which is probably wise. It's a little too early to think that way. I was surprised to hear that only one officer in the history of Minnesota has been found guilty of a crime like this. And I'm wondering, it is legally an uphill battle, is it not?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "NAPOLITANO",
      "utterance": "Well, yes, it is. I mean, people generally respect the police. And the defense, if there is a trial, will put an expert on the stand who will explain to the jury that police are allowed a broad array of discretion, particularly at the scene of a crime, and have a broad array of tools available to them at the scene of a crime. However, I don't think the case is going to be tried, Neil. I don't know how the defendant could possibly get a fair trial. How are you going to find 12 people in the state of Minnesota that don't have an opinion on this? And that's another reason to charge first-degree murder, because that will induce pretty much, I think, a guilty plea to second-degree murder, which has a maximum of 40 years. That's plenty of time in jail for this. First in Minnesota is life in prison without parole. Second is 40 years. The reason they're exposed to 50 here is because of that underlying crime, well, it was an accident, it was negligent. They can't be convicted of both. They can either be convicted of second-degree murder, intending his death, or committing the felony of assaulting him and the death was an accident. It can't be both intentional and accidental. It's one or the other. So they're either going to get 10, it was accidental, or 40, it was intentional. If they were charged with the first- degree,they'd plead to second-degree probably in a couple of weeks."

I wouldn't be surprised if it's considerably lower than that. I also wouldn't be surprised if they're put on some sort of a house confinement. But, remember, these four people are pariahs in Minnesota. And they're very familiar with the legal justice system.

You're going to see four different views of this. You're going to hear every word that was articulated. It would be so graphic that, again, it would likely induce a guilty plea, rather than confront the wrath of a jury after it watched all those."

But, Neil, if none of those body cameras were working, at that point, you have a conspiracy, which is another charge that can be filed against them, which would be a conspiracy to suppress evidence from their superiors and from a jury.

If found guilty on those charges, those officers are looking at potentially up to 50 years in prison. Be that as it may, for a lot of crowds here, that was welcome news, calming news, that this might be all fairly distributed to the officers involved. It depends on your perspective, but it did have a clear calming effect on one city after another.

But they do want to see more from the attorney general in response to those other three officers. But I want to point out what you're seeing right now. If you look to my left, you're seeing members of the military and law enforcement standing shoulder to shoulder. They're essentially providing a human barrier between White House grounds and protesters, where thousands are gathering right now. Correctional officers pulled out of federal prison now protecting the city. TSA agents that served at airports are now on duty in the District. This is all part of the president's unprecedented show of force here. National Guardsmen from 10 states all in D.C. protecting the president and also our national monuments, while the nation marks its ninth day under protest. Around the country, a historic 74,000 National Guard soldiers and airmen were activated for domestic operations. The president credits the National Guard and this massive show of force for containing rioting and violence here in the District.

In D.C., there have been significant injuries to law enforcement officers. A federal law enforcement official says, since the weekend, over 50 Park Police and 30 Secret Service agents have been injured in Washington in the last few days of protests. Most were struck in the head with random objects, like bottles, rocks and bricks. Some of them had to be hospitalized. Another DOJ official tells FOX News that they're also looking into reports of mass drop-offs of items like bricks and rocks that are being used to throw at law enforcement officials. Neil, I also want to point out, it is 90 degrees here in Washington, D.C., just steps from the White House. So it is a very hot day for the thousands of protesters that have turned out here.

Several thousand people have gathered here to make their anguish and pain known regarding the case of George Floyd. This is following, though, a pattern that we have seen over the last couple of days here, Neil, and that is that it is a very peaceful protest, that the police are giving the protesters time and space to make their anger known. And what we have seen over the past 48 hours, Neil, is that the LAPD -- and, in this case, it'll also be the West Hollywood Sheriff's Department -- are trying to let the protesters have the time that they want and saying to them, in effect, OK, if you respect the curfew, we will respect your right to be in these streets to make your voices heard. We have seen it over and over again in Hollywood yesterday and now here in West Hollywood. There have also been protests today down in Orange County, Neil. So far, those have all been peaceful too. So there has been a distinct change in both the protesters and the policing since the violence we saw over the weekend. What I have got the sense of, being on the streets every one of those days, Neil, is that the protesters have started self-policing, that they have been able to identify the criminal elements, and not allow them to infiltrate their legitimate protests."

But here at the famed Saks Fifth Avenue, as you see here behind me, not only is it boarded up, but it actually has a razor wire chain-link fence. It's almost as if you could hear the operators of this iconic store say, not on my watch. And at night, the dogs come. And, actually we just have a couple that have shown up here. German shepherds and pit bulls are on guard, along with these private security guards, all through the night. Now, there was no torn-apart plywood, broken glass or theft here last night. The new 8:00 p.m. curfew that went into effect last night seemed to really dial down the number of arrests and looting. Even though thousands of protesters broke the curfew last night to march in the streets, things looked and felt much different than it did two nights before. And we will see what happens after today's developments. A mass of people got stuck on the Manhattan Bridge for hours last night as they tried to get from Brooklyn into Manhattan. But they were met by the NYPD, who were not allowing entrance into the city. Now, the NYPD is telling us today they had at least 280 arrests over the course of the night. There was some reports of looting and vandalism, but, again, nothing like we have seen. Protesters are set to hit the streets here in this hour, according to some social media posts. We have already seen some of that action at Washington Square Park. There may be more of that tonight, but, hopefully, it will be peaceful, with minimal incident, like last night. There's been a lot of back and forth too between Governor Andrew Cuomo and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio on how the NYPD has handled the rioting and looting. It has been absolutely chaotic. But, Monday, Governor Cuomo said the NYPD actually needed to do a better job. Mayor de Blasio said Cuomo owed the men and women of the NYPD an apology, which, according to reports, and we have seen some of the video, it did happen last night, everyone saying they're ready to move on. And, as you can see here, they're doing some minor tweaks here to the razor wire here at Saks Fifth Avenue, getting ready for another night, hopefully, with no action here on Fifth Avenue or anywhere in New York City when it comes to looting. We will see what happens tonight, Neil."
