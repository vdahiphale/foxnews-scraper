      "sentences": "Good Sunday morning, everyone. Thanks you so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. Joining me exclusively right here straight ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures,\" Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham is here.  How are Senate Republicans preparing for what appears to be an inevitable impeachment trial?  Also with us this morning, Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy on what to expect when the Democrats make their impeachment push public this week with hearings on Capitol Hill.  House Republicans have their own witness wish list. That includes the whistle-blower. Will they get the chance to get their questions answered? And how is the leader of the GOP reforming the Intel Committee ahead of all of this? Also with us this morning, Mark Penn, who advised Bill and Hillary Clinton on how a potential Michael Bloomberg bid could disrupt the 2020 Democratic field. He called it. He said it on this program months ago.  Whether we should expect any other big names to jump in with Mark Penn this morning. Plus, the Republican lawmaker who led the storming of the secure facility where Adam Schiff held his closed-door testimony in the impeachment inquiry, Congressman Matt Gaetz here this morning.  All that and a lot more, as we look ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures\" right now.   Welcome. Public hearings are kicking off this week in the impeachment inquiry against President Trump. Meanwhile, House Republicans have submitted a list of eight witnesses they would like to hear from, among them, Hunter Biden, as well as the whistle-blower who sparked the whole thing. The ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, Devin Nunes, arguing in a letter to Chairman Adam Schiff, \"President Trump should be afforded an opportunity to confront his accusers,\" writes Devin Nunes.   But Schiff already ruled out an appearance by the whistle-blower, also saying this: \"The inquiry is not and will not serve as a vehicle to undertake the same sham investigations into the Bidens or 2016 that the president pressed Ukraine to conduct for his personal political benefit.\" The president, meanwhile, insisting he's already cleared by the White House's rough log of his July call with Ukraine's president.",

And when the president of the company -- Burisma, I think, is the name of the company. When his house was raided in February, the Bidens kicked in. And we're going to look at that.  I consider any impeachment in the House that doesn't allow us to know who the whistle-blower is to be invalid, because without the whistle-blower complaint, we wouldn't be talking about any of this.

Then you see meetings between Hunter Biden's business partner and John Kerry, and all of a sudden, the case goes away. I think it's important that we find that what really did happen regarding the firing of the prosecutor and what was the conflict of interest that Hunter Biden had.  But back to the whistle-blower, it's impossible to bring this case forward, in my view, fairly without us knowing who the whistle-blower is, and having a chance to cross-examine them about any biases that they may have.

This is not about Schiff finding the truth. This is about Schiff trying to destroy the Trump presidency. Mueller looked at Trump, two years, $25 million, 40 FBI agents, and didn't find anything.

So this is the first time ever that impeachment has been driven by a member of Congress, rather than outside counsel. There was outside counsel in Nixon. There was outside counsel in Clinton. And Mueller was an outside counsel.   The first time in the history that we have had a partisan politician push impeachment. And the process in the House is way different than what happened in the past.

If the House Democrats refused to go down the road into looking into whether or not the reason the prosecutor was fired is because he's getting too close to Hunter Biden, and Joe Biden and his team stepped in, that is a legitimate inquiry.

It's impossible for the president to adequately defend himself unless we know more about why Hunter Biden was fired -- why the prosecutor was fired. The president asked the Ukrainian president to look in corruption. Corruption is rampant in the Ukraine. I find it odd that the only person that Joe Biden wanted fired in all of Ukraine was the prosecutor who was investigating a company that his son served on the board. That is very much relevant to the whole quid pro quo allegation against the president. And, to me, is there a quid pro quo in place where Joe Biden said, if you don't fire the prosecutor, you get no money? And was one of his motives to protect his son? Somebody has to look at that. And if Adam Schiff will not allow House Republicans to look at that, then I think Senate Republicans need to make sure it is looked at.",

John Durham is looking at the possibility of criminality when it comes to obtaining the warrant, criminality when it comes to the counterintelligence investigation. My goal is to provide oversight. I promise you that Mr. Horowitz will come before the Judiciary Committee when his report is complete and testify in public, under oath, as to what happened. Then I will start connecting the dots.

That she perjured herself, that she lied in the own - - deposition, that she did, with her own personal e-mail account, contact a Democratic congressional staffer with -- concerning a quite delicate and time-sensitive matter. And this was just two days after the whistle-blower's complaint, and that kick-started the whole inquiry. This has been orchestrated. And if it goes out longer, we will find the lies. We will find how they calculated the coup. We will find more about from the whistle-blower's attorney and others. And remember this. When Adam Schiff said he wanted the whistle-blower to testify, and now he doesn't -- he is fighting us on it, because everything we found out is his association -- in a federal criminal trial, if your case relies on an informant, you must produce the informant at trial. They must face their accuser. But now he's trying to protect that individual because of what we're finding out of their own background and his association with them?

How are Senate Republicans preparing for what appears to be an inevitable impeachment trial? Also with us this morning, Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy on what to expect when the Democrats make their impeachment push public this week with hearings on Capitol Hill. House Republicans have their own witness wish list. That includes the whistle-blower. Will they get the chance to get their questions answered? And how is the leader of the GOP reforming the Intel Committee ahead of all of this? Also with us this morning, Mark Penn, who advised Bill and Hillary Clinton on how a potential Michael Bloomberg bid could disrupt the 2020 Democratic field. He called it. He said it on this program months ago. Whether we should expect any other big names to jump in with Mark Penn this morning. Plus, the Republican lawmaker who led the storming of the secure facility where Adam Schiff held his closed-door testimony in the impeachment inquiry, Congressman Matt Gaetz here this morning. All that and a lot more, as we look ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures\" right now. Welcome. Public hearings are kicking off this week in the impeachment inquiry against President Trump. Meanwhile, House Republicans have submitted a list of eight witnesses they would like to hear from, among them, Hunter Biden, as well as the whistle-blower who sparked the whole thing. The ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, Devin Nunes, arguing in a letter to Chairman Adam Schiff, \"President Trump should be afforded an opportunity to confront his accusers,\" writes Devin Nunes."

You can see efforts in the State Department where they were worried about the conflict of interests between Hunter Biden and this company that was being investigated. And when the president of the company -- Burisma, I think, is the name of the company. When his house was raided in February, the Bidens kicked in. And we're going to look at that. I consider any impeachment in the House that doesn't allow us to know who the whistle-blower is to be invalid, because without the whistle-blower complaint, we wouldn't be talking about any of this. And I also see the need for Hunter Biden to be called to adequately defend the president. And if you don't do those two things, it's a complete joke."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "GRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Yes. I think the big deal is that Hunter Biden is serving on a board of a gas company that's being investigated by the Ukrainian government. In February, they raid the house of the guy who owns the gas company. Then you see a lot of interaction, with Joe Biden calling the president of the Ukraine. Then you see meetings between Hunter Biden's business partner and John Kerry, and all of a sudden, the case goes away. I think it's important that we find that what really did happen regarding the firing of the prosecutor and what was the conflict of interest that Hunter Biden had. But back to the whistle-blower, it's impossible to bring this case forward, in my view, fairly without us knowing who the whistle-blower is, and having a chance to cross-examine them about any biases that they may have. So, if they don't call the whistle-blower in the House, this thing is dead on arrival in the Senate."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "GRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Well, if the whistle-blower comes from the Brennan world, that would be pretty stunning, I think. If the whistle-blower had a connection to a Democratic candidate, that would be pretty stunning. So the only way you can fairly deal with this issue is for us to find out who the whistle-blower is. No American can be accused of a crime based on an anonymous allegation. The whistle-blower is foundational to what they're doing into the House. And the fact that they don't want to call him tells you everything they know -- everything you need to know about how valid this effort is to impeach the president. It is impossible to conduct an impeachment inquiry when the chief complaining witness is unknown to the president, not subject to cross- examination."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Well, this is a really important point, because, for a long time, Adam Schiff said he wanted to speak to the whistle-blower. Then we found out that his staff actually did meet with the whistle-blower."

      "utterance": "Yes. Well, because what's going to happen, when you find out who the whistle- blower is, I'm confident you're going to find out it's somebody from the deep state. You're going to find out that they had interactions with Schiff. And this thing's going to stink to high heaven. And the only reason we don't know who the whistle-blower is, that it hurts their cause. They're not trying to find the truth here. If you really wanted to know the truth about why Joe Biden said what he did about the prosecutor, if you don't fire this guy, we're going to cut off the money, well, let's find out, did his -- was Hunter Biden in the crosshairs of the prosecutor? This is not about Schiff finding the truth. This is about Schiff trying to destroy the Trump presidency. Mueller looked at Trump, two years, $25 million, 40 FBI agents, and didn't find anything. Now we got it in the hands of Schiff and Nadler. If you think Schiff is looking for the truth, you shouldn't be allowed to drive anywhere in America, because that's a ridiculous concept."

It would blow them out of the water if, in fact, the whistle-blower was connected to a Democratic candidate and came from the CIA world that's been trying to destroy the Trump presidency before he got elected. That's why they don't want you to know who this person is."

And we found out that the president's counsel was allowed to cross-examine witnesses making accusations against the president. That's not allowed here. The president's counsel cannot participate in the Intel Committee inquiries. It has been done behind closed doors. Everything afforded Nixon and Clinton has been denied Trump. So this is the first time ever that impeachment has been driven by a member of Congress, rather than outside counsel. There was outside counsel in Nixon. There was outside counsel in Clinton. And Mueller was an outside counsel. The first time in the history that we have had a partisan politician push impeachment. And the process in the House is way different than what happened in the past. And denying the Republicans the ability to trace the Hunter Biden conflict of interest storyline and deny them the ability to expose the whistle-blower, again, is basically denying the president the ability to defend himself. And what are they hiding?"

Everybody wants to know, will you call Hunter Biden? Will you call Nellie Ohr? Much more with Senator Lindsey Graham when we come back, as well as House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy. Leader McCarthy is here talking about former Clinton advisers. Plus, we will also talk with Clinton campaign adviser Mark Penn. He was with Bill and Hillary Clinton for a time. He is now talking about the left. GOP Congressman Matt Gaetz is also here. Wait until you see that. Follow me on Twitter @MariaBartiromo, @SundayFutures, and on Instagram. Stay with us.

Are you planning on calling anyone to testify in front of your committee?"

      "speaker": "GRAHAM",

This is all about the State Department. The Foreign Relations Committee in the Senate has jurisdiction over this. But let me just say this. If the House Democrats refused to go down the road into looking into whether or not the reason the prosecutor was fired is because he's getting too close to Hunter Biden, and Joe Biden and his team stepped in, that is a legitimate inquiry. And I'm hoping that Chairman Risch, if the House refuses to call Hunter Biden and other people related to that in the House, that we would call them in the Senate, because that may be the only place you hear the other side of the story."

We actually have committees in the Senate for a reason, subject matter. But here's what I do believe. It's impossible for the president to adequately defend himself unless we know more about why Hunter Biden was fired -- why the prosecutor was fired. The president asked the Ukrainian president to look in corruption. Corruption is rampant in the Ukraine. I find it odd that the only person that Joe Biden wanted fired in all of Ukraine was the prosecutor who was investigating a company that his son served on the board. That is very much relevant to the whole quid pro quo allegation against the president. And, to me, is there a quid pro quo in place where Joe Biden said, if you don't fire the prosecutor, you get no money? And was one of his motives to protect his son? Somebody has to look at that. And if Adam Schiff will not allow House Republicans to look at that, then I think Senate Republicans need to make sure it is looked at."

The person who's been assigned to look into whether or not the FISA warrant was properly obtained and whether or not that FISA court was basically defrauded is Mr. Horowitz, the inspector general of the Department of Justice. He's been looking at this for over a year. He's also looking at whether or not the counterintelligence investigation of the Trump campaign was legitimate. He's looking at it internally. John Durham is looking at the possibility of criminality when it comes to obtaining the warrant, criminality when it comes to the counterintelligence investigation. My goal is to provide oversight. I promise you that Mr. Horowitz will come before the Judiciary Committee when his report is complete and testify in public, under oath, as to what happened. Then I will start connecting the dots. If the whistle-blower is, in fact, part of the team that tried to get a warrant illegally in 2016, I think that would be a stunning revelation and may explain their motives in terms of why they filed the complaint to begin with."

The declassification issue has been resolved. Most of it's going to be declassified. I want the public to look at what happened, not trust my rendition of what happened. Let's declassify all the applications for the warrants. Let's put it all out there to see, all the 302s, so you can make your own decision if Christopher Steele had a bias against Trump, if he was an unreliable person when it came to obtaining a warrant against the Trump campaign. My goal is transparency, but I'm going to do this right. Horowitz is somebody outside of politics. He's going to testify first. He's going to have the time and the space to make the report the way he feels it needs to be made. And he will come before the American people and tell the story the way he needs to tell it.

So you have got the special envoy to the Ukraine saying there was no quid pro quo. You have got selected leaking of information. To the House Republicans, you have done a good job of trying to correct the record. I think the whole thing is being driven by a partisan, Adam Schiff. The president's counsel is shut out.

And now Adam Schiff gets to decide who comes forward, and now he's fighting the whistle-blower from coming forward? Why is he doing that? Is it because we found out that he met and the staff met with him? Is it because we found out now the whistle-blower's attorney had tweeted that the coup had started, that impeachment will follow ultimately, that he predicted, this attorney, that CNN will play a key role? Maria, it is clear now more than ever this is a calculated coup. And it is being orchestrated by Adam Schiff.

One of the key witnesses is the former U.S. ambassador to, Marie. And what did we find out now? That she perjured herself, that she lied in the own - - deposition, that she did, with her own personal e-mail account, contact a Democratic congressional staffer with -- concerning a quite delicate and time-sensitive matter. And this was just two days after the whistle-blower's complaint, and that kick-started the whole inquiry. This has been orchestrated. And if it goes out longer, we will find the lies. We will find how they calculated the coup. We will find more about from the whistle-blower's attorney and others. And remember this. When Adam Schiff said he wanted the whistle-blower to testify, and now he doesn't -- he is fighting us on it, because everything we found out is his association -- in a federal criminal trial, if your case relies on an informant, you must produce the informant at trial. They must face their accuser. But now he's trying to protect that individual because of what we're finding out of their own background and his association with them? And they changed this all from the Intel Committee to now the impeachment committee. So one thing that I did -- I thank Congressman Rick Crawford, because he's on the Intel Committee, because he cares about intel and where America is standing around the world.

Joining me right now is Mark Penn. He is a chief strategist on both Bill and Hillary Clinton's presidential campaigns. He is managing director of The Stagwell Group. And he is the man who called this months ago on this program. Mark, it's great to see you."

    {
      "speaker": "MARK PENN, FORMER CLINTON CAMPAIGN STRATEGIST",
      "utterance": "Thank you."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "You came on this show and on my show on FOX Business, \"Mornings With Maria,\" and said you wouldn't be surprised, that you are expecting Michael Bloomberg to enter the race. Good call. Tell me what you feel about that now."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PENN",
      "utterance": "Well, look, I think it was political logic then that, unless this field changed, Biden is a front-runner, but a weak front-runner, and a lot of the other candidates are too far to the left. And I think Michael Bloomberg saw that opportunity and made a pretty intelligent decision. Look, for him, it's now or never in terms of running for president. So why not get in and shake up the Democratic Party? And that's what he's doing."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Well, you make a good point when you compare it to Biden, because there are some people, and actually Congressman Kevin McCarthy among them, that say the whole reason that Bloomberg is coming in tells you that means Biden must be failing, because Bloomberg said, I'm not going to enter the race if Joe Biden is there because you don't need me. But if he starts to fail or flag, then I will come in. So is that an admission?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PENN",
      "utterance": "Well, I think what Bloomberg has said directly, he thinks the field is weak. But I do think that Biden's going to have a test in Iowa and New Hampshire. If Biden doesn't come through that test, and at the end of those two, has to drop out, then I think that's going to present a clear field for Bloomberg and the moderate wing. If Biden does particularly well in those two states, that might block the Bloomberg effort and it will never get off the ground. So a lot of pressure is put on the Biden campaign now to deliver in the early states."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Bernie Sanders has said there should be no billionaires in the United States. He actually said that. And we know that. We know that moderates in the past have not gone past go in the Democratic Party, because the progressives have taken over. Will Bloomberg get a fair shot from Tom Perez, the head of the DNC?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PENN",
      "utterance": "Well, I think a big question is whether Bloomberg will be put into the debates or not, regardless of his polling numbers. He needs 165,000 small donors. And while people seem to like billionaires as presidents -- and, in fact, John F. Kennedy came from an incredibly rich family, as did FDR. So, Americans have always seen that as someone above corruption in many ways. On the other hand, the Democratic Party says, if you don't have 165,000 small donors, you don't qualify for the debates. And that is a problem for Michael Bloomberg."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Well, Kevin McCarthy a minute ago just said that Michael Bloomberg gave the Democrats $110 million to help them win the House majority back in November for the midterm elections. Is he buying his way in here?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PENN",
      "utterance": "Well, he certainly contributed his way in some sense. But, look, I believe that's what his conscience said. He's come out with some very strong positions on gun safety or gun control. He's come out with strong positions on climate change. Look, I think Bloomberg very much represents a social progressive, right, but economic moderate or conservative. And a lot of the country has been crying out for somebody who's like that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "So let's talk about his policy platform for a second. Do you think it will be climate change and guns or something else?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PENN",
      "utterance": "I think he's going to combine here climate change and guns with a set of moderate positions. I think -- I think, once Elizabeth Warren put out a $52 trillion Medicare for all program, that became a target for everyone, because it's laughable that the government could put together that kind of program without increasing taxes on a lot of people."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "What are the chances that President Trump wins reelection? You have talked to in the past about an issue that he may have with suburban women. Walk us through what the president's chances are today."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PENN",
      "utterance": "Look, right now, the country is in the middle of a realignment. The Republicans had strongholds in the suburbs and were weak with the working class. Donald Trump comes in, wins the election with a combination of suburban and working-class voters. But he has strengthened since his election, I think, the commitment of working-class voters to him, but he's been losing the suburbs. And that's where you see election after election. In the midterms, the suburbs went over to the Democrats. The Democrats are changing as a party. So is the Republican. Is that permanent? Will it last? That, I couldn't tell you."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "You have also said in the past on this program you think Hillary Clinton may reenter. Do you think she still is thinking about running for president?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PENN",
      "utterance": "There's still a couple of days here. I don't know whether she will look at the Michael Bloomberg thing and say, ah, the field is too crowded now, I missed my opportunity, or the opposite. Wow, the field is weak, I could come in, I could get 165,000 donors. I'm tied with Biden in some of these early states if I get in."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PENN",
      "utterance": "There's still a political logic there for her."
    },

      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "You also have not been afraid to be out front in calling out the wrongdoing in 2016 and the FISA abuse, as I have as well. Do you think this now criminal investigation from John Durham, the Horowitz report, the I.G. report that we're waiting on, all of this blows up right in the middle of an election year, 2020? What is that going to do to the Democratic stance?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PENN",
      "utterance": "Well, the problem we have is, every fact now, right, left, center, is look through a partisan lens. I think -- I have been looking forward to the I.G. Report. I don't see, having looked at this, there's any foundation for that FISA warrant, that real abuses were committed. And I hope people are held accountable for those abuses. I think they will, based on the kind of the hints that people like Senator Lindsey Graham say. But where is this report? It's been years now."
    },

    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Welcome back. Former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon last weekend on this program talked about my next guest, who led House Republicans in storming the Intel Committee's closed-door hearings, saying he -- quote -- \"broke the fever.\" Congressman Matt Gaetz is with me right now, Republican from Florida. He sits on the House Judiciary and Armed Services committees. Good to see you, Congressman. Thanks very much for joining us."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "GAETZ",
      "utterance": "Well, it appears we were successful in communicating the message that this was an unfair, politically motivated process. We saw just last week polling from AP and ABC News reflecting that half the country or more saw this as politically motivated and unfair to President Trump. And so now, in the coming weeks, we will have open testimony. And I think that it's important for the American people to know that you have got a group of people whose names you don't know, whose faces you haven't seen, who are part of the permanent government in Washington. And whether Republicans or Democrats are elected, they believe it's their way or the highway. President Trump is very different. He pushes back on permanent Washington. And now you have people in the bowels of the bureaucracy of government who thinks that the president serves at their pleasure, instead of them serving at the president's pleasure."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "How much of this impeachment inquiry is smoke and mirrors ahead of the John Durham criminal investigation details and the I.G. report? A couple of weeks, ago we had on Svetlana Lokhova, who was basically a woman who met General Michael Flynn. And, as we know, ahead of Veterans Day, let me just say, Michael Flynn rose to the rank of lieutenant general over 33 years of service in the U.S. Army. He served as President Trump's national security adviser, before resigning in February '17. And he basically saw his reputation destroyed. Here's Svetlana Lokhova. Listen to this."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "LOKHOVA",
      "utterance": "In my whole life up to today, I have only met and spoken to General Flynn once, on 28th of February, 2014."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "So, Congressman, they used her to muddy up the reputation of General Flynn, who had served our country for more than 30 years. Can you connect the dots and tell us if this Ukraine situation has any relation to what took place in 2016, where they tried to frame Donald Trump and his campaign?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GAETZ",
      "utterance": "It's not just me saying that. It's not just Rudy Giuliani. It's actually a court in Ukraine. A court in Ukraine held that there was an act of election interference that was unlawful in the 2016 election. And it is only appropriate for us to get to the bottom of that. The Flynn case specifically highlights the hypocrisy here. When General Flynn was tricked into a misstatement to Jim Comey's team, he was forced into this plea deal. When Andrew McCabe lied repeatedly under oath, he escaped consequences. So, time and again, you see these people who are part of the permanent government of permanent Washington playing by their own rules."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GAETZ",
      "utterance": "But when you have disruptive patriots like General Flynn, like Donald Trump, then all of permanent Washington sort of crashes down on them. And that's what we have got to fight back against."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "So, which is why Sidney Powell, who also joined me a couple of weeks ago, his lawyer, wants all of these charges dropped on General Flynn. Real quick, next week is the public hearings. What should we expect? How is this going to go down, sir? How does this play out?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GAETZ",
      "utterance": "Yes. You will see a policy disagreement on how to approach the Ukraine sort of refashioned into an impeachment exercise. There are people who believe that the only appropriate action would have been full support of the Ukraine with no conditions whatsoever. President Trump had a different view. And now they want to impeach him for it. It's crazy."

      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
