The manhunt is over, and the illegal immigrant suspected of murdering a beloved California State officer is behind bars tonight. Plus a California Mayor insisting she did the right thing when she tipped off illegal immigrants about an ICE raid. And Trumpaganda, a power of impeachment? What are schools teaching our children? We'll go over the top politically biased college courses of the year. But first, we begin with a Fox News Alert. Investigators say more arrests could come in connection with the murder of a California policeman on Christmas night. Today, after a two-day long manhunt, police arresting Gustavo Perez Arriaga, an illegal immigrant who should have been on ICE's radar with his two prior DUI arrest but wasn't because of the state's absurd sanctuary laws. Officials say Arriaga was the lone gunman. Five other men were helping him evade arrest and escape to Mexico. Officer Ron Singh's brother was overcome with emotion on the news of the arrest.",

The idea behind - and first of all, I'm not against lawful, legal immigration to this community. We're a community, an agricultural community with a large population that serves in that economy.  The idea behind this policy, these laws, was because there is a belief that people who don't trust law enforcement, and they won't come forward to tell us about being a victim of crime because they're afraid of that we will deport them. Absolutely not true. Local law enforcement doesn't engage in the enforcement of federal immigration law. But by doing this, you've now created sanctuary for criminals, people who are here illegally, victimizing and exploiting others. And there is a category of crimes that below a certain threshold - so anything serious or violent, we can communicate.

It used to be that they could come into my jail and collect or take possession of people who fell into that category who were fugitives and wanted. SB 54, in essence, restricted the ability to some degree of ICE even having access to our facility. So we need to have a dialogue. We need to have a conversation.

And so that, for us, was only - I think there's only 12 officers. And so - this is really a tragedy for the valley here, the big San Joaquin Valley, which is the Ag region. I know you've been here many times, not exactly the way that we want to spend our holidays. So, right before Christmas, we had a very similar situation where there was someone who was in the country illegally, had actually been deported twice, had been arrested just prior and then was released. Because of the sanctuary city law, the Sheriff couldn't hold this Garcia - Mr. Garcia, who went on a rampage for over 24 hours, killed two people, possibly a third. We don't know because I think there is one still in critical condition in the hospital because this person - this Garcia went around the entire county, several communities and was shooting people at random, stealing vehicles, and finally caused a major traffic accident and the car exploded. And he is now no longer a part of the planet here. But the bad part is that there are two innocents that lost their lives, just like what we experienced in the last couple days just north of here, in Newman, where you had a police officer that was killed. And it's just a horrible situation. And you asked me what can be done. I mean, the sad part is that in the last election in California, these policies were rewarded at the ballot box. So the Democrats who condone these policies had probably their biggest election win ever. And so something is not making sense. I don't know if people just aren't getting the right information that you would think that at some point politicians would be held accountable for their actions or inactions. And in this case, it's pretty darn clear that these sanctuary city policies are leading to innocent people getting murdered.",

Let's build a wall, one that actually works, in those populated areas. Let's make sure we get those secure, first. Then other areas you may not need a wall or fencing. But then at the same time the president was very reasonable and was willing to solve the DACA problem. We had a vote in Congress where Republicans actually voted to build a wall and reform DACA, take care of the kids that were brought here with no part of their own. We didn't get one Democratic vote. Every Democrat in the state of California voted against this law. Those are for the young people who live here who would have been made legal, but for some reason people here in California and I think all over the country don't realize what a sensible solution was put on the table -- border security, taking care of DACA, putting in a permit system for people to work here that are doing jobs that aren't going to be filled for Americans, very sensible solutions just aren't being communicated I think to the people, and I think the people are making some uninformed decisions.",

The NBC report is based on an interview with the U.S. commander at Guantanamo Bay, Rear Admiral John Ring, who says he has orders from the Pentagon to prepare for the camp to be open for another 25 years. The joint task force Guantanamo mission is now 16 years old, and according to Ring, the infra structure of the military prison is failing fast. \"It's sort of falling to the ground and deteriorating rapidly,\" he told NBC News. Forty detainees are now left at Guantanamo, the last transfer there in 2008, so they can no longer provide any useful battlefield intelligence according to the rear admiral. The average age now is 46. The oldest is 71, meaning medical needs are changing and becoming more demanding as the detainees age, and Ring, according to NBC, is worried that he doesn't have the funding to provide the necessary care. He told NBC, quote, \"I'm the innkeeper. I don't make laws. People in D.C. tell me when people are going away, when people may be coming in, and my job is to keep these folks comfortable, safe.\" President Obama, of course, wanted to shut down the facility. He failed in that pledge, partly because of politics, partly because of the practicalities of finding a place to rehouse the detainees who numbered more than 200 when President Obama took office. Five members of the Afghan Taliban were released by President Obama in 2014 in exchange for captured U.S. Army Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl. Those five have now joined what the Taliban calls its political office in the Gulf state of Qatar and are therefore among the Taliban representatives negotiating for peace in Afghanistan. That's despite warnings from some analysts that as members of the Taliban's old guard, they bring with them the same ultraconservative interpretation of Islam that characterized the Taliban's five-year rule of Afghanistan and provided shelter and a place to train for Al Qaeda until the U.S.-led invasion after the 9/11 attacks. President Trump has made no moves either to close or grow the population of Guantanamo. Rear Admiral Ring told NBC he believes he could deal with 40 more detainees with his current staffing levels, and up to 160 more with more resources. But that would require Congress to approve those millions of dollars in funding. Jason?",

It took two full days for them to even admit they made a mistake, adding an editor's note yesterday that said, in part, \"The article was correct but on December 26th the situation had changed.

You're pouring tens of thousands of dollars into this. But you are nervous, you're excited at the same time. And then you get a call, and they call you about a new class that they're going to take. It's called \"Trump- aganda, The War on Facts, Press and Democracy.\" What in the world? This is what they are teaching our children in college. There are so many more politically biased courses that were taught this year. Joining us now is Lawrence Jones, editor in chief of Campus Reform and a FOX News contributor, and David Burstein, progressive commentator and founder of Run for America. Now, campus reform has come up with a list of the most egregious politically biased courses of 2018. It's pretty out there. I just told you about the Trump-aganda course at the University of Illinois. I thought they were a respected university, but come on. There's also a Harvard Law, Harvard Law class called \"The Trump Trajectory\" about impeachment in the Trump era. Maybe you can get a two-for-one deal at Harvard. They are all about discounting their stuff, because they have another course on how to push back against Trump strategies. And at San Diego State University has a class called \"Trump Impeachment, Removal, or Conviction?\" At the low, low price, in addition of course to the tuition that you have to pay, $221. And finally, the University of Southern Maine offered a credit to students willing to protest Brett Kavanaugh in Washington, D.C. This is where your tax dollars are going to work in funding those. Gentlemen, I appreciate you coming here. David, when you look at that list that was coming out, come on, how can conservatives and right-minded people look at that and say, this is perfectly -- this is what we should be educating our kids on?",

And the bottom line is, if you are conservatives, you are not really welcome on the college campus. We've seen our kids with their prolife signs, they get beat up. We've had professors, just because they don't like their political leanings, they take their phones from them, crash their phones just because they are videotaping them.

Investigators say more arrests could come in connection with the murder of a California policeman on Christmas night. Today, after a two-day long manhunt, police arresting Gustavo Perez Arriaga, an illegal immigrant who should have been on ICE's radar with his two prior DUI arrest but wasn't because of the state's absurd sanctuary laws.

The idea behind - and first of all, I'm not against lawful, legal immigration to this community. We're a community, an agricultural community with a large population that serves in that economy. The idea behind this policy, these laws, was because there is a belief that people who don't trust law enforcement, and they won't come forward to tell us about being a victim of crime because they're afraid of that we will deport them. Absolutely not true. Local law enforcement doesn't engage in the enforcement of federal immigration law. But by doing this, you've now created sanctuary for criminals, people who are here illegally, victimizing and exploiting others. And there is a category of crimes that below a certain threshold - so anything serious or violent, we can communicate. Anything below that, like DUI, we're prohibited statutorily from communicating with our law enforcement partners, with ICE."

That is all something that is a story created by others. ICE is looking for fugitives and criminals. That's all they're doing. It used to be that they could come into my jail and collect or take possession of people who fell into that category who were fugitives and wanted. SB 54, in essence, restricted the ability to some degree of ICE even having access to our facility. So we need to have a dialogue. We need to have a conversation. And I hope that the death of Officer Singh, who was needlessly and tragically gunned down, that his death is not in vain. If anything, hopefully this has a positive message and we can sit down and talk about some of these policies that restrict law enforcement's ability, our ability, to effectively protect our communities."

And once we deport them through Laredo, they come right back into the United States. And as border patrol agents, we try to arrest as many as we can. But we are not going to be able to arrest everybody. That's why we need those physical barriers. That's why we need that infrastructure and that additional manpower.

And now they're coming across asking for asylum, which they're not even legitimate claims, and now they're going to be committing crimes here in the United States. That's one aspect of it.

And so that, for us, was only - I think there's only 12 officers. And so - this is really a tragedy for the valley here, the big San Joaquin Valley, which is the Ag region. I know you've been here many times, not exactly the way that we want to spend our holidays. So, right before Christmas, we had a very similar situation where there was someone who was in the country illegally, had actually been deported twice, had been arrested just prior and then was released. Because of the sanctuary city law, the Sheriff couldn't hold this Garcia - Mr. Garcia, who went on a rampage for over 24 hours, killed two people, possibly a third. We don't know because I think there is one still in critical condition in the hospital because this person - this Garcia went around the entire county, several communities and was shooting people at random, stealing vehicles, and finally caused a major traffic accident and the car exploded. And he is now no longer a part of the planet here. But the bad part is that there are two innocents that lost their lives, just like what we experienced in the last couple days just north of here, in Newman, where you had a police officer that was killed. And it's just a horrible situation. And you asked me what can be done. I mean, the sad part is that in the last election in California, these policies were rewarded at the ballot box. So the Democrats who condone these policies had probably their biggest election win ever. And so something is not making sense. I don't know if people just aren't getting the right information that you would think that at some point politicians would be held accountable for their actions or inactions. And in this case, it's pretty darn clear that these sanctuary city policies are leading to innocent people getting murdered."

He had been deported twice, and still he's in the hands of law enforcement, but no communication, and he's able to come across the border.

And so the key here is that what we've been trying to do in Congress and what the President has been trying to do, I think a very logical solution, which is, OK, let's take the areas where we have some fencing that isn't quite working. Let's build a wall, one that actually works, in those populated areas. Let's make sure we get those secure, first. Then other areas you may not need a wall or fencing. But then at the same time the president was very reasonable and was willing to solve the DACA problem. We had a vote in Congress where Republicans actually voted to build a wall and reform DACA, take care of the kids that were brought here with no part of their own. We didn't get one Democratic vote. Every Democrat in the state of California voted against this law. Those are for the young people who live here who would have been made legal, but for some reason people here in California and I think all over the country don't realize what a sensible solution was put on the table -- border security, taking care of DACA, putting in a permit system for people to work here that are doing jobs that aren't going to be filled for Americans, very sensible solutions just aren't being communicated I think to the people, and I think the people are making some uninformed decisions."

The progress includes 9,000 new border patrol field agents in the last four years, construction of a 630-mile border fence, or 630 miles of border fence, that create a significant barrier to illegal immigration on a southern land border."

You have President Trump sitting in Washington, D.C., waiting to cut a deal, and they are off on vacation. Look, they never wanted to do a deal. They wanted the government to shut down. The second that Donald Trump said, well, look, I'll own the shutdown, or fine, I'll shut it down, they were like, OK, that's it, we'll get out of town, go to Hawaii. You watch on January 3rd when there's a new Congress, they're going to try to pass something, and this is just going to continue. And in the meantime, problems are not being solved.

      "utterance": "Good evening again, Jason. The NBC report is based on an interview with the U.S. commander at Guantanamo Bay, Rear Admiral John Ring, who says he has orders from the Pentagon to prepare for the camp to be open for another 25 years. The joint task force Guantanamo mission is now 16 years old, and according to Ring, the infra structure of the military prison is failing fast. \"It's sort of falling to the ground and deteriorating rapidly,\" he told NBC News. Forty detainees are now left at Guantanamo, the last transfer there in 2008, so they can no longer provide any useful battlefield intelligence according to the rear admiral. The average age now is 46. The oldest is 71, meaning medical needs are changing and becoming more demanding as the detainees age, and Ring, according to NBC, is worried that he doesn't have the funding to provide the necessary care. He told NBC, quote, \"I'm the innkeeper. I don't make laws. People in D.C. tell me when people are going away, when people may be coming in, and my job is to keep these folks comfortable, safe.\" President Obama, of course, wanted to shut down the facility. He failed in that pledge, partly because of politics, partly because of the practicalities of finding a place to rehouse the detainees who numbered more than 200 when President Obama took office. Five members of the Afghan Taliban were released by President Obama in 2014 in exchange for captured U.S. Army Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl. Those five have now joined what the Taliban calls its political office in the Gulf state of Qatar and are therefore among the Taliban representatives negotiating for peace in Afghanistan. That's despite warnings from some analysts that as members of the Taliban's old guard, they bring with them the same ultraconservative interpretation of Islam that characterized the Taliban's five-year rule of Afghanistan and provided shelter and a place to train for Al Qaeda until the U.S.-led invasion after the 9/11 attacks. President Trump has made no moves either to close or grow the population of Guantanamo. Rear Admiral Ring told NBC he believes he could deal with 40 more detainees with his current staffing levels, and up to 160 more with more resources. But that would require Congress to approve those millions of dollars in funding. Jason?"

Joining me now is Dan Bongino, a former Secret Service agent and host of \"The Dan Bongino Show\" podcast, and Ari Aramesh, a foreign policy and national security analyst. Gentlemen, thank you so much for being here. I've been to Guantanamo Bay, I have seen it. I was a little concerned about what the admiral said when he was talking about need to make sure that everybody is comfortable. I don't think that is necessarily the number one issue, but these are not prisoners, they are detainees. But Aria, what is wrong with Guantanamo Bay? I fought against Barack Obama and his insistence that we close it. I'm glad it's open. But what say you?"

      "speaker": "ARI ARAMESH, NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST",
      "utterance": "So here is what is happening. You have a facility in Cuba that's housed a number of battleground detainees brought in from mainly Afghanistan. These are guys that we picked up on the ground after 9/11. The last detainee came here in 2008. Now, as you heard in the report, this is now turning into a nursing home. Camp seven, for instance, this facility is just a mess. There is no room for wheelchairs and so on and so forth. So the question is this. We can either sit here and complain and complain and complain, or our commander- in-chief can make a decision, either to fund as the admiral asked for, or, bring these guys out, put them on trial, send them to federal prisons, and, guess what? Not even one person, people in national security circles cannot even recall a single name from these unknown, forgotten, crazy detainees, meaning if John Gotti couldn't run away from federal prison, I don't think these irrelevant old terrorists can do that either. But having said that, this have provided a lot of ammunition to terrorists and to radicals."

    {
      "speaker": "DAN BONGINO, FORMER SECRET SERVICE AGENT",
      "utterance": "Jason, there are two separate issues here. The first issue the admiral brings up is a real one. Listen, if we are going to use Guantanamo, which I think is a perfectly viable, usable facility, then it should be secure, and we can't have breaking infrastructure there. Fine. That's one issue. Point stipulated, right. But with regards to the medical care and comfort, I don't get it. I don't care. That may sound harsh, Jason. I'm sorry, I don't mean to offend the cable news audience. But I literally, not figuratively, do not care a bit about the health or comfort of terrorists committed to the destruction of the United States and the murder of innocents. We have millions of people in this country who need back surgery, who need joint replacements, who need kidney replacements. Money is zero-sum. Every dollar we send over there to take care of a murderer terrorist is a dollar taken out of the health care system here that could be used to take care of a kid or take care of someone elderly who has outlived their own fund. This is an outrageous argument."

If they said they have a plumbing issue in camp seven, OK, they have to deal with that. I do think Congress should fund it, but we'll continue the discussion. I've got to get your thoughts on another story from NBC. The network is also under fire this week for a Christmas Day story. The headline reading, quote, \"Trump becomes the first president since 2002 not to visit troops in Christmas time.\" The problem is the president was on his way to Iraq at the time it was published, and even after it was made public he was there visiting with troops, NBC still didn't change the headline. It took two full days for them to even admit they made a mistake, adding an editor's note yesterday that said, in part, \"The article was correct but on December 26th the situation had changed. As a result, the threat of this article is no longer correct, even if it was at the time.\" Instead, NBC could have taken down the article, they could have changed it. They waited a few days, they wanted the maximum impact. But Dan, I have got to tell you, the president has taken all kind of heat for doing something that everybody hoped he would do, which was visit the troops."

Now, what most people don't know, and I wouldn't expect anyone to know this, you haven't done that job specifically, you probably know it having been in Congress, these trips, Congressman, are planned out weeks if not months in advance. So it's really ridiculous about the crap media and their absolute lack of ethics in this story is while they were writing that story, while some lunatic was typing that thing up, the trip was already being planned over to a warzone. The media, nobody takes them seriously."

      "utterance": "Picture this. Your newly independent son or daughter is off to college. You are so proud they are going to get a great education. You're pouring tens of thousands of dollars into this. But you are nervous, you're excited at the same time. And then you get a call, and they call you about a new class that they're going to take. It's called \"Trump- aganda, The War on Facts, Press and Democracy.\" What in the world? This is what they are teaching our children in college. There are so many more politically biased courses that were taught this year. Joining us now is Lawrence Jones, editor in chief of Campus Reform and a FOX News contributor, and David Burstein, progressive commentator and founder of Run for America. Now, campus reform has come up with a list of the most egregious politically biased courses of 2018. It's pretty out there. I just told you about the Trump-aganda course at the University of Illinois. I thought they were a respected university, but come on. There's also a Harvard Law, Harvard Law class called \"The Trump Trajectory\" about impeachment in the Trump era. Maybe you can get a two-for-one deal at Harvard. They are all about discounting their stuff, because they have another course on how to push back against Trump strategies. And at San Diego State University has a class called \"Trump Impeachment, Removal, or Conviction?\" At the low, low price, in addition of course to the tuition that you have to pay, $221. And finally, the University of Southern Maine offered a credit to students willing to protest Brett Kavanaugh in Washington, D.C. This is where your tax dollars are going to work in funding those. Gentlemen, I appreciate you coming here. David, when you look at that list that was coming out, come on, how can conservatives and right-minded people look at that and say, this is perfectly -- this is what we should be educating our kids on?"

      "speaker": "DAVID BURSTEIN, PROGRESSIVE COMMENTATOR",
      "utterance": "I think there are lots of interesting questions being raised and discussed on this network and others every night about the Constitution, and they should be discussed in college campuses. But, to have such an anti-Trump bias in these courses is less about where we are politically. It's more about the importance of giving children an openminded conversation. I think that the reality is that these kinds of courses are probably not the best way to help kids actually figure out how to coexist in a peaceful, deliberative democracy, even though there are plenty of issues that could be discussed in a more civil fashion."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "LAWRENCE JONES, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, CAMPUS REFORM",
      "utterance": "Well, you can't have an openminded conversation when you have a liberal bias on the college campus, which is what we cover at Campus Reform, where you saw all these courses, every single day we get pitches from students that are telling us the bias, the hate for conservatives that are on the college campuses. And the bottom line is, if you are conservatives, you are not really welcome on the college campus. We've seen our kids with their prolife signs, they get beat up. We've had professors, just because they don't like their political leanings, they take their phones from them, crash their phones just because they are videotaping them. This is a college campus that does not respect the First Amendment. They are against freedom of speech. If you are a conservative speaker you can't go on the college campuses or you have to pay $50,000 in speaking fees. The battle of today, whether you're talking about what happened to Brett Kavanaugh when they were anti-due process, all these battles start on the leftist college campuses."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BURSTEIN",
      "utterance": "And this is really important also because this is the time at which people's minds are being formed. So while I may be sympathetic to some of the material that is in these courses, and I may agree with the perspectives of these professors, I think there's something really important about how we educate children, and the importance of making sure -- because what we see in our political dialogue today all starts here. Where do college students grew up. We are taking these classes they grow up to be in organized politics."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHAFFETZ",
      "utterance": "But the beef that I have is that there is no balance, and we are supposed to be teaching kids how to think. And that's not what's happening. You're not teaching them how to think when you're giving them course credit to go down and protest the Brett Kavanaugh hearings and get course credit for it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BURSTEIN",
      "utterance": "I think on that point you are absolutely correct, because the reality is, people can protest all they want, it's part of people's right in this country, but to give people college credit for doing that --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JONES",
      "utterance": "And they lie about it. The university, they lied about it. They tried to pretend that it was just only one professor. When we did the investigation, we found that the president of the university knew about it, the faculty chair knew. They had funding coming in from leftwing think groups to fund the bus. This is a strategic method of the left, and another reason, Jason, that we don't see a lot of the conservative ideology being taught on the college campuses is because they don't want conservative professors there as well. Make no mistake. I don't care if there's liberal professors on the college campuses, but the job of college professors is to have the dialogue, to teach them both sides, and then allow the students to make a decision on where they stand on the political aisle. But we can't do that if we only have one perspective."

There is a rigorous plan on going and looking at these college courses that come up. These don't happen by accident. They aren't necessarily spontaneous. And I guess the rub that I have is there are federal dollars going into many of these universities."

      "speaker": "BURSTEIN",
