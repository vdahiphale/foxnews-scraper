And this was a budget vote, of course, which is going to set us up to do reconciliation, so we can surpass the -- we don't have to comply with the 60-vote rule and we can pass tax reform with a simple majority.  That being said, the tax reform package eliminating the state and local tax deduction, which is something critically important to my region in Upstate New York, is something that needs to be added back in or at least reformed, or we need some kind of compromise on it, to make this tax reform real for us. My taxpayers are at the mercy of the tax-and-spend liberals, people like Governor Cuomo in Albany and Chuck Schumer. They're the ones who have raised the taxes, put New York in a crisis and made it such an issue for us.  Normally, the state and local tax deduction would be something you would think about for itemizers, people who are in the higher income brackets, but because our taxes, our state and local taxes are so onerous, ours -- it actually dips into the middle-income families. And something like 30 percent of the Americans are actually using the -- are itemizing and using this deduction. And in my district alone, over 62,000 filers are actually taking advantage of the state and local deduction.",
