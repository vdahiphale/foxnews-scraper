They're going after Americans. And what Americans are they going after? Any one of you that spends $28 in one single day. If you go to Starbucks, if you simply put three gallons into gas in your car, and you go through a drive-thru, maybe you get a dollar meal at McDonald's, IRS is coming for you. You're proud of that fact that's what you held the CBO up for, how much money can we get from Americans by auditing them. You know what you just provided? Who you're auditing? You're auditing 1.2 million more Americans. You're breeding this bill on the premise that you don't trust Americans. And you know what Americans you're going after? One half of those 1.2 million are people who earn $75,000 or less. That's what you're trying to pay this bill from. House is not in order, Mr. Speaker.",

Democrats, they're desperately searching for a way to remove Joe and Kamala from the ticket in 2024. They're at each other's throats, as a civil war going on between the president and the vice president. The very latest details are straight ahead tonight. But first, we do turn to, once again, Kenosha, Wisconsin, where after hours now of deliberation, there is still no verdict in the trial of Kyle Rittenhouse. It is not clear what kind of progress the jury is making. Speculation is fruitless. But last night, there was a serious development outside of the courthouse. A van transporting the jury was aggressively tailed by a freelance producer working for NBC News. At one point, the producer ran a red light in order to keep pace with that van after getting pulled over for several traffic violations. He claimed that he was told under the direction of a New York- based MSDNC producer to do this, follow the van with the jurors in it. Kenosha police suspect this person was trying to photograph the jurors which, of course, would be an egregious offense and danger to the jurors themselves. In fact, following or stalking or intimidating anybody on a jury for any reason is a major problem with serious real legal ramifications. MSDNC, they have been banished now from the courtroom.

Well, the driver said he was told to do this. But do they really, the driver directly implicated a New York producer. And their coverage of the Kyle Rittenhouse trial has been unethical at best, definitely not benefiting of actual real news organization. Look at liberal Joe Scarborough, once claiming that Rittenhouse crossed state lines with an AR-15 and just started shooting people up. At one point, he called Rittenhouse a self-appointed militia member, who unloaded 60 rounds. Many lies were told by the media mob, many other MSDNC employees openly referring to Kyle Rittenhouse as a white supremacist or vigilante, no evidence whatsoever. Joy Reid triggered by what she called Kyle's white male tears and she works at NBC News. Now, they also at NBC falsely reported that Rittenhouse flashed a white power hand sign after being released on bail. And another NBC headline reads, quote, if convicted, he'll become a right-wing martyr. If he's freed, it's a message to others like him that prison won't be in their future. At NBC News, there is no presumption of innocence, no due process for Kyle Rittenhouse, no rule of law, no equal justice under the law, no equal application of our laws. Facts, eyewitnesses, their accounts, video evidence, none of that matters to NBC. It's always the same thing. The political narrative is way more important and rushing to judgment. Take a look.",

Ultimately, no matter what, MSDNC says about motive and white male tears, the law in Wisconsin is clear. An individual may use deadly force if he or she, quote, reasonably believes that such force is necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm to himself or herself. Now, based on my observation of the evidence, it is more than reasonable to believe that Kyle Rittenhouse faced imminent death or great bodily harm from Joseph Rosenbaum for example after it was Rosenbaum -- yeah, he's the one that was convicted of molesting five kids, vowed to bleeping kill Rittenhouse and proceeded to chase him, corner him and lunge for his gun. It was more than reasonable to believe that Kyle Rittenhouse faced imminent death or great bodily harm when a violent group of rioters, remember, they chased him as he was running away knocked him to the ground were attempting at that moment to stomp his face right into the pavement and attempting to grab his gun. And ultimately pointed -- another guy pointed a loaded gun in his face before Kyle took to self-defense. This is a clear-cut case of self-defense and again, I'm not on the jury. They will ultimately make the final decision but no matter what happens in this case, NBC News, the rest of the mob in the media, they all should be ashamed of themselves and every year somehow their credibility gets worse and worse and worse. They've been wrong on every single solitary case. The same people that lied for three long years about Trump, Russia, collusion, the dirty Russian disinformation dossier that Hillary Clinton paid for. They didn't care at all about lying to a FISA court when it says a affirmed affidavit, it never was because of course nothing was verifiable, says at the top of a FISA application, verified. No, it's not verified, it's been debunked, and they won't admit to the error and the lies and the conspiracy theories and the hoax they perpetrated on you the American people. By the way, they got it wrong on Nicholas Sandmann. They got it wrong on Ferguson, Missouri. They got it wrong with Freddie Gray in Baltimore. They got it wrong with the Cambridge police. They get it wrong with UVA. They get it wrong with Duke Lacrosse. They always get it wrong because they always rush to judgment and they have no evidence no facts and they allow for no due process. Here with reaction, FOX News contributors, Ari Fleischer, Joe Concha. Let's look at it from a media standpoint, Ari, they are so reckless and irresponsible and so wrong so often. I mean, I actually have to tip my hat to \"The Washington Post\" for at least admitting, yeah, our reporting on the Steele dossier was wrong.

And for MSNBC to follow that jury van the bus and had any suggestion that we were trying to figure out who the jurors are for the purpose of publicizing who those jurors are is exactly what contributes to people going after jurors. This is the type of violence in the streets, insurrection against the court if you will, that we need to prevent. And NBC doesn't have a story straight. The person they detained in Kenosha said that he was told by a supervisor to follow the bus. NBC in New York is trying to distance themselves from this calling him a freelancer. Well, producers are aggressive people, I know them. Their job is to make news, report the news. It's inconceivable that he was following the bus for just the fun of it.

And take away please just for a moment, Republican, Democrat, or conservative, liberal, or sane or insane, and apply the fleeting foreign concept called common sense to the situation. NBC to your point earlier has already declared Rittenhouse not only guilty, but a racist, actually expects you to believe that a producer was not following that jury van. He just happened to be right behind it and then just decided to run a red light. Why? What was the sense of urgency? Unless you're a producer doing exactly what you're instructed to do, photograph the jury. And oh by the way, this -- the person that instructed this producer according to the producer in this case to follow the jury, she has nuked her social media accounts, which means if there was no wrongdoing here this person wouldn't be running and hiding. NBC claims the producer wasn't photographing the van, but that's besides the point even. Just because following the bus alone is a whole bull of wrong because if jurors believed that they're being followed, they might feel intimidated. They may feel hesitant to vote the way they truly want to. This is a journalistic atrocity. And for anyone involved, they need to be fired just for starters. This is the same network, by the way, let's remember, that leaked and it was intentional the infamous Trump \"Access Hollywood\" tape two days before a major presidential debate in 2016 to \"The Washington Post\" and tried to sway a presidential election in the process. That's not journalism. It's activism. And it's why a solid majority of Americans feel journalists purposely push information they know to be fake or false. That's per an Axios poll. It's no longer about intent. It's about malice and it's patently insidious, Sean.",

It is in violation of the judicial order and it is well- established in our courts that photographing jurors like this against a judicial order is witness or, excuse me, jury tampering, jury intimidation. But frankly, it's no surprise that this comes from MSNBC, which has convicted Kyle Rittenhouse in the court of public opinion from the outset. They have been hostile to his defense of self-defense. They portrayed him as a white supremacist. They've outright declared on the air that he's a domestic terrorist, the equivalent of a mass murderer, led by Joy Reid and her racist rants against Kyle Rittenhouse. She sounds very much like a racist herself who sees everything through the myopic lens of racism. So the judge was correct in banning MSNBC from the courthouse. But on top of this, I worry deeply about all the protesters chanting outside on the courthouse steps and it be heard in the courtroom \"no justice, no peace\", the \"no peace\" part is meant to say if you don't convict we're going to burn and pillage your city the same way we did months ago.

This is the opposite of what happened 100 years ago. A hundred years ago in the South, you had white ministers screaming and yelling. You had media screaming and yelling, demanding conviction of black people for looking at white people or mistreating white people. Today, we have the exact opposite of that. You get a lead op-ed in \"The New York Times\" today where Charles Blow who was an overt racist talks about white defense and he lists all the white defendants. And he puts them all together, Rittenhouse and then he puts you know political people in the same group because they're white. It's overt racism and it sends a terrible message to the jury that you better convict, you better do what these folks outside want you to do or they will be unrest.

Earlier today here at civic center park where I'm standing to see the courthouse directly behind me, a man was taken into custody. He had his firearm along his side. He was roughly within a thousand feet of a school here in the local area, and the police -- the Kenosha police took him into custody. We didn't see the scuffles that we saw yesterday, but because of the incidents that happened yesterday, five schools in the local area decided that they would shut down and go virtual for the rest of the week, as we enter the fourth day of deliberations. I can tell you this, Sean, you know, as the tensions are high here, people are just hoping that maybe they can mitigate any kind of violence or anything that they saw last year here.

That by the way, we are now learning is not in fact fully paid for, as Joe has repeatedly been claiming. It'll cost you zero, cost zero. Kamala Harris, it'll cost zero, zero, zero dollars, that's what they keep saying. Well, now, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which Joe Biden didn't want to hear from, they're now estimating that this bill will increase the budget deficit by almost $370 billion over years. That is a lot more than zero. Maybe somebody can tell Joe it's time to throw away that old abacus of his and maybe buy him a calculator for Christmas. And here now with the full report, live from Capitol Hill, is our very own Chad Pergram. And a lot of passion from Kevin McCarthy tonight. What's the latest? When do we expect this vote?",

Our latest FOX News poll just out tonight showing Biden with just a 44 percent approval rating -- by the way, another poll came out with him only at 36 percent. We have a majority of Americans disapproving of the job that he's doing. An earlier poll from Quinnipiac as I just mentioned had him at 36 percent, and only a measly 24 percent of voters in this country say they want Joe Biden to run for another term. And the FOX poll, Biden is underwater and every major issue facing this country. A full majority of voters disapprove of his handling of the economy, immigration, the threat from China, the withdrawal from Afghanistan, and I would add energy to that list if that was polled. And get this -- it's even worse for Vice President Harris. She has a 40 percent approval rating. But, of course, last week, it was a whopping low 28 percent.

They're going after Americans. And what Americans are they going after? Any one of you that spends $28 in one single day. If you go to Starbucks, if you simply put three gallons into gas in your car, and you go through a drive-thru, maybe you get a dollar meal at McDonald's, IRS is coming for you. You're proud of that fact that's what you held the CBO up for, how much money can we get from Americans by auditing them. You know what you just provided? Who you're auditing? You're auditing 1.2 million more Americans. You're breeding this bill on the premise that you don't trust Americans. And you know what Americans you're going after?

Biden's poll numbers continue to just plummet, half of America believes that Joe is what we've been telling you - - a complete cognitive mess -- confirmed by yesterday's poll. Democrats, they're desperately searching for a way to remove Joe and Kamala from the ticket in 2024. They're at each other's throats, as a civil war going on between the president and the vice president. The very latest details are straight ahead tonight. But first, we do turn to, once again, Kenosha, Wisconsin, where after hours now of deliberation, there is still no verdict in the trial of Kyle Rittenhouse. It is not clear what kind of progress the jury is making. Speculation is fruitless. But last night, there was a serious development outside of the courthouse. A van transporting the jury was aggressively tailed by a freelance producer working for NBC News. At one point, the producer ran a red light in order to keep pace with that van after getting pulled over for several traffic violations. He claimed that he was told under the direction of a New York- based MSDNC producer to do this, follow the van with the jurors in it. Kenosha police suspect this person was trying to photograph the jurors which, of course, would be an egregious offense and danger to the jurors themselves. In fact, following or stalking or intimidating anybody on a jury for any reason is a major problem with serious real legal ramifications. MSDNC, they have been banished now from the courtroom. Take a look."

Well, the driver said he was told to do this. But do they really, the driver directly implicated a New York producer. And their coverage of the Kyle Rittenhouse trial has been unethical at best, definitely not benefiting of actual real news organization. Look at liberal Joe Scarborough, once claiming that Rittenhouse crossed state lines with an AR-15 and just started shooting people up. At one point, he called Rittenhouse a self-appointed militia member, who unloaded 60 rounds. Many lies were told by the media mob, many other MSDNC employees openly referring to Kyle Rittenhouse as a white supremacist or vigilante, no evidence whatsoever. Joy Reid triggered by what she called Kyle's white male tears and she works at NBC News. Now, they also at NBC falsely reported that Rittenhouse flashed a white power hand sign after being released on bail. And another NBC headline reads, quote, if convicted, he'll become a right-wing martyr. If he's freed, it's a message to others like him that prison won't be in their future. At NBC News, there is no presumption of innocence, no due process for Kyle Rittenhouse, no rule of law, no equal justice under the law, no equal application of our laws. Facts, eyewitnesses, their accounts, video evidence, none of that matters to NBC. It's always the same thing. The political narrative is way more important and rushing to judgment. Take a look."

Ultimately, no matter what, MSDNC says about motive and white male tears, the law in Wisconsin is clear. An individual may use deadly force if he or she, quote, reasonably believes that such force is necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm to himself or herself. Now, based on my observation of the evidence, it is more than reasonable to believe that Kyle Rittenhouse faced imminent death or great bodily harm from Joseph Rosenbaum for example after it was Rosenbaum -- yeah, he's the one that was convicted of molesting five kids, vowed to bleeping kill Rittenhouse and proceeded to chase him, corner him and lunge for his gun. It was more than reasonable to believe that Kyle Rittenhouse faced imminent death or great bodily harm when a violent group of rioters, remember, they chased him as he was running away knocked him to the ground were attempting at that moment to stomp his face right into the pavement and attempting to grab his gun. And ultimately pointed -- another guy pointed a loaded gun in his face before Kyle took to self-defense. This is a clear-cut case of self-defense and again, I'm not on the jury. They will ultimately make the final decision but no matter what happens in this case, NBC News, the rest of the mob in the media, they all should be ashamed of themselves and every year somehow their credibility gets worse and worse and worse. They've been wrong on every single solitary case. The same people that lied for three long years about Trump, Russia, collusion, the dirty Russian disinformation dossier that Hillary Clinton paid for. They didn't care at all about lying to a FISA court when it says a affirmed affidavit, it never was because of course nothing was verifiable, says at the top of a FISA application, verified. No, it's not verified, it's been debunked, and they won't admit to the error and the lies and the conspiracy theories and the hoax they perpetrated on you the American people. By the way, they got it wrong on Nicholas Sandmann. They got it wrong on Ferguson, Missouri. They got it wrong with Freddie Gray in Baltimore. They got it wrong with the Cambridge police. They get it wrong with UVA. They get it wrong with Duke Lacrosse. They always get it wrong because they always rush to judgment and they have no evidence no facts and they allow for no due process. Here with reaction, FOX News contributors, Ari Fleischer, Joe Concha. Let's look at it from a media standpoint, Ari, they are so reckless and irresponsible and so wrong so often. I mean, I actually have to tip my hat to \"The Washington Post\" for at least admitting, yeah, our reporting on the Steele dossier was wrong.

But, Sean, you know what's happening now in Kenosha, if there is ever a time for the media of every stripe to tone things down instead of stir things up, it's on the eve of a major verdict like this. And for MSNBC to follow that jury van the bus and had any suggestion that we were trying to figure out who the jurors are for the purpose of publicizing who those jurors are is exactly what contributes to people going after jurors. This is the type of violence in the streets, insurrection against the court if you will, that we need to prevent. And NBC doesn't have a story straight. The person they detained in Kenosha said that he was told by a supervisor to follow the bus. NBC in New York is trying to distance themselves from this calling him a freelancer. Well, producers are aggressive people, I know them. Their job is to make news, report the news. It's inconceivable that he was following the bus for just the fun of it. He was going there for the purpose of reporting and NBC just explained what that meant and he needs to talk and talk publicly."

      "utterance": "I want to jump on what Ari just said because NBC's attempt to explain this away as far as following that jury van it is about the best unintentional comedy out there. And take away please just for a moment, Republican, Democrat, or conservative, liberal, or sane or insane, and apply the fleeting foreign concept called common sense to the situation. NBC to your point earlier has already declared Rittenhouse not only guilty, but a racist, actually expects you to believe that a producer was not following that jury van. He just happened to be right behind it and then just decided to run a red light. Why? What was the sense of urgency? Unless you're a producer doing exactly what you're instructed to do, photograph the jury. And oh by the way, this -- the person that instructed this producer according to the producer in this case to follow the jury, she has nuked her social media accounts, which means if there was no wrongdoing here this person wouldn't be running and hiding. NBC claims the producer wasn't photographing the van, but that's besides the point even. Just because following the bus alone is a whole bull of wrong because if jurors believed that they're being followed, they might feel intimidated. They may feel hesitant to vote the way they truly want to. This is a journalistic atrocity. And for anyone involved, they need to be fired just for starters. This is the same network, by the way, let's remember, that leaked and it was intentional the infamous Trump \"Access Hollywood\" tape two days before a major presidential debate in 2016 to \"The Washington Post\" and tried to sway a presidential election in the process. That's not journalism. It's activism. And it's why a solid majority of Americans feel journalists purposely push information they know to be fake or false. That's per an Axios poll. It's no longer about intent. It's about malice and it's patently insidious, Sean."

Ari Fleischer, Joe Concha, as always, thank you. Joining us now with more reaction, author of \"The Case for Vaccine Mandates,\" Alan Dershowitz, FOX News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett. Between that, Gregg, and the Rittenhouse prosecution withholding that video evidence, the higher quality, the higher resolution we now have outstanding two motions by the defense for mistrial. One with prejudice, one without prejudice. I believe they're both real -- both of you I think agree with me. But now you have this new incident with this media company. This is beyond disgraceful and intimidating."

      "utterance": "It is and, you know, it's impossible to overstate just how stupid this action was by the MSNBC producer. It is in violation of the judicial order and it is well- established in our courts that photographing jurors like this against a judicial order is witness or, excuse me, jury tampering, jury intimidation. But frankly, it's no surprise that this comes from MSNBC, which has convicted Kyle Rittenhouse in the court of public opinion from the outset. They have been hostile to his defense of self-defense. They portrayed him as a white supremacist. They've outright declared on the air that he's a domestic terrorist, the equivalent of a mass murderer, led by Joy Reid and her racist rants against Kyle Rittenhouse. She sounds very much like a racist herself who sees everything through the myopic lens of racism. So the judge was correct in banning MSNBC from the courthouse. But on top of this, I worry deeply about all the protesters chanting outside on the courthouse steps and it be heard in the courtroom \"no justice, no peace\", the \"no peace\" part is meant to say if you don't convict we're going to burn and pillage your city the same way we did months ago. That too is jury intimidation."

I've got to believe they're not sequestered that they -- well, first of all, we know they're keenly aware of what led up to this incident they are keenly aware that the entire country is watching this case. The amount of pressure that they're feeling. And then to be chased by the media than to hear the chanting outside, it is daunting but more importantly, it is intimidating just like if the average person that doesn't do TV regularly comes on TV, usually, the first time they're going to be scared to death, I bet you people that are trying to do their constitutional duty are pretty frightened right now and intimidated."

The jury saw themselves being followed and that just adds to the intimidation that they're aware of outside the courtroom. This has become a trend. This is the opposite of what happened 100 years ago. A hundred years ago in the South, you had white ministers screaming and yelling. You had media screaming and yelling, demanding conviction of black people for looking at white people or mistreating white people. Today, we have the exact opposite of that. You get a lead op-ed in \"The New York Times\" today where Charles Blow who was an overt racist talks about white defense and he lists all the white defendants. And he puts them all together, Rittenhouse and then he puts you know political people in the same group because they're white. It's overt racism and it sends a terrible message to the jury that you better convict, you better do what these folks outside want you to do or they will be unrest. People remember what Maxine Waters said. People remember what others have said. And you know just going down South for a minute and going to that Georgia case where you have --"

But they promised they would not assist the Democrats since they've been out of the process of doing this bill from the very beginning. Thank you, Chad. Now, tonight is Joe Biden and the Democrats try and force this country down this path to radical socialism, Americans, they are now letting it be known that they do not approve. Our latest FOX News poll just out tonight showing Biden with just a 44 percent approval rating -- by the way, another poll came out with him only at 36 percent. We have a majority of Americans disapproving of the job that he's doing. An earlier poll from Quinnipiac as I just mentioned had him at 36 percent, and only a measly 24 percent of voters in this country say they want Joe Biden to run for another term. And the FOX poll, Biden is underwater and every major issue facing this country. A full majority of voters disapprove of his handling of the economy, immigration, the threat from China, the withdrawal from Afghanistan, and I would add energy to that list if that was polled. And get this -- it's even worse for Vice President Harris. She has a 40 percent approval rating. But, of course, last week, it was a whopping low 28 percent. It's so bad, she is now being openly asked if she feels useful around the White House anymore. Listen to this."

And to make matters worse, we just learned today, Harris communications director will be leaving her job next month, maybe she was the one responsible I guess for hiring those child actors because that turned out to be a disaster also. I guess the vice president is just too hard to defend. Here with reaction, not one but two former White House chiefs of staff to President Donald Trump, Mark Meadows, Reince Priebus. Reince, you were first. We'll give you first crack at it, but I can't think of a single successful issue for them. This bill is not accepted by the American people. If they force it through the Senate, I don't see Manchin and Sinema going along in the Senate. They pass it through in the House."

Biden had no power over his own party. The second thing was as Kevin McCarthy was pointing out, they were warned about this inflation issue. They were warned by people like Democrats Larry Summers and other Obama people, Jason Furman, Stephen Ratner, and the reality is as you pointed out -- unemployment's a bad deal, but inflation affects a hundred percent of us. And we know that people across the country are feeling this everywhere. Gas is more expensive. Thanksgiving dinner is going to be more expensive next week. The grocery store shelves are empty, at least some of them are if you can find the actual ingredients by the way. Restaurants have limited hours. It's taking months for people to get their cars fixed. So, look, unfortunately, it's sort of a sinking ship but we're all on this ship together. So, now, we have to figure out how to how to how to get our country back on track."

So I would assume she's confident she thinks she will get this bill passed in the House, but it's pretty meaningless because I think Joe Manchin and Kristen Sinema are going to put their signatures and their fingerprints all over the bill in the Senate, and it's going to be a very different bill if one at all."

They wouldn't have brought it this far, and the moderates, they were already falling all over themselves when they got the CBO score that actually you're right adds to the deficit. But it's even worse than that. Some of the math that they have, they're actually giving credit for policies that they're reversing that actually haven't been even put into place yet. So it could be a another $200 billion to $300 billion worse than the CBO score. But here's the answer -- Joe Biden thinks the answer to everything is to hire more IRS agents. You know, when we look at it, only 60 percent -- if you drill down on those polls -- only 60 percent of Americans think that their future is going to be better off under a Joe Biden presidency. He's - - but what we get, what we expect he was in Congress for 40 years. He has the approval now that's closer to a congressional representative than the president of the United States."

All right. So the real -- the only thing is -- is Joe Biden now is beholden to this radical element in his party. Mark Meadows, I'll give you first crack on this one. Okay, well I don't see them -- I don't see them bringing back any of the Trump policies which would solve all of their problems. That's not going to happen, is it?"

So all that Joe Biden has to do is run back and actually do what Donald Trump did for four years. But here's the other thing is Joe Biden's used to signing the back of a paycheck not the front of a paycheck. So he doesn't even understand what it takes because he's used to a government paycheck for 40 years. And the average American, Reince is exactly right, they're paying more at the grocery store, at the gas pumps, and candidly that will come back to haunt them in 2022 and 2024."

If they're not willing to change and they're going to continue just to beg OPEC for oil and then excoriate and scold American energy companies, how does that solve the biggest problem they have with inflation, the economy and that's the high cost of energy because their policies artificially reduce the supply as demand has remained constant, I don't see that -- I don't see them solving that problem by yelling at gas company and energy company executives."

But so why do they do it? They do it because they know what they're facing and they're -- and they want they want all their goodies and everything that they've ever dreamed of and they're going to get it all now.

But once they've gotten the yes vote, they are not going to walk the plank without getting all of this radical left-wing policy, socialist communist policy in place, and what they believe is, it's worth it.

He did not cross state lines with an AR-15 that was illegal. His mother did not drive him across state lines to go to a riot to shoot people. He lived 20 miles from Kenosha. His father lives in Kenosha, so does his aunt, his uncle, his grandmother, his best friend. His gun which he was illegally entitled to own in Wisconsin was in a safe in his best friend's stepfather's house. He was in Kenosha because he had a job as a lifeguard that day. He worked a shift before he then went and volunteered to clean graffiti that rioters had defaced a local school with, and then he was asked by a local businessman who owned a car -- used car lot to come and with another group of people to come and guard their car lot because they'd lost cars the night before to arson, because the police and the authorities in Kenosha had abandoned the town and Kyle Rittenhouse told the court that he regarded Kenosha, his father's hometown, his workplace as his community and he was being an upstanding member of that community. His mother was living in Antioch 20 miles away, but she had done a 16-hour shift at the nursing home, where she's a nurse's assistant, and she was asleep before her son even went to Kenosha to work his shift. All of these stories, they're all lies. He's not a white supremacist. He's not a domestic terrorist. He was an upstanding 17 year old."

They don't care about facts. They don't care about the law. It's all racist. A Black Lives Matter outside the courtroom, I don't even know why.
