So, what is, it's an odd message given what the CDC tweeted out yesterday about reopening schools increasing vaccination rates among teachers, staff and eligible students can help get all students back to when person school in the fall. Hours later teacher's union boss and chief proponent of school closures, Randi Weingarten echoed the CDC's message, but added her own twist. The Delta variant is particularly contagious in young people, it's imperative that we educate our communities on the importance of vaccination. What they're telling us folks is that reopening schools in the fall hinges on vaccinations, including of children, but didn't Fauci and his gang just warn us that even being fully vaccinated wasn't good enough in the face of the Delta variant, and that we still need to adhere to the lockdown lifestyle.  It's obvious where this is going. They're preparing Americans for another round of extreme COVID measures. We may not see official stay-at-home order return or blanket business closures, but there are ways to impose lockdowns without explicitly saying so. Here's a prediction. The Biden CDC Fauci and their cronies will wait until after the Fourth of July holiday to announce new masking and social distancing measures. They can't stand the sight of Americans living free and determining their own fates. So, they're looking for any old excuse to clamp down on us again. And when they do, just remember, this isn't about the science. It's about politics and power.   Joining me now is Matt Walsh, host of The Matt Walsh Show. And Alex Berenson, author of the Unreported Truths about COVID-19 and Lockdown series. Alex, I'll start with you. This seems like they're laying the groundwork for something yet again.",

I think this is probably a push to get younger people and teens and ultimately children vaccinated. It's a push to try to scare parents and to try to scare kids, and on to provide cover for colleges and universities that are pushing vaccines, despite the fact that we know that there's a myocarditis risk, there may be other risks, that are sort of starting to emerge from Bayer's (ph), from the federal database. And so, I think it's ludicrous, people are beginning to tune it out. I actually - last week, I told Tucker about the - that I have this new website, called Substack, where I'm publishing almost daily updates on COVID, on vaccines and stuff. And today was particularly interesting in that, if you're under 60, and you're not obese to morbidly obese, your rate of death from COVID. And certainly, if you're under 40, is so low, it almost can't be measured, almost all the risk that we have with COVID is associated with being overweight or obese or being over 60.  And I think so many Americans are aware of this intuitively, at this point, that they're just tuning out the health authorities. And so, I think this is all sort of going to be irrelevant in the end, but they are going to keep pushing.",

Kids are not a high risk group.   I mean, imagine if they had been. Imagine if this had been reversed. And kids were the highest rate affected by it. I mean, what a tragedy that would have been. And that's not the case at all. So, what we also know that the powers that'd be, have seized a lot of extra power, they've used the Coronavirus to do that.

What this is really about the adults, it's about the adults feeling better and feeling safer. That's why we got to put the masks on the kids and put the shots in their arm and so that the rest of us can feel safer around those kids, even though the kids pose no risk to us.

Remember, last summer when teachers in D.C. lined up fake body bags to protest having to go back to work? Or what about the Chicago teachers who performed an interpretive dance to signify the dangers of reopening schools?   In Arizona, they went even darker. teachers' union members there were encouraged to write their own obituaries and send them to the governor.

I mean she was the main villain behind school closures in this country for the past year. The single best predictor of whether schools were open or closed in any jurisdiction was how powerful the teachers' union was there. It had nothing to do with case levels, or COVID, or anything else. It was how powerful the teachers' union was. And now, she's saying, hey, we wanted them open all along. We're the good guys. We were fighting for the kids.

But what was remarkable about this is where it was published, Jeanine, it was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, which is one of the main line prestige journals. And it makes you wonder if there's some cracks in the sort of the so-called expert consensus that has prevented anything critical of masks from being published. So, it's very interesting, we'll see if they're forced to retract our men because this study actually carries an express recommendation at the end of the conclusion that says there should not be mandatory masking of children.

All right, good evening, congressman. This is absolutely insane. What can Republicans do to stop these dangerous cuts from going into effect?",

Once iconic comedian and actor is now free from prison, and today tweeted, I have never changed my stance nor my story. I have always maintained my innocence. Special thanks to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court for upholding the rule of law.  Joining us now is criminal defense attorney Jonna Spilbor. Jonna, thanks for being with us. Let me see if I understand this. We have a DA who's investigating and about to prosecute Bill Cosby, because there is a civil case, he decides to release Cosby from the fifth amendment incriminating himself so that the civil case can go forward. As a result of that, the DA then takes information from the civil case. And then years later indicts Bill Cosby. Was that what the Supreme Court made their decision on?",

But what he did is took another step further, and he said I'm going to do this so that you, Andrea Constand, can be in a better position to sue him for money, because if I am going to prosecute him, then Bill Cosby doesn't have to say a word. He has a Fifth Amendment right not to.

How did the prosecutor know we wouldn't have proof beyond a reasonable doubt the next day? Why would he make a decision to say, oh, I'm going to cut Bill Cosby loose so that this woman can make some money in a civil case, and then years later go back on it, and the whole conviction is overturned.

And speaking of privilege, the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill board of regents today caved to political pressure and voted to grant tenure to leftist Nikole Hannah-Jones, this despite the fact that she has zero academic qualifications and that her flagship 1619 Project was littered with historical inaccuracies. Here now is Horace Cooper, Project 21 co-chair. Horace, it seems the real privilege isn't white privilege, but liberal privilege. HORACE COOPER, PROJECT 21 CO-CHAIRMAN: Absolutely right, Judge. Here we have this case where the insurance industry reports nearly $2 billion worth of damage was done by these so called mostly peaceful protestors. And rather than acknowledge how violent they were, how outrageous their acts were, how damaging their acts were to the community, they're turning around and suing. This is remarkable. They've already sued Los Angeles, and now we're going to see it in Santa Monica as well. Only, I believe, only if there is a settlement is there any merit to any potential for any victory here. And in the case of UNC, it is remarkable that bullying, that bullying by the Black Lives Matter movement and by the progressive left is actually what ends up getting tenure for people today, instead of allowing the real process to go by where we evaluate their work, we look at their merit, and in this particular case, there is no merit, there is no real scholarship.

So, what is, it's an odd message given what the CDC tweeted out yesterday about reopening schools increasing vaccination rates among teachers, staff and eligible students can help get all students back to when person school in the fall. Hours later teacher's union boss and chief proponent of school closures, Randi Weingarten echoed the CDC's message, but added her own twist. The Delta variant is particularly contagious in young people, it's imperative that we educate our communities on the importance of vaccination. What they're telling us folks is that reopening schools in the fall hinges on vaccinations, including of children, but didn't Fauci and his gang just warn us that even being fully vaccinated wasn't good enough in the face of the Delta variant, and that we still need to adhere to the lockdown lifestyle. It's obvious where this is going. They're preparing Americans for another round of extreme COVID measures. We may not see official stay-at-home order return or blanket business closures, but there are ways to impose lockdowns without explicitly saying so. Here's a prediction. The Biden CDC Fauci and their cronies will wait until after the Fourth of July holiday to announce new masking and social distancing measures. They can't stand the sight of Americans living free and determining their own fates. So, they're looking for any old excuse to clamp down on us again. And when they do, just remember, this isn't about the science. It's about politics and power. Joining me now is Matt Walsh, host of The Matt Walsh Show. And Alex Berenson, author of the Unreported Truths about COVID-19 and Lockdown series. Alex, I'll start with you. This seems like they're laying the groundwork for something yet again."

I think this is probably a push to get younger people and teens and ultimately children vaccinated. It's a push to try to scare parents and to try to scare kids, and on to provide cover for colleges and universities that are pushing vaccines, despite the fact that we know that there's a myocarditis risk, there may be other risks, that are sort of starting to emerge from Bayer's (ph), from the federal database. And so, I think it's ludicrous, people are beginning to tune it out. I actually - last week, I told Tucker about the - that I have this new website, called Substack, where I'm publishing almost daily updates on COVID, on vaccines and stuff. And today was particularly interesting in that, if you're under 60, and you're not obese to morbidly obese, your rate of death from COVID. And certainly, if you're under 40, is so low, it almost can't be measured, almost all the risk that we have with COVID is associated with being overweight or obese or being over 60. And I think so many Americans are aware of this intuitively, at this point, that they're just tuning out the health authorities. And so, I think this is all sort of going to be irrelevant in the end, but they are going to keep pushing."

I mean, this is not - we've known this is one of the few things that we all knew about the virus from the get go, which is and it's something we should have all been grateful for, from the beginning, that kids are not widely affected by this. Kids are not a high risk group. I mean, imagine if they had been. Imagine if this had been reversed. And kids were the highest rate affected by it. I mean, what a tragedy that would have been. And that's not the case at all. So, what we also know that the powers that'd be, have seized a lot of extra power, they've used the Coronavirus to do that. And we know that this is what history teaches us that when you give power like this to people, they're going to be very loath to give it back. And I think that's what we're witnessing right now."

And you've heard a lot about how 300 kids have died from COVID in the last 18 months in the United States. I challenge anybody to figure out who those kids are, and how many of them did not have really serious comorbidities like terminal illnesses, such as cancer, because when you actually - in Britain, researchers looked at kids and they couldn't really find any healthy children who died of COVID. And again, that's only half the equation, OK? These vaccines are not risk free, and they're not risk free for kids. And we are seeing lots of cases of really severe heart inflammation post-COVID vaccination of kids. Kids, I mean, 12 to 18."

What this is really about the adults, it's about the adults feeling better and feeling safer. That's why we got to put the masks on the kids and put the shots in their arm and so that the rest of us can feel safer around those kids, even though the kids pose no risk to us. But that just makes it even more demented in my mind that we're putting them through this, not for their sake, but for our own and I just find that infuriating."

She's now claiming that she and her union tried to reopen schools safely since April 2020. What a crock and one easily disproven by looking at the actions of her union members during the pandemic. Remember, last summer when teachers in D.C. lined up fake body bags to protest having to go back to work? Or what about the Chicago teachers who performed an interpretive dance to signify the dangers of reopening schools? In Arizona, they went even darker. teachers' union members there were encouraged to write their own obituaries and send them to the governor. And what about Randi herself, bombshell FOIA or FOIA emails showing that Weingarten and her minions colluded with the CDC to prolong school closures.

I mean she was the main villain behind school closures in this country for the past year. The single best predictor of whether schools were open or closed in any jurisdiction was how powerful the teachers' union was there. It had nothing to do with case levels, or COVID, or anything else. It was how powerful the teachers' union was. And now, she's saying, hey, we wanted them open all along. We're the good guys. We were fighting for the kids.

But what was remarkable about this is where it was published, Jeanine, it was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, which is one of the main line prestige journals. And it makes you wonder if there's some cracks in the sort of the so-called expert consensus that has prevented anything critical of masks from being published. So, it's very interesting, we'll see if they're forced to retract our men because this study actually carries an express recommendation at the end of the conclusion that says there should not be mandatory masking of children. So, it was pretty interesting that that got through peer review."

The state's highest court ruling that Cosby have been denied a fair trial when he was convicted back in 2018. Once iconic comedian and actor is now free from prison, and today tweeted, I have never changed my stance nor my story. I have always maintained my innocence. Special thanks to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court for upholding the rule of law. Joining us now is criminal defense attorney Jonna Spilbor. Jonna, thanks for being with us. Let me see if I understand this. We have a DA who's investigating and about to prosecute Bill Cosby, because there is a civil case, he decides to release Cosby from the fifth amendment incriminating himself so that the civil case can go forward. As a result of that, the DA then takes information from the civil case. And then years later indicts Bill Cosby. Was that what the Supreme Court made their decision on?"

What the D.A. did, the original D.A. did in basically agreeing to not prosecute Bill Cosby, essentially an immunity agreement, when he did that, I get it. But what he did is took another step further, and he said I'm going to do this so that you, Andrea Constand, can be in a better position to sue him for money, because if I am going to prosecute him, then Bill Cosby doesn't have to say a word. He has a Fifth Amendment right not to. Whose business was it for the original D.A. to get involved in the machinations of a civil suit that was going to -- the purpose of was extracting money from Bill Cosby. That went too far."

What it reminds me of is Acosta, the United States attorney in the Epstein case. In Florida, he said I'm going to give immunity to unnamed and undisclosed individuals. That's not the job of a prosecutor. The job of a prosecutor is not to facilitate a civil case. The job of the prosecutor is to prosecute. How did the prosecutor know we wouldn't have proof beyond a reasonable doubt the next day? Why would he make a decision to say, oh, I'm going to cut Bill Cosby loose so that this woman can make some money in a civil case, and then years later go back on it, and the whole conviction is overturned. Victims are then lost. They then think there is no point in coming forward if he's rich or if he's famous."

      "utterance": "And that is one way to look at it. But the other way to look at it, perhaps from Bill Cosby's perspective, is, wait a minute, you thought the case was un-prosecutable. You thought the facts stunk. It's replete in the opinion that the original prosecutor was worried about the credibility of Andrea Constand, was worried about the state of the evidence. So it wasn't good enough to prosecute, but I'm going to help you get the $3.4 million."

Now it's time to get rid of this judge, because she is not doing her any favors. There needs to be a new petition filed and quick, and somebody really needs to give her Britney Spears some legal relief. The woman is 40 years old.

    {
      "speaker": "PIRRO",
      "utterance": "If you want to see real privilege in action, look no further than the racial arsonists and grifters of the left. For instance, Black Lives Matter is now suing the far-left city of Santa Monica for, wait, not arresting enough criminals during last summer's mostly peaceful protests. \"The Los Angeles Times\" reports the lawsuit accuses the city and Santa Monica Police Department of using excessive force against protesters while ignoring individuals who were burglarizing stores and committing other crimes nearby. And speaking of privilege, the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill board of regents today caved to political pressure and voted to grant tenure to leftist Nikole Hannah-Jones, this despite the fact that she has zero academic qualifications and that her flagship 1619 Project was littered with historical inaccuracies. Here now is Horace Cooper, Project 21 co-chair. Horace, it seems the real privilege isn't white privilege, but liberal privilege. HORACE COOPER, PROJECT 21 CO-CHAIRMAN: Absolutely right, Judge. Here we have this case where the insurance industry reports nearly $2 billion worth of damage was done by these so called mostly peaceful protestors. And rather than acknowledge how violent they were, how outrageous their acts were, how damaging their acts were to the community, they're turning around and suing. This is remarkable. They've already sued Los Angeles, and now we're going to see it in Santa Monica as well. Only, I believe, only if there is a settlement is there any merit to any potential for any victory here. And in the case of UNC, it is remarkable that bullying, that bullying by the Black Lives Matter movement and by the progressive left is actually what ends up getting tenure for people today, instead of allowing the real process to go by where we evaluate their work, we look at their merit, and in this particular case, there is no merit, there is no real scholarship. But that's how it should be done, but bullying instead is going to carry the day. Privilege for some."

But in her new book, \"Nice Racism,\" Robin DiAngelo reveals the inner workings of her twisted mind. She writes this about going to dinner with a black couple back in college. Quote, \"I had no black friends and had rarely spent time with black people. I was excited and felt an immediate need to let them know I was not racist. And to that end I proceeded to spend the evening telling them how racist my family was.\" Horace, this just tells you what kind of people are pushing the antiracism nonsense."

We're never going to get to where we should be if the racial arsonists of today continue their work. The progressives have got to stop. Stop blaming America, stop dividing America. Let's all sit down. Let's relax, and let's stop letting those that would divide us on racial lines win the day."
