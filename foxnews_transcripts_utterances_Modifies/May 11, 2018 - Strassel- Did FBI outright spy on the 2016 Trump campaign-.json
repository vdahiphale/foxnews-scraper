So, any arguments that this should be off-limits are completely bogus and people should read them for what they are which is an attempt by the Department of Justice and the FBI it would seem to protect something that they simply don't want people to know because it might prove embarrassing.",

Also yesterday, House Intelligence chairman -- the Committee Chairman Devin Nunes and House Oversight Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy, they actually went to the Department of Justice to view documents they have been requesting and that were under subpoena for months. But sources tell FOX News that Nunes and Gowdy were only briefed about the documents that another meeting is scheduled next week for them to actually see it. But the best way to get the answer is to talk to somebody who was in that meeting, that's Chairman Trey Gowdy, and from the House Judiciary Committee, Congressman John Ratcliffe of Texas. Both are former federal prosecutors, both have been in the system, both have been through this process. And I thank you gentlemen for joining us on this beautiful Friday night. Chairman Gowdy, did you get a lot of lip service? Did you actually get to read the documents? And what did they tell you?",

And I say that because the 15 pages of secret memos never mention obstruction of justice a single time, and in fact, one of the memos does exactly the opposite. It says that -- it's an admission by the former director that President Trump asked him to fully investigate whether or not anyone with the Trump campaign was colluding with the Russians, is why Trey and I have both referred to that memo as defense exhibit A and any charges that would be brought against Donald Trump. But I think he's also hurt the Mueller case and the ability to prove that.

I will tell you, not having seen the report, I'll be surprised if the inspector general doesn't find misconduct by former Director Comey. I think he'll find that he violated his employment agreement made unauthorized disclosures of FBI documents and whether they're classified or not, those are improper leaks. And I think he'll find that he made demonstrably false statements, as I think has been highlighted by some of the congressional transcripts that have been related recently as they conflict with some of the public interviews that he's been given.

Iran is already showing its true colors after the president pulled us out of the nuclear deal. The rogue regime is reportedly is saying it is ready to restart its nuclear program on a, quote, \"industrial scale.\" And earlier this week, lawmakers in Iran chanted death to America and burned the United States flag. Joining us now with reaction to all this week's big foreign policy developments, former counterterrorism adviser to vice president Cheney and Florida Congressional candidate, Michael Waltz, author of \"Reaper,\" former brigadier general Tony Tata, and author of \"Nuclear Showdown: North Korea Takes on the World,\" Gordon Chang. Gentlemen, thank you for joining us tonight. General, I want start with you. Because when you see Iranians chanting that, that's not the people of Iran, that's the parliament or the government there burning the United States flag.

I assume because they didn't do anything else for eight years. But this deal is the worst deal. President Trump was right to get out of it. It's an economic boondoggle for Europe, which is why they are fight something hard to stay in it. So what we see is that Obama at the very end of the deal before it was signed had Clapper, one of the most dishonest people in government at the time and still today, remove Iran from the state sponsor of terror list. And what that meant that businesses could do trade with them, foreign aid could go to them and arms could go to them. And meanwhile, flushed Iran with billions of dollars of cash that immediately went to our enemies in the region. Hamas, Hezbollah, Syria and the Palestinians that threatened our number one ally Israel. So this was a terrible deal. It had very, very loose teeth in it. There was just no way to enforce it.

And what President Trump instinctively knows that President Obama never truly understood is that the credible use of military force is actually what helps diplomacy move forward. And then, you know, finally, you know, the Iran deal is incredibly important. It's a critical piece. But President Trump knows that is just a piece of a broader strategy against these dictatorships. And particularly, against Iran. There is a terrorism piece, there is the missile piece, and that, you know, that it's their economy. Both the Iranian and the North Korean economy that are their Achilles' heels. And once we put our foot on the neck of their economies, these dictatorships will fold and they will come to the table. Finally, Jason, we can't forget that both North Korea and Iran are linked in so many ways. There have been North Korean chemical engineers in Syria. Don't forget that the Israelis bombed a North Korean built nuclear reactor in Syria years ago. That was also backed by Iran. These are linkages here, strategic linkages that Ambassador Bolton, President Trump, Secretary Mattis understand and know how to go after.

GORDON CHANG, AUTHOR, \"NUCLEAR SHOWDOWN\": Well, I'm sure that the Iranians understand that President Trump is willing to use force.

Anything that unnerves the North Koreans is going to unnerve the Iranians because as, you know, we know the two programs, Iran and North Korea, they're linked. We have Iranian technicians in North Korea. The Iranians technicians have seen the North Korean nuclear detonations. They've been there. So these two regimes are joined at the hip.

We're not going to be walked into an Iran deal where the negotiator John Kerry refused to leave the table. Obama, President Obama -- Paid $1.8 billion for hostages. You, not me, you -- last night you saw it and again, it's leading to some very big things. And I think that Kim Jong Un -- Kim Jong Un did a great service to himself to his country by doing this.

And Austan talks about the two- to-one against this deal -- well, one of the ones who didn't want to get in this deal he will remember was Chuck Schumer, who didn't want this Iran deal in the first place. Now, we don't know where he's going to be. In fact, Chuck Schumer had such a horrible week, you wonder if he's trying to get his own wing in the political hall of shame.

When we unilaterally pull out of the agreement, we now cannot convince the other trading partners of Iran to impose those sanctions. So we can't put in place the tough sanctions that will bring them to their knees. It's not possible. And we are encouraging Saudi Arabia to now get into a nuclear arms race with Iran because as they start building centrifuges and enriching uranium again, the Saudis have to do the same.

You don't prevent a war by releasing a hundred and forty billion dollars to a regime that is the biggest sponsor of terrorism in the world and sign a deal with them that actually means they can get nuclear weapons after seven years. That's not how you prevent a war. And I'm going to tell Austan right now on live television across the country, the European nations will follow our lead and they will join us in crippling sanctions.

But in my opinion that Iran has already announced that they're going to wreak immense industrial-style enriching of uranium is going to lead to a nuclear proliferation and arms race of other Middle Eastern countries Saudi Arabia and Iran are direct regional competitors. So if Iran immediately starts trying to get a nuclear weapon again the Saudis will have to do the same. That's why all of our NATO allies, plus in the polling a two-to-one majority of Americans, all the Democrats and a significant number of Republicans think that the president has made a mistake doing this. Now, I'll applaud him on North Korea. I think the president is doing a good job exploring diplomacy.

Now, David, I want to give you a chance to weigh in on what's going on in Jerusalem.

But, you know, listening to Austan talk, it's not surprising to a position for the Democrats that John Kerry goes running over to Iran to try to keep a deal going, it's almost like the schoolboy who kept getting giving money so he didn't get beat up by the bully and now he's running over and give any more money to say, hey, don't tell people I was giving you money not to beat me up. This is absurd. The Democrats position is we've got to appease Iran so they won't go beat up people in the region. Who's for us getting out of the Iran deal? Other Middle Eastern countries who don't want Iran to be a nuclear threat and use it to be threaten them."

But then in their desire to make Chairman Nunes look bad and justify why they were not giving those documents, someone in the government leaked a lot of details about what was happening. It turns out he's asking about a top secret government source who has worked for the FBI and the CIA who is a U.S. citizen would seem to have some sort of entanglement with foreign intelligence agencies or maybe is based overseas. And based on all those bread crumbs and some reporting, I've got a pretty good sense of who it is and it does look as though, indeed there was an FBI attempt, a successful one, to basically go out and spy with a human asset on the Trump campaign."

      "speaker": "STRASSEL",
      "utterance": "Yes, it's so important because remember, the FBI has been doggedly sticking with this story. That what initiated this counterintelligence probe was a tip that they got in July about this supposed drunken conversation of a junior campaign aide named George Papadopoulos. Well, if for any reason we find out that this person this asset of theirs was in fact surveilling or spying on the Trump campaign prior to that time, then they've got an issue right because that's no longer their origins story and they must have had something else that they were basing this on, whether it be the dossier or some other information that they were using as a reason to go out and surveil the Trump campaign."

    {
      "speaker": "STRASSEL",
      "utterance": "You know, we have a great piece in The Journal today by a former FBI officer just talking and his job was in fact to fulfill congressional requests talking about how obnoxious and outrageous it is that the department of justice is not complying with civil requests much less subpoenas from Congress. And the fact by the way that they didn't give this information over to Chairman Nunes, all the way last year when he said he was investigating the FBI's conduct, is really pretty striking. But, look, they're going to have to -- Congress as a body and the good news is Chairman Nunes looks to have the backing of all the leadership and the other members in the Republican Party, make it clear that if the Department of Justice does not turn this over, that they will move to contempt. And with any luck, also, the White House is putting out the message that they need to cooperate and hand over documents."

      "speaker": "STRASSEL",
      "utterance": "Well, it's interesting. The Department of Justice made quite a big deal in its letter back to Chairman Nunes about how it had this development in consultation with the White House. But curiously, it did agree to sit down with Chairman Nunes, and I think probably they have the order to accommodate him in some way. They're still trying to do it without getting out of having to hand over actual documents, but as that is what Chairman Nunes and others are actually after, it would seem that's what they're going to need to hand over to fulfill that request."

And at what point do does the constitution actually come into play. I mean, they don't -- they give lip- service to oversight, but here they are leaking -- I mean, it's pretty well-documented that they're leaking. But what is it that they think they can't and shouldn't show to Congress which is the essentially the American people?"

      "speaker": "STRASSEL",

They have to have specific cause reason things that they're looking for. And as this piece we ran today made clear, when those cases came up, Department of Justice's always helped and been good about it. And we also have processes whereby in particular the gang of eight, right, the senior members of our intelligence committees the leadership can see anything in a classified situation. So, any arguments that this should be off-limits are completely bogus and people should read them for what they are which is an attempt by the Department of Justice and the FBI it would seem to protect something that they simply don't want people to know because it might prove embarrassing."

Also yesterday, House Intelligence chairman -- the Committee Chairman Devin Nunes and House Oversight Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy, they actually went to the Department of Justice to view documents they have been requesting and that were under subpoena for months. But sources tell FOX News that Nunes and Gowdy were only briefed about the documents that another meeting is scheduled next week for them to actually see it. But the best way to get the answer is to talk to somebody who was in that meeting, that's Chairman Trey Gowdy, and from the House Judiciary Committee, Congressman John Ratcliffe of Texas. Both are former federal prosecutors, both have been in the system, both have been through this process. And I thank you gentlemen for joining us on this beautiful Friday night. Chairman Gowdy, did you get a lot of lip service? Did you actually get to read the documents? And what did they tell you?"

And there's a reason that Congress wants to know the answers to these questions. So, it was a really constructive -- I know that is not good news from the media standpoint that we had a boring constructive meeting yesterday, but that's exactly what it was and it was so constructive that we've agreed to meet next week. So you asked if we saw something. I can learn with my ears and I can learn with my eyes, and yesterday was important because I got to hear the department's perspective, but also got to ask questions. You're right, Johnny and I were prosecutors. I know the questions to ask in an investigation like this and I need witnesses there that can answer `em. Yesterday was really productive."

There are lots of things that happen in the judicial branch that members of Congress can't see. There are things that happen the executive branch the members of Congress can't see. And they're things we do, Jason, as you recall in Congress that we don't let anybody else see. So, that tension we've got to work through. I learned information this week. I still would like to see the documents, I think they've taken that request under advisement, and I think we're getting farther taking this approach, meeting eyeball-to-eyeball as opposed to exchanging letters and seeing who can leak them the quickest. And that is not constructive. What is constructive is to have a conversation and I think we're making progress towards accessing the document."

But I'm glad you're making incremental progress step by step. I want to -- I want to go to John Ratcliffe who's -- I want to get your perspective on James Comey, because he's fresh off a book tour. He said an awful lot of things and we've learned a lot more about Director Comey made this -- is he made the situation better or worse for himself after this book tour and the things that we've learned about his actions while he was the FBI director?"

      "speaker": "REP. JOHN RATCLIFFE, R-TEXAS, HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE",
      "utterance": "Well, Jason, good to be with you. I think one of the things that has come out of Jim Comey's interviews on his book tour and the release of his secret memos is it's ironic to me that he's the one that created the allegation of obstruction of justice against Donald Trump, and now, he's the same person who has effectively torpedoed the ability of the special counsel to ever prove obstruction. And I say that because the 15 pages of secret memos never mention obstruction of justice a single time, and in fact, one of the memos does exactly the opposite. It says that -- it's an admission by the former director that President Trump asked him to fully investigate whether or not anyone with the Trump campaign was colluding with the Russians, is why Trey and I have both referred to that memo as defense exhibit A and any charges that would be brought against Donald Trump. But I think he's also hurt the Mueller case and the ability to prove that. You can't build a case around a star witness who has damaged his own credibility and hurt his own reputation as I think Jim Comey has done over the last few weeks on this book tour."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHAFFETZ",
      "utterance": "Well, do you think he -- does he have any legal jeopardy himself, Director Comey? Well, I think the best answer to that, Jason, will come with the release of the inspector general report. You know, we all anticipate that that will happen shortly. We also know that the inspector general, Michael Horowitz, is someone who's proven himself to be a fair umpire, someone who calls balls and strikes fairly and was -- where appropriate -- willing to make a criminal referral of the deputy FBI director. I will tell you, not having seen the report, I'll be surprised if the inspector general doesn't find misconduct by former Director Comey. I think he'll find that he violated his employment agreement made unauthorized disclosures of FBI documents and whether they're classified or not, those are improper leaks. And I think he'll find that he made demonstrably false statements, as I think has been highlighted by some of the congressional transcripts that have been related recently as they conflict with some of the public interviews that he's been given. So, I'm confident that if it's appropriate, Michael Horowitz will make that recommendation."

      "speaker": "CHAFFETZ",

I don't know enough to do it. I know this -- all three of us have tremendous confidence in Michael Horowitz, the inspector general. He's a former federal prosecutor. He's a straight arrow. Just the very fact-centric. I think the reason it is taking longer, Jason, than he anticipated is he is finding more information. So what I would tell my colleagues in the House is give him the time, independence and the resources to do everything he needs to do. I know that we wanted it in February and March and that's a human nature to want it quicker but I want it to be complete. I want it to be fulsome. I want the American people to have confidence in what Horowitz has done. And if he could represent that he is accessed every document and every witness, I mean, something that he found the Page-Strozk text then he found the fact some were deleted and then through his help they were reconstructed. So, I'm as impatient as everyone else. I just, I know this. I want Horowitz to present a fulsome picture when he comes. And if that means waiting another couple of weeks then so be it."

Robbed them of their freedom, didn't let them go home to their families. Their release should not be exalted. It should be expected. It is no great accomplishment of Kim Jong-un to do this.

According to Foxnews.com, MSNBC primetime program spent 30 seconds on American prisoners' return home from North Korea. Thirty seconds.

And the last week President Trumpet goes and gets the five principal leaders of ISIS and takes them off the battlefield at the same time we're bringing home three Americans.

We all, Democrats, Republicans, liberals and conservatives, want and need a deal with North Korea. We need with Iran to work with our allies to make sure they do what President Rouhani said. Stick to the terms of the deal. If they start enriching, tighten the sanctions. But this is an American set of issues. This is not Democrat versus Republican.

In almost all of the comments that President Trump has made on the issue he said if there are not terms that are favorable to the United States, if there's not a verifiable way to ensure that North Korea cannot continue to do harm then we'll get up and walk away. We're not going to make a bad deal. And that's one of the major differences in this administration and the last administration. The last administration made a bad deal with Iran. I think it's very timely that the president now is saying we're not going to do those bad deals anymore. We're going to enforce the terms and we're going to have enforceable terms not secret side negotiations or documents that the Congress and the American people don't see. So I'm very encouraged.

The rogue regime is reportedly is saying it is ready to restart its nuclear program on a, quote, \"industrial scale.\" And earlier this week, lawmakers in Iran chanted death to America and burned the United States flag. Joining us now with reaction to all this week's big foreign policy developments, former counterterrorism adviser to vice president Cheney and Florida Congressional candidate, Michael Waltz, author of \"Reaper,\" former brigadier general Tony Tata, and author of \"Nuclear Showdown: North Korea Takes on the World,\" Gordon Chang. Gentlemen, thank you for joining us tonight. General, I want start with you.

I assume because they didn't do anything else for eight years. But this deal is the worst deal. President Trump was right to get out of it. It's an economic boondoggle for Europe, which is why they are fight something hard to stay in it. So what we see is that Obama at the very end of the deal before it was signed had Clapper, one of the most dishonest people in government at the time and still today, remove Iran from the state sponsor of terror list. And what that meant that businesses could do trade with them, foreign aid could go to them and arms could go to them. And meanwhile, flushed Iran with billions of dollars of cash that immediately went to our enemies in the region. Hamas, Hezbollah, Syria and the Palestinians that threatened our number one ally Israel. So this was a terrible deal. It had very, very loose teeth in it. There was just no way to enforce it.

And our greatest ally is of course Israel, you know. Secondarily, we have to have our military forces fitted and ready and equipped to be a credible use of military force. And what President Trump instinctively knows that President Obama never truly understood is that the credible use of military force is actually what helps diplomacy move forward. And then, you know, finally, you know, the Iran deal is incredibly important. It's a critical piece. But President Trump knows that is just a piece of a broader strategy against these dictatorships. And particularly, against Iran. There is a terrorism piece, there is the missile piece, and that, you know, that it's their economy. Both the Iranian and the North Korean economy that are their Achilles' heels. And once we put our foot on the neck of their economies, these dictatorships will fold and they will come to the table. Finally, Jason, we can't forget that both North Korea and Iran are linked in so many ways. There have been North Korean chemical engineers in Syria. Don't forget that the Israelis bombed a North Korean built nuclear reactor in Syria years ago. That was also backed by Iran. These are linkages here, strategic linkages that Ambassador Bolton, President Trump, Secretary Mattis understand and know how to go after. And that's why you are seeing real results from the Trump administration."

      "utterance": "Yes. That's what I want to ask Gordon about. Gordon, you saw what we've been doing in North Korea. You are such an expert on that. What is the message of North Korea and how should the Iranians read what President Trump has done in North Korea? How is that going to play in Iran? GORDON CHANG, AUTHOR, \"NUCLEAR SHOWDOWN\": Well, I'm sure that the Iranians understand that President Trump is willing to use force. And that has unnerved the Chinese, the South Koreans and the North Koreans. Anything that unnerves the North Koreans is going to unnerve the Iranians because as, you know, we know the two programs, Iran and North Korea, they're linked. We have Iranian technicians in North Korea. The Iranians technicians have seen the North Korean nuclear detonations. They've been there. So these two regimes are joined at the hip. Iran's supposed to pay North Korea something like $2.5 to $3 billion a year for their various forms of cooperation. And that's a real indication that the two nations the two regimes are so close together."

      "utterance": "Well, if we impose new sanctions as I predict we will do -- and that was one of the impacts that the previous sanctions we're having on Iran, is that the money was not flowing as strongly into Syria and to the other groups that I mentioned before. Hezbollah, Hamas and the Palestinians. So you are going to see Syria be separated a little bit from Iran. And hopefully strategically the Trump administration who is doing this artfully as Michael said--"

We have a relatively small footprint on the ground but it's that long-term -- it's not long-term peace in long-term strategy of how we roll back the gains the Iranians have made in the last eight years of, essentially the Obama administration--"
