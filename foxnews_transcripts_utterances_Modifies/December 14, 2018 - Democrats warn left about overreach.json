Mick Mulvaney, he's the current budget director, will become the acting chief of staff when Kelly departs at the end of the year. Mulvaney is going to have to deal with Democrats taking control of the House and the ongoing special counsel investigation.  Today, Robert Mueller pushed back hard against accusation that the FBI acted improperly, in an interview with the president's former national security advisor Michael Flynn. A judge had ordered a special counsel to respond to the charge by this afternoon and it did forcefully. According to the special counsel filing, Michael Flynn as a seasoned military officer who dealt regularly with the bureau knew he should not lie to federal agents, it also says he was tricked into lying is false. Now, Flynn has accused the FBI's the-director Andrew McCabe of suggesting that he should not bring a lawyer to that interview. It's a move George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley calls highly irregular.",

These are the documents filed today, and in them we learned that, yes, the FBI had a transcript of a perfectly legal conversation between Michael Flynn and ambassador Sergey Kislyak. They use that as a pretext to lie to Flynn to entice him into granting an interview, to ensnare him in the crime of making a false statement even though FBI agents determined at the end of the interview that he didn't make a false statement.   Which invites the question why is a guy who told the truth being charged with the crime of lying? That's something that I hope Judge Emmet Sullivan on Tuesday at the sentencing poses to the Mueller team of partisans. Why are you charging this guy with something he didn't do? And perhaps ask Flynn himself were you coerced? Did these prosecutors over here threaten to prosecute your son? Did they bring such an immense, powerful case against you and you became broke and had to throw in the towel?",

I worked for General Flynn in the transition team for the NSC, after the election, the official presidential transition team. And it was our job, our job, to reach out to our interlocutors, whether it's allies in NATO or whether it's other countries of geostrategic importance, like Russia. So, the fact that he was doing what he was mandated to do as the only cabinet-level official who was not congressionally approved means that he was absolutely in his lane. The fact that he misremembered the content or one specific element of a phone conversation, Jason, if that is a crime, then every single person watching this show could commit a felony when they forget what they said to somebody. So, this is entrapment of the highest order, and the fact that they had the transcript tells you everything that you need to know.

You know, General Flynn was the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, I interviewed a number of people, even as far back as in December of 2016 and going into the first month, President Trump's presidency, he was president-elect after all of this news broke. Absolutely, General Flynn would know and did know based on his job, that phone conversations with somebody like Ambassador Kislyak were being recorded. Let's go to the meeting that he had, the very first -- January 24th with the two FBI agents. You know, I was the first to report about this, and both agents, both Peter Strzok and Joe Pietka, who were both the two agents that interviewed him believed after they left that he did not lie whatsoever. Now we see that in writing. In fact, they felt he was so forthcoming because he had actually delivered information to them that only they knew, he had no idea that they knew he had this.  So, when he was just so open about this, they went to the field office and they said we don't believe he's lying. This is straightforward, you know, this guy is very congenial, he's talking to us. He's very open with us. He sees us as an ally, and then what happened? We see Mueller trying to take him down. Let me tell you something here. I have talked to a number of FBI officials, former officials, senior officials, people in the directorate of security at the State Department, they said this is the most egregious abuse of power they have ever seen.   And, Jason, as we are seeing right now, they are investigating every part of President Trump's life, his campaign. They are going after him with full force. The 302 doesn't -- they didn't even turn over the original 302. By the way, that August 302 is an interview with Peter Strzok about the January 24th interview.",

Hillary Clinton initially objected and refused to answer questions about Clintonmail.com, her private email system, but after District Judge Emmet Sullivan ordered her to do so, the former secretary of state submitted written answers which have now been acquired by the conservative Judicial Watch. In her answers, Mrs. Clinton says the system was set up inst 2009 by an aide to her husband, the former president, and that the system was set up for, quote, the purpose of convenience. But Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton says it's not credible to say the email was for convenience. Fitton reminds us that District Judge Royce Lambert once called the Clinton email issue one of the greatest modern offenses to government transparency and ordered additional discovery into whether Hillary Clinton's email was instead an attempt to shelter documents and stymie the Freedom of Information Act. Meantime, financial experts who filed a whistle-blower complaint against the Clinton Foundation have not testified before the House Oversight Committee confirming the FBI does have an open and ongoing investigation into the foundation. The tax and financial forensic experts also claimed they obtained thousands of pages of documents on the Clinton Foundation containing evidence of pay to play, financial crimes, and showing the foundation operated more like a family partnership than a nonprofit. But that same oversight hearing blew up and the financial experts refused to turn over 6,000 pages of documents they say back up their claims. That prompted GOP Oversight Chairman Mark Meadows to warn them that his patience is running out. And breaking right now, a federal judge just ruled the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, is unconstitutional because without the individual mandate, the penalty that mandates you have insurance, the law is invalid because it cannot pay for itself -- Jason.",

I think we need to continue to have harsh conversations with the Saudis about how this doesn't fit the means of international norms, it's not accepted by the United States and we can't continue to partner with someone that continues to brutalize people in this way. And I think we have to decide what accountability is going to look like for them.

Mick Mulvaney, he's the current budget director, will become the acting chief of staff when Kelly departs at the end of the year. Mulvaney is going to have to deal with Democrats taking control of the House and the ongoing special counsel investigation. Today, Robert Mueller pushed back hard against accusation that the FBI acted improperly, in an interview with the president's former national security advisor Michael Flynn. A judge had ordered a special counsel to respond to the charge by this afternoon and it did forcefully. According to the special counsel filing, Michael Flynn as a seasoned military officer who dealt regularly with the bureau knew he should not lie to federal agents, it also says he was tricked into lying is false. Now, Flynn has accused the FBI's the-director Andrew McCabe of suggesting that he should not bring a lawyer to that interview.

Gregg, I want to start with you because I think part of the story that's really missing at this point is what was the pretext, what was the precursor, if you will, as to why the FBI would even go talk to Flynn given that the administration had literally been in office for hours at that point?"

      "utterance": "It was a faulty premise and a lie. These are the documents filed today, and in them we learned that, yes, the FBI had a transcript of a perfectly legal conversation between Michael Flynn and ambassador Sergey Kislyak. They use that as a pretext to lie to Flynn to entice him into granting an interview, to ensnare him in the crime of making a false statement even though FBI agents determined at the end of the interview that he didn't make a false statement. Which invites the question why is a guy who told the truth being charged with the crime of lying? That's something that I hope Judge Emmet Sullivan on Tuesday at the sentencing poses to the Mueller team of partisans. Why are you charging this guy with something he didn't do? And perhaps ask Flynn himself were you coerced? Did these prosecutors over here threaten to prosecute your son? Did they bring such an immense, powerful case against you and you became broke and had to throw in the towel?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHAFFETZ",
      "utterance": "Dr. Gorka, I want to -- you've been in the White House. You were there at the beginning of the Trump administration. And given General Flynn's background, 33 years of service to this country and the position that he had been in and was going to be in, he had to have known, in fact, he did know that conversation with the ambassador from Russia had been recorded. Correct?"

      "speaker": "DR. SEBASTIAN GORKA, NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGIST",
      "utterance": "Well, you would think that, yes, he would know that, but let's be very clear about what he was doing. I worked for General Flynn in the transition team for the NSC, after the election, the official presidential transition team. And it was our job, our job, to reach out to our interlocutors, whether it's allies in NATO or whether it's other countries of geostrategic importance, like Russia. So, the fact that he was doing what he was mandated to do as the only cabinet-level official who was not congressionally approved means that he was absolutely in his lane. The fact that he misremembered the content or one specific element of a phone conversation, Jason, if that is a crime, then every single person watching this show could commit a felony when they forget what they said to somebody. So, this is entrapment of the highest order, and the fact that they had the transcript tells you everything that you need to know. Also, the two agents who did that interview said they didn't think he was lying and the 302s disappear for eight months."

Absolutely, General Flynn would know and did know based on his job, that phone conversations with somebody like Ambassador Kislyak were being recorded. Let's go to the meeting that he had, the very first -- January 24th with the two FBI agents. You know, I was the first to report about this, and both agents, both Peter Strzok and Joe Pietka, who were both the two agents that interviewed him believed after they left that he did not lie whatsoever. Now we see that in writing. In fact, they felt he was so forthcoming because he had actually delivered information to them that only they knew, he had no idea that they knew he had this. So, when he was just so open about this, they went to the field office and they said we don't believe he's lying. This is straightforward, you know, this guy is very congenial, he's talking to us. He's very open with us. He sees us as an ally, and then what happened? We see Mueller trying to take him down. Let me tell you something here. I have talked to a number of FBI officials, former officials, senior officials, people in the directorate of security at the State Department, they said this is the most egregious abuse of power they have ever seen. And, Jason, as we are seeing right now, they are investigating every part of President Trump's life, his campaign. They are going after him with full force. The 302 doesn't -- they didn't even turn over the original 302. By the way, that August 302 is an interview with Peter Strzok about the January 24th interview."

They said we aren't going to tell her until right before the interview and she got mad about it, that's in today's court documents. But she didn't stop it. So, you know, they lie to Flynn to get the interview. And also in today's documents, they had a scheme where we're not going to tell him we had a transcript and we'll try to ensnare him into making a false statement. In the end, they didn't do that. But what's really disturbing is not just lying to Flynn but encouraging him not to have an attorney there and several other deceptions that are all contained in this document which is really a document of corruption by the FBI."

He wants a bullet train to nowhere, and here he is lecturing Democratic Party that they've gone too far to the left. I think it's a sign of the apocalypse. And regarding Claire McCaskill, this is a woman who's saying we've gotten too much involved with identity politics. When she first ran, Jason, she said George W. Bush let people die on rooftops during Hurricane Katrina because they were poor and because they were black. It was outrageous. She played the race card then. And maybe her saying that we play the gender card too much means for the first time, Democrats will stop lying to women and telling them falsely, as they do every single year, that women make less money doing the very same work that men do. They say that women make $0.87 on the dollar compared to men for doing the very same work.

Hillary Clinton initially objected and refused to answer questions about Clintonmail.com, her private email system, but after District Judge Emmet Sullivan ordered her to do so, the former secretary of state submitted written answers which have now been acquired by the conservative Judicial Watch. In her answers, Mrs. Clinton says the system was set up inst 2009 by an aide to her husband, the former president, and that the system was set up for, quote, the purpose of convenience. But Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton says it's not credible to say the email was for convenience. Fitton reminds us that District Judge Royce Lambert once called the Clinton email issue one of the greatest modern offenses to government transparency and ordered additional discovery into whether Hillary Clinton's email was instead an attempt to shelter documents and stymie the Freedom of Information Act. Meantime, financial experts who filed a whistle-blower complaint against the Clinton Foundation have not testified before the House Oversight Committee confirming the FBI does have an open and ongoing investigation into the foundation. The tax and financial forensic experts also claimed they obtained thousands of pages of documents on the Clinton Foundation containing evidence of pay to play, financial crimes, and showing the foundation operated more like a family partnership than a nonprofit. But that same oversight hearing blew up and the financial experts refused to turn over 6,000 pages of documents they say back up their claims. That prompted GOP Oversight Chairman Mark Meadows to warn them that his patience is running out. And breaking right now, a federal judge just ruled the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, is unconstitutional because without the individual mandate, the penalty that mandates you have insurance, the law is invalid because it cannot pay for itself -- Jason."

And so, we see things like the OGR hearing, the subcommittee hearing, where we start looking at what was going on today with the Clinton Foundation investigation, and guess what? Huber wasn't there again. So, one of our responsibilities is going to keep pushing the DOJ to make sure they respond, even if it's the Democrats that are holding hearings on the Trump administration or Trump officials, we have to demand the DOJ and FBI provide transparency in the documents, because I think when those come out, we are going to find, just as we see in the Clinton Foundation scandal, that there is ample evidence of pay for play misuse of funds, co- mingling of funds."

And some of those people may still be serving in the cabinet, and I think they are doing everything they can to make sure that in the final days of Republican control, we can't ask Rosenstein who he was talking to and who he was scheming with to undermine and potentially end the presidency of Donald Trump. I want those answers. The American people want those answers, and by the way, Jason, your book \"The Deep State,\" lays the premise, lays the foundation for the fact that this stuff actually happens.

He have the support of the speaker and a lot of others. He is very close with the whole delegation there for the South Carolina delegation, he ran for the Republican study committee, a committee that was chaired by Jim Jordan, by Mike Pence by others, and he lost to a guy named Bill Florez. But nevertheless, I think a lot of people have really appreciated Mick and I think we're all excited to see him as the chief of staff to the president.

There's other things we can do to secure our border besides building a wall. Because this is what's going to happen when you build a wall. People are just going to get a higher fence, get a higher ladder. And cross over it again.

In October, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, announced she would be resigning her position at the United States at the end of the year. Yesterday, Ambassador Haley spoke with Sean about her time at the U.N., her working relationship with President Trump and much, much more. Take a look."

You know, I look over at the last two years, a little less than two years, what do I see? We saw what happened in North Korea, Jerusalem is now the capital of Israel, it's now been moved to its proper home. We watched ISIS being shut down, the Iranian sanctions have been put in place and seem effective. American strength abroad I would argue has never been stronger but you have the front row seat, so, am I right in my perceptions?"

      "speaker": "NIKKI HALEY, AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED NATIONS",
      "utterance": "I mean, America has found her voice back again, it is a good time for America and the world. Now for some countries that's a good thing and for some countries that's a bad thing. For Americans that's a great thing. Because I think what we have basically seen is that it was time for us to start talking about what we believed in and what we didn't. When I came in, they had just had a Cuban sponsored resolution that was anti-American that basically blamed America for everything. And the United States abstained on that, though. I came in after they did the anti-Israel bias, and instead of standing up for our friends in Israel, we again abstain on our vote. This is a new day and a new time where we don't abstain, you know exactly where the United States stands, you know what we're for, you know what we're against and you know where we're going. And so, I think there's a lot of moral clarity for the United States now and I think countries appreciate that we're now very straightforward."

    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "I've watched an interview and you talked about your relationship with the president. It sounds to me, correct me if I'm wrong, like, it was a good cop bad cop routine. Like you would use whatever the issue was, you would use his strength, that he would go out and be combative -- it seems like the world leaders believed him when he said something and that you would use that in your negotiation. Explain how the dynamic work."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HALEY",
      "utterance": "Well, I think the only thing is I didn't him out to be the bad cop. What I said was this is where the president is, unless we get this done, I can't promise you where he's going to go because he's upset and we need to move forward. I have -- the president and I have a great relationship. It was a great partnership, we respected each other, I let him be him. I turn around and just used his unpredictability as an advantage because it is. For many who say people don't know what to expect from the United States, that's not a bad thing. And so, I use that as leverage. I use that as ways of getting us what we needed and he was always great in making sure he never let anybody get comfortable. And so, I always saw it as a great working relationship. I'm very grateful--"

    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Did you can find that, though. May be good cop, bad cop was a bad phrase, may be the way to say it though is he likes to keep everybody on his toes and he knows exactly what he is doing. That's what I have discovered. Do you agree with that statement?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HALEY",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. Absolutely. And every way whatsoever. I mean, you know, his strong point really is communicating to leaders around the world and I would always tell the president and strongly believe you get him in front of any world leader, he wins them. He completely wins them. And if any world leader threatens the United States he puts the absolute fear of God into them. And you know, for me, it is the reason our foreign policy is so strong, it's the reason why we have been so effective. It's because the president has very clearly what he will do, what he won't do. But most importantly, he stood by it. When he said if they used chemical weapons there would be a price to pay and then he followed through with it, that said a lot to the international community that you can't take this president for granted."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",

      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHAFFETZ",
      "utterance": "And the president is challenging them to pay more. If Mexico and Canada and China and our European allies, if they don't believe the president is really going to be consequences as it relates to trade deals, they'll never negotiate. So, I think there's a force in the wisdom sort of like the art of the deal and I know everybody gets panic. Like I think there's a lot of panic over little rocket man, my button is bigger than yours, and you know, fire and fury. But look where at where -- we now have an opportunity of having the entire Korean peninsula nuclear free. How -- that's a good thing."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HALEY",
      "utterance": "Well, and you know, I'll tell you. First of all, look at NATO. Now all the countries are paying more so what he did work. When you look at North Korea, it was that rhetoric combined with General McMaster the NSC at that time, calling different countries telling them to, you know, expel diplomats, not to allow them to have embassies -- and then all of that worked and allowed us to get those sanctions done at the United Nations. And so, I will tell you, while people didn't like what he was saying or how he was saying it, what it allowed me to do was say he's being honest. He's very truthful, we need to pass these sanctions or I can promise you if there is a threat he will respond."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "I agree with you about the Saudi Arabia situation. I find people have been far too simplistic in their analysis, I mean, it's far more complicated than that. I believe he is responsible, in my heart I think the evidence will show eventually if it has not already, obviously I don't have access to that kind of intelligence -- but there's also other things. And we got to look contextually through history. We had to align with Stalin in World War II to defeat Hitler. A mass murderer. But we did. I look at the emerging alliance of United States, Israel, the Saudis, the Jordanians, Egyptians. Emirates, against Iranian hegemony as may be a once- in-a-lifetime opportunity to thread a needle. It is frustrating that they did this. I've been probably the loudest critic against Saudi Arabia for years. Treatment of women, gays and lesbians, persecution of Christians and Jews. I don't know the answer but I think it's far more complicated especially believing that they did this to Khashoggi. What are your thoughts?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HALEY",
      "utterance": "It's a very complicated situation but it is one that can be handled and can be solved. First of all, if you have Saudi officials going into a Saudi consulate, the Saudi government is responsible which makes MBS responsible. Period. That's just what we know. Secondly, our United States principled values will not allow us to give them a pass and we shouldn't. And I think the president made a good first step when he sanctioned the 17 individuals. I think we need to continue to have harsh conversations with the Saudis about how this doesn't fit the means of international norms, it's not accepted by the United States and we can't continue to partner with someone that continues to brutalize people in this way. And I think we have to decide what accountability is going to look like for them. But at the same time when we talk about the Houthis in Yemen, when we talk about Hezbollah in Lebanon, when we talk about Iran and their role in Syria, we cannot look at Saudi Arabia and not see that they've been such a good partner with us on that. And so, there are two different avenues we need think and both can be done."
