The bombastic former Mayor came out swinging big time, saying, that special prosecutor Robert Mueller's probe is really a trap. And Rudy is not a sucker who will fall for it, either is the president.  It all comes after questions Mueller wants to ask Trump, you know, those questions he wanted to ask the president, well, they were leaked to the New York Times this week, we still don't know why.  And we've learned, he's considering the possibility is Mueller, of a Presidential subpoena.  Here is the president yesterday.",

What happened here was they assigned a prosecutor and then gave him basically limitless authority to go find a crime. And that's really not supposed to happen in this country.

And isn't that what President Trump is trying to do?  So, why is anyone opposing a lifelong participant in the CIA? In the agency itself? I am talking about Gina Haspel. She should be equally applauded on the left and the right. Joining us now to discuss it this is Dr. Jim Mitchell. He is one of the people behind the Enhanced Interrogation Program that played such a valuable role - a significant role in keeping us safe and stopping follow- up attacks, in my opinion.  So, Gina Haspel, many people are questioning, Dr. Mitchell, always good to see you, on whether or not her role in black sites rendition and enhanced interrogation should be something that expels her from getting this job. What do you think?  JAMES MITCHELL, AUTHOR, \"ENHANCED INTERROGATION\": I think she should have an opportunity to explain her role. I don't think that people should presume that she did one thing or the other. I am not in a position to be able to talk specifically about her role was, but she should have to answer hard questions, if that's the case, but I'm confident that if she is given a fair hearing, that she'll be able to answer them in a way that puts people at ease. What I can say because I know her is that, you know, she adheres strictly to the rule of law.

So, he has no foundational basis for this argument. Furthermore, if we are going to have a summit about race at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, that will be a great thing. but for the life of me, I do not understand why every time we come to issues affecting black and brown people, we bring together athletes, we bring together artists. Why is it that we do not bring together scholars who are known in this field, whether it's Dr. Michael Eric Dyson, Dr. Greg Carr, Dr. Imani Perry, Dr. Marc Lamont Hill.

What I can say in terms of this imprisonment that Kanye talked about in terms of mentally, there are a lot of people who are mentally imprisoned. We live in a blaming generation right now where people are quick to blame history as to why they are not succeeding. And I think that's problematic on many levels. I think, at the end of the day, we do live in a country where we can create our own opportunities to do well, now, that doesn't excuse any systems of institutional racism that seems to hold us back, I get that, but that's not going to prevent people like D.

I think this is something that is needed to be done a very long time ago, but now, there's voices that are coming to the table. And Wendy had a good point, you need to bring all voices to the table, whether we agree or not because at this point, we spend a lot of time talking past each other versus talking with each other, and although people don't like the President, and some rightfully so, they may not like what he says or does and we get that, but at this particular point in our country, we really need to have a serious conversation on race and how can we move together and work together, and I think that's why the Kanye West dynamic is so powerful.

You will see a coach come out and try to push him through. He will not have any of it. It is fantastic.

Ellis said this, he scolded team Mueller portraying them as liars, saying they are not really interested in Manafort's potential bank fraud and everything else, but really into ousting President Trump. Here to help us break this down and the significance of that statement in court is former Assistant US Attorney for the Southern District of New York, also he writes for the National Review with his very penetrating columns, Andrew McCarthy. Andrew, welcome back. What is your reaction to that Judge's comment - those Judge's comments on Friday?"

What's supposed to happen in this country is you have a crime and then you assign a prosecutor. What happened here was they assigned a prosecutor and then gave him basically limitless authority to go find a crime. And that's really not supposed to happen in this country. So, for the first time, we've had someone who the Special Counsel has to take notice of, the judge presiding over a case who is saying, \"What on earth does this have to do with collusion with Russia?\" And he was not very satisfied obviously with the answers he got from the Special Counsel."

You're not my type of guy. You're out.\" Now, he's look at an 18-count indictment and this is what a lot of people have been saying all along. Now, what I also thought was significant is the judge said, \"Can you show me the scope of your mandate, please?\" They handled it to him redacted. How dare they hand a US District Judge a redacted agreement about what you can and can't do. That doesn't make any sense, does it?"

Their position is, they gave the judge what they think is relevant to the Manafort investigation because you know, look, just because you're a federal judge doesn't mean you get to stick your nose into anything you want to stick your nose in. However, I think the judge quite rightly said that he would be the judge in this instance of what he was - what is relevant for him to look and what it is not because they are saying that that document is what cabins their investigation, and he is entitled to know that."

So, Mueller has to know that that is one of the hits on him. You are a Republican perhaps, but look who you are hiring, and he adds another. Should he be adding another prosecutor at this point?"

I think you and I discussed earlier this week, that you know, I ran a big terrorism case back in the mid '90s with three prosecutors, you know, it was pretty big deal at the time. So, why you would need 18 prosecutors, I don't know. But I do think that Special Counsel Mueller has disserved himself by the tenure he has had with respect to the people who he has brought aboard. And I know people say, you know, look, they are not allowed to inquire when you are hiring government people about what their political attitudes are. These are not people who applied for a job with Mueller. These are people he went out and recruited."

So, I'd be very wary about going in there, but I really don't think, Brian, that Mueller should be allowed to ask the president for an interview until he can satisfy a test that establishes that he has got a serious crime that Trump is somehow complicit in it and that Trump is the repository of information that he can't get from the any other source.

      "utterance": "All right, another huge story coming this week, and it's coming up beginning on Tuesday. Finding a new CIA Director. With all the corruption that has been uncovered on the FBI side with the Russian probe and other things, isn't it time to take politics out of our intel agencies? And isn't that what President Trump is trying to do? So, why is anyone opposing a lifelong participant in the CIA? In the agency itself? I am talking about Gina Haspel. She should be equally applauded on the left and the right. Joining us now to discuss it this is Dr. Jim Mitchell. He is one of the people behind the Enhanced Interrogation Program that played such a valuable role - a significant role in keeping us safe and stopping follow- up attacks, in my opinion. So, Gina Haspel, many people are questioning, Dr. Mitchell, always good to see you, on whether or not her role in black sites rendition and enhanced interrogation should be something that expels her from getting this job. What do you think? JAMES MITCHELL, AUTHOR, \"ENHANCED INTERROGATION\": I think she should have an opportunity to explain her role. I don't think that people should presume that she did one thing or the other. I am not in a position to be able to talk specifically about her role was, but she should have to answer hard questions, if that's the case, but I'm confident that if she is given a fair hearing, that she'll be able to answer them in a way that puts people at ease. What I can say because I know her is that, you know, she adheres strictly to the rule of law. She is in no way likely to become some sort of a rogue director, that does some of the things we have seen other agencies like the FBI did recently"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KILMEADE",
      "utterance": "So, when you talk about these things, she has got - tactically, she decides how she wants to answer. She could, say, \"Yes, everything I did was okay by justice. I did what I had to do by law to keep America safe. And now, you don't want to do that, and I won't do that.\" So, should she say that or just, \"I had nothing to do with rendition. I had nothing to do with enhanced interrogation. I had nothing to do with black sites.\" Which one would you do?"

    {
      "speaker": "MITCHELL",
      "utterance": "I think she should be as open and honest as she can be given the current level of secrecy about what she did or she didn't do. You know, there is nothing to be ashamed of about that program. It was established at the highest levels of government. It was judged legal by the Justice Department. It was approved by the President of the United States and the National Security Council. It was briefed to both Houses of Congress, some of whom said, \"Is that all you are going do?\" And it was adhered to legally and lawfully, so I don't think there's anything to be ashamed of whatever her role was, which I'll leave to them to explain."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KILMEADE",
      "utterance": "All right, the CIA released a memo. They want her. They said that they have absolved her from any inappropriate behavior regarding the videotape that was destroyed that showed, I believe Khalid Sheikh Mohammed being water-boarded or whatever else was there. So, they have absolved her of that. Senator Burris says, they have provided all the - he's a Republican - they have provided all the documents necessary. He says, the documents they are asking for don't exist."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MITCHELL",
      "utterance": "Well, I am not sure what documents they are asking for. If they are asking for those tapes, I think it's been clearly established that those tapes were destroyed, and they were destroyed lawfully otherwise, Jose Rodriguez who destroyed those tapes, he's been really clear about that. He authorized the destruction of those tapes on his authority, and it was his decision alone. He ordered the person who was there to get rid of those. The only role that Gina had in that whole thing was as his chief of staff, he directed her to put together the cable telling them to do that, but it was done under his authority and released under his signature."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KILMEADE",
      "utterance": "So, I mean just to take a look at who Gina Haspel is, career intelligence officer, Deputy Director since February 2017, overseas experienced, multiple assignments as a Station Chief and will be the first woman to lead the CIA, how valuable, finally, Dr. Mitchell is it - no political appointee. This is somebody appointed by a politician, but is not a politician. The agency would revel in having somebody from the agency leading them, wouldn't they?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MITCHELL",
      "utterance": "Well, the best and the brightest minds in the intelligence community said she is one of the most qualified individual to ever be nominated for a position like that, and she has been described as the first person - the first woman in 70 years who has worked herself up through the ranks, seven overseas assignments; with her assignment as Deputy Director of the CIA, four senior level positions. She is apolitical and her focus will be on getting the CIA to do what it is that the CIA is supposed to do, not build a bureaucracy in Washington, but focus on intelligence and espionage. And I think we need that. America will be safer for having her."

Joining us right now, Fox news political analyst Gianno Caldwell and political commentator extraordinaire Wendy Osefo. What a week it's been for race, a bit of a surprise that Kanye West is leading it. Wendy, for you, what do you get out of this dialogue, and would you like to see it continue at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue?"

      "speaker": "WENDY OSEFO, POLITICAL COMMENTATOR",
      "utterance": "Well, I think that that the dialogue that Kanye West is perpetuating is very, very dangerous. And we have to underscore that. For him to stay here and say slavery was a choice is one that just negates all of history and all of the evidence of history. Slavery was not a choice, and if he's talking about mental slavery, then there are individuals if you look at history like Nat Turner, like Harriet Tubman who rebelled against slavery. So, he has no foundational basis for this argument. Furthermore, if we are going to have a summit about race at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, that will be a great thing. but for the life of me, I do not understand why every time we come to issues affecting black and brown people, we bring together athletes, we bring together artists. Why is it that we do not bring together scholars who are known in this field, whether it's Dr. Michael Eric Dyson, Dr. Greg Carr, Dr. Imani Perry, Dr. Marc Lamont Hill. They are individuals who have studied race, who have studied politics. We are not minstrel shows and we should not be represented by individuals who are not versed in this space."

      "speaker": "GIANNO CALDWELL, POLITICAL COMMENTATOR",
      "utterance": "Well, of course, I agree with Wendy, slavery was not a choice. And I can also speak to the individuals who did make choices to free themselves, we are talking about the 250 rebellions that took place including Nat Turner, including Harriet Tubman, who led - freed over a thousand slaves, and those that freed themselves from many plantations across the country, so I get that. What I can say in terms of this imprisonment that Kanye talked about in terms of mentally, there are a lot of people who are mentally imprisoned. We live in a blaming generation right now where people are quick to blame history as to why they are not succeeding. And I think that's problematic on many levels. I think, at the end of the day, we do live in a country where we can create our own opportunities to do well, now, that doesn't excuse any systems of institutional racism that seems to hold us back, I get that, but that's not going to prevent people like D. Wendy Osefo from succeeding, who is an immigrant, who works as a professor at one of the leading institutions, who sits on Fox News Channel, on air, the number one cable news channel in the country almost every night or myself who was born into poverty, whose mom was addicted to crack cocaine. But yet, and still, here I am having this conversation with you two, very distinguished individuals.

We're not saying that we are proud of what happened 150 years ago, but having said that, this is the playing field and let's be successful. Don't use it as an excuse. How can you say that, Wendy, and not be racially insensitive?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "OSEFO",
      "utterance": "Well, you can say that by also knowing the policies that make us feel that there are hurdles, that even though we are 150 years removed from slavery, there are still issues that plague people in communities, communities of color and communities that have low socioeconomic backgrounds. I quote the great, Dr. Martin Luther King that says, \"We have the notion in our country that individuals will pull themselves up from their boot straps, but these individual do not have any boots.\" So, we have to make sure that we are looking at things in context, and not saying, everyone should rise to the playing field, but we have policies that make us feel certain people are not able to, and that's really important."

      "utterance": "I think elements of it should be televised. I've reached out to Pastor Gerald Scott, I actually had a conversation with him a couple of days ago, talking about the summit and my involvement with it personally. This is something that I have been calling for, for a long time. Wendy and I had said on television when we talked about Charlottesville and had that very emotional segment, where we called for a summit on race. I think this is something that is needed to be done a very long time ago, but now, there's voices that are coming to the table. And Wendy had a good point, you need to bring all voices to the table, whether we agree or not because at this point, we spend a lot of time talking past each other versus talking with each other, and although people don't like the President, and some rightfully so, they may not like what he says or does and we get that, but at this particular point in our country, we really need to have a serious conversation on race and how can we move together and work together, and I think that's why the Kanye West dynamic is so powerful. Although, I may not agree with everything he says, he has at least opened up a conversation where people, especially in the celebrity caliber aren't just shooting him down, they are saying, \"Okay, we may disagree with him, but we're listening.\""

I recall Governor Schwarzenegger being upset with President Bush because we couldn't get enough fire support. Additionally, the Federal budget for fire suppression support has been cut, while the amount of fires in California have gone up. So, if we look at fires and natural disasters, I encourage everybody to look at this, we are not getting what we deserve. We are not getting what we paid for. We are a donor state. We lose $30 billion to $100 billion each year, and we have to beg for fire support? I think Donald Trump recently gave us around $200 million in Federal assistance to deal with the fires. We lost $32 billion. We have to beg for $200 million when you took $32 billion? Horrible deal."

Check out this young baseball player going viral this week during a very intense little league game over in California. The coach told 3-year-old going Lennox Salcedo to run as fast as he can to his home plate and he didn't disappoint, cracking up fans as he gloriously run slow motion, at the very least, this kid has a future in acting. You will see a coach come out and try to push him through. He will not have any of it. It is fantastic. Moving now to the golf course, where most times you hope to sink a few birdies, other times, you get attacked by one. That's what happened to this Michigan high school student, apparently, the 16-year-old named Isaac Cooling angered a foul as he strolled past the nest. Now, goose not having any of it, chase Cooling, knocked him on his back side and eventually bit him in the butt. I guess, that's the last time the student will be taking a gander at some geese. And you thought golf was kind of boring, well, I have news for you and it's sad news, that's all we have for tonight. Jesse will be back next which, which is good news, and you can catch me hosting \"Legend and Lies.\" That will be tomorrow at 8:00 repeated again at 11:00. Up next is \"Justice with Judge Jeanine.\" And if I have some time, you will see a side shot and I am going to pretend to write. END Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.
