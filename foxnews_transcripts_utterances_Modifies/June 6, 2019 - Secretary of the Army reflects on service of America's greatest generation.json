Looking back in 1940, Hitler and his men toured this city after France signed the armistice, effectively giving Hitler control of Paris and of France. Nearly four long years of occupation later, the allies then began -- the beginning of the end at Normandy.  Today, veterans, world leaders, grateful citizens, gathered to mark 75 years since that momentous battle began.",

And with God as their witness, they were going to get it done. More powerful than the strength of American arms was the strength of American hearts. These men ran through the fires of hell, moved by a force no weapon could destroy. The fierce patriotism of a free, proud, and sovereign people.",

November of 1943 between FDR, Winston Churchill, and Joseph Stalin, the Soviet leader. And it was their first get-together where they essentially planned D-Day. And it was a lot of back and forth. Stalin was really pushing for that to go forward, there was a lot of concern from Churchill whether they could trust Stalin and really buy into the Soviets.  But the concern and FDR's concern was that the Soviets could go the other way. That Hitler could go towards the Soviet Union and somehow co-opt their cooperation. So, there was a lot of back-and-forth in this -- in this Tehran meeting that laid the groundwork for the decision that was then put on General Eisenhower. And the agonizing of that decision go-no-go, and the weather, and the behind-the-scenes stories of getting people together General Eisenhower at 3:30 in the morning. And having each one make a decision, should we do it or not? Should we do it or not? But it was -- it was Eisenhower who had to make the final call, and he said that we're going to go.",

That's what today's speech, I think, for President Trump was such a big deal. It kind of was 30,000 feet. It was bigger. It was -- it met the moment. And as I said on \"SPECIAL REPORT\" earlier, I think it was one of his best speeches if not the best of his presidency. And he's had some big ones.  If you look back at Warsaw, Poland, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The State of the Union Address that we covered the last time that was filled with a kind of rhetorical moment.

So Joe Biden is allying himself with the majority of Americans and even the majority of Democrats. There are only 29 percent of Americans who support taxpayer funding and only 13 percent that support abortion on demand. So the fact is most Americans look at abortion as to some extent a necessary evil rather than celebrating it and they -- and they draw a line somewhere. They don't want to completely eliminate it, but they want to put reasonable restrictions on it. And the line Joe Biden has drawn which is reasonable to most Americans is that he doesn't want to pay for it. He actually takes seriously a statement that a lot of people throw out there and don't really mean it that I personally oppose abortion. He says if I personally oppose abortion, I shouldn't be forced to pay for it and I think most Americans and most Democrats will see that as reasonable.",

Stalin was really pushing for that to go forward, there was a lot of concern from Churchill whether they could trust Stalin and really buy into the Soviets. But the concern and FDR's concern was that the Soviets could go the other way. That Hitler could go towards the Soviet Union and somehow co-opt their cooperation. So, there was a lot of back-and-forth in this -- in this Tehran meeting that laid the groundwork for the decision that was then put on General Eisenhower. And the agonizing of that decision go-no-go, and the weather, and the behind-the-scenes stories of getting people together General Eisenhower at 3:30 in the morning.

And, you know, you just have a fascinating take on it in your writings. You know, when you look back now, everything's in retrospect. Right? And I put myself in the current moment that we live in. Covering politics and covering what's going on in the world. And you think about the tensions and the escalation from China. You look at what's going on with Iran. And you know the realignment of nations in many ways that we are witnessing and you just wonder, Bret, you know, what it's going to be like when we look back 20 years from now and look, for example, at China, which clearly in this moment has an aspiration at world dominance."

Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin. You know, what that means for the big picture of things is really a big question as far as geopolitical, three-dimensional chess, if you will. That's what today's speech, I think, for President Trump was such a big deal. It kind of was 30,000 feet. It was bigger. It was -- it met the moment. And as I said on \"SPECIAL REPORT\" earlier, I think it was one of his best speeches if not the best of his presidency. And he's had some big ones. If you look back at Warsaw, Poland, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The State of the Union Address that we covered the last time that was filled with a kind of rhetorical moment. History is going to look at big speeches as it looks back. Obviously, it'll look at the presidency overall. But in the lens of history, speeches are big moments, and this was a big moment for President Trump."

I think anytime you have a constitutional right guaranteed by the Supreme Court it shouldn't be denied people because they can't afford it. I think the Vice President should take a re-look at this because as the Planned Parenthood clinics are being closed in many southern and western states, then poor women have absolutely no access towards abortion, and I think that's their right under the Constitution. And I think in light of that, I hope the vice-president does reassess his position. But I'm for Joe Biden regardless of whether I disagree with him on this issue because I don't think there's one out of the 25 candidates who I agree with on every single issue.

      "speaker": "THIESSEN",

The -- we now know that it with the exception of Joe Biden, every Democrat running for president supports taxpayer-funded abortion on demand up until the moment of birth. That is an extraordinary statement, an extraordinary position because the fact is the majority of Americans do not support taxpayer-funded abortion on demand up until the moment of birth. So Joe Biden is allying himself with the majority of Americans and even the majority of Democrats. There are only 29 percent of Americans who support taxpayer funding and only 13 percent that support abortion on demand. So the fact is most Americans look at abortion as to some extent a necessary evil rather than celebrating it and they -- and they draw a line somewhere. They don't want to completely eliminate it, but they want to put reasonable restrictions on it. And the line Joe Biden has drawn which is reasonable to most Americans is that he doesn't want to pay for it. He actually takes seriously a statement that a lot of people throw out there and don't really mean it that I personally oppose abortion. He says if I personally oppose abortion, I shouldn't be forced to pay for it and I think most Americans and most Democrats will see that as reasonable."

I think most Americans realized that those constitutional rights shouldn't be given based on your ability to pay. So I think it's changing and the circumstances are changing. And a good elected official always has a viewpoint but that viewpoint can be changed by circumstances. So I would urge him to look at the circumstances. In one state, there's absolutely no Planned Parenthood clinic anymore. So what's a poor woman to do if she wants to exercise her constitutional right?"

The Supreme Court has said that you can have --"

And you've got -- his job as running for president is to try to win back those Obama-Biden voters in your state, in states like Ohio, and Michigan, the industrial Midwest that defected to Donald Trump. And those people are not -- are pretty socially conservative. They don't support abortion on demand taxpayer-funded up until the moment of birth. So I think the Democratic Party is putting himself in a bad position by taking such an extremist position on abortion and Joe Biden is dialing that back just a little bit. And it's -- and it's like it's a controversy that you know, he's going to be excommunicated for it. And I think that just shows the extremism of the Democratic Party when it comes to abortion."

I think Joe Biden would make a great president.

They're on D-Day. But it was such an incredible speech. I mean it was hard to watch that speech without tearing up several times.

It's about honoring those heroes. But do you think that he is making an effort to be sort of, you know, to win over some people who perhaps have seen his behavior as something that they might say as unpresidential, things along those lines?

But being the president is something that no one gives you a handbook and says this is how you do it. He has never been a politician before in his life. He is figuring it out all along the way. And so, I think it was very clear how passionate he is about our country, how passionate he has about veterans and those people who without giving their lives, we probably wouldn't be here today. We wouldn't be living in the same world. So, I think that may be what's shown through there. But he's certainly figuring it out every day and he's going to get better and better at it."

But you know, the polls that I mentioned at the top, I want to take a look at these because obviously it's very early, but take a look at Michigan. Now, take a look at Texas where the president is under water in a Quinnipiac Poll against Joe Biden, Biden at 48 percent, Trump at 44. That's an unusual poll coming out of Texas, Lara."

Who even knows if Joe Biden is going to be the Democrat who runs against Donald Trump in 2020. We don't know who it will be yet. But the polls -- and I always say this -- but they have never been accurate when it comes to Donald Trump. Even days before the election in 2016, we saw that they had Hillary Clinton up by huge margin and yet Donald Trump still won.

It was one of the many moving moments as our nation pays tribute to the brotherhood of selfless, humble and incredibly brave man who risked it all for us, and Jack is one of them.

So, we need to lead to a new generation of weapons systems. The Army has outlined six modernization parties that begin with what's called long-range precision fires all the way down to (inaudible) number six. And a big number five in there or number four is integrated air missile defense.

And then they can hit and impact with incredible speed and velocity. So, it creates great damage just by the impact alone and because they can maneuver they're difficult to defend against. Now, the good news is the three services have gone together, the Army, Navy, and Air Force, and are working together on our own hypersonic systems that we each would employ.

      "utterance": "Well, they are the greatest generation. And I feel privileged because I not only served in the 101st and in Desert Shield and Desert Storm, but I served in the 82nd over here in Europe and I served in the 29th Infantry in the National Guard. The 29th Infantry are the ones -- part of the -- with the first infantry division that stormed the beaches here bloody Omaha. And so, when you walk these grounds and you talk to some of the old soldiers that are here, it just -- it lifts your spirits. If you know what these young men at that time did, how they sacrificed, they climbed the cliffs at Pointe du Hoc, where I was yesterday. The paratroopers are in, like you said, amidst the gunfire and a great deal of uncertainty. It just -- it stirs your soul. And what I try to do as Army secretary is look back and look at what did they do to prepare themselves? How did they train? What was your equipment? So, as I think about how we man train and equip the Army, we can capture those same qualities to make sure that our future soldiers can really embrace those attributes that those young men had to win the day so we can win the day in the future."

      "utterance": "It's hard to see. We have exceptional quality through our volunteers and they bring us a good deal of diversity as well. And again, these young men and women we see today joining the military are fantastic. I believe they will be ready when the time comes. But I think the Army right now is very capable. We continue to grow the Army because we need to put capabilities back into it or we need to add capabilities. And I think we're ready. We are ready I know for sure. And I think we'll be ready in the future as well."

It all began three days ago with the actors from the hit show, Band of Brothers, who so many people have watched. Many of them were so moved and inspired by the events depicted in the series that they worked so hard on. They traveled to Normandy to pay tribute to the men who actually did it. Here's a look back of this week's really memorable moment. Let's watch."

They just let me right in without it. I have people coming up and hugging me and running to meet me and take pictures of me and I was just -- it was like euphoria. Then I went to the gravesites and walked to the graves and emotion took over and I just -- I didn't realize I broke down. I said once then, when I was there, I'm going to salute them, pray for them, and I cried. I have to cry, but I did all of those things that I promised I would do."

He spoke on this day in 1984 to commemorate the 40th anniversary of D-Day and honor the boys of Pointe du Hoc, the courageous second ranger battalion scaled the 100-foot cliffs to seize German artillery and prevent American landing troops at Omaha Beach and Utah Beach being fired upon. He is President Reagan."

      "utterance": "You were young the days you took these cliffs. Some of you were hardly more than boys with the deepest joys of life before you, yet you risked everything here. Why? We look at you and somehow know the answer. It was faith and belief. It was loyalty and love. The men of Normandy had faith that what they were doing was right, faith that they fought for all humanity, faith that a just God would grant them mercy on this beach end or on the next. Strengthened by their courage, hardened by their value, and born with their memory. Let us continue to stand for the ideals for which they lived and died."
