      "sentences": "Ship last year was allowed to burn for days due to both individual and systemic failures. It was due to a crew that was \"inadequately\" prepared to battle the blaze. Yes, inadequately prepared. You know, if only there were some water nearby to put out the fire. A report finds that there were widespread lapses in training, coordination, communication, fire preparedness, equipment, maintenance, and overall command and control. But other than that, everything ran great. Of course, how important really are those variables as long as you denounce white rage when communicating with the firefighters? After all, those long hoses represent the patriarchy that's been oppressing women for centuries. So, the Navy had to scrap the ship because it would have taken seven years and $3 billion to fix it. Of course, Trump weighed in and said he could do it in 10 months for under 10 grand if they agreed to rename the ship. So, almost believable. Somehow, fixing this ship doesn't qualify as infrastructure. But free education for illegals does. So we can't put out a fire. But we did read up on anti-racism and white supremacy. We can't fight fires, but we can fire military academy members simply because they were appointed by Trump. Today, it seems that wokeism is the only thing that's flame retardant. Well, that in Biden's Spider Man pajamas. But it shows how we are beating China at beating ourselves. I wonder what the angry white male has to say.",

For every new standard, their weapons set, we lower a standard in our schools. We are our very own enemy now and we don't even have to lift a weapon. We are the weapon. Because when our military and intelligence sees the typical American as a threat, China already won. Of course, we never made it hard for them. That country has the advantage of not having an academic media and entertainment establishment that works overtime to subvert their security. But that I guess that's part of America being a free country. But why be so maliciously stupid about it? Just because we can destroy ourselves? Why should we destroy ourselves? That's something my primary care physician asked me every time he sees me shirtless. China also does not produce social justice warriors, whereas we become the world's assembly line of these fascist cretins. A nuclear weapon can destroy a city but just one woke warrior could destroy everything without blowback radiation. No wonder China embraces woke American companies. China gets paid by America while propping up a pernicious ideology that permanently craps all over America. It's like paying a hitman to shoot yourself. Our companies embrace Black Lives Matter here while embracing slave labor there. And like the women's soccer team in Tokyo, America loses -- like the rub it in. Because we ignore -- we ignore the bigger, uglier problem while obsessing over problems that don't exist.",

Not really, I could seriously not give a (BLEEP). But for professors, but for professors, their jobs depend on it. You know, according to an e-mail sent to faculty, students requested the pronouns for inclusivity and to better represent their preferred identities. Meanwhile, Margaret Atwood, the author of the ultimate feminist novel, \"The Handmaid's Tale,\" is riling up woke-sters because she still likes using the word woman. She retweeted an op-ed titled: \"Why can't we say woman anymore?\" which apparently is a controversial new term for creatures born without external genitalia. As expected, the faceless, nameless, genderless Twitter mob is coming for her. We go to an outraged member of that mob for comment. I admire what they said. I did it. I did it.

      "utterance": "Happy glorious Wednesday, everyone. What a Wednesday it is, or was because it's late. So, earlier this week, people really freaked out about China launching that nuclear capable hypersonic missile. It's an advanced and weaponry that surprised U.S. officials. I know. Who knew that China would launch something harmful that ends up going around the world? Probably should have been prepared for that. Apparently, the Long March rocket ended up missing its target by only 24 miles. But it's just like getting up in the middle of the night to pee. It's close enough to matter. But look, I think we're focusing on the wrong stuff. China may have just launched a hypersonic weapon, but we're killing them in so many other areas. Like for example, they only have two pronouns. We have 237. And despite launching a rocket, yes, they have no diversity programs. Have you ever seen a picture of all of their astronauts? They're all -- they're all Chinese. How dare you clap for that racism? Meanwhile, we're really good at building non binary bathrooms complete with private changing rooms, in case you feel like hitting the battlefield looking fun and flirty. We may lose the war, but we'll all be buried in Versace's fall collection. True, Chinese schools are so good. They turn out many of our top stem college grads, but our schools are better because we've learned teaching math is racist. They're colonizing their neighboring countries, but we are decolonizing science, right? I don't know what that means. But don't get depressed. While China is busy trying to destroy us, we are too. Do you think China's got an edge on America? You haven't seen how America is doing against America. We are killing it literally. Yes, we are kicking our own ass. And we don't need your help, China we already beat you to it. We have a black belt and self-destruction. Take this barely reported story. It's a big story. According to the New York Post, a fire that was started by a sailor slash arsonist that destroyed the massive navy ship, the USS Bonhomme Richard. Don't correct me."

Yes, inadequately prepared. You know, if only there were some water nearby to put out the fire. A report finds that there were widespread lapses in training, coordination, communication, fire preparedness, equipment, maintenance, and overall command and control. But other than that, everything ran great. Of course, how important really are those variables as long as you denounce white rage when communicating with the firefighters? After all, those long hoses represent the patriarchy that's been oppressing women for centuries. So, the Navy had to scrap the ship because it would have taken seven years and $3 billion to fix it. Of course, Trump weighed in and said he could do it in 10 months for under 10 grand if they agreed to rename the ship. So, almost believable. Somehow, fixing this ship doesn't qualify as infrastructure. But free education for illegals does. So we can't put out a fire. But we did read up on anti-racism and white supremacy. We can't fight fires, but we can fire military academy members simply because they were appointed by Trump. Today, it seems that wokeism is the only thing that's flame retardant. Well, that in Biden's Spider Man pajamas. But it shows how we are beating China at beating ourselves. I wonder what the angry white male has to say."

For every new standard, their weapons set, we lower a standard in our schools. We are our very own enemy now and we don't even have to lift a weapon. We are the weapon. Because when our military and intelligence sees the typical American as a threat, China already won. Of course, we never made it hard for them. That country has the advantage of not having an academic media and entertainment establishment that works overtime to subvert their security. But that I guess that's part of America being a free country. But why be so maliciously stupid about it? Just because we can destroy ourselves? Why should we destroy ourselves? That's something my primary care physician asked me every time he sees me shirtless. China also does not produce social justice warriors, whereas we become the world's assembly line of these fascist cretins. A nuclear weapon can destroy a city but just one woke warrior could destroy everything without blowback radiation. No wonder China embraces woke American companies. China gets paid by America while propping up a pernicious ideology that permanently craps all over America. It's like paying a hitman to shoot yourself. Our companies embrace Black Lives Matter here while embracing slave labor there. And like the women's soccer team in Tokyo, America loses -- like the rub it in. Because we ignore -- we ignore the bigger, uglier problem while obsessing over problems that don't exist."

I would have, I would have come out ahead as far as I was concerned. But, but it's also why no one who worries about this stuff will ever accomplish anything. They -- and you cannot put them in charge of anything. If you gave them a dairy, and you said OK, produce milk, and they went and got a bunch of boy cows and put them in the dairy, they would have a bunch of very happy cows, but they would not.

The city said, the Fisherman's Wharf location wasn't checking the vax status of its customers. The chain's actual response, \"We refuse to become the vaccination police for any government,\" good for them. Quite a contrast from the free rectal probes they're offering at Burger King. Now, that's what I call have it your way. You can't buy a burger but you can still shoplift. Soon, that will be the only way to get a burger or a prescription. Walgreens is closing five San Francisco location citing the huge rise in organized retail theft. But the liberal, Mayor London Breed, denies that theft was the issue. She argues that Walgreens had a hard time making money because there were so many locations around town. But with that logic, shouldn't their heroin dealers have been going out of business too? So, yes, I don't believe your eyes, London, all that shoplifting had nothing to do with the shop closing. It's amazing, even the mayors are denying reality and siding with thuggery. The thefts in the closing are just a coincidence much like Barry Bonds hitting all those home runs while his head doubled in size. In and out, Kat, they usually describes how my body handles their food."
