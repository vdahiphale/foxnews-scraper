Temperatures dropped to lows that didn't even seem real. Parts of the State of Illinois fell to 38 degrees below zero this morning. That's a new state record. In Thief River Falls, Minnesota, the temperature approached 80 below. Cold like that will turn hot coffee to ice crystals before it hits the ground. Stay outside for any length of time and you will die and a number of people did in that region. They were found froze to death in the last few days.  Meteorologists -- and this is the good news -- say it will warm up soon. Climate change will continue as it always has. Spring will come. But this is a good reminder of something. Energy matters. It keeps us alive. What would happen if you didn't have energy?  Well, that's something we maybe need to consider very soon because of something called the \"Green New Deal.\" What is that? It's not clear. Take a look now at a description by the chief proponent of the Green New Deal. Watch.",

Now, before we can assess whether getting to that point -- no fossil fuels in 12 years -- is even possible, it is, as the Congresswoman just said, an ambitious goal, let's consider what it would mean for the United States. No fossil fuels would mean no coal, no oil, and no natural gas. And that would mean no cars and no airplanes. It would mean shutting down the single most vibrant part of the entire U.S. economy which is the energy sector. It would mean putting at least six million Americans out of work immediately.   As of today, America is the largest oil producer in the world. The country exports more natural gas than any other place. More than 90% of all of our energy comes from fossil fuels and nuclear power, so we have to figure out a way to replace that in 12 years, using primarily solar and wind power. Ambitious? Well, that's one way to describe it. More destructive than a major war on U.S. soil would be another way to describe it. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand calls the prospect of all of this, quote, \"a really exciting thing.\" Kamala Harris agrees. Bernie Sanders isn't simply a fan, he says eliminating fossil fuels immediately is a moral imperative.",

Talk to someone who studies energy and see for yourself. We are nowhere near being able to do any of this. Wind power is a scam. It's an elaborate rip off perpetuated on impoverished rural America by a few heavily subsidized corporations that are getting rich from making the landscape uglier. Solar is a promising technology, actually, but we're still far being able from being able to efficiently store the energy it produces and storage is key in a power grid.  Solar is not a replacement for fossil fuels now or any time soon, and anyone who tells you otherwise hasn't bothered to learn anything about it - that would be describe most of the people pushing the Green New Deal. How well is wind power going to heat your house when it's 30 below? What is the range exactly on those new solar passenger jets?  Well, they don't know and they don't care because none of it applies to them, it never does. But we think the science is really interesting, and so we want to go with really quickly with Daniel Turner. He is Executive Director and Founder of Power the Future, and he joins us now. Mr. Turner, thanks very much for coming on. So you are hearing an increasing number of people and I want to be open-minded about this, but say that we are going to get rid of all fossil fuels in the United States and switch to something called \"renewables\" in a dozen years.

Central Park.   So when Representative Ocasio-Cortez says we are going to power the entire country on renewables, there just isn't the land to come up with the solar farm or the wind necessary to have these renewables.

Hillary Clinton said that she didn't send or receive any classified e-mail. We know that's a lie. Jim Comey said he was never the source or never the director of leaked information. He later admitted that that was not true even though it was the subject of his sworn testimony before Congress. And you'll remember Clapper, told all the American people before Congress that there was no bulk collection of data. The Deputy Director of the FBI, Mr. McCabe, he lied four times. He lied so frequently, he was demoted and referred for criminal prosecution. But a whole lot of these other people haven't been and it's the greatest evidence that Robert Mueller is not a person in search of the truth. He's out to get Trump and the people close to Trump, because if he wasn't, if he was unbiased, you would have seen similar charges brought against other these other people.

      "sentences": "It's hard to think of a recent innovation that has changed our society more profoundly than the smartphone has. A machine many times more powerful than the supercomputers that guided the moon landing, shrunk to the size of a Crackle bar. Suddenly it's possible to text your college roommate in Burma or FaceTime with your grandkids in Cape Town. You can order toilet paper on Amazon while flying to Los Angeles. You can answer every question on \"Jeopardy\" correctly without learning a thing. The sum total of human knowledge resides right in your pocket. There's no longer reason to stare out the window. Entertainment now fills the space where reflection used to be. You can play Candy Crush at red lights. You can slay foes on Fortnight while waiting in line at the DMV. Nothing is the same since we got the smartphone. We've only had it for about a decade. Imagine where we will be 20 years from now. Well, you probably can't imagine that actually. Imagination takes concentration and if you're like most of us, you know longer have the capacity to concentrate for very long. You're too distracted by your smartphone. When was the last time you read a book cover-to-cover? When was the last time you sat through an entire dinner without wondering who was texting you? Or talk to your spouse or kids for more than an hour without checking your device? Been a while? The cost of all of this progress has been high. How high? Well, the signs are all around us -- endemic loneliness, a rising suicide rate, a country where huge groups of people hate each other. At some point, we'll know exactly what we've traded in exchange for faster sushi delivery. In the meantime, though, it's worth considering what this technology means for our children. About a quarter of kids under six now have smartphones by the age of 10. The devices are ubiquitous. The average teen spends at least nine hours a day staring at a screen online. Parents abet this. They buy smartphones because their kids demand smartphones and we justify this by telling ourselves, it's for their safety. Now you can reach your daughter after soccer practice or your son when the movie gets out. And that's all true. But what are the other effects? Science is just beginning to answer that question and the results are grim. A new study in America's top pediatrics journal finds that high levels of screen time are associated with delayed cognitive development in small children. Studies by the National Institutes of Health have found the same thing. Hours spent staring at devices, lowers kids scores on thinking and language tests. Smartphones have made our kids dumber. It's measurable. But they've also made our kids much less happy. Thanks to smartphones, kids have nonstop access to Facebook, Instagram and other social networks and the science is very clear on that. The more time you spend liking social media posts and updating your Facebook status, the less healthy you are. A 2015 University of Missouri study found that Facebook use made people more depressed and increased their envy of others. A 2016 study found that quitting Facebook boosted psychological health. Last fall a study in the \"Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology\" found that social media use is directly tied to feelings of loneliness and depression, which can lead to life threatening psychiatric disorders. It's not surprising then that rates of mental illness and suicide among teens began to surge right around 2012. That's just as smartphones and social media became universal. You probably didn't need to study to know all this. If you're a parent, it's obvious. Smartphone use makes your kids sadder, slower and more isolated, and over time can kill them. That's all certainly obvious to the people who make the phones and that's why so many executives in Silicon Valley restrict their own children's technology use. The software they make is addictive. It was engineered to be that way. As Facebook's first President once explained in a burst of candor quote, \"We need to give you a little dopamine hit every once in a while. God only knows what it's doing to our children's brains,\" end quote. Well now, we do know. We know enough anyway. The question is, what are we going to do about it? Most parents will do nothing, not because they don't want what's best for their kids. They do. But because in real life, it's just too difficult. Try taking an iPhone away from a seventh grader. You'll learn a lot about what addiction means. It's like trying to get a junkie into rehab. You cannot do it alone. Parents need help. And there's no reason that the Congress which made smartphones possible in the first place shouldn't be part of the solution. So here's an idea. Ban smartphone use for children. Pass a Federal law tomorrow. Why wouldn't we do that? An addictive product that science has determined which gravely harms kids? Sound familiar? Once upon a time, people actually argued against age limits for cigarette sales. It's hard to remember exactly what their arguments were. They seem so mindless and embarrassing now. Well, in case you haven't been convinced that big tech is a direct threat to the health and happiness of your children. Here's another data point. Since 2016, Facebook has been paying kids as young as 13 to install a program on their phone that, unbeknownst to them, gives Facebook access to all of their phone data. Josh Hawley is a senator. He represents the state of Missouri. We're glad to have him in Washington, and on our set. Senator, great to see you.",

It's the perfect distillation of every stale cliche our ruling class uses to celebrate itself packed into 280 characters or less, but then a sharp-eyed Twitter user notice something about the pictures. Zoom in a little bit to the left in the background. Behind the two laughing politicians is a reminder that this country has changed quite a lot from the period 50 years ago that permanently shaped the sensibilities of our baby boom leaders. There's a man there he's lying on a bench unconscious. There's a can of malt liquor underneath him. There are thousands of men like this right now in every big American city. Maybe that's why Harris and Abrams didn't notice him. He's just a feature of the landscape. This is the world they created and you're happy with it. Well, American politics is increasingly haunted by a strange new specter, the \"Woke Billionaire.\" They've got a ton of money, but otherwise they sound a lot like socialists.

As of today, America is the largest oil producer in the world. The country exports more natural gas than any other place. More than 90% of all of our energy comes from fossil fuels and nuclear power, so we have to figure out a way to replace that in 12 years, using primarily solar and wind power. Ambitious? Well, that's one way to describe it. More destructive than a major war on U.S. soil would be another way to describe it. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand calls the prospect of all of this, quote, \"a really exciting thing.\" Kamala Harris agrees. Bernie Sanders isn't simply a fan, he says eliminating fossil fuels immediately is a moral imperative."

Talk to someone who studies energy and see for yourself. We are nowhere near being able to do any of this. Wind power is a scam. It's an elaborate rip off perpetuated on impoverished rural America by a few heavily subsidized corporations that are getting rich from making the landscape uglier. Solar is a promising technology, actually, but we're still far being able from being able to efficiently store the energy it produces and storage is key in a power grid. Solar is not a replacement for fossil fuels now or any time soon, and anyone who tells you otherwise hasn't bothered to learn anything about it - that would be describe most of the people pushing the Green New Deal. How well is wind power going to heat your house when it's 30 below? What is the range exactly on those new solar passenger jets? Well, they don't know and they don't care because none of it applies to them, it never does. But we think the science is really interesting, and so we want to go with really quickly with Daniel Turner. He is Executive Director and Founder of Power the Future, and he joins us now. Mr. Turner, thanks very much for coming on. So you are hearing an increasing number of people and I want to be open-minded about this, but say that we are going to get rid of all fossil fuels in the United States and switch to something called \"renewables\" in a dozen years. Could we do that?"

The largest solar farm in the nation does not produce enough kilowatts to power the New York City Subway System, and that farm is 4,000 acres, which is five times the size of Central Park. Central Park. So when Representative Ocasio-Cortez says we are going to power the entire country on renewables, there just isn't the land to come up with the solar farm or the wind necessary to have these renewables.

It may be incompatible with life, it may be unviable to live outside the womb. So I think that what he was talking about was an unviable fetus who has been delivered and is probably only going to survive outside of the womb for a short period of time. And that is a decision as far as how to proceed for those couple of hours between the physician and between the mother. He is not talking about a full-term, healthy mother and a full-term healthy child giving birth and then committing infanticide following that birth.

But the impulse of so many is to defend this. So I'm confused. What are the standards? He said, and I think I'm quoting him exactly \"profound abnormalities.\" He didn't say the chat was going to die anyway, he said, the child is disabled, for example, that's a real thing.

The problem, Tucker, is that he's enforcing them unequally and so I'm introducing the Justice for All Act, which would create criminal referrals for the people that we know have lied to Congress. Hillary Clinton said that she didn't send or receive any classified e-mail. We know that's a lie. Jim Comey said he was never the source or never the director of leaked information. He later admitted that that was not true even though it was the subject of his sworn testimony before Congress. And you'll remember Clapper, told all the American people before Congress that there was no bulk collection of data. The Deputy Director of the FBI, Mr. McCabe, he lied four times. He lied so frequently, he was demoted and referred for criminal prosecution. But a whole lot of these other people haven't been and it's the greatest evidence that Robert Mueller is not a person in search of the truth. He's out to get Trump and the people close to Trump, because if he wasn't, if he was unbiased, you would have seen similar charges brought against other these other people.

      "utterance": "It's hard to think of a recent innovation that has changed our society more profoundly than the smartphone has. A machine many times more powerful than the supercomputers that guided the moon landing, shrunk to the size of a Crackle bar. Suddenly it's possible to text your college roommate in Burma or FaceTime with your grandkids in Cape Town. You can order toilet paper on Amazon while flying to Los Angeles. You can answer every question on \"Jeopardy\" correctly without learning a thing. The sum total of human knowledge resides right in your pocket. There's no longer reason to stare out the window. Entertainment now fills the space where reflection used to be. You can play Candy Crush at red lights. You can slay foes on Fortnight while waiting in line at the DMV. Nothing is the same since we got the smartphone. We've only had it for about a decade. Imagine where we will be 20 years from now. Well, you probably can't imagine that actually. Imagination takes concentration and if you're like most of us, you know longer have the capacity to concentrate for very long. You're too distracted by your smartphone. When was the last time you read a book cover-to-cover? When was the last time you sat through an entire dinner without wondering who was texting you? Or talk to your spouse or kids for more than an hour without checking your device? Been a while? The cost of all of this progress has been high. How high? Well, the signs are all around us -- endemic loneliness, a rising suicide rate, a country where huge groups of people hate each other. At some point, we'll know exactly what we've traded in exchange for faster sushi delivery. In the meantime, though, it's worth considering what this technology means for our children. About a quarter of kids under six now have smartphones by the age of 10. The devices are ubiquitous. The average teen spends at least nine hours a day staring at a screen online. Parents abet this. They buy smartphones because their kids demand smartphones and we justify this by telling ourselves, it's for their safety. Now you can reach your daughter after soccer practice or your son when the movie gets out. And that's all true. But what are the other effects? Science is just beginning to answer that question and the results are grim. A new study in America's top pediatrics journal finds that high levels of screen time are associated with delayed cognitive development in small children. Studies by the National Institutes of Health have found the same thing. Hours spent staring at devices, lowers kids scores on thinking and language tests. Smartphones have made our kids dumber. It's measurable. But they've also made our kids much less happy. Thanks to smartphones, kids have nonstop access to Facebook, Instagram and other social networks and the science is very clear on that. The more time you spend liking social media posts and updating your Facebook status, the less healthy you are. A 2015 University of Missouri study found that Facebook use made people more depressed and increased their envy of others. A 2016 study found that quitting Facebook boosted psychological health. Last fall a study in the \"Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology\" found that social media use is directly tied to feelings of loneliness and depression, which can lead to life threatening psychiatric disorders. It's not surprising then that rates of mental illness and suicide among teens began to surge right around 2012. That's just as smartphones and social media became universal. You probably didn't need to study to know all this. If you're a parent, it's obvious. Smartphone use makes your kids sadder, slower and more isolated, and over time can kill them. That's all certainly obvious to the people who make the phones and that's why so many executives in Silicon Valley restrict their own children's technology use. The software they make is addictive. It was engineered to be that way. As Facebook's first President once explained in a burst of candor quote, \"We need to give you a little dopamine hit every once in a while. God only knows what it's doing to our children's brains,\" end quote. Well now, we do know. We know enough anyway. The question is, what are we going to do about it? Most parents will do nothing, not because they don't want what's best for their kids. They do. But because in real life, it's just too difficult. Try taking an iPhone away from a seventh grader. You'll learn a lot about what addiction means. It's like trying to get a junkie into rehab. You cannot do it alone. Parents need help. And there's no reason that the Congress which made smartphones possible in the first place shouldn't be part of the solution. So here's an idea. Ban smartphone use for children. Pass a Federal law tomorrow. Why wouldn't we do that? An addictive product that science has determined which gravely harms kids? Sound familiar? Once upon a time, people actually argued against age limits for cigarette sales. It's hard to remember exactly what their arguments were. They seem so mindless and embarrassing now. Well, in case you haven't been convinced that big tech is a direct threat to the health and happiness of your children. Here's another data point. Since 2016, Facebook has been paying kids as young as 13 to install a program on their phone that, unbeknownst to them, gives Facebook access to all of their phone data. Josh Hawley is a senator. He represents the state of Missouri. We're glad to have him in Washington, and on our set. Senator, great to see you."

It's a tweet from California Senator Kamala Harris. She's running for President. Attached is a picture of her laughing with her friend, Stacey Abrams of Georgia quote, \"There's no better person to showcase our country's strengths and speak the truth after the State of the Union,\" Harris writes of Abrams. Senator Harris's social media consultant must have been proud of that tweet, and you can see why. It's the perfect distillation of every stale cliche our ruling class uses to celebrate itself packed into 280 characters or less, but then a sharp-eyed Twitter user notice something about the pictures. Zoom in a little bit to the left in the background. Behind the two laughing politicians is a reminder that this country has changed quite a lot from the period 50 years ago that permanently shaped the sensibilities of our baby boom leaders. There's a man there he's lying on a bench unconscious. There's a can of malt liquor underneath him. There are thousands of men like this right now in every big American city. Maybe that's why Harris and Abrams didn't notice him. He's just a feature of the landscape. This is the world they created and you're happy with it. Well, American politics is increasingly haunted by a strange new specter, the \"Woke Billionaire.\" They've got a ton of money, but otherwise they sound a lot like socialists. How does that work exactly? Venture capitalist, Nick Hanauer recently declared that Alexandria Ocasio- Cortez is at the very beating heart of American politics, and he is for that. Watch."

That's true centrism. What Howard Schultz represents, the centrism he represents, is really just trickle-down economics -- tax cuts for rich people, deregulation for powerful people and wage suppression and benefit cuts for everyone else without the overt racism. He is not the centrist, AOC is this centrist."

Author and columnist, Mark Steyn has some ideas about that, and he joins us today. What's going on here, Mark Steyn? MARK STEYN, AUTHOR AND COLUMNIST; Well, I think the woke billionaire is a phenomenon of our time. The way you get rich now is not the way you got rich in the days of the 19th Century Robber Baron's in the Gilded Age. It's possible to do it now, while being ever more disconnected from the concerns of ordinary people. So these woke billionaires, I think, they're a lot like rock stars. You know, Bono, for example, goes on about debt forgiveness for Africa, but when he wanted to save money, he moved his music publishing firm from Dublin to Amsterdam for the lower taxes. He doesn't move it to Wagadugu and give a big injection into the African economy. And I think that's actually the way these guys are. They understand that they're in a world in which striking attitudes that preserve their own power base is actually more important than anything else."

And they're smart enough because they are smart by and large, that's how they got rich - to understand that there there's a lot of roiling politics right beneath the surface and the main theme going forward is the populist economics and guys like them could get crushed. So do you think this is a defensive move?"

So you know, Google doing the old double Irish as they call it, by routing its money from one Irish company to another and then into a British tax haven like Bermuda. The whole point is to actually create a world in which there's an elite at the top and a vast mass underneath and not a lot of -- and the escalator to get from the bottom to the top is running ever slower and with an ever fewer people able to get on it."

      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Don't you think though there should be some standard? I mean, if you're a billionaire who's going to go on MSNBC and call for a revolution, shouldn't we get to see your tax returns and assess the tax havens that you're using to prevent paying your fair share? I mean, isn't that sort of a minimum requirement for this?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STEYN",
      "utterance": "Well, I think actually, on the left there's a huge acceptance now that the rules they want to apply to others don't apply to them. So if you made your money in say coal or construction and you want to keep your - and you want to keep that money in the Cayman Islands, or Bermuda or the Channel Islands, you're a bad person. But if you're - you don't even have to be a businessman. If you're the Southern Poverty Law Center and you have that ridiculous name and yet you have billions salted in, as I said British colony tax havens, then that's okay. The left has a high degree of tolerance because they actually think it's different when they do it. That's their basic view of it, and I think that's true with these guys. I mean, everyone knows you can salt all your money away in these little Irish Bermudan tax loopholes, not pay tax here but still get invited to the Obama White House and be standing between Obama and Bill Clinton. It won't affect that."
