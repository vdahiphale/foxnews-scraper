And today, after spending most of the week in hiding, Joe Biden finally issued a public statement and even answered four questions. But he's proud of his work in Afghanistan. Hmm, I wonder how their families feel. I wonder how the people caught behind enemy lines feel.  Now, of course, the reporters were all pre-selected. As per usual, Joe -- well, he called their names from his little list. He put to -- obviously put together by his staff, and at no point did Joe mention the Americans that he abandoned and left behind to suffer under the Taliban that have now brought back full Sharia law and that means -- yes, the death squads exist, women and children can't go to school, girls can't go to school, women and girls that is, and nor did he mention his drone strike that killed humanitarians and -- yeah, seven children and zero terrorists. Instead, Joe again congratulating himself on what was his debacle of a withdrawal from Afghanistan, says he won't make apologies for the way it all went down. Wow, pretty arrogant, Joe.

Why didn't you do it in April, May, June, July when you had full control of Kabul and could have done all of that safely and gotten everybody home?   You said you wouldn't abandon them and you did. You should apologize for that, Joe. It's only one small part of his bizarre rambling defensive speech where a very irritated looking Joe Biden attempted to blame -- to blame everybody but himself, for every crisis he created, he caused them all. You know, scolding border patrol and people that won't listen to his one-size-fits- all medicine from a guy that never went to medical school and frankly was a horrible student on top of all of it. First, with COVID cases spiking all around the country, 300 percent higher than last year, condemning every American who has not received a COVID-19 vaccine, lecturing them. What about people with rare conditions, Joe? What about people that just had COVID and it's recommended they not get the vaccine while their antibody level is high?  According to Joe Biden, they're destroying this country. And now, more vaccine mandates are headed your way. Thanks to Joe, Dr. Joe.",

      "sentences": "And why, Joe, are you controlling all the monoclonal antibodies and rationing it, considering it's shown such great success? I know you only heard about them a week and a half ago. Federal mandates are not only unconstitutional. But they're also deeply unpopular especially for whatever reason, I don't know, like New York City. African-Americans in New York City, it's a little over 30 percent that have been vaccinated.  But according to Joe, he's just following his science, unless, of course, it interferes with his political agenda. Today, what is being called a, quote, boost for Biden's campaign to give a broad segment of Americans access to boosters, the CDC director single-handedly actually overruled her own agency, the CDC advisory panel, to recommend COVID booster shots for a variety of American workers.  And according to even \"The New York Times,\" it's highly unusual this decision. So, what, politics first, science second? Joe? It's also highly unusual that the Biden administration is rationing these therapeutics, monoclonal antibody treatments like Regeneron in red states.  Now, Governor Ron DeSantis who actually set up centers all throughout the state of Florida, now he's had to go out on his own and buy them himself.   Joe never mentioned these until last week. But for Joe Biden, finding someone to blame for his failures, that's more important than protecting American lives. Look at the border, for example. It doesn't take a genius to figure out that is an unmitigated disaster of his making and has been for seven months -- yeah, a real crisis that they've been denying.  Thousands of migrants packed together in horrific squalid conditions, many infected with COVID-19, women and children are being trafficked, physical sexual assault is occurring on a large scale, virtually none of the migrants undergo any proper vetting whatsoever about radical backgrounds.  There's no COVID-19 testing, and people are then being released into the U.S. and no vaccine mandate for them either. This week, Haitian illegal immigrants attack pilots and ICE officials on multiple transport flights. Clearly, health and background checks are very important but according to Joe Biden the real crisis -- well, he's going after border patrol agents and their horses. They are fighting back fiercely saying this is all a lie, but here's what Joe is saying.",

I guess forget about due process or presumption of innocence, what about the people that ordered the don't drone strike, Joe? Oh, that would be you, the one that killed seven innocent children and humanitarian workers.  What about the people who planned the botched withdrawal from Afghanistan that resulted in 13 dead American soldiers, trapping hundreds of our fellow Americans behind enemy lines? What about the people that you abandon in Afghanistan that have green cards, our Afghan allies, all their families? What about the people who cause this border crisis and told these migrants to surge the border?   If I become president -- think about it -- according to Joe Biden, his twisted logic, a border patrol agent on horseback with a long rein is evil but leaving thousands of Americans and our allies behind in Afghanistan that will be tortured and many killed by the Taliban that are very professional and business-like as he quote turns the page, that's a success?  Make no mistake, American enemies are all watching. All our enemies know, China knows, Russia knows, the Iranian mullahs know. Kim Jong-un knows, that Joe Biden is a cognitive mess and weak and frail and incompetent on virtually every major issue. They don't respect and they don't fear Joe Biden. China, for example, oh, they've been circling Taiwan where they planned their reunification with fighter jets. What are you going to do, Joe? Because yesterday, the People's Republic of China, they sent 19 jets and today, they sent 24. They know you are too weak and spineless and you won't lift a finger, will you, Joe? You'll abandon Taiwan, just as you abandon people in Afghanistan, your own citizens.   Now, Joe Biden has harsher rhetoric for the American people than he does for the communist party of China. Hmm, probably China has compromising materials on Hunter. For example, Joe Biden now likes to lecture and scold Americans for not paying your fair share in taxes, which is ironic. I'll explain.",

Today, the DHS Secretary Mayorkas said there have been 12,400 of Haitian migrants from under the bridge in Del Rio who have been released into -- to initiate removal proceedings. What that means is they basically just start a process that on average because there's a one and a half million immigration case backlog in the courts, that takes about two and a half years. So, we have gone from a couple days ago hearing from officials here that I these migrants do not intend to stay in the in the United States for a long period of time.

Of course, a photograph has to be looked at in context and that's what the photographer is saying. I would argue and Secretary Mayorkas said something remarkable today in his statement. That this was an example of systemic racism, absolutely absurd and remarkably a disgusting statement. The fact is there is Democratic racism. It is systemic in the Democrats, and it is this environment that they've created -- having rhetoric and policy and encouragement for people of color effectively, Hispanics and black people coming to this border undergoing sex trafficking, child molestation, indentured servitude, sickness, suffering and you know what their reward's going to be low-wage jobs that the Americans won't take. That is the racism putting those people in this position and then having the border patrol do their job. But let me tell you, is that there is no one the Democrats and Biden won't throw under the bus. Whether it is an innocent family in Afghanistan by droning them with a bomb or the border patrol.

And a couple of thoughts on this interview today, OK, and what happened during the show. After Ana Navarro and Sunny Hostin two we're escorted off the set made show, Joy Behar could be seen and heard coughing loudly on several occasions which completely encapsulated this moment perfectly. And, look, when the interview finally did begin, you want to hear some of the questions that the vice president got? Here's Behar while not coughing, quote, is it time to get tougher on mandates and make to life tougher for the unvaccinated, unquote? Sarah Haines, the other co-host, quote, Madame Vice President, we've been discussing those images of U.S. border agents on horseback, inhumanly corralling Haitians of the U.S. border and you've been tasked with immigration. How do you explain this? And as you justly before, Harris has used the slavery analogy when talking about border agents, considering she once compared ICE to the KKK. This is totally on brand. And in a related story, by the way as you said the photographer who took those viral images said Border Patrol was not whipping anyone and the photos were being misconstrued that guy should be on \"60 Minutes\" this Sunday and put an end to this narrative that the president is pushing as well when he says that border agents will pay, they'll pay for their actions. Oh that sounds like a very fair investigation. Here's another question from Haines which was really an advocacy position in the form of a question. Haines, quote: will the Biden administration halt all deportations of Haitians at the Texas border and allow for Haitians to apply for asylum? And Behar running PR, quote, we're here today basically to make a big announcement around broadband access, Behar says to Harris. So I want to give you time to talk about that.

Hmm, I wonder how their families feel. I wonder how the people caught behind enemy lines feel. Now, of course, the reporters were all pre-selected. As per usual, Joe -- well, he called their names from his little list. He put to -- obviously put together by his staff, and at no point did Joe mention the Americans that he abandoned and left behind to suffer under the Taliban that have now brought back full Sharia law and that means -- yes, the death squads exist, women and children can't go to school, girls can't go to school, women and girls that is, and nor did he mention his drone strike that killed humanitarians and -- yeah, seven children and zero terrorists.

Why didn't you do it in April, May, June, July when you had full control of Kabul and could have done all of that safely and gotten everybody home? You said you wouldn't abandon them and you did.

Today, what is being called a, quote, boost for Biden's campaign to give a broad segment of Americans access to boosters, the CDC director single-handedly actually overruled her own agency, the CDC advisory panel, to recommend COVID booster shots for a variety of American workers. And according to even \"The New York Times,\" it's highly unusual this decision. So, what, politics first, science second? Joe? It's also highly unusual that the Biden administration is rationing these therapeutics, monoclonal antibody treatments like Regeneron in red states. Now, Governor Ron DeSantis who actually set up centers all throughout the state of Florida, now he's had to go out on his own and buy them himself. Joe never mentioned these until last week. But for Joe Biden, finding someone to blame for his failures, that's more important than protecting American lives. Look at the border, for example. It doesn't take a genius to figure out that is an unmitigated disaster of his making and has been for seven months -- yeah, a real crisis that they've been denying. Thousands of migrants packed together in horrific squalid conditions, many infected with COVID-19, women and children are being trafficked, physical sexual assault is occurring on a large scale, virtually none of the migrants undergo any proper vetting whatsoever about radical backgrounds. There's no COVID-19 testing, and people are then being released into the U.S. and no vaccine mandate for them either. This week, Haitian illegal immigrants attack pilots and ICE officials on multiple transport flights. Clearly, health and background checks are very important but according to Joe Biden the real crisis -- well, he's going after border patrol agents and their horses. They are fighting back fiercely saying this is all a lie, but here's what Joe is saying."

I guess forget about due process or presumption of innocence, what about the people that ordered the don't drone strike, Joe? Oh, that would be you, the one that killed seven innocent children and humanitarian workers. What about the people who planned the botched withdrawal from Afghanistan that resulted in 13 dead American soldiers, trapping hundreds of our fellow Americans behind enemy lines? What about the people that you abandon in Afghanistan that have green cards, our Afghan allies, all their families? What about the people who cause this border crisis and told these migrants to surge the border? If I become president -- think about it -- according to Joe Biden, his twisted logic, a border patrol agent on horseback with a long rein is evil but leaving thousands of Americans and our allies behind in Afghanistan that will be tortured and many killed by the Taliban that are very professional and business-like as he quote turns the page, that's a success? Make no mistake, American enemies are all watching. All our enemies know, China knows, Russia knows, the Iranian mullahs know. Kim Jong-un knows, that Joe Biden is a cognitive mess and weak and frail and incompetent on virtually every major issue. They don't respect and they don't fear Joe Biden. China, for example, oh, they've been circling Taiwan where they planned their reunification with fighter jets. What are you going to do, Joe? Because yesterday, the People's Republic of China, they sent 19 jets and today, they sent 24. They know you are too weak and spineless and you won't lift a finger, will you, Joe? You'll abandon Taiwan, just as you abandon people in Afghanistan, your own citizens. Now, Joe Biden has harsher rhetoric for the American people than he does for the communist party of China.

The administration talks a lot about how if you make the journey to the U.S., you will not be successful. Today, the DHS Secretary Mayorkas said there have been 12,400 of Haitian migrants from under the bridge in Del Rio who have been released into -- to initiate removal proceedings. What that means is they basically just start a process that on average because there's a one and a half million immigration case backlog in the courts, that takes about two and a half years. So, we have gone from a couple days ago hearing from officials here that I these migrants do not intend to stay in the in the United States for a long period of time.

This is a perfect illustration of how the Democrats led by Joe Biden are anti-police, anywhere and everywhere. That's his message today. Don't enforce America's laws. When you see somebody breaking into our country, let them in. He's also saying to police forces everywhere, no more horse patrols anywhere. Has anybody's ever been to Bourbon Street? They have horse patrols there. Is that somehow inhumane? The purpose of those patrols is to deter people from coming into the country.

And then we're going to -- now, Joe is begging OPEC to increase production.

He even blames his staff for not calling on certain reporters that he doesn't want to call. Unlike Trump, he'll just say I'm not calling on you because I think you're a liar, he just blames other people. Let's -- here's my point, that he can -- he has the opinions on these issues. You know that Biden rescinded -- and I just wrote a list of like things in a second during your monologue -- he rescinded the wall, he rescinded zero tolerance, he rescinded the Paris agreement, he rescinded the travel ban, he rescinded Keystone, he rescinded Trump's policy on transgender in the military. They have this view of America that is not the view that most people in this country have, and the problem that Biden has now is that when -- because he ran as this guy of competency, when this mess on the border comes to light because they don't care if hundreds of thousands of people pour over the border. But every once in a while, they got a really bad camera shot and they've got 15,000 Haitians under a bridge and people start wondering, wait a minute, this guy's not very competent. They see what happens in Afghanistan. Thirteen service people are killed tragically. Wait a minute, this guy is not competent.

They're meant to keep people away and to move them away. The horses can also get frightened by certain environments and those reins are used to maintain control of those horses as well. Of course, a photograph has to be looked at in context and that's what the photographer is saying. I would argue and Secretary Mayorkas said something remarkable today in his statement. That this was an example of systemic racism, absolutely absurd and remarkably a disgusting statement. The fact is there is Democratic racism. It is systemic in the Democrats, and it is this environment that they've created -- having rhetoric and policy and encouragement for people of color effectively, Hispanics and black people coming to this border undergoing sex trafficking, child molestation, indentured servitude, sickness, suffering and you know what their reward's going to be low-wage jobs that the Americans won't take. That is the racism putting those people in this position and then having the border patrol do their job. But let me tell you, is that there is no one the Democrats and Biden won't throw under the bus. Whether it is an innocent family in Afghanistan by droning them with a bomb or the border patrol. If they want to win a new cycle, they want to distract nothing is off the table and that's what we're watching here."

      "utterance": "And, Joe, even Mexican-American agents have defended their fellow agents on this saying, that is not the case, you know? But if we're going to look at root causes of things, because Kamala, the borders czar, had to go Central America to find the root cause of why people are coming, it couldn't be her invitation, and Joe's invitation. But if we're going to look for root causes, they invited people. They're not enforcing the laws. By not enforcing the laws and processing people into the country, they have encouraged these large groups of people to keep coming and coming. We went from a 25-year low under Trump's policies which they abandon and we're probably now headed to a 25 or 30-year high of illegal immigrants, that they are just processing into the country, aiding and abetting the lawbreaking."

      "utterance": "And instead of going too central Del Rio or instead of going to La Jolla, the vice president goes too Central Park in essence, ABC studios, to go on \"The View\". How tone-deaf. I mean, if the vice president, currently pulling at 35 percent approval in \"The USA Today\", if she need a state say space, Sean, this was the Wrigley Field of friendly media confines. And a couple of thoughts on this interview today, OK, and what happened during the show. After Ana Navarro and Sunny Hostin two we're escorted off the set made show, Joy Behar could be seen and heard coughing loudly on several occasions which completely encapsulated this moment perfectly. And, look, when the interview finally did begin, you want to hear some of the questions that the vice president got? Here's Behar while not coughing, quote, is it time to get tougher on mandates and make to life tougher for the unvaccinated, unquote? Sarah Haines, the other co-host, quote, Madame Vice President, we've been discussing those images of U.S. border agents on horseback, inhumanly corralling Haitians of the U.S. border and you've been tasked with immigration. How do you explain this? And as you justly before, Harris has used the slavery analogy when talking about border agents, considering she once compared ICE to the KKK. This is totally on brand. And in a related story, by the way as you said the photographer who took those viral images said Border Patrol was not whipping anyone and the photos were being misconstrued that guy should be on \"60 Minutes\" this Sunday and put an end to this narrative that the president is pushing as well when he says that border agents will pay, they'll pay for their actions. Oh that sounds like a very fair investigation."

      "speaker": "Here's another question from Haines which was really an advocacy position in the form of a question. Haines, quote",
      "utterance": "will the Biden administration halt all deportations of Haitians at the Texas border and allow for Haitians to apply for asylum? And Behar running PR, quote, we're here today basically to make a big announcement around broadband access, Behar says to Harris. So I want to give you time to talk about that. This is like getting into the ring with Mike Tyson in his prime, isn't it, Sean? How did Kamala survive this onslaught, that's what I want to know."

They really were angry, and I will tell you -- I have spoken to a lot of the border patrol guys, they are apoplectic over the rush to judgment and the accusations of racism of the border patrol over this horse incident. I'm not a horse person, I don't know if you are, Leo, I'm not. But these long reins, they use to control the horse. Also, if people are getting close to the animal, it could cause a situation where people can get severely injured. There's a lot of factors in play here that you know if you don't rush to judgment, you might actually hear a reasonable answer."

It's purely a lie. I am so happy tonight, I want to thank the state of Texas for telling Al Sharpton to get out of Texas, that they don't play the race card. Al Sharpton went down there to play the race card, and the people in Texas say, we don't play that here. Go back to New York. Sean, what they were trying to do -- Al Sharpton -- was trying to change the narrative from the dereliction of duty of Joe Biden on the southern border and play the race card. People of Texas said, no, we don't play that here. You go back into New York, go back to Chicago, and L.A. We don't play the race card. Systemic racism does not exist. I am proud of Texas for throwing Al Sharpton out of the state."

      "utterance": "The main argument that Border Patrol is making and their union is making is that they are saying this to distract from the policies they put in place that caused this, that now has put us on a path where hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants are entering this country each and every month and will send a 25, 30-year record high. They have put the border patrol in the worst position possible, in the middle of a pandemic. Now not only a high rate of COVID positivity among those illegally entering the country. They're not being tested. There's no vaccine mandate, but border patrol have a very high incident of COVID positivity, because they're taking care of people in overcrowded cages and the unsanitary conditions that we see in Del Rio."

    {
      "speaker": "TERRELL",
      "utterance": "Sean, it's very clear. You know why this is happening? Because the progressive left do not want a border. And I'll tell you right now about the border patrol officers, they have been defamed. They have been humiliated. They have been accused of racism, and there's not a single shred of fact. They have been basically attacked as pawns by the Democrats because, Sean, what you have just articulated about the border, it's a refugee camp, and what the Democrats and Al Sharpton tried to do was change the narrative. No one can ignore what's happening at the southern border, it's a war zone and like I said, again, Al Sharpton, state of Texas does not play the race card, does not play. Play that stuff up back in New York. But I am proud of the state of Texas for throwing Al Sharpton out. It's great day today."
