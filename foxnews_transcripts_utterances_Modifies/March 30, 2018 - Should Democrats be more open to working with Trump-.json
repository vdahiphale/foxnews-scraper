He won't let anybody escape it because victimization is his only source of power. He has nothing else to offer. Nothing to say about the economy, immigration, whatever. Nor do most people on the left have much to say about those issues, but they can sure call people racist, take positions that give them this sort of aura of innocence from the Americans.

I absolutely get that slavery, this abomination, is different than a lot of things that happened in political life. This is something like the holocaust that can't be forgiven.

And when you look at it from that perspective I think it gives a greater degree of understanding why statues like that should really be in museums. Now when it comes to somebody like Thomas Jefferson, for example, he is much more than a slave owner. That was a past sin of his, but this is somebody who created, had a hand in creating the Declaration of Independence. And he said all men are created equal. In addition to that he was the president. He was a governor. He was the secretary of state. So this is an individual I think that we can celebrate, although he did have past sins.

An entire lifespan, maybe not so much with everyone.

And look, I'm not a black person. I don't know how it feels to walk by one of these statues, and maybe you are told this person hated you and didn't think you were a real person. I can't imagine that. But I do think that people who especially worked for reconstruction or forgiveness for bringing and healing the country, especially those people, I think we are on a real slippery slope if we start saying like -- look, these Hofstra students, they're serious. They were serious at Princeton about Woodrow Wilson, a great internationalist. Democrat hero. Woodrow Wilson has to go off the Wilson Center. This is what one of the Hofstra students said on FOX News, the right to peaceful protest and assembly is at the core of our democracy. Hofstra supports our student's rights to engage in peaceful demonstrations about issues that matter to them. We look forward to continuing civil exchange of ideas on the subject. That's what their statement was to FOX News. But it looks like groups of students mobilized at Princeton University, not successfully yet, but I think it's a matter of time before Thomas Jefferson gets put in that same place as Robert E. Lee, who past American presidents including FDR hailed as one of the greatest generals we have ever had. One of the greatest Christians gentlemen we have ever had.

And I don't think that that gets anyone anywhere. But I will say this much. There was a time in this country at the beginning of the reaction to reconstruction, the beginning of Jim Crow where statues were erected specifically to stick it to black people, to let them know who was still boss and who was subordinate. Those statues, I think, they may have the facade is a historic monument but the real purpose is a racialist social statement rather than historic remembrance.

That's good stuff. Now, it doesn't mean that everything is perfect and there aren't big disagreements. I think that D.C.C. polling that came out this week. Dan, you can comment on this. That showed that in swing districts especially, Democrats really would be well-served to at least appear to be trying to work with the president on some of these issues. And I think when you see the comments by Greenberg Quillen Research, they say look, in these swing districts, they must be willing to express hope and desire to work with this president when his agenda might help in the district.

The Democrats are out of ideas in the legislative and policy realm and they've moved seamlessly into the culture fight. I mean, Laura, what are they going to run on? Let's raise your taxes. The government should have a bigger role in your health care. By the way, give us your kids in public schools and let's forget school choice. They can't put that on a campaign sign.

Again, liberalism goes after examples of victimization. What's amazing about Mr. Sharpton, he has a passion for black victimization. He loves it. He celebrates it. He won't let anybody escape it because victimization is his only source of power. He has nothing else to offer. Nothing to say about the economy, immigration, whatever. Nor do most people on the left have much to say about those issues, but they can sure call people racist, take positions that give them this sort of aura of innocence from the Americans. I'm not a racist. I'm an innocent, good-hearted American. We're going to go and have diversity and inclusion and so forth while they actually ignore the real problems. If you have got 762 boys being shot on the south side of Chicago in one year that suggesting a profound, almost unheard of level of human pathology particularly in the western world.

Someone actually raises a point about, you know, what happens when our fighting forces become social experimentation places. Then you are anti-trans or anti-this or anti-that instead of having a conversation, what works best for the military or what works best for borders. You are anti-immigrant. So, the left does not want a discussion. They want to impose their will on others and if you do not bow down to them.

Nuts and bolts of it, how do we fix a problem like the family breakdown we see across the black America today? What do we do there pragmatically down on the ground that can actually move us into the modern world? Now that as blacks we enjoy this level of freedom. What's going to take us -- help us meet that challenge? Nothing to say. They want to take us back to the old world. He wants to fly to Sacramento.

I absolutely get that slavery, this abomination, is different than a lot of things that happened in political life. This is something like the holocaust that can't be forgiven.

And when you look at it from that perspective I think it gives a greater degree of understanding why statues like that should really be in museums. Now when it comes to somebody like Thomas Jefferson, for example, he is much more than a slave owner. That was a past sin of his, but this is somebody who created, had a hand in creating the Declaration of Independence. And he said all men are created equal. In addition to that he was the president. He was a governor. He was the secretary of state. So this is an individual I think that we can celebrate, although he did have past sins. These other individuals, however, their past sins was the majority of their career from the viewpoint of having a Confederacy."

He helped build schools for minority children and he did so much work to try to bring the fabric of the community together. I mean, he is a beloved person postwar. So, yes, sins of slavery, horrific. An entire lifespan, maybe not so much with everyone. And I agree with Geraldo that painting every historical figure that was living in the south at the time and might have even fought in the war with this brush of put him away, take him away in the middle of the night, put it somewhere we don't even know, I think that does not serve us all that well. And look, I'm not a black person. I don't know how it feels to walk by one of these statues, and maybe you are told this person hated you and didn't think you were a real person. I can't imagine that. But I do think that people who especially worked for reconstruction or forgiveness for bringing and healing the country, especially those people, I think we are on a real slippery slope if we start saying like -- look, these Hofstra students, they're serious. They were serious at Princeton about Woodrow Wilson, a great internationalist. Democrat hero. Woodrow Wilson has to go off the Wilson Center. This is what one of the Hofstra students said on FOX News, the right to peaceful protest and assembly is at the core of our democracy. Hofstra supports our student's rights to engage in peaceful demonstrations about issues that matter to them. We look forward to continuing civil exchange of ideas on the subject. That's what their statement was to FOX News. But it looks like groups of students mobilized at Princeton University, not successfully yet, but I think it's a matter of time before Thomas Jefferson gets put in that same place as Robert E. Lee, who past American presidents including FDR hailed as one of the greatest generals we have ever had. One of the greatest Christians gentlemen we have ever had. That's FDR's commemoration of Robert E. Lee. So this is a wild territory we are in. And I don't know where it ends, guys."

So Senator Kennedy was one of those who picked John Calhoun as one of the great -- that was in the 1950s. My fear is that as contemporary mores and values and who is in and who is out change we'll continually be erasing. History will have to be written in pencil rather than in ink. And I don't think that that gets anyone anywhere. But I will say this much. There was a time in this country at the beginning of the reaction to reconstruction, the beginning of Jim Crow where statues were erected specifically to stick it to black people, to let them know who was still boss and who was subordinate. Those statues, I think, they may have the facade is a historic monument but the real purpose is a racialist social statement rather than historic remembrance. And I think you can look at them, and it's easy to find their providence and history and determine how you feel about them based on that."

All right, guys, let's talk about this. Hillary Clinton has been on a book tour that never ends. It just goes on and on and on. It's like Cher's farewell tour, it just keeps going on and on and on.

Look, she did lose the election. Actually, she lost the Electoral College because 3 million more people voted for her than President Donald Trump. She lost the Electoral College. But she is in her private life getting paid to do speeches, selling her book. And so why does the right wing want to harp on what Hillary Clinton says? I don't think Hillary Clinton gives two cents about what the right wing is doing. So leave her alone. Let her be. Hillary has served our country well, first lady, secretary of state, U.S. Senate.

Now we are looking to the future for the Democrat Party, and they have Kamala Harris, they have a lot of interesting people. That's the point. It's not about sexism, Antjuan.

It's been the team's chaplain and diehard supporter, 98-year-old Sister Jean Dolores Schmidt, a.k.a. Sister Jean. She's been rooting for the team for six decades, since Eisenhower was president, and has captured the hearts of fans and foes alike. Sister Jean may be the only nun to inspire an entire sports merchandise line. Everything from t-shirts to socks and, yes, even Sister Jean bobbleheads. \"USA Today\" reports that sales of Sister Jean merchandise has been through the roof leading up to tomorrow night's game. I love it. The 11 seed Loyola Chicago Ramblers take on the three seed Michigan Wolverines in San Antonio. Great match up.
