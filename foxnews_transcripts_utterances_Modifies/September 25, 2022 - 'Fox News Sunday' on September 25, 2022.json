Number two, lower the price of energy, I hear that from my constituents in Upstate New York, whether it's home heating bills or the price of gas. We have multiple bills that have already been introduced that Democrats refuse to bring up when it comes to lowering those energy costs. When it comes to supporting our law enforcement and having a nation that's safe, we have legislation that'll immediately provide funding through recruitment and retention bonuses to hire additional 200,000 police officers across this country. When it comes to freedom -- a future that's built upon freedom -- I highlighted the Parents Bill of Rights. This is a bill that Republicans already introduced and we are going to have ready to pass in the first 100 days in the next Congress. Day one, we intend to repeal the 87,000 IRS agents, the army of IRS agents that Joe Biden and Democrats have put into place to go after hardworking Americans, moms and pops, small business, and middle class Americans. So, Democrats have no plans, they are attacking us because they are created crises across the country. We have the commitment to tackle the crisis that Democrats have created to make sure that we have a strong economy, a safe country, a future that's built upon freedom and a government that's accountable.",

But, most importantly, Shannon, the American people, our constituents provided input in this process. Those are where our best ideas come. And the reality is, Democrats have no plans when it comes to inflation. They have no plan when it comes to the crime crisis or the border crisis. These crises have been created by Democrats, unifying control of government in Washington. Republicans have a plan.

That's compared to the most unsecured border under Joe Biden. It's been a crisis with over 3 million illegals who have crossed the border. And those are the ones that we count. That doesn't include the significant number of gotaways. So, this is a crisis that Democrats have created themselves. The American people are smart. They know that while Joe Biden started his inauguration day trying to unify the country, they have done nothing but dividing -- divided the country. So, Republicans are going to achieve this, I think not only we are going to earn back the House, but we are going to earn back the Senate as well. And we will send every bit of legislation that we promised to the president's desk and it's up to Joe Biden whether he works with us or whether he will play politics and veto these important bills to rein in inflation, to support law enforcement to make sure we have a safe country, and to secure the border which is in free fall under Biden's amnesty policies.",

We have this border crisis because of the amnesty policies and the wide open border that's happened under Democrat government, under Joe Biden. This is the most insecure border in our nation's history. Go to South Texas, we have a president of the United States and a vice president who refused to go to the southern border. The vast majority of House Republicans have gone to the Southern border. We've seen with our own eyes Del Rio, Eagle Pass. We've seen that this is a humanitarian crisis, an economic crisis, a national security crisis. All of these border issues, all of this immigration crisis is a result of Joe Biden's failure. We have the most secure border in our nation's history, as I said, under President Trump. We know the policies that work. It's build the wall. It's end catch and release. And it's to make sure that we have a rule of law in this country. So, Republicans will absolutely work to secure the border. Shame on Hakeem Jeffries for being a partisan pawn. He has a record as being the most pro-amnesty, one of the most pro-amnesty Democrats in this current Congress. And the reality is, Republicans are polling plus 39 when it comes to border security in the most recent NBC poll. We're plus 19 on the issue of immigration. So, this is -- this is an issue of safety. It's an issue of security and it's an issue of who we are, the United States of America.",

But what's his motivation here? And I think he's brandished these weapons before, or at least he's had his surrogates do it. And I think he's had some success with it because it delayed the distribution of advanced weapons that Zelenskyy was begging for, for weeks and weeks and weeks. And it finally took months before we got those systems to him. He likely knows that on the table the United States is considering sending to Ukraine advanced fighters, like F-16s, after training the Ukrainians, tanks, infantry fighting vehicles and other equipment that will help the Ukrainians with a spring counteroffensive, which would be conventional, combined arms to drive them out of the Donbas region. So, he likely would like to curve that. Now, let's assume he's serious and the use of a nuclear weapon is actually on the table, which I think is probably very low. But if you consider that, here's the factors he's got to consider. He would use the nuclear weapon and want to end the war. And that's not going to happen. The Ukrainians, the people, as well as their military, are steadfast. They openly talk about the possibility of a nuclear weapon being targeted against them and they are going to fight and continue to fight. The second thing is, his army on the battlefield, they're not trained to deal with a radioactive nuclear battlefield. The Soviet Union was. They were equipped to properly trained. These guys aren't trained to fight a conventional fight, much less deal with an environment like that. And then the third thing is, this is about taking it serious. I believe the Biden administration has reported that they're talking to Putin and his surrogates about the consequences here. And I hope we're very direct with him about what their consequences would mean. I think that's likely an expansion of the war. It brings the United States and NATO into it. Not to use nuclear weapons, we wouldn't do that. I don't even think we would put a significant amount of ground troops. But we would conduct devastating air and missile attack, largely to destroy his military, inside of Ukraine. And he knows that and so does his military people know that. He wants to win the war.

And we said that we would help Taiwan defend itself, made no statements about whether we would physically help them to defend themselves in terms of our own troops. That is called the strategic ambiguity. But, in the last 10 years, look what has happened. President Xi has accelerated the military intimidation and cohesion of Taiwan. Not only that, on repeated occasions he has said, if - if Taiwan does not capitulate and become a part of mainland China, then he will use military force to take control. Now, all of this activity that he's done in 10 years to include threatening military force, I would suggest he has violated the 1979 Taiwan agreement to maintain peace and stability.

Now, does that make any sense to anybody? No. But that's not important. The fact is, the Israelis believed it. And they believe that Iran clearly has this intent to destroy the state of Israel. So, this is a dangerous point we're at. It can lead to conflict, whether there is or not a nuclear deal, because Iran is in pursuit of a nuclear weapon.",

Here we go again with the Department of Justice and now the New York attorney general, who is running for election again on this idea of going after Donald Trump.

What it doesn't have is a whole lot of specificity. You heard that from the president, from other Democrats, too, who say, there are a lot of slogans. Yes, everybody wants a safe country. They want good education. They want crime to go down. But it's the details of how you do that that matter. So, why not more details in this plan?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STEFANIK",
      "utterance": "Shannon, there are ample details. So, number one, an economy that's strong. The first focus on economic issues is we need to rein in inflation. We start by doing that by reining in the reckless trillions of dollars of spending that we have seen under Joe Biden and unify Democrats far left government. Number two, lower the price of energy, I hear that from my constituents in Upstate New York, whether it's home heating bills or the price of gas. We have multiple bills that have already been introduced that Democrats refuse to bring up when it comes to lowering those energy costs. When it comes to supporting our law enforcement and having a nation that's safe, we have legislation that'll immediately provide funding through recruitment and retention bonuses to hire additional 200,000 police officers across this country. When it comes to freedom -- a future that's built upon freedom -- I highlighted the Parents Bill of Rights. This is a bill that Republicans already introduced and we are going to have ready to pass in the first 100 days in the next Congress. Day one, we intend to repeal the 87,000 IRS agents, the army of IRS agents that Joe Biden and Democrats have put into place to go after hardworking Americans, moms and pops, small business, and middle class Americans. So, Democrats have no plans, they are attacking us because they are created crises across the country. We have the commitment to tackle the crisis that Democrats have created to make sure that we have a strong economy, a safe country, a future that's built upon freedom and a government that's accountable."

Steny Hoyer, the House majority leader, Democrat, says that this was about distracting from your narrative and your own deep divisions. \"The Washington Post\" also talks about this in the context to the Freedom Caucus, the more conservative members of the GOP, saying: They're expected to make starker demands of leadership in exchange for their votes. I talked to some members of the Freedom Caucus who do feel like they are being taken for granted a bit in this process. What would you say to them and about accusations you guys are divided?"

All members of Congress were able to provide input in this development of the Commitment to America. But, most importantly, Shannon, the American people, our constituents provided input in this process. Those are where our best ideas come. And the reality is, Democrats have no plans when it comes to inflation. They have no plan when it comes to the crime crisis or the border crisis. These crises have been created by Democrats, unifying control of government in Washington. Republicans have a plan. We have legislation on each and every one of these issues, and we can't wait to get it done starting on day one as we earn back the House majority."

      "utterance": "Well, first of all, Steny Hoyer is dead wrong. Look at the success. Look at the economic growth that we saw under Republican leadership, working with the House, the Senate, and the White House. We have the most secure border in our nation's history. That's compared to the most unsecured border under Joe Biden. It's been a crisis with over 3 million illegals who have crossed the border. And those are the ones that we count. That doesn't include the significant number of gotaways. So, this is a crisis that Democrats have created themselves. The American people are smart. They know that while Joe Biden started his inauguration day trying to unify the country, they have done nothing but dividing -- divided the country. So, Republicans are going to achieve this, I think not only we are going to earn back the House, but we are going to earn back the Senate as well. And we will send every bit of legislation that we promised to the president's desk and it's up to Joe Biden whether he works with us or whether he will play politics and veto these important bills to rein in inflation, to support law enforcement to make sure we have a safe country, and to secure the border which is in free fall under Biden's amnesty policies."

      "speaker": "BREAM",

Democrats say you don't have a better plan, and they don't think that this is a good look. In that poll, a majority of Americans said that they don't think it's okay to be transporting people this way. These are real people with real lives.

    {
      "speaker": "STEFANIK",
      "utterance": "Well, first of all, Hakeem Jeffries should start acting like a leader rather than -- rather than a partisan hack. We have this border crisis because of the amnesty policies and the wide open border that's happened under Democrat government, under Joe Biden. This is the most insecure border in our nation's history. Go to South Texas, we have a president of the United States and a vice president who refused to go to the southern border. The vast majority of House Republicans have gone to the Southern border. We've seen with our own eyes Del Rio, Eagle Pass. We've seen that this is a humanitarian crisis, an economic crisis, a national security crisis. All of these border issues, all of this immigration crisis is a result of Joe Biden's failure. We have the most secure border in our nation's history, as I said, under President Trump. We know the policies that work. It's build the wall. It's end catch and release. And it's to make sure that we have a rule of law in this country. So, Republicans will absolutely work to secure the border. Shame on Hakeem Jeffries for being a partisan pawn. He has a record as being the most pro-amnesty, one of the most pro-amnesty Democrats in this current Congress. And the reality is, Republicans are polling plus 39 when it comes to border security in the most recent NBC poll. We're plus 19 on the issue of immigration. So, this is -- this is an issue of safety. It's an issue of security and it's an issue of who we are, the United States of America."

We were addressing the border security crisis, and that has unraveled starting on day one under Joe Biden, who has created this crisis.

He's able to cite and specifically point to GOP policies for those accusations. Is that a party blunder?"

This inflation expansion bill that Democrats just ramp through has tax increases on every working American. Republicans are on the party of lowering taxes. And that's in stark contrast to Joe Biden, Chuck Schumer, and Nancy Pelosi who have raised taxes. When it comes to Social Security and Medicare, Republicans are committed to saving and ensuring those programs exist for future generations, and that means making sure that they are fixed, to exist for my generation and my son's generation. And when it comes to the issue of life, Republicans are proudly pro-life. We support our most vulnerable. I am the newest mom in Congress and I know how important it is to stand up for life. So, Chuck Schumer is attacking and it's because they have no plan. Americans need a change of course. We need true leadership in both the House and Senate who will focus on the crises that hardworking families are facing across this country.

But this is a chance in a lifetime for us to have energy independence, Shannon. For us to have security in this nation, which we need, and making sure that we can take care of the American people with low energy prices, producing more oil, producing more gas.

She's totally supported of my approach basically as incorporated many of the things that she and 46 other Republican senators also had endorsed and agreed. I just hope we can come together as Americans and forget about our party, the party politics that's going on and make this opportunity, a reality that gives us security for our nation, that gives us independence and be able to lower their gas prices, lower the energy prices in America and help our allies around the world."

And \"Politico\" says this. They are quoting Senator John Cornyn, the top Republican. Given what Senator Manchin did on the reconciliation bill, it's engendered a lot of bad blood.

My Republican friends, I've been working for 12 years with them, and I know their number one item that they've had, the number one priority they've had is permitting reform. We can't build anything in America. It takes five to 10 years. The developed world takes one to three years. And why should we so behind the developed world to bringing products to market, to be able to have the infrastructure to move energy around? And we're asking people around the world to do things for us, we won't do for ourself? My Republican friends know exactly where we are. This is not about the previous legislation. This is something, a high priority that we have for our country. It's a -- it's a time in history. If we don't, Shannon, take advantage of this and come together as Americans, we're going to look back five or 10 years from now and wonder why we're not able to meet demands, why are we allowing Putin to kind of control, dictate our energy policies, and what we are trying to respond to and not able to do it in a timely fashion because we can't move the energy in America -- whether it's going to be new transmission lines for renewables or basically for fossils and oil and gas that moves the products we need today.

I'm asking this them to take the opportunity you finally have to make something happen in America, that we can deliver energy that we need, to lower gas prices at the pump, to lower energy prices in your home, and be able to take care and keep ourselves secure and independent, and be able to help our people and Europe who are hurting very badly and allowing Putin to put this absolutely, using energy as a weapon.

They've never been for permitting reform. That's why we never had it. This is one time when overwhelmingly, Democrats in both the House and the Senate are supporting. And from my Republican friends not to see that, which I know they do, and not be able to pass something they've been able to do for twelve years since I have been working with them, it would be basically a lost moment in history if we don't do this. So, I'm hoping that they'll look at what we have in front of us -- the energy independence, security stopping Putin dead in his tracks, being able to do what we need to do to reduce the price of energy and helping people in their homes as far as energy cost there. We have a golden opportunity and we have a majority, overwhelming majority of Democrats supporting it. And they're doing it because this is the right time and the right thing to do for our country. But, also, it's a time we basically can bring Democrats and Republicans together as we've done with the bipartisan infrastructure bill. We've done it with the CHIPS bill. And we continue to do things when we need to do something for our country. This is the most important thing that we can do today.

Right now, Americans are continuing to pay more for everything, including just groceries. We look at August to August, 13-1/2 percent jump last week. And then the markets are plunging and there's this headline. Billionaire investor Carl Icahn warns the worst is yet to come for investors and compares U.S. inflation to the fall of the Roman Empire. So, what regrets do you have at this point in voting for the Inflation Reduction Act which hasn't cool things off, it's not projected to short term or long-term, in exchange for this deal now that may no actually go anywhere on energy?"

The Inflation Reduction Act, basically, first of all, does, puts more energy back into the markets. So, if you want to reduce prices, then put more products out there. If you want to get your gasoline prices down, produce more oil. If you want to get your home heating, produce more natural gas. Do it cleaner than anywhere in the world, replace the dirty energy around the world. And that basically helps the climate and gives us more product. When you reduce basically the Medicare prices of drugs -- in West Virginia, 300,000 West Virginians rely on Medicare. We're reducing their pricing on drugs and so that has to reduce it. When they're saying it's negligible, they're going to see it in the next 30 days? No, will they see it? Absolutely they will see it because this does nothing but gives us a chance to reduce inflation. And I -- you know, I have worked very hard to make sure we had an opportunity to be energy- independent and secure and fight Putin's war. I understood that -- I understood that Bernie Sanders and my left wing of the Democratic Party would never support anything that would let us be energy-independent with the energy we have in our own country."

Anti-mobilization protests erupted across major Russian cities this week that saw more than 1,400 people arrested, further raising pressure on the Russian leader. A mass exodus at the country's borders, prompting neighboring Finland to restrict Russian tourists from entering. Putin trying to do all he can to make up for significant battlefield losses in recent weeks. Today, annexation referendums are underway in Russian occupied areas of Ukraine. The voting to become part of Russia was described as a sham and illegitimate by Ukraine and its western allies."

      "utterance": "Thank you very much. So, let's start on where Trey touched on, these referenda that are being held in Ukraine. \"The New York Times\" reports it this way, it's as Ukrainians were forced to vote while Russian officials or their proxy stood guard. The aim of the hastily called referendums, supported by pro-Russian residents and their proxies, as apparent to give President Putin of Russia a legally bogus pretext to gobble up their country. What are we to make of these votes?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KEANE",
      "utterance": "Yes, he's seeking - he's just had a military defeat that was quite sizable. He's got to conclude that, at least night now, he's losing his war. And this is an attempt to obtain a political victory, largely for his own domestic audience, that they have gobbled up this increased terrain in four different regions in Ukraine. I mean anybody looking at this knows it's a sham, as Trey pointed out and other commentators have. I mean this is a vote at gunpoint and it's not going to mean anything. And it certainly is not going to stop the Ukrainians from continuing their military operations inside these territories. After all, they have conducted some significant attacks inside of Crimea. Espionage attacks and also missile attacks, which have been annexed by Russia since 2014. So, the Ukrainian operations will continue. The political sham, I think, is what it is. And the whole international community sees it as such."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BREAM",
      "utterance": "And it seems like these referendums will also tie into some saber rattling over nuclear use by Putin. \"The Washington Post\" talks about this speech he had on Wednesday. They say he made two references or two threats. He reminded NATO that Russia possesses more modern weapons than the weapons NATO countries have and Putin pledged that Russia would use all weapons systems available to protect its territorial integrity, Russia's people, as well as Russia's independence and freedom. How do you take those nuclear threats?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KEANE",
      "utterance": "Yes, well, first of all, the -- I think the probability of it is pretty low, but you have to take it seriously because of what these weapons, obviously, and the horrific applications and what it would mean to Ukraine and to the world rite large. But what's his motivation here? And I think he's brandished these weapons before, or at least he's had his surrogates do it. And I think he's had some success with it because it delayed the distribution of advanced weapons that Zelenskyy was begging for, for weeks and weeks and weeks. And it finally took months before we got those systems to him. He likely knows that on the table the United States is considering sending to Ukraine advanced fighters, like F-16s, after training the Ukrainians, tanks, infantry fighting vehicles and other equipment that will help the Ukrainians with a spring counteroffensive, which would be conventional, combined arms to drive them out of the Donbas region. So, he likely would like to curve that. Now, let's assume he's serious and the use of a nuclear weapon is actually on the table, which I think is probably very low. But if you consider that, here's the factors he's got to consider. He would use the nuclear weapon and want to end the war. And that's not going to happen. The Ukrainians, the people, as well as their military, are steadfast. They openly talk about the possibility of a nuclear weapon being targeted against them and they are going to fight and continue to fight. The second thing is, his army on the battlefield, they're not trained to deal with a radioactive nuclear battlefield. The Soviet Union was. They were equipped to properly trained. These guys aren't trained to fight a conventional fight, much less deal with an environment like that. And then the third thing is, this is about taking it serious. I believe the Biden administration has reported that they're talking to Putin and his surrogates about the consequences here. And I hope we're very direct with him about what their consequences would mean. I think that's likely an expansion of the war. It brings the United States and NATO into it. Not to use nuclear weapons, we wouldn't do that. I don't even think we would put a significant amount of ground troops. But we would conduct devastating air and missile attack, largely to destroy his military, inside of Ukraine. And he knows that and so does his military people know that. He wants to win the war. If he uses a nuclear weapon, it guarantees that he loses."

      "utterance": "OK, so let's turn to another region of the world also filled with tension at this moment. \"60 Minutes,\" the president said last week, it - we would come, U.S., to Taiwan's defense if China launched an unprovoked attack. And then there was walking back some of that, clarification of that. The Council on Foreign Relations said, while pledging to defend Taiwan from China, Biden shifted on Taiwan independence and it matters because it says the White House has clarified, or they're trying to, that U.S. policy hasn't changed, but officials in Beijing will see this as further evidence that the U.S. is walking away from a one China policy."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KEANE",
      "utterance": "Well, I think the American people must scratch their head here and say, what is going on. In 1979 there was a Taiwan Relations Act that China and the United States agreed to. And the essential ingredient in it that it would govern China's and the United States' behavior as it pertained to the Taiwan Straits. The central theme was peace and stability along those straits. And we said that we would help Taiwan defend itself, made no statements about whether we would physically help them to defend themselves in terms of our own troops. That is called the strategic ambiguity. But, in the last 10 years, look what has happened. President Xi has accelerated the military intimidation and cohesion of Taiwan. Not only that, on repeated occasions he has said, if - if Taiwan does not capitulate and become a part of mainland China, then he will use military force to take control. Now, all of this activity that he's done in 10 years to include threatening military force, I would suggest he has violated the 1979 Taiwan agreement to maintain peace and stability. And I think it's quite appropriate, and even more than that essential, that President Biden make a public declaration -- he said it four times already in response to a question -- but make it a public declaration that Mr. Xi, if you're going to attack Taiwan, you are forcing me to have to respond military to defend it. And I would encourage my allies to do the same. I think that's where we are anyway. Certainly, that is where the president of the United States is. And he is the decisionmaker."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "KEANE",
      "utterance": "Yes, what we have to understand here, you know, you can have an academic discussion about whether nuclear weapons would be used in the Middle East by Iran. That's not relevant. The only thing that's relevant here is, Israel is convinced that if Iran has a nuclear weapon, it's an existential threat because they have repeatedly said for 40 years, they intend to destroy the state of Israel. And I believe they've had intelligence for a number of years that indicates that Iran would do just that. And the fact that they have 9 million people, densely located in a small country, and Iran had 86 million people in the mountainous large country, that Iran had seriously considered destroying the state of Israel and absorbing a nuclear attack themselves and believing that they could survive it. Now, does that make any sense to anybody? No. But that's not important. The fact is, the Israelis believed it. And they believe that Iran clearly has this intent to destroy the state of Israel. So, this is a dangerous point we're at. It can lead to conflict, whether there is or not a nuclear deal, because Iran is in pursuit of a nuclear weapon."

The Justice Department probe is back on track after an appeal. As well the special master is giving the Trump team a hard time. And it seems to me that even Republican senators are saying he can't just mentally declassify documents. But if there's one silver lining here for Donald Trump it is this, the more that he is pursued and persecuted, his word, Republicans feel that he's under attacked by his political enemies, and he still has a virtual lock on the nomination."

He has done things. There have been allegations against him that would take down nearly any other political candidates. They don't, and haven't, with president - former President Trump. In this case, as - and Howie's right, he's got lawyers for a reason. It may not be the politics that brings him down. It could very possibly be the legal - the legal system that brings him down. But, politically, it has been up until now, and almost certainly will continue to be useful for him."

      "speaker": "BREAM",

Dick Wadhams is a long-time GOP strategist. He's quoted in this article. He says, if we lose a lot of Senate races, or House races for that matter, that we should have won, and that can be traced back to the emergence of Trump once again as such a dominant figure in the midterm election campaign, I think that will probably hurt him long-term.

This is also something they did, if you remember going back to 2015 and 2016, they all propped up Donald Trump thinking they could beat him and then he beat Hillary Clinton in that election. So, when it comes to what they want to be talking about, of course Donald Trump is in the news with his legal woes. Joe Biden is off at the top of the headlines. That's good for them when it comes to inflation, especially the market dipping this week. But also it helps with Republican voters in the sense that they do feel like the government has repeatedly brought these charges against the president. They have not been able to prove them. Here we go again with the Department of Justice and now the New York attorney general, who is running for election again on this idea of going after Donald Trump. That is something they like when it comes the narrative. But Republicans see it as another chance to hold government accountable and to roll back this idea that the legal system and federal law enforcement or state law enforcement should be used for political purposes rather than to go after actual criminality."

And if they get the majority, perhaps they will do it. I don't know all the details around and legality of these things. The thing that has struck me the most, and how we touched on it, is a special master who both the Trump team and the Justice department agreed to in this matter involving the search warrant executed on President Trump's home down in Florida.
