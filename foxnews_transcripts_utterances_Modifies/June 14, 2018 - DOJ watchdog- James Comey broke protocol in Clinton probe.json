We'll bring it to you when it happens. Among the many new revelations, the I.G. report blasts former FBI Director James Comey for how he handled the Hillary Clinton email probe, saying he broke protocol.

Well, that, in and of itself, even though we don't have the full context of what they're talking about there, just that in a vacuum will create major fuel to the issue of what was happening behind the scenes. The other thing though to note is that overall at 30 thousand feet, the I.G. says that they couldn't document political bias within the FBI on the decisions made early in the Clinton email case. It does raise questions, though, about the bias that they did find and how that affects the case after July, when the FBI Director Comey comes out with that news statement.",

And then, my other question is Michael Horowitz, the inspector general, had a lot of bipartisan support, lot of credibility across administrations. Congressman Radcliffe said today that he has read the report, he's been briefed on it, and he still maintains confidence in Michael Horowitz, which I guess means that this next I.G. report which is on the actual Clinton emails themselves and that investigation would, at least, have some credibility.",

And that when he made that decision, it was not really his to make. That should have fallen to the Justice Department. No. 2, these text messages between FBI agent Peter Strzok and FBI lawyer Lisa Page, this really hung like a cloud over the Clinton email investigation. The inspector general found that there was no documented evidence that political bias infected the Clinton email investigation. So in other words, that it changed the steps that they took me investigation prior to Comey's statements in July 2016. But just last month, a new text message was uncovered between Strzok and Page where they talk about stopping Donald Trump. And the inspector general said that, in the latter stages of the email case, Agent Strzok made the priority the Russia investigation and not the Clinton emails, and that explained why there was such a delay to go through newly-discovered emails that had been found in late September on Anthony Weiner's laptop that he shared with his wife, Clinton aide Huma Abedin.  On Attorney General Loretta Lynch, the inspector general found that she showed bad judgment when she met with Bill Clinton on that Arizona tarmac in June of 2016, and that she clearly did not understand the implications and sort of the bad optics it would have not only for the public confidence in the Justice Department and FBI but also for the integrity of the email investigation -- Dana.",

It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is \"The Five.\" Breaking news, we're awaiting a press conference from FBI Director Christopher Wray in response to the scaling Justice Department inspector general reports. We'll bring it to you when it happens. Among the many new revelations, the I.G. report blasts former FBI Director James Comey for how he handled the Hillary Clinton email probe, saying he broke protocol. The White House is responding to stunning developments."

      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "One, the big loser, James Comey. This I.G. really goes after the former FBI director for his decision-making. Two, the other loser, Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, and those text messages that are -- that surfaced, more of them, in this report. The biggest of which will be, I'm sure, grasped upon by President Trump and his supporters and that is seven words that -- is an answer to attacks from Lisa Page to Peter Strzok, Trump is never going to become president, right, right? And Strzok then responds no, no, he won't. We'll stop it. Well, that, in and of itself, even though we don't have the full context of what they're talking about there, just that in a vacuum will create major fuel to the issue of what was happening behind the scenes. The other thing though to note is that overall at 30 thousand feet, the I.G. says that they couldn't document political bias within the FBI on the decisions made early in the Clinton email case. It does raise questions, though, about the bias that they did find and how that affects the case after July, when the FBI Director Comey comes out with that news statement."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",

But, in terms of the level of discussion that preceded this, do you think that the take away of what you're hearing from behind the scenes is that this was something that they overpromise, under-delivered, or how would you characterize it?"

    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Yeah. I think, first of all, depending on your political point of view, if you're just talking pure politics, you look at this and there'll be people who say, oh, it's a nothing burger. And the other people will say it's really chock-full of damning things. I think what you'll hear from the FBI Director Chris Wray is that this is a big problem within the FBI. And they're going to probably announce some kind of action that they're taking."

What do you think is next for Jim Comey? Does he keep speaking out? Does he go quiet? Is he investigated further by DOJ? What happens for him next?"
    },

      "speaker": "BAIER",

He obviously made his rounds on the media, including on Special Report. He made the book tour. He kind of laid the groundwork for his defense and, obviously, has this letter to the New York Times. But the stuff in here suggests that he made some big mistakes in the eyes of the inspector general of the justice department. And no matter if you look at it from a Clinton perspective, that there are folks who think he cost Hillary Clinton the election, or a Trump perspective and how he dealt with President Trump after the election."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "I mean he took it on the chin. I mean, they said he committed serious violations of FBI policy and process, and did damage the credibility of the investigation and the institution itself. So, pretty tough stuff coming out of the I.G. report. Dana?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "Well, Bret, in Jim Comey's statement, in reaction to this, right away, first a tweet and then an op-ed in the New York Times, he says, look, I respect the I.G. I think they did a great work here. Reasonable people can disagree. So, he's moving on. Now the Strzok attorney, he did put out a statement as well. But he didn't address these text messages, and I'm curious if you think that might happen? And then, my other question is Michael Horowitz, the inspector general, had a lot of bipartisan support, lot of credibility across administrations. Congressman Radcliffe said today that he has read the report, he's been briefed on it, and he still maintains confidence in Michael Horowitz, which I guess means that this next I.G. report which is on the actual Clinton emails themselves and that investigation would, at least, have some credibility."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Yeah. And I think these are questions that I'm going to ask Chairman Gowdy and Goodlatte, and they'll be on the next hour on Special Report. I think that there's a lot here that tees as Jesse mentioned, the next iteration of the I.G.'s effort. And the second text, the part that says no, no, he won't be president. We'll stop it. That was just released last -- in the past few days, weeks. And the first part where the question was asked, will he be president, was released but the second part was not. You know, that tells you something about transparency and where this document back and forth is going up with Capitol Hill and oversight. I think, to your point, people will look at this and there'll be Republicans who look at it and say it just didn't deliver. And I think others will look at it and say there's a lot in here yet to be mined."

There was a part there where we found out that Comey used his private email to conduct -- I think it was non-classified business, which maybe why he couldn't damn Hillary for doing the same thing because it's like mutually assures destruction. Everybody is guilty of doing the same thing. Could that be part of the reason why he decided not to proceed further?"

Comey is using a private email, even though it's unclassified, to deal with the email investigation of Hillary Clinton. And the I.G. says that's not a good thing. I've got the Gutfeld diaries over here and I've been looking through them."

      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "All right. Kimberly, like we've talked about, some of these nuggets that are coming out and it's going to take probably another 24 hours to get all of them. Her emails were penetrated by a foreign agent. And, that, we really didn't know because Comey himself said it was possible that that happened, and now we learned that it actually did happen. And, one of those emails was considered secret, which means disclosure of that email reasonably could be expected to cause serious damage to the national security of the United States."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUILFOYLE",
      "utterance": "Yeah. I think this is significant because much was made at the time. Well, it's possible but there was no nailing it down. But, obviously, they knew and were not honest about it. And, essentially, what I call that is a cover-up. Like, why if you knew that in fact that they've had been penetrated and he'd been read, etcetera, by or accessed by a foreign agent, that is significant. It is a security breach of the highest order, and something that is very disconcerting for us for national security. But, there you go, Hillary Clinton, the rules of law do not apply to her or to Mr. Comey. Birds of a feather flocking together."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Right, another weasel move by the director. Marie, some of the nuggets that I'm really interested deal with Strzok, because they keep coming, the, we'll stop it, meaning we'll stop the Trump presidency, when you pair that with, we need to protect the country from Donald Trump, and we need an insurance policy in case he is elected, and now FBI agents are calling Trump supporters retarded, at least 5 FBI agents exchanging anti- Trump, pro-Hillary text messages. The I.G. says there was willingness to take official action to impact Trump's electoral prospects. That sounds pretty serious to me."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HARF",
      "utterance": "It does. And I think they demonstrated incredibly bad judgment. But the I.G. also found that there was no evidence of political bias or improper motivation affected the Hillary email investigation. So, what I've always said is, these people should not have been doing this. It was stupid. It looks bad. And the I.G. actually found that, that it looks bad, it called into question the investigation impartiality. But there's no evidence that their personal views impacted --"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HARF",
      "utterance": "I think it's important -- selective history, fake news. I think that it's important that they did not find evidence of political bias impacted the investigation. They've also found that they had no way, no ability to prosecute Hillary Clinton under the five statutes they've examined. So, I'm not in a tree, but the department of justice looked into the question that a lot of Republicans and Trump supporters keep bring up, and found, in fact, that they did the right thing here."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "That's actually not true. What the I.G. report says, Dana, is that witnesses, meaning prosecutors of the DOJ or FBI investigators, didn't think that this would be a prosecutable case. It doesn't mean the I.G. concluded that that was the fact. It just meant some attorneys disagreed."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "Well, to further that, I think what one of the things Comey did was -- so the I.G. says insubordinate or insubordination, but who did that really benefit? It benefited Loretta Lynch who was the attorney general, because he then took it out of her hands for making a charging decision that I'm sure President Obama and Loretta Lynch did not want to do to their nominee."

      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "But this gets me back to the original point of how do we even know any of this? Why we've spent so much time and so much money on all of this? And it goes back to Hillary Clinton's decision to subvert the process, to have her own email system, to have a private server, and we -- so that was in 2015, and is now 2018 and we have spent 500 Pages."

You're talking about, you know, the FBI that is, you know, held to the highest regard in terms of justice and supposed to be truth seeking and fact finding without any ideological bent. And you see the people here that were only hell-bent on undermining the Trump campaign and preventing a presidency. You see a candidate in Hillary Clinton that completely just disregarded the law, destruction of evidence, and really just creating a situation that undermines the confidence not only in our political process and campaigns and elections, but in our highest investigatory agencies. And what you're seeing here is a modified, redacted report by Rod Rosenstein who is allowed to do this, and he's actually in the middle of all this. So, how is this, you know, coming out it with clean hands? We actually don't know what all the evidence is because some of it has been removed."

But, also, as Greg has talked about, there's the emotional part of it and it is strong. And you have it running rampant. I do think the White House needs to confront this a little bit, because that -- it wasn't just being a jerk, like, people are like, are you kidding me?

But the other thing is, again, I go to the root cause, the drug cartels are really fueling this. They have figured out a way to make a nice little bit of side money because it's not just like on the money that they're like, oh, we could get money by getting -- like your life savings and you'll give it to me, and I'll tell you how to go.

Number one, for FBI Director James Comey, the inspector general found that when he gave a statement in July 2016 about the Clinton email case and when he recommended against criminal charges, the inspector general found that when he gave a statement in July 2016 about the Clinton email case, and when he recommended against criminal charges, the inspector general found that that was insubordination, that he had gone outside the chain of command, he had not notified his leadership, Attorney General Loretta Lynch, her deputy Sally Yates. And that when he made that decision, it was not really his to make. That should have fallen to the Justice Department. No. 2, these text messages between FBI agent Peter Strzok and FBI lawyer Lisa Page, this really hung like a cloud over the Clinton email investigation. The inspector general found that there was no documented evidence that political bias infected the Clinton email investigation. So in other words, that it changed the steps that they took me investigation prior to Comey's statements in July 2016. But just last month, a new text message was uncovered between Strzok and Page where they talk about stopping Donald Trump. And the inspector general said that, in the latter stages of the email case, Agent Strzok made the priority the Russia investigation and not the Clinton emails, and that explained why there was such a delay to go through newly-discovered emails that had been found in late September on Anthony Weiner's laptop that he shared with his wife, Clinton aide Huma Abedin. On Attorney General Loretta Lynch, the inspector general found that she showed bad judgment when she met with Bill Clinton on that Arizona tarmac in June of 2016, and that she clearly did not understand the implications and sort of the bad optics it would have not only for the public confidence in the Justice Department and FBI but also for the integrity of the email investigation -- Dana."

And they're going to retrain everybody and tell everybody not to leak. That's good. But the bottom line is, Hillary was never going to be charged. The Obama DOJ, they were never going to charge her. Hillary always skates. Bill Clinton always skates. She was the most powerful woman in the world, about to become president. They're not going to charge her. And that was never, ever going to happen."

So he appointed himself judge and jury; he usurped her power. It was inappropriate. It wasn't up to him whether or not to make a charging decision. So people are upset about this? You should be upset with Comey specifically, as well, because he's the one that put the fix in. He was the puppeteer of this whole thing. It's an obstruction of justice. It's -- it's filthy, the whole thing, how this went down. And it really besmirches the reputation of the incredible men and women that work at the FBI.

I'm furious with him as a Democrat, because you read this, and some of the things he's being criticized for, the decisions, whether it was the July 5 statement about Hillary Clinton, the October statement said they reopened the investigation. Those decisions hurt Hillary Clinton and helped Donald Trump politically. So Comey, who already was not a sympathetic character to any Democrat or Republican that I know, I think comes out of this looking really bad. Really sanctimonious. He -- you know, Christopher Wray watching that, he's so -- he screams nonpartisanship; he screams confidence. That's the kind of FBI director Jim Comey wanted to be seen as.

And Trump and his team were treated like they were already guilty. And that's going to become clear. And we're going to see -- they've actually asked Strzok for his personal emails, and you know what he said? He refused to hand them over.
