It was Russian made. It was aimed in their own effort to retaliate, which they said they wanted to do.

He agrees with the killing of Soleimani. He believed that the president has power. As a matter of a fact, if you don't believe it, go back to the documents that Congress signed back in 2002, that gave the president the call to make this happen. And he has to notify them before or he has 48 hours to notify Congress then. So that is a wash. We don't even have to debate this. What Mike Lee is saying is that there has been moments where the intelligence community has misled. There has been moments where the military has misled. We just saw reports on Afghanistan. And we need to know all of the raw intelligence before we decide to go to war. And Congress does have the right to do this.

But I want to go back to the media for a minute and Democrats and Pete Buttigieg. They are making this false moral equivalency between the Iranian regime and President Donald Trump, AKA, America and what we are doing to protect Americans in the Middle East. For him to say that we had just as much responsibility for this plane shoot down, as the Iranians did, completely eliminates any kind of responsibility for that. They are hiding the black boxes. They don't want us to find out what happened. And also, it's really interesting to see the media constantly say that the president is a bigot. The president is anti-gay. The president is this. Now, they are openly defending and equating people like Soleimani to someone like Martin Luther King Jr. or Princess Di when they stone women. They hang gays off of cranes and justify it just the other day. They kill innocent protesters in the streets for daring to speak out and not show up to Soleimani's funeral. So they need to pick a side here. You can't just be against this kind of behavior when you think it's coming from President Trump, which it never is, and then turn around and defend something like the Iranian regime.",

So I'm just trying to you know -- dear to me -- this scares me for the deer. It's like when squirrels don't run away and get too close to them.

So Martha, I want to go to you first about the plane. We are learning that it was probably or likely shot down by Iran.

It was Russian made. It was aimed in their own effort to retaliate, which they said they wanted to do. But to not go a step further back to talk about the killing of an American contractor, to talk about the overrun or the attempted overrun of a U.S. embassy, sovereign territory in Iraq that was built by the United States.

Mike Lee is saying look, I went in there yesterday to question the general and the briefers about not the attack but authorization. When do you think you need to come back to Congress to declare war? He agrees with the killing of Soleimani. He believed that the president has power. As a matter of a fact, if you don't believe it, go back to the documents that Congress signed back in 2002, that gave the president the call to make this happen. And he has to notify them before or he has 48 hours to notify Congress then. So that is a wash. We don't even have to debate this. What Mike Lee is saying is that there has been moments where the intelligence community has misled. There has been moments where the military has misled. We just saw reports on Afghanistan. And we need to know all of the raw intelligence before we decide to go to war. And Congress does have the right to do this. But Democrats are using Mike Lee to say the president should've never killed Soleimani, and that's not what he's saying."

But I want to go back to the media for a minute and Democrats and Pete Buttigieg. They are making this false moral equivalency between the Iranian regime and President Donald Trump, AKA, America and what we are doing to protect Americans in the Middle East. For him to say that we had just as much responsibility for this plane shoot down, as the Iranians did, completely eliminates any kind of responsibility for that. They are hiding the black boxes. They don't want us to find out what happened. And also, it's really interesting to see the media constantly say that the president is a bigot. The president is anti-gay. The president is this. Now, they are openly defending and equating people like Soleimani to someone like Martin Luther King Jr. or Princess Di when they stone women. They hang gays off of cranes and justify it just the other day. They kill innocent protesters in the streets for daring to speak out and not show up to Soleimani's funeral. So they need to pick a side here. You can't just be against this kind of behavior when you think it's coming from President Trump, which it never is, and then turn around and defend something like the Iranian regime."

So the thing is look at what he's done with North Korea, what he's doing with China, what he's doing with Iran. He's a walking game-changer by making decisions that other people don't. He doesn't see this as war. He saw this as a shaking the box, which it did. There may be out of this, being on the brink of war looks exactly like being on the brink of peace.

She's completely lost control of her caucus, both from the left. And now with people are saying we want you to push their articles over to the Senate, so the Democrats are getting very frustrated with her. Because they feel like she's undermining the institution.

They didn't get that done. They said they were going to repeal the President's tax bill even though they knew it was going to be vetoed. They didn't get that done.
