If you just do repeal, all the experts tell me a lot more uncertainty and a lot more plans are going to leave, and costs are going to go up even more. So, let's sort of bite the bullet and do this. And I think we're pretty darn close. I really do. I spoke to Vice President Mike Pence on the phone recently about this today. And we had a god meeting at lunch today. We had a meeting late last night. And I know it's going to be tough to get there, because we come from different states, different perspectives. But I think we have got a responsibility to really get try to a conclusion on this and to come up with a solution, not just kick the can down the road.   That's my preference.
