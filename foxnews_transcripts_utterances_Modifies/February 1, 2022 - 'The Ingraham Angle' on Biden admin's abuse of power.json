We don't trust the Biden administration to protect our civil liberties. Period. They abuse their power on COVID. They abuse their power in the way they handled the January 6 situation, and they trash our country's history every chance they get. After 13 months of President Biden, Americans have every reason to be suspicious of anything they do that involves collecting information about Americans. I'm talking about lists and databases, or surveillance of anything, including your health records or social media history. Let's face it, they treat half of the country as if they're the mortal enemy. A threat to be controlled, not a constituency to be served. Now, when the school CRT and sexual assault issues bubbled up in the U.S., Democrats finally found themselves on the defensive. And then Biden's Attorney General Merrick Garland, he swooped in to flex the power of the federal law enforcement. His words at the time were meant to intimidate and scare parents. If you're upset and angry at the direction your school board is taking, and you show up and you speak your mind as is your constitutional right by the way. Now, you have to be worried about being caught up in some bogus domestic terror dragnet. And rather than treat January 6 as a protest that got way out of hand with some criminal elements, no doubt, the Biden administration and their media cronies insisted on claiming that it was an insurrection and treating everyone who supported President Trump as a trader.",

Now, enter the extremism review that generals Austin and Milley undertook of the armed forces after January 6. So rather than focusing sharply on real problems, they use vague language to essentially smear huge swaths of the American public and the military. Now, in a sense, they hung out a 'Conservatives Need Not Apply' sign at the Pentagon. Now, who knows what files are amassing on soldiers, airmen and Marines, who they deemed to be potential problems? Now, maybe they posted pro Trump stuff, or photos from Trump rallies on social media. Who knows? But which group has been subjected, you think, to more scrutiny under Austin? Our own troops, or the nearly 85,000 Afghan refugees they airlifted to the United States? Well, I think we know the answer to that question. And presidential wannabe Pete Buttigieg, he feels where the winds are blowing in his party, and he wants to get in on the action. As Transportation Secretary, he's planning to blanket America's roads with more surveillance cameras, billions and billions of dollars worth. Supposedly it's all to cut down on traffic deaths. You know, he is a humanitarian. But of course, what they really want is fewer cars and fewer car owners. They want to make it so expensive, so cumbersome to drive and own a vehicle that only the truly responsible elites can do so. Now, and it gets worse and worse, which brings us to the huge story we brought you last night. Courtesy of our friends at the Washington Free Beacon and Republican congressmen that the U.S. government is storing just under 1 billion gun purchase files and digitizing them, presumably for a searchability down the road. Now, Biden's ATF, in a letter to our next guest, insists that such record keeping was approved by Congress, including the process of digitization. During 2021, they collected data on 54 million gun owners. But they waved away any concern of nefarious intent writing, \"The sole purpose of these systems is to trace firearms used in crimes, which is a valuable gun intelligence tool used in thousands of investigations by ATF and our local, state, and federal law enforcement partners.\" In other words, because of all the good faith they've shown their fellow Americans, we're just supposed to take them at their word. This is all for benign purposes. This massive log of gun purchases, it's not a significant leap toward the ultimate goal of a national gun registry. Sorry, but they do not deserve the benefit of the doubt. Of course, we know that all the people with the power in the Democrat Party hate guns and would love nothing more to confiscate as many as possible under whatever pre Texas Supreme Court would allow them to do so. Don't take my word for it, take theirs.",

And now, they've gone so far as to cast traditionally minded Americans as public enemy number one. Republicans in Congress, especially when they take back power, they need to exercise strict oversight over every aspect of this Biden team. And they need to prohibit and defund every action, and every policy that undermines our basic constitutional rights. There are a lot of such actions and policies. And that's the 'Angle'. Joining me now, the lawmaker who led the investigation into the ATF's massive database of gun owners, Texas Congressman Michael Cloud. Now, Congressman, the ATF says that the records are totally permissible to be held under federal law, and that they're there to help solve crimes. But they also admit that they have no data on crime solved as a result of this information. So what the heck is really going on here?",

We don't trust the Biden administration to protect our civil liberties. Period. They abuse their power on COVID. They abuse their power in the way they handled the January 6 situation, and they trash our country's history every chance they get. After 13 months of President Biden, Americans have every reason to be suspicious of anything they do that involves collecting information about Americans. I'm talking about lists and databases, or surveillance of anything, including your health records or social media history. Let's face it, they treat half of the country as if they're the mortal enemy. A threat to be controlled, not a constituency to be served. Now, when the school CRT and sexual assault issues bubbled up in the U.S., Democrats finally found themselves on the defensive. And then Biden's Attorney General Merrick Garland, he swooped in to flex the power of the federal law enforcement. His words at the time were meant to intimidate and scare parents. If you're upset and angry at the direction your school board is taking, and you show up and you speak your mind as is your constitutional right by the way. Now, you have to be worried about being caught up in some bogus domestic terror dragnet. And rather than treat January 6 as a protest that got way out of hand with some criminal elements, no doubt, the Biden administration and their media cronies insisted on claiming that it was an insurrection and treating everyone who supported President Trump as a trader."

Now, enter the extremism review that generals Austin and Milley undertook of the armed forces after January 6. So rather than focusing sharply on real problems, they use vague language to essentially smear huge swaths of the American public and the military. Now, in a sense, they hung out a 'Conservatives Need Not Apply' sign at the Pentagon. Now, who knows what files are amassing on soldiers, airmen and Marines, who they deemed to be potential problems? Now, maybe they posted pro Trump stuff, or photos from Trump rallies on social media. Who knows? But which group has been subjected, you think, to more scrutiny under Austin? Our own troops, or the nearly 85,000 Afghan refugees they airlifted to the United States? Well, I think we know the answer to that question. And presidential wannabe Pete Buttigieg, he feels where the winds are blowing in his party, and he wants to get in on the action. As Transportation Secretary, he's planning to blanket America's roads with more surveillance cameras, billions and billions of dollars worth. Supposedly it's all to cut down on traffic deaths. You know, he is a humanitarian. But of course, what they really want is fewer cars and fewer car owners. They want to make it so expensive, so cumbersome to drive and own a vehicle that only the truly responsible elites can do so. Now, and it gets worse and worse, which brings us to the huge story we brought you last night. Courtesy of our friends at the Washington Free Beacon and Republican congressmen that the U.S. government is storing just under 1 billion gun purchase files and digitizing them, presumably for a searchability down the road. Now, Biden's ATF, in a letter to our next guest, insists that such record keeping was approved by Congress, including the process of digitization. During 2021, they collected data on 54 million gun owners. But they waved away any concern of nefarious intent writing, \"The sole purpose of these systems is to trace firearms used in crimes, which is a valuable gun intelligence tool used in thousands of investigations by ATF and our local, state, and federal law enforcement partners.\" In other words, because of all the good faith they've shown their fellow Americans, we're just supposed to take them at their word. This is all for benign purposes. This massive log of gun purchases, it's not a significant leap toward the ultimate goal of a national gun registry. Sorry, but they do not deserve the benefit of the doubt. Of course, we know that all the people with the power in the Democrat Party hate guns and would love nothing more to confiscate as many as possible under whatever pre Texas Supreme Court would allow them to do so. Don't take my word for it, take theirs."

Because along the way, as I've demonstrated tonight, they've shown so much bad faith in so many different contexts, from our Intel agencies, to the public health sector, to law enforcement, and even the previously innocuous Department of Transportation. And now, they've gone so far as to cast traditionally minded Americans as public enemy number one. Republicans in Congress, especially when they take back power, they need to exercise strict oversight over every aspect of this Biden team. And they need to prohibit and defund every action, and every policy that undermines our basic constitutional rights. There are a lot of such actions and policies. And that's the 'Angle'. Joining me now, the lawmaker who led the investigation into the ATF's massive database of gun owners, Texas Congressman Michael Cloud. Now, Congressman, the ATF says that the records are totally permissible to be held under federal law, and that they're there to help solve crimes. But they also admit that they have no data on crime solved as a result of this information. So what the heck is really going on here?"

We thought that was astronomical. And so we sent a letter, and you know how these things go. Sometimes you get a letter back when you start an investigation, sometimes you don't. Well, we got a letter back and, boy, was it shocking, over 1 billion records that the ATF has, and it's illegal for the federal government to have a federal gun registry.

We've seen the Department of Justice stand up to the department to domestic terrorism to look into that. And so, we've seen - in the past, we've seen the IRS target conservatives; we've seen the FBI. The FBI, they're supposed to be the law enforcement branch target a political candidate for president. And so this is where the American people are going. We can't trust this.

Here now is Hoover Institution Senior Fellow, Victor Davis Hanson. Victor, we're told that this has happened in the past, this federal, state and local coordination of resources.

I think thematic in this whole discussion, Laura, is this idea - eternal idea of the left that because they're so morally superior, they say, they can use any means necessary for their ends. And it really - if you go back it really started with the Obama administration in full. I mean, they went after the Associated Press reporters' communications. You remember, they went after Fox's James Rosen; the head of the CIA, John Brennan lied under oath when he denied that they were spying on the Senate staff or computers. James Clapper, the head of Director of National Intelligence lied when he was asked about the NSA surveilling people. James Comey's FBI was completely - went row. We have the Clinesmith alteration of the FISA document. There were no consequences. And then when you look at the traditional watchdogs, the left always used to brag we have law faculties. We have Democratic senior senators. We have the ACLU. And when you look at those institutions, and they're on the side of the surveillance. ACLU is degenerated into an activist left-wing political group. And we have people in the media that were outwardly and explicitly saying, we're not going to cover the news like we used to. Jim Rutenberg Christiane Amanpour, Jorge Ramos. We have to be biased because Trump - there was no Frank Churchs in the 1975 watchdog committees.

And I tell anybody who's a radical leftist now that you should test out that ideology by going and working for the radical left, because it will soon crumble. I lasted about a year doing that. And I just realized that there was so much hypocrisy. There was blatant racism towards white people. And there was so little discussion. And when I brought up those concerns to higher ups at the organization, I was turned away and I was told that I didn't understand how oppressed I am. And that is so emblematic of modern day woke leftism is trying to convince people that they're victims in order to promote your agenda. And I simply got tired of it and had to leave.

Today, law school students ramped up their pressure campaign to get Professor Ilya Shapiro fired over kind of a poorly worded tweet about Biden's potential SCOTUS pick.

Nate, first of all, big kudos for you for getting at least a little of that video because that is one of the most pathetic things I've ever seen. Georgetown Law School used to be a great place.

But what it was voicing was a fundamentally true principle, and a principle that was uncontroversial in American life until five minutes ago, which is that Supreme Court nominees should be selected on the basis of their merits and their competency, rather than the color of their skin. And what we've seen at Georgetown Law, rather than last students defending equality under the law is a complete meltdown. And a capitulation by the Dean of Students and the rest of the administrators like we saw in that video, where they are trying to appease these radical students and give them everything that they're demanding, rather than actually standing up for basic constitutional principles like equality and (inaudible)"

But it gets worse. The CCP has sent a clear message to any would be critics during the games. \"The New York Times\" reporting that in January a prominent human rights activist in China took to Twitter to criticize state security agents for questioning, harassing, and detaining critics ahead of the Olympics. Since then, the police have visited him four times in eight days. Joining me now is Florida Senator Marco Rubio, vice chair of the Senate Intel Committee, someone who has joined me in calling for a boycott of the Beijing games.

I think the second is if a U.S. athlete expresses a political view that runs counter to anything that China believes or says, we don't know what is going to happen to them. We don't know what they'll do. I'm also worried, frankly, about the state of journalism. We'll have journalists over there covering these Olympics, and what if one of them goes off script and says something that the Chinese censors don't like, can something happen to them? Frankly, I'm hoping that these networks that are covering this, that are planning to make a bunch of money of this, that they have the courage in their news departments to cover exactly what kind of country is hosting these Olympics, what kind of government is hosting these Olympics. This is a government that is committing genocide, pure and simple."

They are not going to be able to report on Xi and the ongoing genocide, everything you have been talking about for years, frankly, they are not going to be able to do any of that."

Look, at the end of the day, we're not punishing the athletes to be part of that. The concern we have, right, is NBC is putting up a bunch of subscription services that people have to pay for to watch some of these things in real time. I don't think they should be making a penny out of this, or at least consumers don't have to participate in helping them make a penny out of it. And if there's an athlete that you really like and want to follow, I assure that the clips are going to be available online. People will post those in different places. The core of this is very simple, and that is we're going to not allow, if we want, we shouldn't allow people to monetize an Olympics being hosted by a genocidal, communist government, that, by the way, is also trying to dismantle the U.S.'s place in the world. They're targeting our industries, our jobs, our supply chains, all across the board."

If in fact there are health risks, if in fact there is some novel new disease or an outbreak of a new variant of COVID, or whatever, we wouldn't know about it. There's no way the Chinese government is going to be transparent about that. They weren't transparent about it when the COVID crisis first emerged, and they will not be transparent about any risk that the athletes run to their health or wellbeing, be it anything from air quality all the way down to a new pandemic or a new disease. So I can't personally say I'm aware of a threat. But I can tell you, you are in the country where if one existed, you wouldn't know about it."

But that said, I think this is an issue that doesn't, quite frankly, have to be a partisan or ideological one. And for the life of me, I don't understand why anybody would be a defender of the Chinese government, what they do in terms of stealing technology, intellectual property, when they helped deindustrialize this country. Let me be clear, there's a lot of blame on this side, too, because we've got a lot of corporations and a lot of political figures who are tied to either directly through finances or in many cases because of key constituencies, are tied to the companies and/or practices that are helping China at the expense of American workers, American industry, and American national security. So we welcome anybody who wants to join the fight on this and talk about this very clearly, because this is not just about embarrassing or calling them out. This is about changing policies. A lot of what has happened is because we have allowed China to industrialize the country. We have allowed China to steal our technically and look the other way. We have allowed this to go on for far too long, and if this continues, we are not going to like the world."

And yet, I understand there's a movement in the Senate among some of your colleagues, and in the House, to move forward with a push to pull back on some of the tariffs that Trump smartly put in against China. Are you going to be a force against that effort given everything that has happened?"

      "utterance": "Absolutely. Not only that, but first of all, China has not lived up to any international commitment they have made. From Hong Kong, you name it. They've never lived up to any -- they'll sign any agreement because they don't intent to keep it when the time is right. They'll break it. And in the case of the phase, they never intended to comply with it. And now, in fact, they are using it as a bargaining chip. Now they are basically saying, if you give in and you stop doing this and you stop doing that, then maybe we'll comply with phase one as a result of it. So now they are actually using things they have already signed as a condition of whatever it is they are asking for from our government on a plethora of things. They will never comply with anything. And at the same time as we keep these tariffs, we have got to do things to bring factories and factory type jobs and manufacturing back to the United States."

I want them to do well in all of their classes, not just mine. And they are like, Ms. Fontanilla, that class is so dumb, especially my boys. And I'm like, OK, what is this class? So I actually had access to the same platform as the other teacher that was teaching the ethnic studies class, and I got to take a look at some of the lessons.
