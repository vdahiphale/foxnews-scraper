But there is no long-term upside in this kind of incivility. Politics is the art of persuasion, and the people who make long-term gains in politics are the people who do a better job of persuading others that their views are right. Those are the kind of people who take political moments and make them political movements.  These are not about arguments. You're not persuading anybody. If Democrats follow Maxine Waters' advice and get in the face of Republicans or harass them at a restaurant, is any Republican going to think, that's the right way to do this? And the same goes the other way too. If Donald Trump makes one of those comments, does he actually think he might convert a Democrat that could be persuaded by an argument on behalf of his policy?

It turns out that child was never separated from her parents and, in fact, further reporting shows of the mother had left her other children back home which suggests that maybe a sign she is not going to succeed in getting asylum, doesn't deserve asylum based on the criteria.  But now after a week of the hysteria has sort of past and we are still down to a really complicated situation on the border, and I think that moved by Donald Trump to talk about keeping people from getting into the country so that we don't have to give them due process, it's an argument for building a wall, or anything, or something that prevents them from getting across the border.",
