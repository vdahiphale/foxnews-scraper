Now two men are facing charges, including battery on a police officer and inciting a riot. The TSA warning of penalties for fliers who exhibit this type of behavior as we head into the long holiday weekend. Easier said than done when planes are packed and tempers are frayed. Welcome, everyone. Glad to have you. I'm Neil Cavuto.

Some feared that Omicron would be a Grinch, crushing the Christmas spirit of holiday travelers this season, but twice as many passengers are expected to take to the friendly skies compared to this time last year. The TSA estimates that, last Friday and Saturday, about 4.3 million people traveled through checkpoints at airports around the country. That's compared to a total of two million people who traveled those same days last year. But even with a new COVID variant on the rise, a lot of people we talked to traveling today say they still feel safe.",

That's really not the case anymore. I would recommend if you are having concerns or you just want to know what your options are is to check directly with your airline and find out exactly what their policies are now. Don't assume that they're the same as they were one year ago. There are some airlines that are -- got rid of their change and cancellation fees all together, some that were more liberal and they have kind of gone back to the way things were pre-pandemic.

So, if you could imagine that the travel demand over the holidays is normally big, it's even more so this year, compared to what we have seen in the last couple of years. So I think travelers need to absolutely pack your patience if you're headed to the airport, get there extra early and come prepared. Make sure that you're OK with the guidelines that are in place now. I think we hear that travelers are pretty comfortable.

Well, in the meantime here, if it weren't enough with the spike in Omicron cases to get going here, the irony is that the cases themselves are not really that serious, in fact, about 80 percent less so if you consider hospitalizations and even the extreme possibility of serious cases, even death.

Meantime, you have New York mayor-elect Eric Adams already canceling his inauguration. The Rockettes' Christmas spectacular is off. Broadway shows like \"Hamilton\" are on hold. No live audiences at \"SNL.\" And the enclave of the rich and powerful at the World Economic Forum has been delayed for the second year in a row. Now, as for sports, the NHL has confirmed that the best hockey players on the planet will be skipping the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics, precautions, they say, after the NHL had to postpone several hockey games in Florida and Colorado last week. The NBA has delayed five games. The NFL shifted three. Now, Texas A&M has just dropped out of the Gator Bowl over COVID concerns. Now, as for getting back to the office, you have numerous companies, including the biggest on the planet, they have indefinitely delay the return to work. And TBD, to be determined, over at Apple, Google and Uber. We know CNN has closed their offices to nonessential workers.

We can't do mass testing. We don't have enough tests to go around. We heard about another half-million coming online. Well, we need about one to two billion a day in order to do regular test screening. If you think about it, in a normal flu season, we might have 41 million flu cases in a matter of months.

Even in South Africa, where only 30 percent of the population there is vaccinated, they're having a massive decline. That's not because of high vaccination rates. That's because of natural immunity. And so we have got high population immunity, and policies need to be adjusted accordingly. Otherwise, we're going to be in this mode forever.

I mean, 2.5 weeks ago, I ordered a huge number of Christmas presents for family and friends and -- from Amazon.

Where I think the Democrats could help themselves economically are -- is that there are two key provisions there, the child tax credit, which is no longer tethered to work or earnings, which will, by some estimates, drive 1.5 million Americans out of the work force, and also the child care, the new entitlement program there. For many families, parents where you have two kids, both the parents working, they could see their child care costs go up by almost $27,000 a year.

What we, saw just by America becoming competitive again, redesigning the code so our companies could compete and win anywhere in the world, including here at home, creating incentives to bring manufacturing, intellectual property, investment back in the United States, which it achieved beautifully there, had a significant effect.

Now two men are facing charges, including battery on a police officer and inciting a riot. The TSA warning of penalties for fliers who exhibit this type of behavior as we head into the long holiday weekend. Easier said than done when planes are packed and tempers are frayed.

Some feared that Omicron would be a Grinch, crushing the Christmas spirit of holiday travelers this season, but twice as many passengers are expected to take to the friendly skies compared to this time last year. The TSA estimates that, last Friday and Saturday, about 4.3 million people traveled through checkpoints at airports around the country. That's compared to a total of two million people who traveled those same days last year. But even with a new COVID variant on the rise, a lot of people we talked to traveling today say they still feel safe."

The FAA administrator saying expedited screening is a privilege -- quote -- \"If you act out of line, you will wait in line. Our partnership aims to promote safe and responsible passenger behavior. One unruly incident is one too many.\" So, Neil, the message is, pack your best behavior or pack your patience, because you're going to be waiting in the line with everybody else -- Neil."

      "utterance": "If you're lucky to be waiting in a line. They might kick your fanny off the plane or out of the airport. Hillary, thank you very, very much for that. What are your options now as you look to fly in these next few days, the busiest we have seen probably in a couple of years going back to before the pandemic? Jeanenne Tornatore here, a travel expert. Jeanenne, first if I can ask you about your options when you're looking to cancel flights or you're anxious about canceling, because you don't want to take any chances. What do you do?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JEANENNE TORNATORE, TRAVEL EXPERT",
      "utterance": "So I think the first thing travelers should know is, look, a lot of these airline policies aren't as liberal as what they were during the height of the pandemic or back when everything was canceled at the beginning of the pandemic and they were just allowing everyone to get refunds and credits. That's really not the case anymore. I would recommend if you are having concerns or you just want to know what your options are is to check directly with your airline and find out exactly what their policies are now. Don't assume that they're the same as they were one year ago. There are some airlines that are -- got rid of their change and cancellation fees all together, some that were more liberal and they have kind of gone back to the way things were pre-pandemic. So make sure that you absolutely know what your airline is doing."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "You know, a lot of people are canceling first, asking questions about getting their money back later. Maybe they see this brawl in Miami or they see these iconic images on planes where people are going nuts. And they say, you know what? With the Omicron scare and everything else, I want no part of this. What are their options if they do this at the last minute?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TORNATORE",
      "utterance": "Well, look, I would say, if you are thinking about canceling, do it as soon as possible. When you wait within that 24 to 48 hours before your flight, you don't have as many options and you may not get those refunds, or it may not be as easy for you to change those plans. So, if you're thinking I have a flight a week from now, I may want to cancel it, or I may want to change it, do it as soon as possible."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "But I think, as you pointed out, I mean, these are rarities. They're hardly common. They catch our attention because some of them can be very graphic and very in your face. But, by and large, what is it like this travel week going into Christmas itself?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TORNATORE",
      "utterance": "Well, look, as you heard previously, it's almost double, the amount of passengers that we saw last year. I mean, you have airlines like United that have added more than 200 flights domestically per day just to keep up with the domestic demand, over 4,000 flights going out on United per day. So, if you could imagine that the travel demand over the holidays is normally big, it's even more so this year, compared to what we have seen in the last couple of years. So I think travelers need to absolutely pack your patience if you're headed to the airport, get there extra early and come prepared. Make sure that you're OK with the guidelines that are in place now. I think we hear that travelers are pretty comfortable. We have all been kind of traveling and been aware of what these guidelines and protocols have been for the last year."

      "utterance": "Yes, and I think most of us are pretty good about this and patient about this. We just have to all remember to be that way. Jeanenne, thank you so much. Very good advice. I appreciate it. Well, in the meantime here, if it weren't enough with the spike in Omicron cases to get going here, the irony is that the cases themselves are not really that serious, in fact, about 80 percent less so if you consider hospitalizations and even the extreme possibility of serious cases, even death. That has not stopped some states, municipalities businesses to change things mightily, imposing restrictions that might go way beyond whether Omicron deserves it or not. Susan Li looking at the fallout from all of this -- Susan."

Different networks are doing different things to try to mitigate any risks from the Omicron spread. Fox Entertainment being the latest to cancel their special broadcasts, while the traditional broadcast networks are moving celebrations outside of New York City. NBC will be live from Miami instead, ABC in Puerto Rico. CBS is going to Nashville. Now, as for New York City and the famous ball drop in Times Square, Mayor de Blasio is still debating whether or not to welcome back the crowds this year. Meantime, you have New York mayor-elect Eric Adams already canceling his inauguration. The Rockettes' Christmas spectacular is off. Broadway shows like \"Hamilton\" are on hold. No live audiences at \"SNL.\" And the enclave of the rich and powerful at the World Economic Forum has been delayed for the second year in a row. Now, as for sports, the NHL has confirmed that the best hockey players on the planet will be skipping the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics, precautions, they say, after the NHL had to postpone several hockey games in Florida and Colorado last week. The NBA has delayed five games. The NFL shifted three. Now, Texas A&M has just dropped out of the Gator Bowl over COVID concerns. Now, as for getting back to the office, you have numerous companies, including the biggest on the planet, they have indefinitely delay the return to work. And TBD, to be determined, over at Apple, Google and Uber. We know CNN has closed their offices to nonessential workers. Ford delayed the return to March, and companies like Lyft even pushing out the return to 2023."

But that could be good news for people who are leery of needles or shots of any sort. With us right now, Dr. Marty Makary of the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. How much of a game-changer, Doctor, do you think this is?"

    {
      "speaker": "DR. MARTY MAKARY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Look, if we use this the right way, Neil, this will mark the end of the pandemic in the United States officially. No one died who got this medication. And the trial in which it was done was conducted very elegantly. There were 12 individuals who died in the placebo arm and zero died who received Paxlovid. Now, there's other medications out there. Fluvoxamine, ironically, has been around for a long time. That cut deaths by 91 percent. So we have got a lot of tools in the toolbox, not just Paxlovid. If we use them right, no one should be dying of COVID right now, with rare exceptions."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "You know, Doctor, there are a lot of people just terrified of needles. And I'm just wondering, when you look at the unvaccinated, how many do you think is that an issue?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MAKARY",
      "utterance": "Look, needle anxiety is a known issue with children especially, but other people have reasons. They just don't like doctors or hospitals or needles. And we see that. But the entire construct of the vaccinated and unvaccinated is a false construct. It's very frustrating for me to watch the White House briefings and the speech by President Biden yesterday, and because we know that the more precise medical terminology is the immune and the non-immune. And about half of those who are not vaccinated have immunity and that changes the dynamics, with testing, with boosters. And it changes the dynamic with gatherings."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Now, you mentioned gatherings, Doctor. And you probably heard about Anthony Fauci saying, in groups of more than 40 people, even if vaccinated, even if you have gotten a booster shot, he'd avoid them. What did you think of that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MAKARY",
      "utterance": "Well, first of all, we're not using testing properly. We need to do selective testing. So if there are people who are vulnerable that you're concerned about, if your grandfather chose not to get vaccinated, and you want to get together, that's important for people to know that they're not bringing virus into the setting. We can't do mass testing. We don't have enough tests to go around. We heard about another half-million coming online. Well, we need about one to two billion a day in order to do regular test screening. If you think about it, in a normal flu season, we might have 41 million flu cases in a matter of months. Can you imagine if we tested everybody and then graphed the chart of cases every day? What I'm seeing is basically a denial that we have got a respiratory pathogen like others that we are not willing to accept and learn to live with."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Doctor, do you think the world is overreacting, when Israel shuts down travel from other countries, or France stops accepting visitors from Britain, or the European Union cuts down on the number of members within the union who can fly to respective countries, or the mask requirements, the hyped-up restrictions now on how many can go into a restaurant or a pub? Are we going too far here?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MAKARY",
      "utterance": "Well, Neil, I think people in these countries are acting with good intentions. I think they want the best for people. But what they're doing is, they're using policies from 2020 in a modern era, when we have Omicron, a more mild variant, and we have got broad population immunity, either natural or vaccinated. Even in South Africa, where only 30 percent of the population there is vaccinated, they're having a massive decline. That's not because of high vaccination rates. That's because of natural immunity. And so we have got high population immunity, and policies need to be adjusted accordingly. Otherwise, we're going to be in this mode forever. If I told someone that their child is likely to get five or six colds in the course of their childhood, they could either choose to keep that child masked from K-12 or they can find some selective policy to use reasonable hygiene practices and learn to live with the risk."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Then what about cases like the Radio City Christmas show that was shelved because a couple of members had gotten Omicron, or now the cast to \"Hamilton,\" \"Lion King\" and some others shutting down until this is resolved, but usually based on one or two or several people contracting a virus that seems very, very contagious, but so far not extremely dangerous? Is that an overreaction?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MAKARY",
      "utterance": "I think it is, Neil, because if we're going to use the criteria to shut down those events, we're going to be shutting them down almost every winter in perpetuity. We have other respiratory pathogens that don't have the same social stigma and the sort of raw memories of last year, when COVID had a higher case fatality rate. We're going to have influenza, RSV virus, rhinovirus, coxsackievirus. There's a lot of respiratory pathogens. And with this particular strain right now, it is nearly impossible to contain it. And so we have got to turn our attention to reasonable ways in which we learn to live with it and turn our attention to treatments, which really today was the first day we had a major milestone with the FDA approving Paxlovid."

Doctor, thank you very, very much, Dr. Marty Makary of Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, bestselling author as well. You heard a lot going into Christmas how Santa was just out of goods and the shelves were empty. Turns out that that might have been much ado about nothing.

But he also said the Build Back Better spending bill is the biggest weapon to address inflation, once again saying that it will bring down costs for prescription drugs, health care, child care and more. But, of course, the bill's future is murky, with Senator Joe Manchin killing it for now earlier this week, saying that he could not support it.

Steve Moore had been warning about that for some time. Kind enough to join us. Steve, inflation is real. We do know that. It sent toy prices rocketing. Electronic items are rocketing.

So it's amazing how well this economy can adapt pretty quickly to a crisis like we had a month or two ago. However, I should tell you just a personal story. I mean, 2.5 weeks ago, I ordered a huge number of Christmas presents for family and friends and -- from Amazon. And, usually, with Amazon, you get that stuff in three days; 2.5 weeks later, and I still don't have it."

The producer prices were up almost 10 percent. Consumer prices are up about 6.5 to 7 percent. When you get that situation, producer prices go up, and consumer prices have to go up, right? Because businesses have to be able to sell the products at a profit. And so I do think you're going to see some tough months ahead on inflation. I do believe that the Fed is behind the curve.

So he wants -- he's worried about inflation. Overall, this is a real problem. But Democrats can't throw in the towel, because they have just put too much time into this effort.

Remember, the year started out with Bernie Sanders, the Budget Committee chairman, where this all started talking possibly $6 trillion to $10 trillion. Chuck Schumer was saying big and bold, OK? I think Democrats raised expectations. And I think that was a mistake, because they knew Republicans weren't going to get on board. That was not hard to see. Republicans are not going to vote for any tax increases. So, overall, they have to make sure that Manchin and Sinema are there at the end. And I think progressives -- remember, Neil, even if this passes the House, it's -- the Senate, it's got to go back to the House. And just five progressives could sink it."

And that upsets, of course, some Democrats, but it's not going to cost them votes, like Senator Gillibrand, who has been pushing for that. The child tax credit, as you mentioned, Senator Manchin wants to lower those thresholds, so a smaller type of bill. Now, on the Medicare expansion, that is really important to Bernie Sanders."

Do you know anything about the backstory on that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CUSACK",
      "utterance": "I don't know as a fact, Neil, but that makes a lot of sense. I asked Manchin a few years ago, could he ever leave the Republican Party, and do Republicans ask him to do that -- to leave the Democratic Party for the Republican Party?"

But he said he could never leave the party because of the Republican stances on Obamacare, health care, in particular, and taxes as well. I don't know. I mean, you have to be worried that maybe he doesn't become a Republican, but maybe he becomes an independent who caucuses with the Republicans if the progressives get too nasty with him. So I think Joe Biden saying that makes a lot of sense. And it makes sense. That's how the president operates. Let's get a deal. Let's lower the temperature.

I think only a few of them are starting to move toward acceptance, which the truth of matter is, this bill is as alive or as dead as Senator Manchin makes it. And he was very clear. You're not listening to me. I'm not going there. And you can't bully me. And so the question is, can they begin to accept that he's got parameters that they will have to meet? I also think -- and I'm grateful for this as well -- because even the $1.75 trillion, in true numbers, there are still crippling tax cuts there -- tax hikes -- excuse me -- that will drive U.S. jobs overseas and really drive this economy lower as well. So we're still fighting for this bill to die. But I think, at the end of the day, I think the progressives will do that for us. I don't think there's any way they can accept what Joe Manchin will insist that they do in the Senate."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

And that would dramatically cut down its price, as it would the tax hikes to pay that price. Do you think -- I know where you stand on this -- any Republicans would be on board something like that, that dramatically cuts the size of this thing down?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BRADY",
      "utterance": "Not with the tax hikes included, because it makes no sense to be dramatically raising taxes on job creators and investment in the U.S., or making us less competitive against China, Russia, and Europe especially as we try to recover from this pandemic. And so, no, I don't see that happening. Where I think the Democrats could help themselves economically are -- is that there are two key provisions there, the child tax credit, which is no longer tethered to work or earnings, which will, by some estimates, drive 1.5 million Americans out of the work force, and also the child care, the new entitlement program there. For many families, parents where you have two kids, both the parents working, they could see their child care costs go up by almost $27,000 a year. That too is going to be a barrier to returning Americans to work. So, in addition to the economic impact of tax hikes, making the labor shortage worse is going to work against this economy in a serious way."

      "speaker": "BRADY",
      "utterance": "So, two thoughts. One, Wall Street loves stimulus. And this is -- the House version, at least, almost $5 trillion in true costs over the decade, that's a lot of money pumped in the economy, exactly at the wrong time, by the way. But I think that drove part of it. Secondly, I think most of those firms underestimate the importance of tax policy. What we, saw just by America becoming competitive again, redesigning the code so our companies could compete and win anywhere in the world, including here at home, creating incentives to bring manufacturing, intellectual property, investment back in the United States, which it achieved beautifully there, had a significant effect. I think often Wall Street undermines the impact of tax policy."

I don't know how much you are worried about inflation or how you balance that when it comes to, I don't know, buying Cheerios. Would you would you spend a lot more for Cheerios? Well, the reason why I mentioned Cheerios, it's just part of what General Mills makes, a vast, vast group of grocery items that are iconic, and now a lot more expensive. And it's passing those increases along to you. And it got us thinking. It happens here now and then on \"Your World.\" What would you refuse to give up on, no matter how high the price gets? After this."

A host of other consumer product companies, from Cargill to Heinz, they have all been doing this and we have been paying the price, happily. No, maybe not always happily, but we are. So the prices keep going up because the demand is still there. Let's get the read on just how far you can push it with Abby Hornacek. We have got Jimmy Failla joining us as well. Guys, so great to have you. Where are you on this, Abby, first off, this -- how -- is there an item you would have that you would definitely pay more for, keep paying more for, maybe there's a limit in your head, but you haven't hit it yet?"

But when you really -- when you do ask that question, you're like, when are people going to stop paying these prices? The problem is, is if they want to stop paying the prices for, let's say, Lucky Charms or Yoplait, they're going to go reach for another type of cereal or another type of yogurt and see that those prices have increased as well. When you look at the statistics, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics says that prices rose 6.4 percent. You saw it on the screen in your intro there."

Where's your limit, Jimmy?
