I'm Lawrence Jones in tonight for Judge Jeanine and at this hour, a crime pandemic continues to sweep across the nation and few cities have been hit harder than Chicago. One week ago, 29-year-old officer, Ella French was tragically murdered while conducting a traffic stop in the city. According to recently released F.B.I. data, in the first seven months of 2021, forty four law enforcement officers were murdered in the line of duty. That's an over a 41 percent increase from the previous year. So what changed? Progressive district attorneys stopped prosecuting violent offenders, liberal judges decided it was a bright idea to grant bail for repeat violent offenders, and recently, an increase in anti-cop rhetoric and support for the defund-the-police movement ramped up. Sadly, Officer French's death was far from honor from Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot this week when she didn't even know the fallen officer's name.",

In the past week alone, there have been 21 murders, 36 sexual assault, 164 robberies, and 199 car thefts and Chicago alone. The people feel hopeless, the many victim families feel forgotten, and the cops feel demoralized. How can anyone tell me this is not a failure of leadership? Here for reaction, Florida Congressman Byron Donalds and FOX News contributor, Lara Trump. You know, Lara, the least that they could do is remember the name of the fallen officer.",

This is disgusting. It is disgraceful. But you're right, Lawrence, it starts at the top. The leadership in Chicago ought to be ashamed of themselves and it starts with the mayor. But let's not forget it goes much larger than that. Look at the fact that Joe Biden is allowing people to just flow into our country, violent gang members going across America to all of our major cities. We know that crimes are up. We know that the police have been defunded. They've been demoralized. It is absolutely shameful. And, sadly, these great American cities are going to be lost if somebody doesn't get a handle on this. It's in Chicago. It's in New York. And you're right, it is also because they are letting these people out. They have changed policies that are allowing violent criminals back on the street to commit more crimes. This officer did not need to die. She is murdered. She was murdered. And she is dead today because the man who killed her was not in jail, and he should have been for a hit and run. So, it's crazy that this is happening in America. If we don't get a hold of this, not only are we going to lose our great American cities, we're going to lose America herself.",

The reason this is happening is because you have these District Attorneys who are being elected, whose sole view when it comes to criminal justice is to not prosecute anybody. And this is going to be a tragedy for the inner cities in our country. It's not just Chicago, it is Portland, it's Seattle, it's Los Angeles, and it's New York City. You have these District Attorneys who choose to play politics. They will try to get into the headlines and prosecute people because of politics or because of where they might be on a certain political framework or even on a racial framework, but they won't just punish crime, no matter who commits it, no matter where they commit it. And that's how somebody like this gets out on the street. It's abhorrent that something like this is happening in our country, but to the citizens of Chicago, you elected your DA, it is time to bring somebody else in, because they're not doing the job of making sure that violent offenders stay behind bars. That is what is going to keep our cities safe while also supporting our police, but there are these DAs that aren't actually doing their jobs.",

So really, I think that the Republicans are being given a gift, and it's a sad gift. It's a gift we don't want because we don't want to see this happen in America. But we need to make sure that we are standing behind our men and women in blue. We need to get behind our cops, we need to refund police departments. You've seen across the country, places like Minneapolis that took funding away. Lawrence, they're bringing the funding back to the police departments, because guess what? When you don't have police officers on the street, your crime goes up. You have murders that increase. You have rapes and violent offenses that increase.

And so this is important for the citizens of our inner cities, they have to start looking at the people who are running and not just look at party ID and party label. Because if we all get caught up in what big media talks about in terms of what Republicans believe or Democrats believe, voters are actually not implementing their power the way they should.

How about telling people that the vaccine, the research has been in the works for 30 years already. The whole way that this was marshaled out by the current administration has led to this distrust, has actually galvanized its distrust. It's an emotional decision.

I'm Lawrence Jones in tonight for Judge Jeanine and at this hour, a crime pandemic continues to sweep across the nation and few cities have been hit harder than Chicago. One week ago, 29-year-old officer, Ella French was tragically murdered while conducting a traffic stop in the city. According to recently released F.B.I. data, in the first seven months of 2021, forty four law enforcement officers were murdered in the line of duty. That's an over a 41 percent increase from the previous year. So what changed? Progressive district attorneys stopped prosecuting violent offenders, liberal judges decided it was a bright idea to grant bail for repeat violent offenders, and recently, an increase in anti-cop rhetoric and support for the defund-the-police movement ramped up. Sadly, Officer French's death was far from honor from Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot this week when she didn't even know the fallen officer's name."

That drew a quick response from the Fraternal Order of Police who released this tweet, saying quote, \"Her name was Ella French. French, not Frank, French.\" Officer French, we appreciate your sacrifice to keep the City of Chicago safe. And unfortunately, there is much more work to be done. Take a look at these stats. In the past week alone, there have been 21 murders, 36 sexual assault, 164 robberies, and 199 car thefts and Chicago alone. The people feel hopeless, the many victim families feel forgotten, and the cops feel demoralized. How can anyone tell me this is not a failure of leadership? Here for reaction, Florida Congressman Byron Donalds and FOX News contributor, Lara Trump. You know, Lara, the least that they could do is remember the name of the fallen officer."

And by the way, Mayor Lightfoot got it back from the cops, they turn their backs on her whenever they were on the way to see her comrade, who was in critical condition because of this shooting. This is disgusting. It is disgraceful. But you're right, Lawrence, it starts at the top. The leadership in Chicago ought to be ashamed of themselves and it starts with the mayor. But let's not forget it goes much larger than that. Look at the fact that Joe Biden is allowing people to just flow into our country, violent gang members going across America to all of our major cities. We know that crimes are up. We know that the police have been defunded. They've been demoralized. It is absolutely shameful. And, sadly, these great American cities are going to be lost if somebody doesn't get a handle on this. It's in Chicago. It's in New York. And you're right, it is also because they are letting these people out. They have changed policies that are allowing violent criminals back on the street to commit more crimes. This officer did not need to die. She is murdered. She was murdered. And she is dead today because the man who killed her was not in jail, and he should have been for a hit and run. So, it's crazy that this is happening in America. If we don't get a hold of this, not only are we going to lose our great American cities, we're going to lose America herself."

Congressman, why is this happening all across the country?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REP. BYRON DONALDS (R-FL)",
      "utterance": "First of all, good to be with you this evening. The reason this is happening is because you have these District Attorneys who are being elected, whose sole view when it comes to criminal justice is to not prosecute anybody. And this is going to be a tragedy for the inner cities in our country. It's not just Chicago, it is Portland, it's Seattle, it's Los Angeles, and it's New York City. You have these District Attorneys who choose to play politics. They will try to get into the headlines and prosecute people because of politics or because of where they might be on a certain political framework or even on a racial framework, but they won't just punish crime, no matter who commits it, no matter where they commit it. And that's how somebody like this gets out on the street. It's abhorrent that something like this is happening in our country, but to the citizens of Chicago, you elected your DA, it is time to bring somebody else in, because they're not doing the job of making sure that violent offenders stay behind bars. That is what is going to keep our cities safe while also supporting our police, but there are these DAs that aren't actually doing their jobs."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JONES",
      "utterance": "The DAs, the judges decide that they are just going to grant bail when you have people that are at risk to society. Lara, I want to go to you because the congressman picked up on something that I think is great, and that is elections and elections do have consequences. So make the case to the audience, what do Republicans need to do, and what does the message need to be in the midterms when it comes to these local races? This is not a Federal issue. This is a local issue and it is happening to communities all across this country. What is the case?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "L. TRUMP",
      "utterance": "Well, the case is really being made for Republicans right now by the Democrats in leadership. You know, you look around the country, it is in Democrat-run cities that you see these massive spikes in crime, people literally getting punched in the street and robbed in broad daylight in cities like New York City that used to be a safe place to be, they no longer are. So really, I think that the Republicans are being given a gift, and it's a sad gift. It's a gift we don't want because we don't want to see this happen in America. But we need to make sure that we are standing behind our men and women in blue. We need to get behind our cops, we need to refund police departments. You've seen across the country, places like Minneapolis that took funding away. Lawrence, they're bringing the funding back to the police departments, because guess what? When you don't have police officers on the street, your crime goes up. You have murders that increase. You have rapes and violent offenses that increase. So let's get the cops some funding and let's get behind them."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JONES",
      "utterance": "It seems like an obvious case to be made though. But Congressman, you've got to run in those races, and as someone that travels all across the country, and sees the decay, these people that are on the ground, they don't care what political party is necessarily running. But Republicans have to run in those local races, and there seems to be a lack of Republicans that are in those races. So, you can't just make the case, you've got to be there to get the job done. What do you think, Congressman?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DONALDS",
      "utterance": "I think you're right. But it's very, very difficult to a lot of our urban areas, let's be perfectly blunt, are heavy Democrat-precincts. The voters just vote Democrat, frankly, too often, they don't actually look at the people running. They just stayed party line and that's how they do things, unfortunately. And so this is important for the citizens of our inner cities, they have to start looking at the people who are running and not just look at party ID and party label. Because if we all get caught up in what big media talks about in terms of what Republicans believe or Democrats believe, voters are actually not implementing their power the way they should. You've got to look very closely at the people who are running and vote for people and support people who want to have safe communities, safe streets, and law and order. That is what's going to help our communities, nothing else."

Kids being shot in the head at six years old, seven years old, and I see them playing outside and they want to have a great life just like the rest of us. But there seems to be that -- they're being robbed of a choice. So, can you talk about this specifically, as a mom, how does that make you feel knowing that our American family members across the country are being robbed of liberty? That's what it is. Their liberty has been robbed?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "L. TRUMP",
      "utterance": "Yes, it's absolutely devastating. Any American child should be able to go on in their neighborhoods, safely play on their street, ride in a car with their parent without fear of getting shot. But now, in so many of these cities in America, that is not the case. But I think it's important. Let's go back to what you were just talking to the Congressman about, let's get Republicans that are going to go door to door in the midterm election, knock on the doors of people in the inner cities and say, I am a Republican, I am here to clean up this community to keep you safe. I want to make sure that it's your kids that are able to get out and play with their friends on these streets. So Republicans also have to be able to go into those communities and take that step so that they interact with people and just your name on the ballot isn't going to do it. You've got to get down in these communities and talk to people."

      "utterance": "Welcome back to JUSTICE. Americans continue to look for answers about the best way to navigate the COVID pandemic. The surge of the delta variant is raising concerns as kids prepared to hopefully return to the classroom. Meanwhile, \"The New York Times\" reported this week that only 28 percent of young black New Yorkers are vaccinated. So, what's responsible for this distress of the vaccine? Joining me now with important updates on America's battle against the virus is author of \"COVID: The Politics of Fear and the Power of Science,\" FOX News medical contributor, Dr. Marc Siegel. Doctor, thanks so much for joining JUSTICE tonight. I've been really looking forward to this because you know, there are so many misconceptions out there that it was just these Trump voters, these white voters that were skeptical of the vaccine. Meanwhile, I was talking to people in my community the entire time, and they have been skeptical the entire time. They say Tuskegee and some of the stories that our grandparents told us. What do you hear, Doctor?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DR. MARC SIEGEL, FOX NEWS CHANNEL MEDICAL CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Exactly that. You know, just what we need, right, is the black community to be told by the government we know and you don't know. We're going to teach you and you're going to do what we say. If you don't agree, it is misinformation. Bullying and shaming -- that'll work really well with the black community, which, as you said, went through the Tuskegee experiments where syphilis went untreated, as you know, Lawrence, even after they had penicillin. What a disgrace. And then, of course, there was Henrietta Lacks down in Baltimore, who cells after she got cancer was sold for billions of dollars, and the family never got a penny, and you could go on and on. What about slavery? I mean, the black community has a long 400-year history of being mistreated by the medical establishment. And now, we're going to tell black people what they should do and why? How about using community leaders? How about doctors? How about people that people know that have gotten the vaccine? Not the government. The government is never going to be able to convince this community to take it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JONES",
      "utterance": "Doctor, I feel like it's laziness that we're seeing from these leaders. Instead of talking about the issues and concerns that these folks have in my community, they just say, just take it. And another thing, I've got to go back to the misconception. You know, part of the reason why they are backing off some of these mandates is because they thought it was just these Trump voters were the people that were hesitant of the vaccine. Now, they are realizing, a lot of minorities -- because the data suggests that -- are hesitant as well."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SIEGEL",
      "utterance": "Well, that's right. And the reason that people are hesitant is because they are emotional about a decision, whether they're going to put a needle in their arm or whether they're going to don a mask or something -- somebody is telling them to do something. They are emotional and you have to deal with emotion with emotion. And as far as the Trump situation is concerned, it would have helped a lot if somebody had actually said, hey, this vaccine came from the Trump administration. It was made in nine months, used a public-private partnership which was classic for President Trump, by the way. You know, bringing the private sector and saying we're going to pay for this vaccine. How about telling people that the vaccine, the research has been in the works for 30 years already. The whole way that this was marshaled out by the current administration has led to this distrust, has actually galvanized its distrust. It's an emotional decision. You've got to bring -- go to people where they live. You can't bring some superimposed from on high. And then of course, we see President Obama's party, Lawrence, where everybody is frolicking, right? I bet the people that crashed that party at the end were unvaccinated and didn't wear a mask. I mean, you know, you have to actually follow the same rules that you're asking other people to follow."

Doctor, I want to get your comment on this, because I've noticed that a lot of these public officials have been leading with fear and it is starting to impact people. I want to bring it to producers to go to this board member, Linda Sexton in Normandy Public School. This is what she had to say. \"It's not just --\" Do we have the sound? Let's play that."

I think they have value. But how about making sure that teachers in the school are actually being vaccinated. We don't even know if that particular parent is vaccinated that is accusing other kids of murder.' Well, you know, kids are small, they can't stand up for themselves all the time. So, some five-year-old is going to fight back against this bullying parent. Again, I'm for masks. I'm not for bullying. I'm not for shaming. I'm not for ridiculing other people. I am for making sure teachers get vaccinated."

It is safe to return from school, the C.D.C. said it and it wasn't until the White House changed their guidance at the C.D.C. move, then Doctor, we learned that there was coordination between the C.D.C. and the unions. That's not science."

I mean, you know, it's easy for a rich person to sit on the beach and learn remote and have a tutor come in or have food brought in, but in the inner cities.

President Joe Biden's agenda is failing at the southern border and fears are on the rise as Americans watch the crisis grow tremendously.

This is the Biden administration policies that have made this happen. This is six months, just only six months into his administration, and it is completely unraveling. Over 40,000 illegal migrants have been dropped off in cities that have tested positive for COVID. I want you to think about that. Others that they don't even know right now because they haven't even been tested. The tents are overflowing in the parks right now at Anzalduas Park in Rio Grande Valley. In some areas of the Rio Grande Valley, the COVID explosion has gone over 900 percent in some areas. I can tell you this, they have agents on the front lines that are now being pulled off the frontlines because they've been exposed to COVID, and not only that, the national security implications, Lawrence, are so huge, because while our agents are dealing with people coming in, an overflow of 600, I saw this myself in other areas of the border, they are moving in -- the drug cartels, Mexican drug cartels, Colombian drug cartels are moving in narcotics and fentanyl, and people that they consider gotaways.

It's an absolute disaster for the people that are being brought into this country that are living in the shadows that will be living in the shadows. I want you to think about this, Lawrence. Those thousands of children that have been trafficked into the United States, some of them have been abused in ways that we can't even describe. The people that are coming here looking for a better life, only to realize that there is nothing for them here. The failure on the part of our government to hold these drug cartels and these human smugglers accountable. I literally watched as smugglers came across the Rio Grande Valley in the middle of the night, 1:00 a.m. in the morning, 12:00 a.m., bringing boatloads of people and literally handing them off to our National Guard and warning the National Guard that they better not puncture their rafts, because those rafts cost the cartels a lot of money, and they have got more people to bring across. And I said to the National Guard, well, what are you doing? What can you do? And they said, I can't do anything. I just have got to make sure that that the people that they're bringing across don't drown. Those are my orders. So, that's the truth. That's what's happening at the border. And to tell you something else, you know, the residents that live in the Rio Grande Valley sector, the residents that live in Arizona, the residents that live along these border communities, they are suffering. Their resources are being tied up, they can't even get ambulances on time. The authorities are warning residents that there are people in their communities with COVID. This is the reality of the Biden administration policies. This is what is going on at our border, and it is not just staying there. It is coming to every city in America and it is harming not only Americans, but it is harming the people that the government here says they actually care about, which are the migrants."

She claimed earlier this week -- I'm sorry earlier this summer, that skyrocketing violent crime in major cities is a right-wing talking point, which flies in the face of, you know, actual crime stats, right? She wants to claim that conservatives would trade in tax cuts for the ability to say the N-word quote, \"Like the good old days.\" This is a person that only seeks to divide via hyperbole on steroids and pixie sticks. She lied about her blog, by the way, remember that from years ago that had homophobic anti-Semitic racist posts. She said it was hacked and NBC, what do they do? They turn around and award her a primetime hosting role. Of course, they did. Now fortunately, her ratings are as low as her discourse and in the same world, hopefully someone of importance at Comcast which owns NBC or NBC or MSNBC steps in and says, you know what, this poisonous discourse has no place on our air.

And two thirds of cable news is petrified, therefore, to criticize her as a result, because we wouldn't want to insult anybody. But here's the steak, something that no one broached on the Cortez News Network, otherwise known as CNN, in that documentary talked about. AOC has introduced 21 substantial bills. Of those 21 bills, none received floor votes, therefore, not one became law. In terms of her performance against other congressional Democrats, she ranks 230th out of 240 in terms of getting things done, but no matter, she is a performance artist, not a lawmaker, and therefore much of our media, they say, you know what, it's more than enough."

He is rounding the bases, he is dancing. The only bad thing is, is he recently said that he has never seen the \"Field of Dreams,\" the movie. So, let's just hope that he watched that after that moment. I think this was a great thing for the game of baseball, which has been seeing some low engagement numbers amongst its youth. But it's also great for America. You know, it gave people something to look forward to. It was the most watched regular season MLB game in 16 years.

But also, you can go with your family, you can go with your friends, you can have a beer and sit in the stands. When I was there, you know filming for our FOX Nation special for the 30th Anniversary, one of my favorite things was asking people what brought them to the Field of Dreams. And you can just tell how much this movie meant to people because it's the values, too. This guy plowed through his cornfield, which is his livelihood, to follow this voice and he built it. They came, same thing happened in Dyersville this year with the Yankees and the White Sox. I mean you see it right now, them coming out of the cornfield.

Brother, you know, the producers were briefing me and I was reading your story. You started off as a wrestler. And then you decide that's not enough. I'm just going to become an MMA fighter. How did you gain the will to do something like that? I mean, being wrestler was already enough."

    {
      "speaker": "NICK NEWELL, MMA FIGHTER",
      "utterance": "I guess -- I guess, ignorance is a little bit of a story. You know, when I started off wrestling, I started and I lost my first 17 matches and I had a friend that convinced me to wrestle all year long and when I came back for my sophomore year, I ended up placing my regionals and then I ended up going all state. So it was then that I realized the value of hard work and putting in the time and then not doubting yourself. So, when I was done wrestling in college, I still wanted to compete. And I went to a few shows, and I've been training martial arts a little bit, just kind of for fun. And I was like, you know what, I'll do one fight and one fight kind of turned into a world title and a career."

    {
      "speaker": "JONES",
      "utterance": "Wow. Nick, was there ever a moment among amongst all of this, you know, this real thing that you've got to do? You were born this way that you said, you know what, this is just not for me?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "NEWELL",
      "utterance": "Well, the thing is, you know, I think that going through adversity builds character, right? And you can either become a victim of your circumstances, or you can create your own. And for me, it's important to not just curl up in a ball and give up because I'm facing challenges. When I look at the world and I think about people's lives and I think about what people are going through, I know that every single person is facing challenges. And, you know, I have one hand, I was born with one hand, but um, you know, who am I to say that my life is any harder than anyone else's, or I have a harder road. I just have to take what I have and be thankful that I do have what I have and work and accomplish and become something."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JONES",
      "utterance": "Such a great outlook, Nick, there are a lot of young people out there that may be struggling, that may be defeated. What do you say to them?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "NEWELL",
      "utterance": "You never know unless you try. You know, people look at me for inspiration and that's good. But really, the self-motivator has got to be you. You've got to find something you really enjoy and a passion and you want to give the world the best version of yourself, and you could go out there and you could fail and I failed before. I've lost, I've won. But I've also lost but I try and I never give up and I just keep going and that's why I am who I am. I've never been someone to give up when things get too hard. I always kind -- I've never had the easy road. So, I learned to appreciate hard work and struggles and take them as presents and build and grow from those."

    {
      "speaker": "JONES",
      "utterance": "Brother, you have the eye of the tiger. You just don't stop, and I appreciate it and I appreciate you inspiring this audience and I will be watching your movie, brother.
