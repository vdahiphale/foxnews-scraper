      "sentences": "Hi, I'm Greg Gutfeld with Morgan Ortagus, Juan Williams, Jesse Watters, and a pinky ring is her hula hoop, Dana Perino -- \"The Five.\" A fiend shot and killed at least two people in northeastern France last night, he yelled Allahu Akbar while opening fire at a Christmas market. Wonder what he was trying to tell us. The terrorist was known to authorities, 27 convictions and currently wanted for other violent acts. Considered a threat to the state he was still out and about and might already had fled the country. Now, as an American, the striking thing about this recent attack is how rarely we hear about them now. That's good. But the venom of Islamic terror still exist and injected into a bitter loser culminates in mayhem. It's been so long since writing about this and talking about it, I'm pretty rusty. The fact that such evil can move freely is another reason why security is the backbone of freedom, and while you'll never be 100 percent safe. The only way to enjoy freedom is to understand the price it takes to maintain it.  A border, it's important. But when someone born here is radicalized, that's not enough. Solid walls keep bodies at bay but toxic ideas flowed happily over them. The terrorist was in prison. Prisons have walls and borders, but they only work if the dirt bag is still inside them. He was out and able to kill innocent people. Why? How is that possible? It's infuriating. France, a target of numerous attacks, they still have trouble with priorities. While America enjoys relative safety compared with the past, this is a reminder for the modern world that as we move forward there're still those who wish to take us back.  You know, Morgan, you've dealt with this. It's been kind of your expertise. The last big attack here was around Halloween last year, a terrorist in a truck killed eight and they're mostly tourists. But it seems like we're not really focusing on this as much anymore. Is that wise?",

I do think that this attack foreshadows the coming debate that this administration is going to have very soon about what we're doing in Afghanistan, if we will keep forces there, if we will pull them out. And I think it serves to remind all of us that this is a generational struggle. This attack may not have been ISIS directed, but it was clearly ISIS inspired.

You could get on that list if you fight for ISIS, or even if you go to a jihadi website, or if you have any contact with a suspected jihadist they put you on the list. And that allows the French authorities to place a GPS monitor in your car, it allows them to wiretap you, and exchange information with the other E.U. nations.  You know, we had our eyes on the 9/11 hijackers, on the Boston bombers, on the Pulse Nightclub shooters, and it's very frustrating as an American when someone perpetrates an attack and then you have the idea that the FBI kind of was aware a little bit and it looks like the same thing happened over in France.

The hearing lasted just over an hour, included Cohen's attorney asking for leniency, suggesting that his client made a remarkable life decision to cooperate with the federal government, offering evidence against the most powerful person in the country, saying Cohen was a man of integrity and an honest businessman. But U.S. attorneys painted a different picture of a man fueled by greed and a lust for power who deliberately and willfully stole millions and he wrote in fate in the electoral process. They say trying to influence the outcome of the presidential election. Judge William Pauley said that somewhere along the way, Michael Cohen did lose his moral compass and the magnitude and breadth of misconduct require significant deterrence. That deterrence, as you've mentioned, 36 month in federal prison, three years supervised parole, $1.3 million in restitution to the IRS, the forfeiture of a $500,000 loan, and about $100,000 in fines.

      "utterance": "Hi, I'm Greg Gutfeld with Morgan Ortagus, Juan Williams, Jesse Watters, and a pinky ring is her hula hoop, Dana Perino -- \"The Five.\" A fiend shot and killed at least two people in northeastern France last night, he yelled Allahu Akbar while opening fire at a Christmas market. Wonder what he was trying to tell us. The terrorist was known to authorities, 27 convictions and currently wanted for other violent acts. Considered a threat to the state he was still out and about and might already had fled the country. Now, as an American, the striking thing about this recent attack is how rarely we hear about them now. That's good. But the venom of Islamic terror still exist and injected into a bitter loser culminates in mayhem. It's been so long since writing about this and talking about it, I'm pretty rusty. The fact that such evil can move freely is another reason why security is the backbone of freedom, and while you'll never be 100 percent safe. The only way to enjoy freedom is to understand the price it takes to maintain it. A border, it's important. But when someone born here is radicalized, that's not enough. Solid walls keep bodies at bay but toxic ideas flowed happily over them. The terrorist was in prison. Prisons have walls and borders, but they only work if the dirt bag is still inside them. He was out and able to kill innocent people. Why? How is that possible? It's infuriating. France, a target of numerous attacks, they still have trouble with priorities. While America enjoys relative safety compared with the past, this is a reminder for the modern world that as we move forward there're still those who wish to take us back. You know, Morgan, you've dealt with this. It's been kind of your expertise. The last big attack here was around Halloween last year, a terrorist in a truck killed eight and they're mostly tourists. But it seems like we're not really focusing on this as much anymore. Is that wise?"

He also, for the military, had great success against Syria -- excuse me, against ISIS in Syria and Iraq. I do think that this attack foreshadows the coming debate that this administration is going to have very soon about what we're doing in Afghanistan, if we will keep forces there, if we will pull them out. And I think it serves to remind all of us that this is a generational struggle. This attack may not have been ISIS directed, but it was clearly ISIS inspired. And this continues to be something that Europe struggles greatly with, and we can't keep our eye off the ball."

And according to the Department of Homeland Security, they stop about ten terrorist-related people coming into this country every single year. And, obviously, a lot more money needs to be spent in order to protect the U.S. national security. They have watch lists. They have them here and they have them there. And right now there's about 26,000 people on the French terror watch list. You could get on that list if you fight for ISIS, or even if you go to a jihadi website, or if you have any contact with a suspected jihadist they put you on the list. And that allows the French authorities to place a GPS monitor in your car, it allows them to wiretap you, and exchange information with the other E.U. nations. You know, we had our eyes on the 9/11 hijackers, on the Boston bombers, on the Pulse Nightclub shooters, and it's very frustrating as an American when someone perpetrates an attack and then you have the idea that the FBI kind of was aware a little bit and it looks like the same thing happened over in France. You know, the viciousness of the attacks kind of strikes me. I went back and looked at the type of attacks in France, and there's been a lot, especially in France, firebombs, hostage taking, machete attacks, car ramming, hammer attack, machine guns --"

What strikes me, first and foremost, is that this guy had a long criminal record as I've read it. He had been arrested for breaking into a pharmacy, breaking into a dentist office, and put in jail in Germany at one point. He's a bad guy. It does not appear, as Morgan said, to be part of any kind of terror network, although the French police have picked up five people who, maybe, family, but somehow associated with this guy as they try to pursue him at this moment. But in response to you being rusty in terms of doing this, I think that's good news for America --"

You know we just have the guy who ran over the woman down in Charlottesville put in jail for life this week. So, I mean, those are real things. But in terms of trying to advance the border argument, I would wish that the president would just be more direct. It's hard to say that terrorists come across the southern borders because the State Department says that's not the case, but it is the case that he wants to make the argument that we're more secure."

Near the very beginning, he told the judge this may be hard to believe but today is one of the most meaningful days in my life, the day I got my freedom back because he says his blind loyalty to Donald Trump led him to choose a path of darkness over light, ignoring his own moral compass and spending several years in what he called mental incarceration. The hearing lasted just over an hour, included Cohen's attorney asking for leniency, suggesting that his client made a remarkable life decision to cooperate with the federal government, offering evidence against the most powerful person in the country, saying Cohen was a man of integrity and an honest businessman. But U.S. attorneys painted a different picture of a man fueled by greed and a lust for power who deliberately and willfully stole millions and he wrote in fate in the electoral process. They say trying to influence the outcome of the presidential election. Judge William Pauley said that somewhere along the way, Michael Cohen did lose his moral compass and the magnitude and breadth of misconduct require significant deterrence. That deterrence, as you've mentioned, 36 month in federal prison, three years supervised parole, $1.3 million in restitution to the IRS, the forfeiture of a $500,000 loan, and about $100,000 in fines. Jesse, he can spend the holidays with his family. He will turn himself in on March 6."

We voted for him. He's the legitimate President of the United States. We love what he's doing. How dare you say that? He's saying -- he doesn't mean that they're going to revolt against the country and like pick up weapons and go after people. That's not what he meant. He just meant that there would be frustration, right? And big time. I also feel like on the campaign finance laws, it is murky. I've talked to three different lawyers today.

And I think, as Dana said, the president can make a clearer argument here that I was doing something to protect my family. I similarly talked to several lawyers today and had everyone had a different response on this. So it comes down to the politics. What do the 20, 30 Republican senators in the Senate think if the House impeaches, and do they want to remove a president for what is a campaign violation, or making a payment to protect his family.
