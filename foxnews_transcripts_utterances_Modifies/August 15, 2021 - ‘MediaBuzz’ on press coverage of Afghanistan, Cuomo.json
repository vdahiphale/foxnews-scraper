The plan to leave Afghanistan has been in place both under President Trump and President Biden. But then gets to the issue of the day. How do you leave? When do you leave? Under what circumstances do you leave? I think it wouldn't be a partisan. It would simply be objective truth telling to say that the Biden administration absolutely fumbled this.

And in addition to that, when you just look at what is top of mind for voters, Afghanistan is not even on the radar. What is on the radar and what was quite frankly during the Trump administration was America first? Since the pandemic, it's America first even more. You can't -- many American voters feel focus on -- the Biden administration, they feel -- or our elected officials focused on the economy and COVID, if they're worrying about Afghanistan. Look, whether you agree or of disagree with President Biden, I think many of us didn't expect how fast the Taliban would come up to power. The president has said they need to fight for themselves.

Statement -- put it up, please. One more year, or five more years, says Biden, of U.S. military presence wouldn't have made a difference if the Afghan military cannot or will not hold its own country. And an endless American presence in the middle of another country's civil conflict was not acceptable to me. Will, CNN's Jake Tapper this morning says it seems shocking President Biden could have been so wrong, saying six weeks ago the collapse was highly unlikely.

And that is do we want to have an endless presence in Afghanistan. And by the way, whatever my opinion might be on that, I have it with some humility because of how complicated this entire issue is. We don't want to be in the exercise of nation building. We can't have more will for freedom than the Afghan people do. We can't indulge a military industrial complex that has profited on two decades of war. But at the same time, we do need to make sure that the war on terror is something that remains overseas and not here at home. So I have my opinion with some humility. What my position is, though, it's what's happened in the past one to two months, specifically now in the last couple of weeks. The Biden administration, it did not have to be this way. And I'm sorry to be repetitive, Howie, but, you know, we could have been prepared to take care of the people that took care of us.

Everybody knew this was not going to be easy. Everybody knew the Taliban would rise to some power. But look, we have been training with and we've working with the Afghan government, more specifically the Afghany military. And the military, I was told by people who have been in Afghanistan and the military, which I have not, they said that they were stronger, they were more prepared. So, you know, at some point, somebody -- I don't want to use the phrase, but I'm going to pull the trigger on getting out of Afghanistan and quite frankly I think that Donald Trump, if he were president right now, would be dealing with the same issues again, Howie, because we just didn't realize - -",

Yet in places like Florida, so the coverage, the criticism from the mainstream media is about how you can't have a mask mandate in schools because of Governor DeSantis' orders but, you know, the deaths of teachers that we heard about recently in the media, those were unvaccinated teachers.

The media should be asking these questions every day, especially in a wartime situation. I'm Howard Kurtz and this is \"Media Buzz.\" The lightning quick collapse of the Afghan military as the Taliban marched into Kabul today as U.S. official tells Fox that President Ashraf Ghani fled the country has stunned everyone from the media and war experts to the Biden administration and Congress.

The plan to leave Afghanistan has been in place both under President Trump and President Biden. But then gets to the issue of the day. How do you leave? When do you leave? Under what circumstances do you leave? I think it wouldn't be a partisan. It would simply be objective truth telling to say that the Biden administration absolutely fumbled this.

I mean, Howie, when you look at the polls, Americans largely favor pulling out of Afghanistan. We have been there, as Will cited correctly, for two decades. And in addition to that, when you just look at what is top of mind for voters, Afghanistan is not even on the radar. What is on the radar and what was quite frankly during the Trump administration was America first? Since the pandemic, it's America first even more. You can't -- many American voters feel focus on -- the Biden administration, they feel -- or our elected officials focused on the economy and COVID, if they're worrying about Afghanistan. Look, whether you agree or of disagree with President Biden, I think many of us didn't expect how fast the Taliban would come up to power. The president has said they need to fight for themselves.

President Biden saying he inherited this withdrawal from Donald Trump who invited the Taliban to Camp David back in 2019. There was a lot of criticism that never happened. Statement -- put it up, please. One more year, or five more years, says Biden, of U.S. military presence wouldn't have made a difference if the Afghan military cannot or will not hold its own country. And an endless American presence in the middle of another country's civil conflict was not acceptable to me. Will, CNN's Jake Tapper this morning says it seems shocking President Biden could have been so wrong, saying six weeks ago the collapse was highly unlikely. But Biden makes the case that what's the point of staying and investing more and more American treasure."

And that is do we want to have an endless presence in Afghanistan. And by the way, whatever my opinion might be on that, I have it with some humility because of how complicated this entire issue is. We don't want to be in the exercise of nation building. We can't have more will for freedom than the Afghan people do. We can't indulge a military industrial complex that has profited on two decades of war. But at the same time, we do need to make sure that the war on terror is something that remains overseas and not here at home. So I have my opinion with some humility. What my position is, though, it's what's happened in the past one to two months, specifically now in the last couple of weeks. The Biden administration, it did not have to be this way. And I'm sorry to be repetitive, Howie, but, you know, we could have been prepared to take care of the people that took care of us.

Now, the media can debate, as Will is saying, whether or not Trump might have handled the actual details of the withdrawal differently, but didn't Joe Biden end up carrying out Donald Trump's policy on getting out of Afghanistan?"

Everybody knew this was not going to be easy. Everybody knew the Taliban would rise to some power. But look, we have been training with and we've working with the Afghan government, more specifically the Afghany military. And the military, I was told by people who have been in Afghanistan and the military, which I have not, they said that they were stronger, they were more prepared. So, you know, at some point, somebody -- I don't want to use the phrase, but I'm going to pull the trigger on getting out of Afghanistan and quite frankly I think that Donald Trump, if he were president right now, would be dealing with the same issues again, Howie, because we just didn't realize - -"

It's all very confusing in 2021. I'm sure it's that way for Governor Cuomo, Howie. He has been told, first, my last name is Cuomo, bad things don't happen to me, I'm entitled to this power, this is privilege, nothing ever is needed to hold me to account because I'm a best-selling Emmy award-winning author lionized by the press. And then he wakes up one day and the world is upside down. Everybody wants to hold him accountable for some things that he did. I'm sure he is suffering from whiplash right now. He is wondering how the world got turned upside down. And so on his way out, what is he going to give you? He is going to give you that same privilege and defiance that has got him where he is today.

What was so disgusting to all of us, whether victims are not whether women or not, was that this man was saying mea culpa but not really, not accepting responsibility, stepping down but only to get out of the way politically, again not owning what he did. You have to accept responsibility, you know, apologizing, even. And you know, he didn't go far enough because it's one of those, like, you know, I'm sorry, but I'm not really sorry.

He hasn't talked -- I know you did the whole first segment which is great on Afghanistan. He hasn't talked. He will not be talking to the press until at least Wednesday when he's back in the White House from Camp David. He does these so rarely. But it is interesting. You know, Peter Doocy asked a tough question. He sort of laughs it off. Kaitlan Collins asked a tough question. Again, I mean, this happened overseas, he gets all angry about it. I'm not saying that Joe Biden is necessarily a misogynist, by the way that he reacts to Kaitlan Collins, but I do think that a press looking at it objectively, the way the Trump answered questions, would be asking those sorts of questions about what seems to rile him up and what he sort of laughs off and moves on."

And also, what I find very curious is it's very, the debate is very focused on masks and mask mandates even though you still have -- in areas of the country where vaccination is very high, you still are not seeing an uptick in deaths. The vaccines are working, they don't, you know, prevent all breakthrough infections but any sort of the imagination but they're a tremendously good mitigation effort. Yet in places like Florida, so the coverage, the criticism from the mainstream media is about how you can't have a mask mandate in schools because of Governor DeSantis' orders but, you know, the deaths of teachers that we heard about recently in the media, those were unvaccinated teachers. Why are we not discussing the urgent need to vaccinate people? The media for some reason is obsessed with the mask issue which, to me, seems like kind of a side issue at this point, given the vaccines work better and that's what we need to focus on."

So, you're looking at Houston, for example. Houston has no more ICU beds in the pediatric units. And you know, it's interesting because I looked at local news pages just this morning and FOX Orlando reporting that about Houston. Obviously, the FOX stations throughout and local media stations whether they are ABC, NBC, CBS, are talking a lot about this. In fact, there is in Texas, I believe, local municipalities are defying Governor Abbott and saying, you know what, we're going to impose our own mask mandates.

But if you look at the statistics, they are as safe from a severe COVID outcome basically as a vaccinated adult is. So, I'm not of worried about them. I think it's reasonable to worry about their teachers. And you could. And I would support this, I think employees of public schools, of government agencies, the government should require them to get vaccinated or not teach there. And that's actually something that DeSantis' other order gets in the way of. So, I could understand criticism of prohibiting vaccine mandates for public employees but the media is not talking about that. They're talking about the mask mandates which are so -- which are inferior to getting people vaccinated. So that's why this is ridiculous."

      "speaker": "CLAMAN",
      "utterance": "He's a journalist and he should not be speaking out on it, especially because he is right there as one of the so-called faces on, you know, the Mount Rushmore over at CNN Primetime. CNN was in a tough position, you know, and basically, they probably held him to exactly what journalistic standards require, and that is anybody, whether it's a pundit or a reporter. If there's a conflict of interest they cannot participate in that conversation. That particular night when Governor Cuomo stepped down and resigned, well, yes, CNN audience didn't get to hear that story because he didn't weigh in but CNN did what they had to do under that circumstance, short of pulling him off the air. If he weighs in, Howie, that's a total disaster. There's very little upside to that. It's an awful situation for him to be in. The governor is his brother. And so clearly, yes, it was a tight spot."

    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Right. But the problem Robby, as I know you understand is that CNN last year changed its rules to allow Chris Cuomo to interview his brother, 11 love filled appearances on his Primetime show. And then that's when Andrew was riding high, and then pulled the plug on that. So, how much responsibility do you think Chris Cuomo has in what admittedly is and was a difficult situation."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SOAVE",
      "utterance": "Yes, that was a disastrous decision to allow him to interview his brother. You know, I don't blame Chris for sticking by the governor, a family should stick together. I think it's wrong to expect denunciation of family members. So that's fine. It makes sense to me. But he just can't do that and also be this very important host of this central news hour on CNN. You know? They were in a difficult situation because it's weird to have a very important political figure and on one hand and then his brother, the head of a very important news slot on a mainstream cable channel. I mean, that's the problem."

      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "You know, people don't realize that Chris and Andrew Cuomo growing up as a sone of a governor both had some resentment towards the press because of the way they felt their father Mario Cuomo had been treated with baseless rumors of mob ties. Liz, Chuck Todd, MSNBC, the Atlantic has a piece on this, that Andrew Cuomo could rise from the ashes here and run again in the future. That seems rather far-fetched to me."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CLAMAN",
      "utterance": "Highly unlikely. And here's why. When he resigned there wasn't a political friend in sight, Howie. That is a big issue. And obviously, the situation is such that, you know, it was sexual harassment and there were multiple, multiple cases, so when you think about exactly what has transpired here, it would be very tough for him to come back. I'm not saying he won't try."

I was thinking of Mark Sanford, the governor of South Carolina back in 2009, had a scandal, he disappeared for five days, said he was hiking the Appalachian trail. In essence, he was in Argentina with his mistress. He resigned. But just by 2013, he was nominated, and he was elected, rather --"

But the media would be against him from day one and what a contrast that is as we said earlier to the way in which he was lionized last year. We are out of time. Robby Soave, Liz Claman, thanks very much for joining us this Sunday. Still to come, Snopes suspends its co-founder over an ethical disaster. A major victory for the free Britney campaign. And Jeopardy's new how overcomes a negative campaign. That and more on the buzz beater."

      "utterance": "Time to beat the clock on this week's buzz beater. Go. Turns out the co-founder of the fact checking site Snopes has no sense of journalistic ethics. BuzzFeed discovered that David Mikkelson wrote 54 plagiarized articles. Someone to a fake byline with passengers just lifted from elsewhere. Snopes has suspended him, saying plagiarism undermines our mission and values. Full stop. Mikkelson apologized for his serious lapses in judgment. And said something about not having formal journalistic training. Seriously? But he'd also urge staffers to plagiarize when stories break to get more traffic. This is the watch dog site that sits in judgment of everyone else? What a travesty. Britney's social media campaign actually worked by constantly attacking her father for suffocating her during a 13-year conservatorship. Britney Spears pressured him into agreeing to withdraw. Her lawyer calls this vindication for Britney. We are disappointed, however, by their ongoing shameful attacks on Ms. Spears. Now Britney didn't win in court but Jamie Spears withdraw, saying in his filing that while he's the target, the unremitting target of unjustified attacks, he does not believe a public battle with his daughter is helping her. A public battle through the press is the only option she had with a lawyer who wouldn't represent her interest while she earns millions. Hash tag free Britney is now a reality. Jeopardy producer Mike Richards beat out a whole bunch of celebs to succeed Alex Trebek but hasn't exactly gotten a standing ovation from the media. Huff Post lead story was, wrong answer for Jeopardy host, questions whether all those tryouts were just for show."

      "utterance": "But Richards had to beat a wave of negative press, one model filed suit when was at The Price is Right, saying she was treated differently when she became pregnant. Another model sued saying, he wouldn't talk to her at all. Richards who have said in statement the complaints don't reflect the reality of who I am, wound up winning. And actress Mayim Bialik got the consolation prize hosting a few primetime specials. MSNBC's most popular liberal host is strongly considering leaving the network when her contract ends up early next year. Rachel Maddow sounds a bit tired after 12 years of the primetime grind. In a Daily Beast report she is intrigued by podcasting and streaming video. Well, this could well be a negotiating ploy. But she has talked about the importance of work/life balance. CNN host S.E. Cupp says she's getting treatment for a deep black hole of anxiety related to all the bad news out there. She writes in New York's daily news that she hasn't been able to watch any stories without spiraling into an uncontrollable sense of panic and fear, Cupp says. The anxiety I nurtured and cultivated over the years became an absolute monster during this perfect storm, pandemic, politics, problems. I can't string together a cohesive thought about the story I've been covering my entire career. You know, it takes courage to acknowledge such a painful struggle. And we wish her well. And I am, support that is. There we go. That's it for this edition of Media Buzz. I'm Howard Kurtz. We hope you'll like our Facebook page. I post my daily columns there. And let's continue the conversation on Twitter at Howard Kurtz. Check out my podcast, Media Buzz Meter at Apple iTunes, Google podcast or on your Amazon device. We tore up the show today obviously because of the breaking news in Kabul. Who ever dreamed that this would happen so quickly? The Taliban takeover is going to be analyzed by the media for a long time to come. We'll stay on it today here at Fox and we'll obviously be talking about it I am sure among other topics on our show next week. Which tease me up to say we will be back here next Sunday, 11:00 Eastern, 8 a.m. on the West Coast. We'll see you all then with the latest buzz.
