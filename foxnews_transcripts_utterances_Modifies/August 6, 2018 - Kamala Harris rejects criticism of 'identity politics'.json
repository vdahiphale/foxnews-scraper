This is why Trump won was because he was talking about one identity politics which was American. Now, then you have the left saying no, that's racist, because what you're really saying is white when you're talking about America. That's the consequence of identity politics is what they're saying is that if you are white, you're part of the oppressor group. So when you say identity politics, you're obviously racist.

It's not something that has nothing to do with Republicans. It's all the Republicans fault. So they demonize the Republicans and create a war. There's a war in women. There's a war in minorities. There's a war on Muslims. And a lot of Republicans don't go out every day and wake up, eat breakfast, and say how can I wage war on other people in this country? They go to work.

And he doesn't really even mention Donald Trump that much. The Republican is a little bit older. Not as charismatic. So he's got a little personality problem there. And now the national media is coming in big time. They started going positive and touting the president's success, and now they're just smearing this Democrat. They're linking him to Elizabeth Warren, calling her Pocahontas. They're going dirty late, so that means they're worried about it.

Looks like they spotted Air Force One. So two points to learn from this: First, Venezuela is a socialist paradise that was once rich, meaning if you like Bernie, this could be your future. Someone should page Alexandria and the Democrats. Hyper-inflation, depression, human rights violations, food shortages. There's your happy tomorrow. You, too, could eat your own zoo animals. Your currency could be worth less than toilet paper, except you couldn't buy toilet paper. Play your Bernie card right, and your medicine could vanish, your hospitals close. And for safety, you could do what Venezuelans do: Move to Colombia. Think it can't happen? Venezuela was once the most prosperous country in South America. But boy, they traded it all in for a dime-store socialist. The point of socialism: to find something good made by somebody else, take it for yourself. It's shoplifting as a political theory. You convince poor people to give up everything they have to beat the crap out of them if they ask for it back. They've been doing this for a century now. Socialism is even older than Bernie. And it doesn't work either. Second thing: The attack was by drone, equipped with C-4. I've been talking about this forever. Terror married to Amazon technology. It's a new scary reality. You can fret about it. The experts are already there. They don't want to ban socialists; they want to ban drones. Frankly, you can't ban either. But any smarty-pants knows which one is worse.

And what happens is everybody who in their specific groups then have to feel that their group is somehow more important than the other group, so what you end up having are warring factions. And you're seeing it a lot of times where one group accuses another group of cultural appropriation, and another group accused that group of something else. Ultimately, it's going to turn on itself. This is why Trump won was because he was talking about one identity politics which was American. Now, then you have the left saying no, that's racist, because what you're really saying is white when you're talking about America. That's the consequence of identity politics is what they're saying is that if you are white, you're part of the oppressor group. So when you say identity politics, you're obviously racist. So that's -- nothing good can come from identity politics because in its heart, it's about division."

They've seen something internally that tells them we've got to stop this. And, actually, independent women's voice, which on the president and McLaughlin survey shows that 85 percent of people don't care, as an example, about gender. They're not going to base their vote on gender. Yet, that's what all of 2016 was really. Vote for Hillary, she'll be the first woman president. Or vote for this person, it will be the first of this thing or the other thing. Americans are not caring because they've realized that that's false. It doesn't work. So her position is, well, this is now not working. We've relied on this. Let's retreat a bit. The president just being consistent, it was what the campaign was. We're all in this together. The numbers prove that's correct. All of the unemployment numbers we know, of course, are extraordinary now. That everyone's boat has been lifted. It's the thing that he promised. And it's based on all of us -- actually, not seeing each other differently, but seeing each other as a neighbor. That's what resonates with the American people and that's why it's working."

When you fix an issue that -- for example, plaguing the African-American community, you help all Americans. When you properly fund public education, you help all Americans. When you fix our broken immigration system, you help all Americans. And you make sure that everybody has the right to vote without disenfranchisement, you help all Americans. So, it's not identity politics to make sure America works for everybody, no matter their color, no matter their race, no matter their sexuality, no matter their zip code, and I think that's the fight the Democrats are having."

And what they do is they have these groups and they say these groups have grievances, and we're going to correct those grievances, we're going to right those wrongs or right those injustices, and we're going to take -- and use the government to do that by redistributing wealth and benefits. But what they do is they say everything that's wrong that's plaguing these identity groups is the fault of Republicans. It's not the groups fault. It's not the economy's fault. It's not something that has nothing to do with Republicans. It's all the Republicans fault. So they demonize the Republicans and create a war. There's a war in women. There's a war in minorities. There's a war on Muslims. And a lot of Republicans don't go out every day and wake up, eat breakfast, and say how can I wage war on other people in this country? They go to work.

You don't get the answer because it's never enough. The idea of identity politics is that as you are the oppressor and they're the oppressed, so there's actually no end in sight. So, if you say will you take our help? I would like to help you with this. That will not be enough. If you see any public disturbance between -- either with Antifa or activists, these are people who are not interested in a discussion, all right?

And he doesn't really even mention Donald Trump that much. The Republican is a little bit older. Not as charismatic. So he's got a little personality problem there. And now the national media is coming in big time. They started going positive and touting the president's success, and now they're just smearing this Democrat. They're linking him to Elizabeth Warren, calling her Pocahontas. They're going dirty late, so that means they're worried about it.

That this -- getting a 20 minute meeting that you don't even give a damn about is somehow -- what also gets me about the media, a lot of these people have never worked in business before, so they don't understand this but they make phone call to you.

But -- like Greg said, but they've found their villain, and it's Rudy Giuliani. So what they could do -- and there's and opportunity for the media to do, is treat this like a real humanitarian crisis. Like a hurricane or like a school shooting. They flood the zone with TV reporters. They bring an anchor to Chicago. They send undercover people. They talk with local pastors and leadership.

      "speaker": "So two points to learn from this",
      "utterance": "First, Venezuela is a socialist paradise that was once rich, meaning if you like Bernie, this could be your future. Someone should page Alexandria and the Democrats. Hyper-inflation, depression, human rights violations, food shortages. There's your happy tomorrow. You, too, could eat your own zoo animals. Your currency could be worth less than toilet paper, except you couldn't buy toilet paper. Play your Bernie card right, and your medicine could vanish, your hospitals close. And for safety, you could do what Venezuelans do: Move to Colombia. Think it can't happen? Venezuela was once the most prosperous country in South America. But boy, they traded it all in for a dime-store socialist. The point of socialism: to find something good made by somebody else, take it for yourself. It's shoplifting as a political theory. You convince poor people to give up everything they have to beat the crap out of them if they ask for it back. They've been doing this for a century now. Socialism is even older than Bernie. And it doesn't work either."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Second thing",
      "utterance": "The attack was by drone, equipped with C-4. I've been talking about this forever. Terror married to Amazon technology. It's a new scary reality. You can fret about it. The experts are already there. They don't want to ban socialists; they want to ban drones. Frankly, you can't ban either. But any smarty-pants knows which one is worse. Dana, I sat here and I said, technology in terror is the next wave."

But also, she said another thing, which is that Cuba is basically controlling this country. So everyone is basically dealing with a situation where, remember, during the Obama administration, he tried to make that overture, tried to change everything. It didn't actually work.

I knew somebody who tried to get to Milwaukee for a bachelor party, but they ended up sending them down to Richmond. Like, well, how did we get to Milwaukee?

Their kids are this way. This is like, once that flight opens up, you have your ticket ready. You scan it. You go. All right? And then you find your seat fast.

This is for any metal bands who love \"The Five,\" and liberals who hate the fact that Riley and I are buddies. I can't see that far -- oh, I'm talking to Dusty Hill from Z.Z. Top. That's his wife. I know, are these great pictures, Dana? I've got 600 of them."
