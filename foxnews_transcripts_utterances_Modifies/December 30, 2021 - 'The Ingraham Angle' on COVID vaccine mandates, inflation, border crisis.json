Then, there is this school shutdowns. THE INGRAHAM ANGLE spoke with one New Jersey mother who said her seven- year-old broke down in tears when she told him that he couldn't go back to school next week. Virtual learning is not helping her children and it is heartbreaking what we're forcing them to go through. But, it's not just our young kids. We're robbing older ones too.  Take a look at Princeton University. They require vaccines, boosters, even a negative test, just to return to campus. And now, we're learning that they're restricting students travel and forcing them to stay in the immediate area. They can't even leave the county that the school is in. People want to get on with their lives and they don't want the political bunk from the so called experts to dictate it. Enough is enough. These same experts are now letting it slip that some of the rules weren't totally based on the science. You don't say.

I'm sure that's just an oversight, but we know they're happening. Let's take a look at Massachusetts whose population is just slightly smaller than New York City. In the last week alone, 44 percent of all total cases were from people who have already been vaccinated.  Joining me now is Dr. Harvey Risch, Yale School of Medicine professor and Epidemiologist, and Dr. Marty Makary, professor at the John Hopkins School of Medicine and the author of \"The Price We Pay\". Dr. Risch, we see Eric Adams is now saying he is going to keep this vaccine mandate in the city. But, New York is getting crushed. We saw 74,000 cases today alone. New York City saw the biggest day of cases than any major city in the entire world. Yet, we have a state that has mask mandates. We have a city of New York that has a vaccine passport. You got to be vaccinated just to go to a restaurant or to basically live amongst society. At this point, why would any city, why would any business, why would any university be forcing a vaccine that doesn't stop the spread of COVID?",

And, we know from influenza, when viruses do that, they're much less pathogenic and much more infectious. So, the good news with Omicron is very low disease, highly infectious. It looks an awful lot to experienced vaccinologists, like a live attenuated virus vaccine that you might design for purpose. It's going to elicit a strong mucosal immune response.

But looking back, we're almost at year two of COVID here. I don't know if I'd ever seen the government use something, use this fear, to really reshape our society.

You have to be insane to think that you can ask for million federal workers or soldiers, many of them who have had COVID and have natural immunity, that they have to be vaccinated or they're going to be fired, while at the same time you're letting in 2 million foreign nationals without vaccinations and without tests in a time of pandemic, and they're coming in illegally. Or you have to be insane to think that you can print $2 trillion in back- to-back deficits when you are almost $30 trillion in debt and you are running a seven percent at least an annual inflation and you have limited supply and enormous demand, and you're still doing it. And they know it's going to blow up, but it's kind of like musical chairs.

If you don't prosecute crimes, or you defund the police or you prohibit bail, you know that the crime is coming up, but what do you do if they are an ideologue? Do you say I renounce all my former positions? And then when you see your neighbor broken in or your son assaulted or your car hijacked, do you just keep quiet and take one for the team? So they've created these paradoxes where the policies don't work, and yet they are going to continue them because they don't want to correct because they feel it would be contrary to their base or their visions of a socialist utopian. And it's going to be -- and what are they going to say, Lisa? They're going to say just what Hillary Clinton said, that democracy is threatened by free and fair election, or democracy, the generals wrote and said we might have a coup by Donald Trump, or the Senate is unfair.

But, we're still instituting these ridiculous restrictions like requiring a vaccine just to go to work or eat in a restaurant. And, we're forcing young kids to mask up and get vaccinated. Then, there is this school shutdowns. THE INGRAHAM ANGLE spoke with one New Jersey mother who said her seven- year-old broke down in tears when she told him that he couldn't go back to school next week. Virtual learning is not helping her children and it is heartbreaking what we're forcing them to go through. But, it's not just our young kids. We're robbing older ones too. Take a look at Princeton University. They require vaccines, boosters, even a negative test, just to return to campus. And now, we're learning that they're restricting students travel and forcing them to stay in the immediate area. They can't even leave the county that the school is in. People want to get on with their lives and they don't want the political bunk from the so called experts to dictate it. Enough is enough. These same experts are now letting it slip that some of the rules weren't totally based on the science. You don't say.

It sounds like we don't have Andy Biggs right now. Congressman? No. All right, we are moving on. Hopefully we get the Congressman back in just a moment. So, after a lot of speculation, New York City's incoming Mayor Eric Adams announced that he is keeping de Blasio's private sector vaccine mandate which means that basically anyone working in New York City needs to be vaccinated. And, that's not all. His team brought us this New Year's Eve message."

      "speaker": "BOOTHE",
      "utterance": "So, team Adams must have not gotten the message that you can still get COVID even if you're vaccinated. New York City doesn't report numbers on breakthrough cases. I'm sure that's just an oversight, but we know they're happening. Let's take a look at Massachusetts whose population is just slightly smaller than New York City. In the last week alone, 44 percent of all total cases were from people who have already been vaccinated. Joining me now is Dr. Harvey Risch, Yale School of Medicine professor and Epidemiologist, and Dr. Marty Makary, professor at the John Hopkins School of Medicine and the author of \"The Price We Pay\". Dr. Risch, we see Eric Adams is now saying he is going to keep this vaccine mandate in the city. But, New York is getting crushed. We saw 74,000 cases today alone. New York City saw the biggest day of cases than any major city in the entire world. Yet, we have a state that has mask mandates. We have a city of New York that has a vaccine passport. You got to be vaccinated just to go to a restaurant or to basically live amongst society. At this point, why would any city, why would any business, why would any university be forcing a vaccine that doesn't stop the spread of COVID?"

This is where it's going. This is not frightening. This is good news because it's generating a lot of population immunity. We should not be looking at the cases. And unfortunately, the Health Commissioner in New York City is still mired in the past looking at case numbers. He should be looking at hospitalizations and mortality from Omicron. That's what tells you on what to do about policy moving forward and he is not doing it."

    {
      "speaker": "MAKARY",
      "utterance": "There is 141 studies. At this point, any more research is not going to convince them. They clearly have an entrenched political interest and to them it threatens to vaccinate everybody message and that's the bottom line. And, I think that's eventually where there is going to be so much pushback. They're going to have to at some point just recognize that people are not going to tolerate dishonesty in science."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOOTHE",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "RISCH",
      "utterance": "Well, at some point, we thought that it might but that is long in the past already. There is so much evidence around the world that it doesn't and our own evidence that it doesn't that we have to reevaluate, but we have entrenched interests. The whole - this whole pandemic was sold to us as wait for the vaccines, the vaccines will cure it. And so, there has been a push from --economic push to sell vaccines to every arm in the planet, if not in the country. And, that's what we're facing. We are facing a push from above the government to do this and not from the science."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOOTHE",
      "utterance": "And, Dr. Makary, it goes even beyond that now with these boosters. I mean, we're seeing some universities push boosters for students. It looks like the FDA might approve the Pfizer booster for 12 to 15 year olds. What science is there behind that for booster for young and healthy people?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MAKARY",
      "utterance": "Well, the science on boosters for young and healthy people points to the recommendation that young and healthy people should not get a booster. That's where the data lives right now and that's why the FDA's experts, they sit on an Advisory Committee called VRBPAC and it's routinely convened with any authorization decision the FDA does. That's why the advisors voted against boosters for young people and then the FDA made a second internal push and simply circumvented those experts. They decided not to convene the meeting. And, the rumor is now, the New York Times is reporting it as well, that they're about to authorize boosters for 12 through 15 year olds, again, without convening their experts. That's unconscionable. And, if we have any journalism left in the United States, they should ask why - how are they getting away with this?"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOOTH",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "MAKARY",
      "utterance": "Yes. There is a whole bunch of them and immediately when Omicron emerged, our public health officials immediately started talking about additional vaccine boosters. We're now learning 10 weeks after your booster that immunity goes down to 35 percent. The efficacy goes down to 35 and 45 percent, depending on the vaccine you've got. There is fluvoxamine out there. It reduced mortality by 91 percent. It has been FDA approved. There is solid randomized controlled trial data supporting it. No data against it. I've never once heard Dr. Fauci or Dr. Walensky say the word fluvoxamine. Many universities, including my own, included on its recommended therapeutics list on their COVID websites. And, there is of course the Merck and Pfizer pills which we hear a little about but they're ready to go and they're at pharmacies now."
    },

      "utterance": "Well, really looks like our government is failing us miserably. Dr. Makary and Dr. Risch, thank you so much for joining me tonight. Appreciate it. So, we're going to try again with Arizona Congressman Andy Biggs. Congressman, you just heard what Dr. Makary said about why we're not pushing these treatments. It's this vaccine or else policy. What do you think is behind that, Congressman?"

    {
      "speaker": "REP. ANDY BIGGS (R-AZ)",
      "utterance": "Well, thanks, Lisa. Good to be with you. I think he is right in two reasons. Number one, when he talks about big pharma having other economic interests, they got on a path and they want to keep this path there. And, these other therapeutics aren't really going to make them a lot of money. So, you got to look at the money angle for sure. But then, you also have to look at the efficacy of big government married to big pharma here and what you see is kind of this power, this control, this move for that. That's also what's going on, in my opinion,"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOOTHE",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BIGGS",
      "utterance": "Well, Lisa, if you'd look at the federal elections commission reports, you're going to see that farmers contribute to a lot of members of Congress and they contribute a lot of money. They may be the biggest lobbyist organization there. And so, they do have a lot of SWAC. And, some of it is necessary, of course, because we need that information in Congress. But, other parts of it make you wonder and this epidemic of COVID has really called a lot of those relationships into question and I think they need to be explored a whole lot more."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOOTHE",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BIGGS",
      "utterance": "Yes. That's exactly what it is. I mean, just think about it. So, Donald Trump poisoned the well by simply saying he thought hydroxychloroquine might work. Well, OK. So, nobody is going to go there and farmers are not going to go there because it costs five cents a pill. Then, you get ivermectin, oh, no, that - there may be a Nobel Prize that came with that one. But, you know what, that's horse-based (ph). All of that stuff indicates to me that there was a focus on new product, new sources of revenue. And then, you marry that up with government and then you get folks like Fauci, I mean, who is all over the ballpark. Let's not kid ourselves. Dr. Fauci has been all over the place, everything from you should never wear a mask to double mask, maybe five masks, whatever it was. You marry those together and you're going to get the kind of confused messaging that we've seen out there over COVID."

    {
      "speaker": "FAUCI",
      "utterance": "Treating people who are vaccinated but not boosted has the same risk of those who are not vaccinated at all.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOOTHE",
      "utterance": "Congressman, yet, we're seeing boosted people still get COVID. Are they ever going to relinquish control? Isn't that what this is all about, just control?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BIGGS",
      "utterance": "Well, it seems like it's all about control. I mean, I don't know that they're ever going to give it up. I just saw today that, for instance, the Netherlands is talking about having a total of one underlying shot and then five boosters in about an 18-month period. And, you begin to wonder what is that all about? And, you see what's going down with the move to lockdowns or shut down schools in some states again over Omicron and you just - and I say to myself this, we're reliving this. We didn't learn anything. Then you have President Biden's thing. Well, the Feds really can't solve this problem. Well, that's what he beat up President Trump for because he felt like he could come in as the federal government and mandate and lockdown and turns out the states are the best way to control this and bring it into harmony with our lives and our freedoms. And, I love what Greg Abbott, Governor of Texas, said. He said we're going to do the Texas way, no mandates and we're going to let people take personal responsibility and that's really what this administration and Dr. Fauci is against."

So, Dr. Robert Malone, who was involved in the creation of the mRNA vaccine platform, was permanently suspended from Twitter yesterday over what they say is repeated violations of their COVID misinformation policy. Twitter wouldn't provide THE INGRAHAM ANGLE with which specific tweet violated this policy and Dr. Malone tells us that he doesn't even know.

Omicron apparently, according to recent data from Hong Kong University, has shifted the targeting of where it infects the Delta and the prior variants were infecting your deep lung, which we know from influenza is a great way to cause severe disease in humans, and it shifted to the upper airway to the bronchus. And, we know from influenza, when viruses do that, they're much less pathogenic and much more infectious. So, the good news with Omicron is very low disease, highly infectious. It looks an awful lot to experienced vaccinologists, like a live attenuated virus vaccine that you might design for purpose. It's going to elicit a strong mucosal immune response.

MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIR, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION & FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes. I actually - believe it or not, I actually think she is nosing herself back into this race as Joe Biden clearly doesn't have the mental and the physical ability to run again. It certainly seems likely he won't run again. And then, Kamala Harris, who is like so unpopular, she is more unpopular than a disease. They don't even put her out at all. You just don't see her. And so, I think what's interesting is Hillary Clinton is saying that it will be the end of our democracy if in a free and open election the American people vote for Donald Trump again. I mean, it's just insane. This is the same woman that concocted the lie in her team, the lie that Trump only got elected the first time with Russian collusion. She has never really accepted her loss.

She sounds so angry, whenever she brings this stuff up, especially when she starts talking about Donald Trump and his supporters, talking about his ilk, it's kind of like a sort of, like, that's the - the shorthand for the basket of deplorables. But, what I think - if you play on that clip, what she goes on to say is that she doesn't want her party to take a deep left turn and go left wing crazy. Well, what's kind of interesting about that? She is basically talking about is exactly what Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have done. And so, I think that in that sort of remarkable sit down right there, not only - I don't think she is just nosing her nose back out onto the campaign field, I think she is sliming the sitting Democratic president and trying to soften him up in order to make way for herself yet again."

We are literally kicking brave marines out of the Marines, and Joe Biden gets on a phone call with Vladimir Putin and says we are ready to take you on? It's a joke. And if they want to keep Americans safe, why don't you start projecting strength?

It is a political purge, right? CHARLES HURT, OPINION EDITOR, \"THE WASHINGTON TIMES\": Without a doubt, and I think it's devastating. And I think, of course the worst part of all of it is you go back even further than just the COVID -- the pandemic, but this whole notion that we are going to turn our military into the world's policeman and we are going to go around and fight these -- to protect people's borders all over the world while we don't even protect our own borders, and that kind of fuzzy mission that politicians, and quite frankly, we've seen it from both parties, but nobody has been a bigger war hawk than Hillary Clinton herself, and of course, Joe Biden, who is the grandest expert on the political -- on the world stage going back for 50 years he's been in Washington, and nobody has been more wrong about everything that he gets into. And so what I worry about -- and I think Matt is exactly right, at the very least, please, start projecting an America first policy, look at the world in terms of what benefits us and regular Americans before you make the decisions, and don't go starting fights in order to protect other people's borders when you don't even protect our borders."

And so I hope that the media takes a long, hard look at how they have distorted guidance, they have condemned people who have now come forward with information that has now turned out to be true, and they have actually even turned on the CDC at times.

Joining me now is Victor Davis Hanson, Hoover Institution senior fellow and author of \"Dying Citizen.\" Victor, if this is what Democrats consider a successful year, we are in for a wild ride in 2022. But looking back, we're almost at year two of COVID here. I don't know if I'd ever seen the government use something, use this fear, to really reshape our society. You look at the role that government has played, shutting down businesses, denying the ability to go to church. We've seen societal division as well, the blaming of the unvaccinated.

And they would rather see their agendas enacted and fail than they would the correctives or the opposites or the antithesis be enacted and succeed. So they are going to go full speed ahead. You have to be insane to think that you can ask for million federal workers or soldiers, many of them who have had COVID and have natural immunity, that they have to be vaccinated or they're going to be fired, while at the same time you're letting in 2 million foreign nationals without vaccinations and without tests in a time of pandemic, and they're coming in illegally. Or you have to be insane to think that you can print $2 trillion in back- to-back deficits when you are almost $30 trillion in debt and you are running a seven percent at least an annual inflation and you have limited supply and enormous demand, and you're still doing it. And they know it's going to blow up, but it's kind of like musical chairs. They feel that maybe they'll be out, they'll find a chair when the blow up comes and somebody else will take the blame, maybe Joe Biden will. I don't know. Same thing with crime. If you don't prosecute crimes, or you defund the police or you prohibit bail, you know that the crime is coming up, but what do you do if they are an ideologue? Do you say I renounce all my former positions? And then when you see your neighbor broken in or your son assaulted or your car hijacked, do you just keep quiet and take one for the team? So they've created these paradoxes where the policies don't work, and yet they are going to continue them because they don't want to correct because they feel it would be contrary to their base or their visions of a socialist utopian. And it's going to be -- and what are they going to say, Lisa? They're going to say just what Hillary Clinton said, that democracy is threatened by free and fair election, or democracy, the generals wrote and said we might have a coup by Donald Trump, or the Senate is unfair.

      "utterance": "They are the greatest revolutionaries we've seen in a generation, whether it's packing the court or ending the filibuster or bringing in two more states or ending the Electoral College or the national voting law, or Hillary Clinton's collusion, hiring a foreign national to get dirt on the presidential opponent, candidate opponent, or what we saw with the FISA abuses. So they are revolutionaries, and they are projecting their own pathologies onto other people because they have no alternate agenda. They'll never say to themselves, here's a contract for America that's going to work. And anybody in the Democratic Party who thinks that is not going to last very long or they are going to retire. And so this is a revolutionary Jacobin movement, and I think everybody saw that in 2021, and I think they fear rightly that it's going to continue in 2022, even if it explodes and takes us with it. But they're not going to change on their own."

Thank you for joining me and happy New Year. So up next, it's time for me to finally admit this. A man is the reason I left New York City for Florida. I reveal who it is next."

I'm Lisa Boothe in for Laura Ingraham. Check out my podcast \"The Truth with Lisa Boothe,\" and tomorrow night at 10:00 p.m. eastern, watch FOX's All-American New Year featuring Will Cain, Pete Hegseth, Rachel Campos-Duffy.
