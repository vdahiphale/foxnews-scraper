That was President Donald Trump Thursday announcing that the United States would withdraw from the Paris climate accord, making good on a central promise of his 2016 campaign. The long-awaited decision, seen as a major blow to President Obama's legacy, but is it the blow to the environment that critics claim?  Let's ask Wall Street Journal columnist and Deputy editor Dan Henninger, Washington columnist Kim Strassel and columnist Mary Anastasia O'Grady. So, Mary, we'll get to the politics, which are considerable here, but first just as a decision, was it the right one?",

But the pay-off was a very small in its projection and not enough really to make the cost worthwhile.

The harm is that it was going to enable them to then force those policies into place via the courts, in other words via a system that they couldn't do politically.  If the Paris agreement were that important, they would've had real policies in there with real enforcement mechanisms, but that was politically impossible.

Talk of a West Wing shakeup continue, with communications director Mike Dubke resigning and more departures rumored to come. So, how can the president keep his agenda on track amid the turmoil. Let's ask \"Wall Street Journal\" columnist and Fox News contributor Karl Rove. He served as a senior advisor to President George W. Bush.   So, Karl, I want to ask you first about this decision to leave Paris because you experienced something similar to this in the Bush administration when the president decided not to embrace the Kyoto protocol. And there was a huge uproar then internationally. What advice do you have for the Trump administration on how to cope with something similar now?",

And one of my White House colleagues at the time who now teaches out at Stanford blogged last night that this is another example of what he calls QTIPS - quantitative total impact insignificant, total political impact significant.  So, this is - you're right. This is the right decision to make. The question is, is the president going to spend the next six or seven or eight or nine or ten days, he and his administration, explaining this to the American people in detail and giving an optimistic vision of what American leadership in this issue can mean?  Or are they going to move on to the next thing. And I think it's really vital that they win this issue. What we had to do was explain why we had something that was better than Kyoto, that we would focus on energy efficiency, and that by doing so we would reduce the absolute level of carbon emissions, but without beggaring our economy. Because at the heart of the sort of the Paris agreement, the Paris Accord, is that the nations that commit to it are committing to make energy more expensive. It's going to be more expensive to drive your car, to cool or warm your home, to power the plant at which you work, right. And as a result, that's going to reduce economic growth and the prosperity of virtually every American and every American family.  So, they've got to make the argument.

But the pay-off was a very small in its projection and not enough really to make the cost worthwhile.

In other words, just as Pruitt said, once it was in place because this is simply an agreement, a voluntary agreement, people go, what's the harm? The harm is that it was going to enable them to then force those policies into place via the courts, in other words via a system that they couldn't do politically. If the Paris agreement were that important, they would've had real policies in there with real enforcement mechanisms, but that was politically impossible.

There was going to be blowback whether or not we pulled out of this agreement or whether we didn't actually live up to our commitments, which, by the way, under President Trump's agenda was never going to be possible. This is certainly a cleaner way to do it and I think the Trump administration's way-forward is to say that they're going to continue to lead in other areas where there are, in fact, great agreement between us and our allies."

So, we're not - we're going to avoid Congress. If he had submitted it to the senate as a treaty, then he might have some Democrats who voted against it and it would look, I think, politically weaker.

Barack Obama constantly and Hillary Clinton in her campaign would talk about all the good jobs that are going to be created by people making solar panels.

Let's ask \"Wall Street Journal\" columnist and Fox News contributor Karl Rove. He served as a senior advisor to President George W. Bush. So, Karl, I want to ask you first about this decision to leave Paris because you experienced something similar to this in the Bush administration when the president decided not to embrace the Kyoto protocol. And there was a huge uproar then internationally. What advice do you have for the Trump administration on how to cope with something similar now?"

And one of my White House colleagues at the time who now teaches out at Stanford blogged last night that this is another example of what he calls QTIPS - quantitative total impact insignificant, total political impact significant. So, this is - you're right. This is the right decision to make. The question is, is the president going to spend the next six or seven or eight or nine or ten days, he and his administration, explaining this to the American people in detail and giving an optimistic vision of what American leadership in this issue can mean? Or are they going to move on to the next thing. And I think it's really vital that they win this issue. What we had to do was explain why we had something that was better than Kyoto, that we would focus on energy efficiency, and that by doing so we would reduce the absolute level of carbon emissions, but without beggaring our economy. Because at the heart of the sort of the Paris agreement, the Paris Accord, is that the nations that commit to it are committing to make energy more expensive. It's going to be more expensive to drive your car, to cool or warm your home, to power the plant at which you work, right. And as a result, that's going to reduce economic growth and the prosperity of virtually every American and every American family. So, they've got to make the argument.

And it's not just the tweets on Russia. A lot of these other tweets are unconstructive to the fulfillment of his agenda or the explanation of it to the American people. Kim Strassel, whom you had on earlier, wrote a wonderful piece on Friday about how all these great things are happening and nobody knows about them. This week, as she pointed out, the Keystone - the Dakota Access Pipeline began moving energy and that's directly because of the administration. Why didn't we have a White House ceremony where the president symbolically pushed a button to begin the pipeline and instead it got obscured by tweets. Angela Merkel trolled him for God's sake. She's on a campaign trail out of Germany, makes a comment that antagonizes him and he goes after her. What the heck was that about?"

But let's talk about the staffing issue because one of the problems with this White House is a lot of the factions - factionalism inside it. Does he need whatever - I know you respect Reince Priebus - I do - the current chief of staff. But I don't think Donald Trump has ever given him the clear authority to lead that White House, a disciplined White House. Does he need a new one, a new chief of staff?"

      "speaker": "ROVE",
      "utterance": "No, he needs to change his behavior because if he doesn't change his behavior, the same problems that are occurring today will occur under a new chief of staff. He needs to give Reince the ability - Reince Priebus, the chief of staff, the ability to find some low-level leaker and fire him as a message to the rest of the team. He needs to give Reince the ability to discipline somebody who's backstabbing one of his or her colleagues in the West Wing and send a message that that's not tolerated. This has to start at the top. Trump has to be committed. The president has to be committed to saying to people, when you leak against one of your colleagues, you're hurting me and hurting our agenda. And when you are failing to - when you're engaging in warfare, you're engaging warfare with me."

They're an expression of whether or not you have a disciplined plan of what you want your message to be and the message has to be connected intimately with what it is that you want your policy to be. So, results matter. So, at the end of the day, this is not just about picking what's the nice message for today, it's about picking what is it there we're going to focus our attention on and how do we then explain that to the American people."

We're back with Dan Henninger, Kim Strassel and Wall Street Journal editorial board member Joe Rago. So, Kim, let's start with these three subpoenas about unmasking. How significant is this?"

If you look at the entire Russia question, the only crimes that we actually know have been committed have been the leaking of classified information to do with Mr. Flynn and others.

Then you've had subsequent reporting in which people close to Mr. Kushner said that this is nonsense that he set up one meeting, one discussion and that there was never any suggestion from him to use Russian facilities, so we just don't know and we're going to have to wait until we get to the end of some of these investigations to get some facts."

I think if we know that the threat is coming, it's the responsibility of the leaders in our country to say, we're going to be ready for it and be able to have a much higher success rate than you just mentioned than 50 percent of shooting down a rogue missile from North Korea or Iran."

It would also accelerate the development of what they call multiple kill vehicles. So, this allows missiles when they're shot up, it's just not a bullet hitting a bullet, but several kill vehicles off one missile that up the chance of hitting the missile. And finally -"

But what we don't have, and all the experts think we need it, is a system of sensors that can be deployed in space that integrate the different systems - THAAD, Aegis, the ground-based system back home - and make sure we have what the military calls an unblinking eye to make sure that everything in our different regional and homeland systems are integrated from a sensor perspective.

It was bankrupt. It was on the verge of insolvency. Its data was mediocre to poor. I never said I was a perfect candidate. And I certainly have never said I ran perfect campaigns, but don't know who is or did. And at some point, it sort of bleeds over into misogyny."

      "utterance": "That was 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton at a conference in California on Wednesday, ticking off just a few of the many reasons she says she lost the election. The former secretary of state joining another Obama administration alum this week and making a return to the public stage with former vice president Joe Biden officially launching his own political action committee, an indication, some say, that he may be considering a run in 2020. We're back with Dan Henninger, Kim Strassel, and Mary O'Grady. So, Dan, I think it's fair to say the former secretary of state isn't moving on from her defeat. What do you think of her explanation?"

    {
      "speaker": "HENNINGER",
      "utterance": "What I think of her explanation is, Paul, we know that about one-third of the people who voted for Trump actually voted against Hillary Clinton. And we just got a pretty good example of why they did that. That could have been the president of the United States, whining about what happened to her email server and it being a big nothing-burger. Hillary Clinton has been in public life her entire professional career. And her legacy right now is that she lost the Democratic presidency to Donald J. Trump."

      "utterance": "Not as well as it is hard to take, she's getting hammered from within her own party. And Hillary, in her way, is now trying to give a rationalization for why she lost. She's now got this elaborate conspiracy about how the Russians linked up with somebody in the Trump campaign because no matter what they were doing, it wouldn't have worked unless they had a contact in the Trump campaign. She has reached the point of desperation."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "Do any of these explanations she offered, Mary, do they wash with you? Anything? The one thing that she might have a point about, in my view, is Jim Comey's intervention late in the campaign. You did see voters - late voters turn towards Trump. I don't know if it was Comey, if it was just that that's what they wanted to change. But anything else seem fair?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "O'GRADY",
      "utterance": "Well, the problem with the Comey argument is that she allowed the rest of the race to get so close that, yes, some little things could push people over the edge. But I was really astounded that she tried the voter suppression line in Wisconsin. I mean, she never went to Wisconsin. And in the primary, you had the greatest turn out since 1972 in the primary, and that required voter ID. So, to then say that in the general, because there was voter ID requirement, that was voter suppression is a ridiculous claim, and it makes her look foolish."

      "speaker": "GIGOT",
      "utterance": "Kim, what about the argument that this - it came down to misogyny. Basically, she's saying that the fact that she was a woman was a disadvantage. Does that make any sense to you?"

    {
      "speaker": "STRASSEL",
      "utterance": "It doesn't make any sense at all. All along, throughout this entire campaign, we talked about the power of women voters, how they come out, they're such an important swing group. And in the end, she didn't get enough of them to come out because she did not enthuse them or they deliberately voted against her in some very key groups. So, she underperformed. So, there can be no argument here. Look, this is a woman who has held some of the highest offices in the land. She has run for the presidency twice. There were no barriers. She was anointed by her party for that position."

Under those circumstances, someone like Joe Biden goes, I've got an opening if the Trump presidency starts to decline."
