Would you come with us? We would love to be -- they don't want that. I think they want this fight with Nancy Pelosi. And I think that they're isolating themselves away from the Democratic caucus forgetting about President Trump. Here's the other thing I would say. Everybody has the opportunity right now to convene a meeting. That's one of the things that you have as a congress person or a senator or speaker or a president. If they wanted to get past this, they could all get together in a room, getting to know each other better, that always helps with things, but no one is suggesting that.

Democrats are going to find out a whole lot more about who they are if they know who they are now because they're going to primary them. As we just saw Democrats are accusing them of being socialist who are trying to rip down and tear down the party. This is beneficial to President Trump in this way. This will pass. The story will go away. The outrage over another offensive thing that President Trump said will go away.

Like, if you're going to actually run for Congress is because you think that you want to do something. The problem with these guys is that they don't have the votes and they're totally un-persuading. They do not persuade anybody except, possibly, within their blue districts. But that's not how you grow a coalition. It's not how you say -- look, we can give a little here -- you're not going to have a green new deal revolution. The revolution is not happening in 2020.

Like, she's working her way through the system to try to keep that majority so that they could see if they can try to win back the White House and the Senate. Right now it looks like that -- absolutely isn't going to happen. What was Tom Freidman's headline today in his column in the New York Times?

They only see what America harms. That is the underlying engine for those tweets which you talked about on Monday. Trump reacts in the perception of disloyalty. Now, you can disagree with that and find it simplistic and shallow and incorrected, but it ain't racist. It's based on a unifying concept of loyalty to your country. By the way, if you were born after 2000, you might find that whole idea so stupid and old fashioned like ribbon candy, you know, and bicycles with giant tires. Oh, what is patriotism?

He has bigger crowds than any other Democrat, and he matches up very favorably head-to-head with Donald Trump.

And he's fading, that's the big problem. Now his people say that's because the pollsters don't capture young voters, you're all on cell phones and all the like, and they can't capture the energy of those young voters, and especially small young -- you know, small donors who are young voters who have given him a lot of money. Pete Buttigieg, actually, is the biggest surprise among donors on the Democratic side. But I would say my problem with Bernie is it feels to me like I've seen this movie before. It feels like a rerun. It's a little-bit like Trump and his Florida relaunch. Hmm, I think the reporters who covered him in 2016 could give the same speech because they've all heard it before.

But these are my patients on the street. I know who they are. I've treated this population for years and it is ridiculous that they're calling it a home - a housing problem. It is ridiculous. The rat thing, I saw that coming 18 months ago. I predicted the typhus epidemic. It hit and is amongst us now. The problem is there are things that follow typhus. Given that they've done nothing for this rat population, there are other illnesses that will follow. We have tuberculosis exploding. We will see Yersinia, which you may know as plague. We have potential measles. We have people - their excrement and their bleeding and they're urinating in the street every day. That is getting washed directly with LA River. 60,000 people's excrement is getting into the river, into the ocean every day. If I had a city of 60,000 people that was disconnected from the sewage treatment plant, my god, the environmentalists would have - would freak out. Where are they? Then we have mammalian die-off off our coast now. Mammalian sea life - dolphins, sea lions dying because of all this garbage, untreated, going directly to the ocean, where's the help?"

None of them are on the street. 800,000 people without a penny, without a family, without a country, found a place to live.
