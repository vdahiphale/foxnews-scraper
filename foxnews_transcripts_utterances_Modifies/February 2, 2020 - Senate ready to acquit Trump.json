But as the host, Don Lemon should have challenged his guests on why they thought it was fine and dandy to mock and denigrate so many Americans. And that's where he fell short. President Trump attacked Fox News again this week, tweeting that it's really pathetic that the network is trying to be politically correct by loading the airwaves with Democrats like Chris Van Hollen. After swiping at some host, Trump said watch. This will be the beginning of the end for Fox just like the other two which are dying in the ratings. I'll just make two points. Interviewing Democrats during the impeachment trial or any other time isn't being PC. It's fair journalism. As for the future, Fox just finished the 18th straight year as the top-rated cable news network by far. So odds are we will be around for a while. Now, an update on the bitter feud between Mike Pompeo and NPR.  The Secretary of State berated All Things Considered co-host, Mary Louise Kelly, after she asked him about Ukraine and said she lied in setting up the interview. But new emails show Kelly didn't violate any ground rules when Pompeo's press aid wrote we would like to stick to Iran as the topic, as opposed to jumping around. Kelly responded I am indeed just back from Tehran and planned to start there. Also, Ukraine, and who knows what the news gods will serve up overnight. I never agreed to take anything off the table. So Kelly who disputes that there's a subsequent argument was off the record as Pompeo claimed was right about the interview. Still, Pompeo got a pat on his back from his boss.",

But it does give you a playing field where you kind of get to see all of these players really go all in. And I think the rest of the country gets to witness that as well. I was at Andrew Yang event last night and talked to people who voted for Trump last time around, talked to people who are undecided between Joe Biden and Andrew Yang. I mean, these folks are paying very close attention. And they love the part that they place in this process. So I think it makes it really interesting to watch where they go here tomorrow night.",

And things are, you know, hearings are in the basement of the House, and there's no transparency. Now that the shoe is on the other foot, the impeachment process has been in the GOP-controlled Senate. And now you're seeing left-leaning media saying the same kind of thing. It's a partisan sham.

I never instructed John Bolton to set up a meeting with Rudy Giuliani. That meeting never happened. Now, Bolton says that White House officials, Mick Mulvaney and Pat Cipollone, who is of course, his lead impeachment lawyer in the Senate, were also there. It seems a little strange that we're all relying on leaked account of a manuscript without any of the exact quotes."

It's an interpretation. News room stories aren't often an interpretation by a reporter, by an editor. And in this case, it can be particularly dangerous. Because we don't even know what the manuscript says.

I should note that the White House which has a copy of the book is reviewing it -- about classified information and has not put out any statements that's not what the book says. How is it that many conservative commentators -- now, we saw this at the top, are denouncing John Bolton as a snake and a turncoat, when he has been such an icon on the right. And, you know, going back to his days as acting U.N. ambassador and his years as a Fox News contributor. How is it that that flipped -- that turn has been so dramatic?"

I think with the release of this book, Bolton is following the Comey precedent or the precedent set by Richard Clarke, the former Bush counterterrorism advisor who released his tell all in the middle of a presidential election, rather than a precedent of Bob Gates who waited two years after Obama's re-election to come out with a blistering indictment of Obama's presidency. So it's a feeling of betrayal among a lot of conservatives. You would note, as you showed, Tucker Carlson hasn't been consistent. He did not like Bolton before. He doesn't like him now."

We would be in World War Six by now and goes out and immediately writes a nasty and untrue book.

I mean, the fact that Alan Dershowitz has gone to all these media outlets saying that his words have been wilfully distorted has been covered in publications like the Hill. You know that very well may be the case. However, I think the one problem with that is that many Republican senators are actually referencing Alan Dershowitz's argument as a reason for the stance that they're taking. So obviously, it was clear enough for members of the United States Senate, they're taking it a certain way, and, you know, and now obviously Dershowitz is trying to clarify that."

And you can hear how he could pick out little pieces of that. And I immediately saw on Twitter the headlines in the major newspapers saying Dershowitz is now arguing that the president using his own re-election for -- to motivate himself with Ukraine is in the national under national interest. Because his election is in the national interest that is a real oversimplification of what Dershowitz was saying. But it goes to the fact that it's very hard to present these nuanced arguments. And what they were trying to do in the Senate trial is very carefully tell the senators that you can't say he -- there is a smidgen of personal interest here that would be impeachable. Because then you have to go back and impeach all presidents, including President Obama, who decided not to bomb Syria maybe because of his own political interest."

We're going to be talking about Iowa in a few moments, saying that no one's very excited about the Democratic primaries. You write that for four and a half years the main event in politics has been Donald Trump, not policy. He is the issue. And you relate that to a lack of interest or excitement in the Democrats."

There are a few things I find more offensive, and liberal pundits who ridicule not the president, who is always fair game, but those who support him as dumb, moronic, bigoted, racist yahoos. By the way, 45 percent now support Trump in recent polls. Are they all idiots? True, Lemon didn't say those things. And he later tried to walk it back by saying he never belittles people for their beliefs. He was laughing at a joke he found funny. But as the host, Don Lemon should have challenged his guests on why they thought it was fine and dandy to mock and denigrate so many Americans. And that's where he fell short. President Trump attacked Fox News again this week, tweeting that it's really pathetic that the network is trying to be politically correct by loading the airwaves with Democrats like Chris Van Hollen. After swiping at some host, Trump said watch. This will be the beginning of the end for Fox just like the other two which are dying in the ratings. I'll just make two points. Interviewing Democrats during the impeachment trial or any other time isn't being PC. It's fair journalism. As for the future, Fox just finished the 18th straight year as the top-rated cable news network by far. So odds are we will be around for a while. Now, an update on the bitter feud between Mike Pompeo and NPR. The Secretary of State berated All Things Considered co-host, Mary Louise Kelly, after she asked him about Ukraine and said she lied in setting up the interview. But new emails show Kelly didn't violate any ground rules when Pompeo's press aid wrote we would like to stick to Iran as the topic, as opposed to jumping around. Kelly responded I am indeed just back from Tehran and planned to start there. Also, Ukraine, and who knows what the news gods will serve up overnight. I never agreed to take anything off the table. So Kelly who disputes that there's a subsequent argument was off the record as Pompeo claimed was right about the interview. Still, Pompeo got a pat on his back from his boss."

Because they think it's over. I mean, there is such a battle going on right now in terms of the reporting and the coverage of this in the way it should be covered. And all of these candidates are sort of putting out their spin pre-tomorrow night in order to make sure that the door stays open through the very end of this process. And I think that is fascinating. It's amazing to me how a -- how much energy there is sort of and fear you can feel on the Democratic side about what the outcome is going to be here. Four years later, the Bernie Sanders issue is front and center once again just like it was in 2016. It's going to be really fascinating to watch this tomorrow night."

He is -- he appears to have, you know, weakened over the course of that time. And even if you look into the South Carolina polls this morning, his numbers are slipping in South Carolina as well. So what is happening to Joe Biden and whether or not even that's South Carolina firewall is going to hold for him. I think, you know, we won't know until people actually cast their vote and caucus.

So it kind of fit, but the fact that he's had this staying power suggest that, you know, this thing if he wins here in Iowa.

But Martha, also we have got people to judge, and Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar who has kind of put most of her chips on Iowa. They all need a solid showing. So how -- a lot of this will depend on how the all-knowing pundits interpret the different percentages and how many delegates you win. The rules are actually a little more complicated this year."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yeah. So the new rules that govern the caucus reporting tomorrow night. There is a lot more transparency along the way. So in the first-round, we're going to some results from the first-round, than you have the realignment round where people look at, you know, if your candidate is below 15 percent. You're going to look around the room and join with another group. And then the delegate round, which is the third round. So you could end up potentially with three different people sort of claiming that they won the caucus. So the -- and all of that was part of the battle that happened after the 2016 election. And Bernie Sanders, you know, was razor thin in Iowa, between Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton. And the party doesn't want that to happen again, although now that they're confronted with the surge by Bernie Sanders that I think there are some in the Democratic Party who are thinking we need to put in some kind of bumper rails here so that he doesn't get the nominee."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "You know I just talked to Chris Stirewalt in a podcast. And he said he would like three different winners and a contested convention. So I'm not sure if he's going to get that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Right. But of course, if the Democratic Party, those who do not want Democratic socialist nominee goes to aggressively against Sanders, that could cause a backlash among his passionate supporters. But finally, you know, we do this every four years, which is the media always give a big boost to the Iowa winner. If you win by 10 or 12 votes, and that gives you a head of steam going to New Hampshire. And then the numbers may or may not start to change. But the criticism is grown a lot of this year, I think, which is why do we in this business put so much emphasis on the first caucus day in a place that is rural, largely white, and not representative of the country."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Well, there is obviously arguments both ways. The people here in Iowa would say that they really value this privilege to be able to screen these candidates, and a lot of them have had them in their living room. A lot of them have been to coffee shops where there are 10 and 12 people. They really screen these candidates along the way. So it is a lot of retail politics. And I talked to somebody who has been studying and along and still undecided between Biden and Warren and says he will make up his mind Monday night."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "I love how seriously the people of Iowa take it, Martha."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "I agree. And, you know, when you look at the outcome down the road, I don't think that Iowa ends up holding a disproportionate say in the matter. Because only Jimmy Carter and Barack Obama, the Democrat side, went on -- went to win on Iowa and then to actually win the White House as well. But it does give you a playing field where you kind of get to see all of these players really go all in. And I think the rest of the country gets to witness that as well. I was at Andrew Yang event last night and talked to people who voted for Trump last time around, talked to people who are undecided between Joe Biden and Andrew Yang. I mean, these folks are paying very close attention. And they love the part that they place in this process. So I think it makes it really interesting to watch where they go here tomorrow night."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Yeah. It does give a shot to candidates who don't have a lot of money or necessarily a lot of name recognition. But this has been fascinating. Bret Baier, Martha MacCallum, we'll look forward to your coverage from Iowa. Thanks very much."

    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "We'll see you."

    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Good to see you. After the break, what's it like covering the craziness on the Hill during a president's trial, a behind the scene look right after this."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "What's it like for reporters in the trenches on Capitol Hill trying to cover the endless hours of impeachment? We are back with Susan Ferrechio. And you have been part of that daily grind. What's life like especially you have to surrender your phone and your laptop?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SUSAN FERRECHIO, MIAMI HERALD FORMER EDUCATION REPORTER",
      "utterance": "Well, that's not new now. Those rules are not new. You could never bring your phone and laptop into the Senate gallery. In the House side, you can pray. So there's a big difference there."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "FERRECHIO",
      "utterance": "It sure does because if you want to watch this trial, it is nice to sit in there and listen. See what the senators' expressions are on their faces. Otherwise, you really don't -- you can't gauge where people are as the arguments progress, especially during the question and answer period where there was some dramatic questions and there was some moments were senators would mouth things to each other. And it was, of course, the color in the room, who was doing what, where they paying attention. Sometimes the room was a third empty. You know things like that you don't -- you miss if the cameras aren't showing it which they were not."

      "speaker": "FERRECHIO",
      "utterance": "And you can't live tweet it. So you have to -- but then again, you can just step out of the room and get your phone and tweet it. That's what a lot of people do."

      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Or get some coffee and food."
    },

      "speaker": "FERRECHIO",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "There have been a lot of complaints from journalists about the special restrictions that were set up by Mitch McConnell, sergeant at arms, just recovering the trial. How did that affect you?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FERRECHIO",
      "utterance": "First of all, as a reporter, a long time reporter there. I've been up there for several decades. It's never in the public interest, never, to restrict access. The Capital is one of the best political listening posts in America, if not the world. And only because we have pretty much unfettered access. So we push back hard against these restrictions. Having lived through it now, I can say I was limited. There were times where we did miss out on conversations."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FERRECHIO",
      "utterance": "-- rather than being to walk wherever we wanted on the second floor of the Capital, which is where the senators meet in the chamber. We were penned off behind ropes in two or three areas. And what that did is it allowed the senators to control the message. We had to be spoon-fed the information. And -- talking to particular people to find out what's going on. They sent their messengers out. And both parties did this. And we were spoon-fed what they said what they had to say at that moment."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Now on that point, Chuck Schumer it seemed was out there every few hours --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "-- a lot of it was taken live. Some of the Republican senators especially Lamar Alexander, Mitt Romney, Susan Collins, who were on the fence for all the witnesses, were they more reluctant to talk to reporters like you."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FERRECHIO",
      "utterance": "Well, we would catch them down in the basement. The strange thing about this is these restrictions were only put in place during certain hours. And the rest of the time we were still able to walk around. So we actually did end up talking to Mitt Romney a lot and Susan Collins. And we would find them at different hours. A lot of us regulars know where they are. Early in the morning and later in the day -- so we were able to catch them. But yes, it did allow them to escape a lot of the coverage and a lot of the mob coverage that normally happens during these big news events on the Hill."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Yeah. And you showed up in that video right behind Lindsey Graham sticking your tape recorder trying to get --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FERRECHIO",
      "utterance": "That's how it's done."

      "utterance": "Sure."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Still to come, forget impeachment in Iowa at least for the moment. We are counting down to the Super Bowl, a look at the media coverage next."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Let's face it. The Kansas City Chiefs appearing in today's Super Bowl for the first time in 50 years and San Francisco 49ers have not made a whole lot of news. But so what? The game will be carried on the Fox broadcast network will still draw a mammoth 100 million or so. I spoke moments ago from Miami with Jim Gray, the veteran sportscaster and Fox News contributor."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Jim Gray, welcome."

      "utterance": "That's how I feel."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Look, the Super Bowl is always huge, the commercials, the parties. But since the two week media run coincided with the impeachment trial, and there's no Tom Brady or other big celebrity star. Is there less excitement about the game itself between the 49ers and the Chiefs?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GRAY",
      "utterance": "Well, I think there has been less of a buzz and less excitement. I don't know if it's due to impeachment. That could be part of it. It's Kobe Bryant and sports fans obviously very depressed over that news and what has transpired across the country. And maybe just the whole thing that's going on across the nation of, you know, America needs right now the Super Bowl, Howie. They need to see the joy of Patrick Mahomes. They want to hug Andy Reid who has dedicated his life to football. They have got to love the approach of Jimmy Garoppolo and the young Kyle Shanahan. So I really think America can sit back. And let's have some enjoy. Let's make this a joyous occasion. Hopefully, we'll have a great game. And everybody will be smiling tomorrow because the country could really use it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "I am with you on that, a rest from all the polarizing politics. Now, I scoured the coverage for some hint of controversy. None of them -- some people being upset about the Chief fans tomahawk chop. It seems like both teams were not trying to make much news or stirring anything up in the media interviews."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GRAY",
      "utterance": "Well, sometimes those things just happen naturally and sometimes they don't. I mean, Richard Sherman is a guy who plays for the 49ers, speaks his mind. But he's relatively quiet this week. And there just really haven't been many issues. And I want to go back to Kobe Bryant. And I know you want to talk about that. But a lot of these guys, in fact, all of them look up to Kobe Bryant. He was the be-like-Mike guy for this generation. So they all wanted to be like Kobe, even it's a different sport. They saw his attitude and his approach and how he wanted to win, his motivation, and just the mamba mentality that he built, and that's what all these guys have been around for the past two decades. So, you know, that was a tremendous loss that happened Sunday night. And then that's when the teams came in, and it really never got to the fever pitch. But I suspect there will be a huge audience today. And America's going to sit back and enjoy this. And the league is going honor Kobe Bryant in the pre-game."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Yeah. Well, it's more than the league. I mean, obviously he should be honored. He will be honored. And I know he was a friend of yours, and it's so hard for all of us after that after that horrifying helicopter crash last weekend. But it seems to me that Kobe Bryant, you know, all these tributes to what a great athlete and a competitor he was, and somebody who's transcended basketball and transcended pro-sports, your thoughts?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GRAY",
      "utterance": "Well, he did. And I had the opportunity to travel with him on a few occasions overseas. And you just couldn't believe the amount of people in Hong Kong or in China who just wanted to take a picture of this guy from 200 yards away, who did anything they could, getting out of cars, jumping off bicycles to try and touch this guy. He was a worldwide superstar. And he had global appeal. And his work ethic and his dedication really is unsurpassed. I'm sure there are other guys that have equal, Floyd Mayweather, for example, Tom Brady, numerous others, Michael Phelps. But he was kind of in a category all of his own. And he helps so many and he touched so many people. And he wanted no recognition for it, Howie, because it went against the mamba mentality. But he had thousands of acts of kindness and --"
