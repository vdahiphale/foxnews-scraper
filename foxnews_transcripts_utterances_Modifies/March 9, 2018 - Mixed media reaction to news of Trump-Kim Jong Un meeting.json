I think he's getting -- I would call it a net plus in terms of coverage for him on this with a little dose of skepticism, not about the president but about Kim Jong-un, and appropriately so, because in 1996 and in 2005, they tried the same thing. Not exactly face-to-face talks, but they wanted talks in exchange for something.  And in this case, it seems that depending on what Kim Jong-un actually does, they might actually get nothing for it, right? They want the talks for what? You know, they're going -- supposedly, he said he won't do any missile tests between now and whenever this meeting takes place. And we haven't heard other things from Kim Jong-un on what he would want. Now, with that said, it is a different situation now than to 1996 or 2005 because, apparently, he does have nuclear weapons now. So he comes to the table in a much different position. But I think there's no doubt that the president's stance and his willingness to be really tough -- plus, if you look at there's always this thing that Kim Jong-un was worried that he would become Saddam Hussein. And there's a reason that Kaddafi turned over his nuclear weapons because they realize that America, like, was not going to put up with it anymore.  So, back to your question, is President Trump getting enough credit? I think so. And I think -- I think that also he can't worry about it too much because leadership is doing things that might not necessarily be popular at the time, but looking back could be very popular. For example, when he said fire and fury back in -- I don't know, was it last spring, and he was at Bedminster, and there was a huge fire fight about that in the media, like, oh, my gosh, it's so bellicose and he's going to lead us to nuclear war.   Well, actually, looking back, and even in Vanity Fair, and the New York Times, and several of those people there, Podesta -- I'm sorry, Panetta and Brennan are all looking back saying, it actually worked in getting to this point. So I think on balance he's getting enough credit --",

But I want to hit the point about the optics, they say by elevating Kim, the optics -- he's getting something for nothing. It may actually help rocket man, but that's -- why wouldn't he do it? The point is that's going to be part of the deal. He's going to be in a deal that it's going to probably help him survive. But in order for this to succeed, we have to be super skeptical and we also have to have -- make sure that there is restitution for Otto Warmbier, right? He has to be part of this equation. And President Trump has spent a lot of time with Otto's dad, so I'm pretty sure that there's going to be-- that's going to be part of the deal. They should find out what happened to Otto? They should find the people who were responsible for that horrible, horrible treatment and they should punish them. I think that's his -- that's his big, to me, personally. I know it may seem irrational. As making sure that there're inspectors there to look at their nukes. But I think it should be part of because you can't let him get away with that.  But, obviously, the sanctions worked. And the sanctions worked because they're like -- it's like -- I would call the sanctions the Trump handshake, right? It's the handshake that doesn't let go and just gets tighter and tighter and tighter. That should be -- I'm going to coin that the Trump handshake because it can go -- it can go on forever. There's no end to these sanctions. It's going to always makes them worse.  And I think they're realizing that this isn't going the way they want to go. Also, he targeted companies, which is kind -- I think it's pretty new. I mean, you target -- you target countries, but you target their companies. That's kind of interesting, but I am -- I am skeptical, but I will also say this that like -- it's an interesting contrast between how Republicans do foreign policy and Democrats. Democrats are like the single parent, but Republicans are like both parents. You've got -- you got the carrot and the stick. The Democrats always think all they have to do is yell world peace and it will happen. No, you actually need a carrot and you need a stick.

I don't think it led to this. I think what led to this was the South Korean president actually taking the risk of coming together and saying, you know what, we want to reunify, we want the peninsula to be one. Why don't you North Koreans join us at the Olympics, march in with us, let's talk -- let's have some talks. Remember, there's going to be talks between Vice President Pence who went. Those talks broke down, but the South Korean president did meet.   Today, you have a situation where Rex Tillerson, our Secretary of State, said -- as you saw at the start of the show, it's a surprise to us, speaking of the Trump administration, that you get Kim changing his posture in this way. And today at the White House, Sarah Huckabee-Sanders was kind of unsure saying, you know what, we want to make sure that he is going to, as a pre-condition to any talks, denuclearize first. And then, other people say, oh, no, they agree to have the meeting. But Sarah Huckabee- Sanders state -- made it seem like we're not quite sure about this. And then, Tillerson said sitting down to talk is not negotiation.  So I think to myself, the way that we're casting this conversation is big win for Trump or not, is he getting enough credit or not? And I'm just thinking the real issue here is how do we deal as a country with North Korea, and are we doing so effectively?",

      "speaker": "DANA PERINO, CO-HOST",
      "utterance": "Unbalance, I think so. I think he's getting -- I would call it a net plus in terms of coverage for him on this with a little dose of skepticism, not about the president but about Kim Jong-un, and appropriately so, because in 1996 and in 2005, they tried the same thing. Not exactly face-to-face talks, but they wanted talks in exchange for something. And in this case, it seems that depending on what Kim Jong-un actually does, they might actually get nothing for it, right? They want the talks for what? You know, they're going -- supposedly, he said he won't do any missile tests between now and whenever this meeting takes place. And we haven't heard other things from Kim Jong-un on what he would want. Now, with that said, it is a different situation now than to 1996 or 2005 because, apparently, he does have nuclear weapons now. So he comes to the table in a much different position. But I think there's no doubt that the president's stance and his willingness to be really tough -- plus, if you look at there's always this thing that Kim Jong-un was worried that he would become Saddam Hussein. And there's a reason that Kaddafi turned over his nuclear weapons because they realize that America, like, was not going to put up with it anymore. So, back to your question, is President Trump getting enough credit? I think so. And I think -- I think that also he can't worry about it too much because leadership is doing things that might not necessarily be popular at the time, but looking back could be very popular. For example, when he said fire and fury back in -- I don't know, was it last spring, and he was at Bedminster, and there was a huge fire fight about that in the media, like, oh, my gosh, it's so bellicose and he's going to lead us to nuclear war. Well, actually, looking back, and even in Vanity Fair, and the New York Times, and several of those people there, Podesta -- I'm sorry, Panetta and Brennan are all looking back saying, it actually worked in getting to this point. So I think on balance he's getting enough credit --"

And I think that's paying off in great dividends. And it did happen very quickly. There're going to be a lot of gyration. And if they delay the timeline or what happen -- we need to let this play out because President Trump has put us in a position where we can actually prevail and make the world a better, safer place."

But I want to hit the point about the optics, they say by elevating Kim, the optics -- he's getting something for nothing. It may actually help rocket man, but that's -- why wouldn't he do it? The point is that's going to be part of the deal. He's going to be in a deal that it's going to probably help him survive. But in order for this to succeed, we have to be super skeptical and we also have to have -- make sure that there is restitution for Otto Warmbier, right? He has to be part of this equation. And President Trump has spent a lot of time with Otto's dad, so I'm pretty sure that there's going to be-- that's going to be part of the deal. They should find out what happened to Otto? They should find the people who were responsible for that horrible, horrible treatment and they should punish them. I think that's his -- that's his big, to me, personally. I know it may seem irrational. As making sure that there're inspectors there to look at their nukes. But I think it should be part of because you can't let him get away with that. But, obviously, the sanctions worked. And the sanctions worked because they're like -- it's like -- I would call the sanctions the Trump handshake, right? It's the handshake that doesn't let go and just gets tighter and tighter and tighter. That should be -- I'm going to coin that the Trump handshake because it can go -- it can go on forever. There's no end to these sanctions. It's going to always makes them worse. And I think they're realizing that this isn't going the way they want to go. Also, he targeted companies, which is kind -- I think it's pretty new. I mean, you target -- you target countries, but you target their companies. That's kind of interesting, but I am -- I am skeptical, but I will also say this that like -- it's an interesting contrast between how Republicans do foreign policy and Democrats. Democrats are like the single parent, but Republicans are like both parents. You've got -- you got the carrot and the stick. The Democrats always think all they have to do is yell world peace and it will happen. No, you actually need a carrot and you need a stick. And I think Trump has been really good at welding that stick."

I don't think it led to this. I think what led to this was the South Korean president actually taking the risk of coming together and saying, you know what, we want to reunify, we want the peninsula to be one. Why don't you North Koreans join us at the Olympics, march in with us, let's talk -- let's have some talks. Remember, there's going to be talks between Vice President Pence who went. Those talks broke down, but the South Korean president did meet. Today, you have a situation where Rex Tillerson, our Secretary of State, said -- as you saw at the start of the show, it's a surprise to us, speaking of the Trump administration, that you get Kim changing his posture in this way. And today at the White House, Sarah Huckabee-Sanders was kind of unsure saying, you know what, we want to make sure that he is going to, as a pre-condition to any talks, denuclearize first. And then, other people say, oh, no, they agree to have the meeting. But Sarah Huckabee- Sanders state -- made it seem like we're not quite sure about this. And then, Tillerson said sitting down to talk is not negotiation. So I think to myself, the way that we're casting this conversation is big win for Trump or not, is he getting enough credit or not? And I'm just thinking the real issue here is how do we deal as a country with North Korea, and are we doing so effectively?"

And they're thinking, you know what, the way the sanctions are going, the way they're going after companies, this guy -- it's not going to end well for us, and it may still not end well for Kim, because the other thing we're not talking about is -- and I disagree, Juan.

And they have a South Korean president now that they did not have during the Obama administration who is much more willing to say to the North Koreans, let's try to work this out. It just depends on who you end up with. And right now, what we ended up with is a president who is willing to do what it takes to stop North Korea from having a nuclear weapon.

You know that household net worth is now up to $100 trillion. That's up 44 trillion since 2009, so that's obviously not Trump. But it tells you the strength of the economy. And the reason why the middle class is shrinking is because more high-income households are moving into the high-income households, so it's like triple since the late 60s.

Thankfully, I think that people see this in their local newspapers, because all across the country, if you're getting a bonus, it's in the paper.

That's what started this conversation on The View. So Dana, are we right to be critical of Joy Behar for just saying this?"

I could imagine that Pence listened to the apology and accepted it and forgave her, because that's what his religion tells him to do. And he lives his faith. But I think other people could have done that, too. You don't have to be Christian to accept somebody's apology. The other thing is, on television, sometimes you say things that you regret or that are provocative. And I'm sure that Bob Iger, the CEO of Disney, was sort of reluctant to be policing what is being said on air. So I think -- I just would never say that, but here's what I would say. Everyone gets a choice. When you open your mouth, you get to say whatever you want, and she had to own it."

Obviously, you know, it's of concern because it was raised by a shareholder and of Bob Iger. So it's a very, you know, serious situation. And, you know, people are offended. Right? I mean, they've got to think about it from a strategic perspective, too, and a ratings perspective, also in terms of just the public, you know, approach. So what are people thinking about this? There's millions and millions in this country of Americans that practice their faith and their religion. And they deserve to be -- you know, have the respect to be able to do that. And not only that, to say that about, you know, the vice president. I'm quite certain that Joy regrets those comments. Certainly, ABC doesn't applaud them. And they specifically also brought up all the Trump supporters, as well. So they're saying, \"Listen, you've offended a lot of people. You've said terrible things now about the president, about the vice president, about Christians in America and Christians in general.\" That's not a good situation for the network to find themselves in, but Mr. Iger showing leadership in this direction, and she's made her apology, and I think you won't be hearing that any further."
