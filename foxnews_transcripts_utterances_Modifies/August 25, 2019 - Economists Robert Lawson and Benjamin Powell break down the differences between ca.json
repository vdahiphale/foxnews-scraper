One of the things I like about your book is it's readable for the people who need to read it like millennials, like leftists, like Democrats running for President of the United States, that's just me speaking.  So let's get started. Let's start with you, Professor Lawson. What is Democratic socialism? We hear Bernie Sanders and others use this. What does that mean?",

Now, if you want to attach Democratic in front of that, then the idea, I suppose, is that you're going to have some Democratic system -- voting politicians -- who will elect central planners. Now that's actually where the problem comes in. Because once you centralize economic control in the hands of a few people, and that's what socialism inevitably and by definition does, then how do you have millions and millions of people influencing it, it doesn't actually work. And so it's been tried. The greatest example in the modern era of Democratic socialism is probably Venezuela. Chavez was elected by all accounts, a free and fair election. He instituted a new Constitution and started his Bolivarian socialist revolution.   They've nationalized industries, price controls -- all of the things that go with socialism. And what happened? As it inevitably it has happened every time socialism have been tried, that concentration of power, that concentration of economic control in the hands of a few. They couldn't keep the democracy side, and they end up using the power of the state to hammer down on their political opponents, the media, the independent media, independent journalists, the independent professors, and all sorts of people and the other political parties. So that's the problem is that you can try it for a minute, and it has been tried. But there's an internal contradiction, centralizing control over the entire economy, usually -- not usually -- inevitably means that you're not going to be able to maintain a democratic, free and open political system.",

When people point to places like -- and say, \"This is successful democratic socialism,\" like Sweden. Well, they've got a problem. In fact, in Socialism Sucks, our chapter on Sweden is called not socialism, because Sweden isn't socialist. The government doesn't own the major means of production in Sweden.   Instead, the government is too big, it's got a big welfare state. It has got high taxes. And we think there's problems with that, but we shouldn't conflate it with socialism. The type of big welfare state and high taxes that Sweden have will slow down its rate of growth, but it doesn't impoverish you and get rid of democracy the same way that actually nationalizing the major means of production does.",

Their selling point from Marx from the very, very beginning, the selling point for socialist has been \"Give us the power, we will centralize the control of the economy and we will deliver not only good economic performance,\" which is a lie, \"but we will also deliver equality.\" And that's been that's been the selling point, and equality, I have to say isn't on its surface, a horrible sounding concept. More or less, all things being equal, think equality is a nice thing. The problem is they don't actually deliver it. It's an empirical lie.  What socialism gives you, if it gives you anything at all, it will give you sameness. And this is one of the things we discovered in some of our travels.  When you go to a socialist country like Cuba today, you get two types of beer, the meals at every restaurant are basically the same. Just the day- to-day drudgery of things. Now, there's a certain equality in it in the sense that we're all going to be eating the same meals, we're all going to be having the same products available in the stores, but there's going to be no variety available. So it's a type of equality that I like -- I think it is called sameness -- that is not the kind of equality that most of us would really want to have. And so one of the things that I think when we have this conversation about equality is let's separate what the socialists claim they can give us. They claim they can give us equality, but what they're actually going to give us and what they have given us when it's been tried, has been a dreary, sort of sameness of life.   Everybody gets whatever the government says, you're going to get what I get. I'm going to get what you get. And that's not really what equality means to me.",

That's constrained human creativity. But those same Cubans, 90 miles away, make delicious food in Miami. A Cuban sandwich in Miami is great.

Now, the attack on free market capitalism is it creates too much wealth and too much materialism. So we apparently need to regress and we need to limit the access to economic wealth -- financial wealth -- that this economy creates. And they've created this green New Deal.

If you want to deal with every problem you can think of, it's going to be better for the rich, and we're not going to get rich by turning over our economy and the energy that drives our economy to windmills, which are, you know, orders of magnitude less efficient than fossil fuels.   So one of the challenges is, how are you going to achieve your -- if I'm a leftist, how are you if you're a leftist going to achieve your social goals of equality and justice, and so on and so forth, while your economy is falling apart?

This is a fascinating book. One of the things I like about your book is it's readable for the people who need to read it like millennials, like leftists, like Democrats running for President of the United States, that's just me speaking.

Now, if you want to attach Democratic in front of that, then the idea, I suppose, is that you're going to have some Democratic system -- voting politicians -- who will elect central planners. Now that's actually where the problem comes in. Because once you centralize economic control in the hands of a few people, and that's what socialism inevitably and by definition does, then how do you have millions and millions of people influencing it, it doesn't actually work. And so it's been tried. The greatest example in the modern era of Democratic socialism is probably Venezuela. Chavez was elected by all accounts, a free and fair election. He instituted a new Constitution and started his Bolivarian socialist revolution. They've nationalized industries, price controls -- all of the things that go with socialism. And what happened? As it inevitably it has happened every time socialism have been tried, that concentration of power, that concentration of economic control in the hands of a few. They couldn't keep the democracy side, and they end up using the power of the state to hammer down on their political opponents, the media, the independent media, independent journalists, the independent professors, and all sorts of people and the other political parties. So that's the problem is that you can try it for a minute, and it has been tried. But there's an internal contradiction, centralizing control over the entire economy, usually -- not usually -- inevitably means that you're not going to be able to maintain a democratic, free and open political system."

When people point to places like -- and say, \"This is successful democratic socialism,\" like Sweden. Well, they've got a problem. In fact, in Socialism Sucks, our chapter on Sweden is called not socialism, because Sweden isn't socialist. The government doesn't own the major means of production in Sweden. Instead, the government is too big, it's got a big welfare state. It has got high taxes. And we think there's problems with that, but we shouldn't conflate it with socialism. The type of big welfare state and high taxes that Sweden have will slow down its rate of growth, but it doesn't impoverish you and get rid of democracy the same way that actually nationalizing the major means of production does."

And they're going to tell you how to use your labor and how to interact the economy. That's the opposite of freedom."

    {
      "speaker": "LAWSON",
      "utterance": "Well, it's the social assault -- that's been their selling point. Their selling point from Marx from the very, very beginning, the selling point for socialist has been \"Give us the power, we will centralize the control of the economy and we will deliver not only good economic performance,\" which is a lie, \"but we will also deliver equality.\" And that's been that's been the selling point, and equality, I have to say isn't on its surface, a horrible sounding concept. More or less, all things being equal, think equality is a nice thing. The problem is they don't actually deliver it. It's an empirical lie. What socialism gives you, if it gives you anything at all, it will give you sameness. And this is one of the things we discovered in some of our travels. When you go to a socialist country like Cuba today, you get two types of beer, the meals at every restaurant are basically the same. Just the day- to-day drudgery of things. Now, there's a certain equality in it in the sense that we're all going to be eating the same meals, we're all going to be having the same products available in the stores, but there's going to be no variety available. So it's a type of equality that I like -- I think it is called sameness -- that is not the kind of equality that most of us would really want to have. And so one of the things that I think when we have this conversation about equality is let's separate what the socialists claim they can give us. They claim they can give us equality, but what they're actually going to give us and what they have given us when it's been tried, has been a dreary, sort of sameness of life. Everybody gets whatever the government says, you're going to get what I get. I'm going to get what you get. And that's not really what equality means to me."

That's constrained human creativity. But those same Cubans, 90 miles away, make delicious food in Miami. A Cuban sandwich in Miami is great. A Cuban sandwich in Cuba is ham and cheese that's old and kind of cruddy. When the Cubans are given their liberty, they do wonderful things with it, and instead, it is stifled on an island."

Now, the attack on free market capitalism is it creates too much wealth and too much materialism. So we apparently need to regress and we need to limit the access to economic wealth -- financial wealth -- that this economy creates. And they've created this green New Deal. But this Green New Deal as I see it, I'm interested in your take, is sort of a de-growth moment, or a deindustrialization moment, wrapped up in a climate change argument. How do you see this?"

And it's not full out socialism of say the Cuban and North Korean variety, but it's one more step down that road to serfdom, as we lose more and more of our economic liberty and those who know best in D.C. try to plan our lives first. The environmental part is just a sideshow. It's like you call it environmentalism in this context -- watermelons -- green on the outside, but it's red on the inside. That's the Green New Deal."

If you want to deal with every problem you can think of, it's going to be better for the rich, and we're not going to get rich by turning over our economy and the energy that drives our economy to windmills, which are, you know, orders of magnitude less efficient than fossil fuels. So one of the challenges is, how are you going to achieve your -- if I'm a leftist, how are you if you're a leftist going to achieve your social goals of equality and justice, and so on and so forth, while your economy is falling apart?

But that's not markets. We have a severely regulated healthcare industry, whether it's the AMA controlling access to the profession and not letting nurse practitioners do more things, whether it's the FDA that makes it cost a billion dollars in 10 years to bring a new drug to market. This isn't freedom. This isn't capitalism. Our problems in Medicine come from too much government running, doubling down and doing more government and Medicine and promising it for free would be even worse. In fact, lots of the socialist countries have given free healthcare for everybody. The Venezuelan Constitution puts in there that everybody has a right to free healthcare. Now, but having a right on paper doesn't actually deliver it. There's still scarcity. I mean, the average person in Venezuela last year lost something like 19 to 22 pounds. This isn't a healthy country. Putting it on a piece of paper doesn't deliver. There's still scarcity, you still have to ration which is why you hear about these horrible things like death panels that decide who gets what care and whatnot, when you have socialized Medicine."

And so we don't have enough resources, so then what? Well, then you have to ration. You have to ration. Someone has to decide. And if there is no prices to do the rationing, then it's going to be a government agency. It's going to be the Medicare-for-All agency, whatever we call it, and those guys are going to be the ones that decide, okay, Mark, well, you're sick. We don't have enough doctors, nurses and medicines to go around. We give everybody free medicine. So we're going to have to decide whether you're one of the lucky ones that gets it or not. That rationing is required in the system. And you make that rationing so much worse when you don't charge prices. Because who is to say if your illness is worse or more deserving of care than say, Ben's illness? Well, it's going to become a bureaucrat that makes those decisions and that's inevitable.

But what they have is good care for the ruling elite, because some comrades are more equal than others. And for paying foreigners who pay the Cuban government for healthcare, they can get high quality care, but the average person gets horrible care there. And it's a myth that they have this great life expectancy because of socialized health. They don't have cars to die in car accidents from. They have forced abortions at their hospitals of high risk pregnancies. Basically, they're cooking the books when it comes to the life expectancy stuff in Cuba.

And when you say healthcare is free, and it's your right, what you're essentially saying is those doctors and nurses are obligated to work for you, or the taxpayers have to pay them for you. And I think we really ought to ask ourselves a moral question. Is that really worth what this is all about? Or maybe we should have a system -- a medical center system -- that is more based on mutual gain? Like, look, I need something I really would like something fixed, Dr. Levin, would you help me?

It's not just about the wrong people, although, I think bad people are disproportionately attracted to politics, rather than private markets. But even with people being people. The entrepreneur in the private market has prices and profit and loss to guide his decision making to create value for others. The government planners don't have access to that same information, because they're not getting people to voluntarily purchase their services from them. So the informational component of it isn't the same. This is the fundamental problem that the economist level, Ludwig von Mises pointed out almost a hundred years ago in his article on socialism, and he asked socialist economies, how are you going to calculate even if we have angels in the planning bureaus, how are you going to make the calculations to coordinate your advanced production?

Poor and equal except for the ruling elite. In the United States context, doing something like this would be just tremendously costly.

So profit and loss and salaries, these gives you incentives to do things for others, and the prices give you the information to tell you whether you're doing a good job for others. In the socialist economies, this doesn't work the same way because they don't generate the prices for the information. And by the way, that new socialist man who is going to work for the good everybody else, he never showed up and punched the time clock. People continued to be people and concerned with themselves and weren't doing it just for the common good.

So calling it socialism was a little bit of a problem. But we certainly had a lot of people who thought that was a good idea. But we go back to the same conversation we had about free healthcare. You can't make something free -- well, you can, but if you do, you have to ration it, because everybody is going to want to go and one of the things you see with the free university systems in Europe, is they don't take very many college students. So we're trying to send a third of our high school or 40 percent of our high school students, 50 percent -- we're trying to send huge numbers of people to college in the United States. The only reason this is financially viable is if we charge them. If you make it free, we're not going to be able to afford to send that many students. We have to, again, the central planner or some bureaucrat, some testing agency or somebody is going to have to decide which lucky high school students get to go to college.

And while they talked about free college or forgiving debt, what you actually got when you talk with a lot of them is a whole host of issues where they are just kind of far left of the Democratic Party. But when you ask them, are you in favor of abolishing private property and replacing it with state planning and control? The majority of them aren't. They don't equate socialism with its defining characteristic. Instead, it's whether it's the environment, gender issues, pick your issue -- they're just far to the left, and somehow someone has told them socialism is the answer, when really what we need to be saying is capitalism, freedom, free enterprise, free association, and cooperation -- a type of word that socialists and lefties like. Capitalism is cooperation, buying and selling, exchange, this is cooperating on a voluntary basis. So what we've tried to do in this project is reach out to millennials and write in a way that they can engage with and understand some of the benefits of capitalism and how socialism is the opposite of a lot of the values that they espouse."

Most Republican or conservative politicians have marbles in their mouths, I don't know how to explain these things.

And I don't hear it brought up to any of that based by any of the journalists, so we're asking you the questions. There's more than even this that's being proposed. Plus we have our current circumstances of massive debt. How do we pay for all this?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "POWELL",
      "utterance": "We're not going to. The government is ultimately going to have to default in the long run on some of its promises that it's made. Forget the free college, free healthcare, everything else they are talking about. What we have on the books right now is not sustainable. Social Security will not be able to pay for itself going forward. We are not going to be able to make the type of payments that are promised. So that's going to mean some sort of default whether a default on actual obligations in terms of defaulting on the debt, or whether it's changing the ages and the requirements and the payments that you get under Social Security. The government has promised more can be delivered. You can't squeeze blood out of a rock. You're not going to squeeze more money out of our economy to pay the type of debts that this government is racking up."

    {
      "speaker": "LAWSON",
      "utterance": "So yes, so one way we can default though is to print money, maybe one of the greatest risk of the national debt at its scale. If the politicians won't actually have, but they won't be brave enough to tell our Social Security recipients, \"Sorry, you're not going to get that $400.00 check, you're going to get a $300.00 check because we are out of money.\" They are instead going to print a hundred dollars, and at the scale we're talking about that is inevitably inflationary. So I think that the default might be a different type of default. It might be an inflationary default, which is still a default, because the value of the money that you're going to get as a recipient of Social Security or Medicare won't be what you were promised."

      "utterance": "Oh, a hyperinflation of that type of magnitude, utterly wrecks an economy. It destroys your price system, your ability to calculate profits and losses between things. It all gets -- this is not like a three percent inflation. This is hyperinflation. It grinds economic activity to a halt. I mean, this is what we saw with Venezuela. We saw people lugging suitcases across the Venezuelan border into Colombia to buy basic necessities to bring back with them. But the suitcase was heavy both ways, because it was stuffed with the worthless cash that they had from Venezuela because of the hyperinflation there. They needed a suitcase full in order to buy basic supplies."

      "utterance": "When we see these pre-World War II black and white films of Germany, and the Myanmar Republic, and people pushing barrels filled of their paper currency at the time. So what it does ultimately is it destroys the society. Right? Completely destroys the society, starvation, poverty. Why do we need example, after example, after example of this? We've got one south of the border in Venezuela, which is rich in oil. It actually has more oil reserves than any of the country on the face of the Earth. It was a vibrant, rich country 50 years ago, probably the richest country south of the border. Look at it. It's the poorest country -- one of the poorest countries on the face of the Earth. People starving to death. People being killed because they object to what's taking place. How many more examples do we need, that liberty related economics works? And tyranny related economics is a disaster."

      "speaker": "POWELL",
      "utterance": "Hopefully no more examples, Mark, but unfortunately, I think we're going to keep getting them. But when we look -- I think Venezuela is really important to look at because you're absolutely right. In 1970, the average Venezuelan was richer than the average Spaniard. This was a relatively wealthy country. And it was democratic, as we discussed earlier. This is what Democratic socialism will give you -- political tyranny and poverty."

      "utterance": "I'm an optimist. So I'm going to go with more capitalist. And part of the reason I say that is because if you'd asked me that question 20 or 30 years ago, you know, coming out of the 70s when we had wage and price controls, we had borderline hyperinflation. We were talking about industrial planning at the national level. All of those ideas were considered to be absolutely absurd now, right? I think it's -- no one would national wage and price controls in the United States today. So we are much freer and more economically free, much more capitalist today than we were in Jimmy Carter's 1970s. And I think that trend is still going on, it is still going on around the world and U.S. is part of the world. I think we're on a trajectory. This is a little bit of a hiccup. But I'm actually an optimist."

I think the ideas of freedom and free enterprise are more compelling than socialism than an anti-capitalist rhetoric more generally. So if our ideas are better, and we do a better job of communicating, the world should move in that direction. Now, I think economists generally do a fairly bad job of communicating these things to the general public. Bob has written plenty of boring journal articles that nobody reads, I have written some that probably nobody reads --"

I don't really know of any political or governmental way to start to contain it other than maybe Article V Convention of States. I see the progressive movement of a hundred years has been extremely successful in devouring numerous institutions, including yours, in my opinion. I see some pushback. So I think it's a coin toss. At best. It's a coin toss at best. The Republic's don't survive forever. I'm not saying this one's over. We're fighting like hell with ideas, with books, with this TV show and so forth. But it's a tough nut. The American people must get engaged. Professors, it has been a great pleasure. Thank you."
