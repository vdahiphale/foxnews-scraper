Last night, you saw the opposition toxin at work, where every idea is positioned as A versus B, men versus women, black versus white, gay versus straight. So when you talk about uniting a country, it's met with a smirk. Unity means oppression which is really oppression driven by bigotry incapable of uniting behind American ideals and free markets and free minds. They shout about how bad everything is even when things are great. But things aren't great for everyone. They'll tell you. True, but your divisive message only makes things worse for people who want to do better and who are trying to do better. That's the oppositional mindset. Every answer ends with off with their heads. The only way you can do better is if someone does worse. They even managed to politicize a global virus. That's not a message. It is a virus. And they are stuck with it.

And as we've seen, debates haven't really paid off in terms of support for other people. But I thought Elizabeth Warren had the weirdest attack of the night when she went after Mayor Bloomberg for allegedly telling an -- a female employee to kill her baby when she was pregnant, which kind of took away the left argument on the abortion issue. So, like, on one hand, she's saying abortion is not killing. But then she accuses Michael Bloomberg of telling an employee to kill her baby, which I thought that Democrats were about choice. It's a very weird thing for her to say. And certainly, it didn't get her anywhere going into South Carolina on Saturday.",

Bernie Sanders doesn't even win the debate. He just gets to the left of every body and pounds the podium. He has no depth of knowledge about his own proposals. Everything is so thin. You punch him one time and he just says billionaire. I mean, that's not going to last.   He's going get eaten alive, eventually. Mike Bloomberg has no personality. He just memorizes talking points and delivers them like a robot. I've never seen anybody so rich and successful bomb like that before. Be a boss. Then there is a Biden, who I guess was more vigorous, but he didn't have any macho moments. He gets run over by a moderator.  It's the most pathetic thing I've ever seen. Warren is the most annoying person I think I've ever seen on television. She's intolerable. And I have a very high tolerance level. He frames an issue very concisely, but he doesn't ever punch above his weight class. Every time he tries to hit one of the big dogs, he gets talked over. Amy lost her sense of humor. Where did that go? And Steyer's a passionate guy but he's like a Lizard. He's so hard to look at. You can't him seriously.",

Nobody considers the fact that Obama had both the House and the Senate. And I think when Katie said that they are going after each other but they're not talking about -- it's so superficial. There is no actual debate about OK, what would you actually do? What are the issues that you would deal with? But Biden got very good news today with the endorsement from Jim Clyburn and the Palmetto State poll, which was the most accurate one for South Carolina in 2016 said Biden is up 35.

Last night, you saw the opposition toxin at work, where every idea is positioned as A versus B, men versus women, black versus white, gay versus straight. So when you talk about uniting a country, it's met with a smirk. Unity means oppression which is really oppression driven by bigotry incapable of uniting behind American ideals and free markets and free minds. They shout about how bad everything is even when things are great. But things aren't great for everyone. They'll tell you. True, but your divisive message only makes things worse for people who want to do better and who are trying to do better. That's the oppositional mindset. Every answer ends with off with their heads. The only way you can do better is if someone does worse. They even managed to politicize a global virus. That's not a message. It is a virus. And they are stuck with it.

This was the thrashing, the over talking, people are interrupting each other, not sticking to the rules, was a preview of dying, thrashing campaigns. This was the last stop for people like Elizabeth Warren, Amy Klobuchar, Mayor Pete. They are done if they don't get any kind of boost out of this debate. And as we've seen, debates haven't really paid off in terms of support for other people. But I thought Elizabeth Warren had the weirdest attack of the night when she went after Mayor Bloomberg for allegedly telling an -- a female employee to kill her baby when she was pregnant, which kind of took away the left argument on the abortion issue. So, like, on one hand, she's saying abortion is not killing. But then she accuses Michael Bloomberg of telling an employee to kill her baby, which I thought that Democrats were about choice. It's a very weird thing for her to say. And certainly, it didn't get her anywhere going into South Carolina on Saturday."

So to me, understanding that these people are desperate and that they are hungry and that they are going to claw, and spit and fume. They should've had better, you know, guard rails to make sure that there wasn't -- I mean, here at this table, I think we make an effort not to over talk because the audience gets angry.

And Rubio, Cruz, Christie, Romney, all of these people would decimate any one of these people that we saw last night. Just imagine what Trump would do. It's like a heavyweight versus a featherweight. Bernie Sanders doesn't even win the debate. He just gets to the left of every body and pounds the podium. He has no depth of knowledge about his own proposals. Everything is so thin. You punch him one time and he just says billionaire. I mean, that's not going to last. He's going get eaten alive, eventually. Mike Bloomberg has no personality. He just memorizes talking points and delivers them like a robot. I've never seen anybody so rich and successful bomb like that before. Be a boss. Then there is a Biden, who I guess was more vigorous, but he didn't have any macho moments. He gets run over by a moderator. It's the most pathetic thing I've ever seen. Warren is the most annoying person I think I've ever seen on television. She's intolerable. And I have a very high tolerance level. He frames an issue very concisely, but he doesn't ever punch above his weight class. Every time he tries to hit one of the big dogs, he gets talked over. Amy lost her sense of humor. Where did that go? And Steyer's a passionate guy but he's like a Lizard. He's so hard to look at. You can't him seriously."

And then last I -- because I did book signing with Martha. I asked Peter to take some notes for me. And this is what he had for Tom Steyer. It's kind of like Jesse's -- not as funny, says Tom Steyer, the man has all the presence of a wet tissue, blaming the Senate for the fact that gun control cannot be done. Nobody considers the fact that Obama had both the House and the Senate. And I think when Katie said that they are going after each other but they're not talking about -- it's so superficial. There is no actual debate about OK, what would you actually do? What are the issues that you would deal with? But Biden got very good news today with the endorsement from Jim Clyburn and the Palmetto State poll, which was the most accurate one for South Carolina in 2016 said Biden is up 35. And the next one is Steyer at 17 and Bernie at 13. So this race could still be way out of whack because Biden could win South Carolina, doesn't have a lot of money to compete in Super Tuesday."

He's going to take away your health insurance. The Green New Deal he supports is going to cost an average family $75,000 just for the first year, which is double the average of what the American family actually makes in the year.

He's been going all around the state. He's got a lot of support there. So I think it lifted his spirits, gave him a little confidence. I don't understand why he yells so much during the debates, because I'll tell you one thing I do think. I think that in 2024, the debates ought to consider not having an audience, because what happens is they're just going for an applause line, it gets disrupted, people get rattled, and then actually, as a voter, you can't actually get to some real meat of the issue.

When there's a firewall that means there's a fire that they haven't put out yet. And the firewall is made up of black voters. So if Biden does win South Carolina comfortably, it's not Biden that gets the credit, it's the black voters. But if he doesn't perform well in South Carolina, then the black voters get the blame, because they were disloyal to the first black president's V.P., and it's just an awkward situation to be in."

      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "If he wins big, Joe wins big, that might help him Super Tuesday. But I still really feel uncomfortable about watch -- when I'm watching him. When he's feisty, I like it because it's funny when he gets exasperated and he tells stories and stuff. But then when he loses his place and he closes his eyes and you can see that he's frustrated, and then no -- it's no longer funny to me and it makes me -- it makes me sad that it's gaffes about -- it's gaffes about mental confusion, about dates and memories and what happened. And we all see that with people that we know. And generally, you know, Dana has spinach in her teeth, somebody tells her. But there's nobody over on Joe's side saying stop. And it's like -- it's kind of like --"

      "speaker": "PERINO",

OK, well, I think it matters to Joe Biden in a place like South Carolina. But I agree with Dana that his team has not served him well moving forward. They've been very focused on a single demographic of voters in a single state, and California is already voting on early -- on Super Tuesday. In Texas, Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders are neck and neck when it comes to winning that state. Colorado is another one that people should be watching. So it's great if he wins on Saturday, but it seems like they've been very narrowly focused with blinders on about trying to pull out South Carolina and hoping that somehow this changes the momentum against an opponent that has an entire movement behind him that is bringing in more people by the day. I don't see it happening."

This is the safest country in the world to be during a time like this. I'm totally confident in the U.S. healthcare system. The United States doctors were probably going to find the virus vaccine to cure this. So, I was on the subway today. An Asian woman sat down. She had the mask on right next to me. I don't care. I didn't stand up. I'm not afraid of corona at all. The other thing is you keep hearing lies from the left and the media about these cuts that Trump made to the CDC and the National Institute --"

I'm right in the middle here between what Trump is saying and what the Democrats are saying. If you tell us it's overblown, fine. As long as you're committed to over- preparing. And I'll be happy four months from now to admit that we panicked, or we acted appropriately. But I don't want to say it now when we're flying blind, when we don't know that like -- and by the way, I'm not on CNN or MSNBC, I'm on Fox News.

I have tremendous faith in the CDC and the NIH. I think they those people know what they're doing, and they have a track record that's astounding. I agree with Jesse on that point.
