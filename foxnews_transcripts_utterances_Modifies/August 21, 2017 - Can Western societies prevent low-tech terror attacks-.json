But as far as the significance of this when it all started in Oregon it did have us thinking of, well, a certain Monty Python moment when this great moment fell on, well, disappointment.

General John Nicholson who is the commander of troops in Afghanistan wants some 4,000 additional troops. General Mattis, the secretary of defense, and H.R. McMaster, the national security advisor agreed. So if the president listens to his generals as he says he would during the election campaign and he follows the consensus, more U.S. forces will headed to Afghanistan. He basically was given three choices. One was if you stay in Afghanistan, you increase the number of troops, you pull out of Afghanistan and just leave a vacuum or you replace U.S. forces with private contractors. He didn’t like the last option, neither did the military in terms of turning it over to private contractors and according to Newt Gingrich, pulling out is not an option.

I think that the low tech nature of what we just saw here in Barcelona, which is similar to what we saw in France, this taking a vehicle, getting your hands on whatever you can, is going to become the signature. And the reason why is because it’s low tech. It’s easy to put together. You don’t need to do a lot of planning which means that threat assessments need to be done across the country. Europe’s a little slower, they move slower. Barcelona and I’ve been out there a number of times, Las Ramblas. The whole nature of Spain it’s a -- it’s a slower-moving groove. The bollards need to be in place. And there needs to be patrol armed police officers on both ends of that Las Ramblas, but everyone of those Las Ramblas needs to be looked at across Europe as well as here in the states to be able to prevent this low-terror attacks. I think the low-terror is more prevalent in Europe and I think the reason why is because it’s just easier to carry out an act of terror than let’s say trying to get AK-47s and explosives. The other place where I come out with this particular type of terror is that I think that this is going to continue to manifest and the reason why is because of the -- I just think the immigration policies in Europe have allowed a massive influx of ISIS sympathizers into that country and I think it’s almost too light. Countries like Germany and now in Spain. As far as being able to deal with this, I have a very hard line opinion on how to deal with this, but I’ll tell you from experience, Neil, I feel that if a - - if a 20 something-year-old would-be Jihadi’s sympathizer decides to take a vehicle and smash into a crowd of people. I believe that the only way to get back at this type of psychological threat is to use psychology in its reverse which is to export or ship back the parents and family members of that particular terrorist back to their parent country because it seems that the only thing they do care about is their family. They hate this country. They hate the country they live in. You’ve got to get the family members out of the country and let them know that those family members and the people close to them will be immediately sent back to their parent countries.",

Clemson was also one of several places along the path of the eclipse setting up a total of 68 identical telescopes and digital cameras to take photographs during totality of the sun’s corona. So instead of just a clip lasting several minutes they can string them together and have a 90-minute video of that corona so they can study it.

But what they can do with this tax cut, Neil, is also, key, make it retroactive to say June 1st driven January 1 of this year. That will do two things. One, it will give a positive jolt to the economy and/or it will mean the American people have big tax refunds next April. Good for the economy, good for the republicans. I hope they can connect the dots."

Not on tax cut policy but on our policy in Afghanistan by extension, North Korea, our agenda going forward. A lot of people are calling this is his moment to reestablish gravitas and that could affect everything, which is why on Fox Business tonight we are all over it beginning with a sort of a preflight report at 8:00 pm then the address at 9:00 pm. The only place you can gauge world market reaction as well as their own futures as and after the president is speaking whether it registers, not only when it comes to matters of national security but maybe market security. Much more after this."

Think about the last time he’s addressed the American people in a venue, anything approaching this was his address to a joint session, the congress back in January. What’s at stake for this big speech tonight? Presumably on our policy in Afghanistan going forward among other things. Let’s get the read right now from John Roberts following it all very, very closely. What can we expect, John?"

      "speaker": "JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Neil, good afternoon to you. We’re at Fort Meyer where the president will speak 9 o’clock tonight. He has made a decision underway forward, a new strategy in Afghanistan. He did that after meeting with his whole national security council on Camp David on Friday. And our understanding is that the president will allow the military to increase the number of U.S. forces there. General John Nicholson who is the commander of troops in Afghanistan wants some 4,000 additional troops. General Mattis, the secretary of defense, and H.R. McMaster, the national security advisor agreed. So if the president listens to his generals as he says he would during the election campaign and he follows the consensus, more U.S. forces will headed to Afghanistan. He basically was given three choices. One was if you stay in Afghanistan, you increase the number of troops, you pull out of Afghanistan and just leave a vacuum or you replace U.S. forces with private contractors. He didn’t like the last option, neither did the military in terms of turning it over to private contractors and according to Newt Gingrich, pulling out is not an option. Listen to what he said earlier today."

We know that the last time we allowed Afghanistan to be an empty space, it was filled with the Taliban and by Al-Qaeda and the planning for 9/11 was done in Afghanistan. We know if we pull out and the government collapses, you’re going to have some combination of ISIS, Al-Qaeda, and the Taliban running the country again. And that’s a long-term very real threat to the United States and Europe and all of our allies."

The president at his last big meaning on the National Security Council back in July was not happy with any of the options, couldn’t find anything to sign off on, but he has now and will learn what he signed off on tonight, 9 o’clock here at Fort Meyer in Arlington."

This is about a lot more than what we’re doing going to do in North Korea or in Asia, and this is about a lot more than foreign policy.

      "speaker": "FRANK LUNTZ, POLLSTER",
      "utterance": "It’s significant. The last 10 days for the president has not gone well, no matter what he has tweeted. That you have republicans in the house and senate and others across the country that where legitimately wondering whether he has lost the message, whether he’s lost the narrative. And this is a chance for him to do what presidents are meant to do, which is to lead. He is after all the commander-in-chief and I, actually as a strategist think that where he is doing this speech, being surrounded by military personnel, is quite smart. Donald Trump is at his best when he is with those that appreciate him, who like where he stands, and like the direction of the country. And he is also at his best when he is assertive in terms of policy, not politics. And so I’ll be listening to the language that he uses and the presentation that he makes, but this comes at the right time, he needed this speech."

It might have been short logged in that case, but there was a pop in the president’s popularity than President Carter’s popularity and a sort of a rally around the flag, rally around the guy who occupies the White House. So how important is it that he hits all the right notes tonight?"

    {
      "speaker": "LUNTZ",
      "utterance": "Well, we know what happened with Barack Obama when he reached out to the American people and talked about drawing the line with Syria and then doing nothing. And in fact, Obama’s evaluation of foreign policy was particularly weak for his presidency. So this is Donald Trump’s opportunity to draw a contrast with his predecessor. And we also know that Ronald Reagan, George Herbert Walker Bush, even Bill Clinton had very strong foreign policy, a very strong national security records which helped their overall favorability, so this is something that other presidents have done before, but the key here is not really what happens this evening. It’s the follow through over the coming weeks and months. Does he stay on message? Does he continue to talk about the essential nature of American national security? This is not in the administration that says the same thing day after day after day. It tends to veer off in other directions. Neil, the key for them is consistency, repetition, and quite frankly, accountability."

Having watched him speak before congress and having watched him at times like this. When the pressure is on is when Donald Trump is at his best, but I have to emphasize accurately that what will he say tomorrow, what will he tweet tomorrow and then the days that follow. One speech does not a presidency make."

And could still be in the making."

      "utterance": "All right. Spanish police are finally confirming that the van driver of that Barcelona attack, well he is dead, he’s been killed, but former Israeli Counterterrorism Operative, Aaron Cohen, still worry that this process where they use vehicles to do untold damage and killing in violence has not abated. Aaron, very good to have you, thank you. Do you get a sense right now that this will be the way ISIS targets folks? It’s crude but clearly effective and then the logical question becomes how do western governments societies deal with it?"

      "speaker": "AARON COHEN, FMR ISRAELI COUNTERTERRORISM OPERATIVE",
      "utterance": "Neil, it’s good to see you, great having you back, it’s been awhile. I think that the low tech nature of what we just saw here in Barcelona, which is similar to what we saw in France, this taking a vehicle, getting your hands on whatever you can, is going to become the signature. And the reason why is because it’s low tech. It’s easy to put together. You don’t need to do a lot of planning which means that threat assessments need to be done across the country. Europe’s a little slower, they move slower. Barcelona and I’ve been out there a number of times, Las Ramblas. The whole nature of Spain it’s a -- it’s a slower-moving groove. The bollards need to be in place. And there needs to be patrol armed police officers on both ends of that Las Ramblas, but everyone of those Las Ramblas needs to be looked at across Europe as well as here in the states to be able to prevent this low-terror attacks. I think the low-terror is more prevalent in Europe and I think the reason why is because it’s just easier to carry out an act of terror than let’s say trying to get AK-47s and explosives. The other place where I come out with this particular type of terror is that I think that this is going to continue to manifest and the reason why is because of the -- I just think the immigration policies in Europe have allowed a massive influx of ISIS sympathizers into that country and I think it’s almost too light. Countries like Germany and now in Spain. As far as being able to deal with this, I have a very hard line opinion on how to deal with this, but I’ll tell you from experience, Neil, I feel that if a - - if a 20 something-year-old would-be Jihadi’s sympathizer decides to take a vehicle and smash into a crowd of people. I believe that the only way to get back at this type of psychological threat is to use psychology in its reverse which is to export or ship back the parents and family members of that particular terrorist back to their parent country because it seems that the only thing they do care about is their family. They hate this country. They hate the country they live in. You’ve got to get the family members out of the country and let them know that those family members and the people close to them will be immediately sent back to their parent countries."

    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "But you do have to wonder too when this is prominently featured, this means of attack using vehicles, trucks, cars, et cetera, to kill people is featured in this inspire magazine, I guess, the ISIS, you know, magazine, there’s no mystery or secret to what they’re trying to do or who they’re trying to enlist. So how do we stop the enlistment part? That seems to be a big part of that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "COHEN",
      "utterance": "That’s a good question. I think there needs to be more emphasis spent on the -- on the -- on bolstering the cyber security that’s affecting the propaganda that the whole entire world can access. And if you look at the profile of the would be terrorist -- vehicular terrorist that we saw here -- you know, again, this guy didn’t blow himself up, he didn’t immediately go after the, you know, police officers with AK but just a lot more low tech. I think there was a little more time spent on the planning as far as (INAUDIBLE) how to get a safe house together and how to lay low for a couple of more days, but I think that killing that propaganda by bolstering anti-SIS cyber security means will ultimately affect the amount of people that are affected and want to collaborate with ISIS. And the tricky part is all the laws that are connected into that web of, well, you know, free speech and letting people say what they want, but anyone who posts a tweet that’s ISIS sympathist, anyone that post a Facebook post, or anyone that fills up in Instagram, hashtags and pro-ISIS, anything needs to be condemned and considered whatever it is legally that needs to have teeth on it to be able to have Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook immediately shut those down and that’s where I would start."
