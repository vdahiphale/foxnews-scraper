That's a bit misleading considering we are in Houston right now in this neighborhood just flooded late yesterday afternoon. I mean, keep in mind, these people are out and they are looking to rescue people and we rode along with them again today in both trucks and boats, pulling out families, and their pets. In this area alone today, Martha, we pulled out at least 60 people or saw 60 people being rescued and they're going back in because more people are in there. They really are at the mercy of the reservoirs here because what happens is that they don't let enough water out of the reservoirs that surround these areas than the dam breaks and everybody gets flooded. If they do let a ton of water out, well, then, certain neighborhoods get flooded. That is exactly what is happening here today.  But you see several people around Houston going back in and assessing the damage because the water has dropped and other people are packing up and getting out. Moments ago, we spoke to a prominent Houston judge. Watch.   KELLY JOHNSON, JUDGE, 178TH CRIMINAL DISTRICT: You know, this has been a really emotional day because you see all of these great Houstonians coming together, thinking it's over. And I just let the community that's just been pillaged by letting the aqueduct go and seeing canoes come down a street when you can drive one block over and they're dry.

It's hard to believe.

It's a very orderly process, we have very good tracking of where they are going so that we can keep their family members aware of not only their condition but where they are being taken. And once the hospital is able to return to full service, we'll be able to bring them back. As far as the homes of those being evacuated, we are taking them a place that is high and dry. Shelters operated not only by the state of Texas but by the American Red Cross. And we are supporting those shelters with commodities such as food, water, medical care, infant and toddler kits, durable medical equipment, things that those with have access and functional needs will require -- medications. The larger shelters you've seen, that your folks have been at also have our disaster teams that provide medical assistance right there.  We can create almost a mini hospital inside those large shelters to provide the full service of medical care while they're there in the shelter.

As well as we provide what we call rental assistance under or individual assistance program, where he will provide them additional money so that they can rent an apartment while they're repairing their home.  We have a multitude of options as we look for that long term solution, whether it gets them into an apartment, or they can go back and build some commercial facilities, but to make them either apartments or construct new ones, and rebuild ones that are there. We have the ability to use various means of housing to support them in the long term.

We started out in the Inwood area, and we rescued probably about, I would say 20 to 30 families there and we just started moving all over the city.  In the meantime, while we are rescuing, people just started tagging me, \"Hey, I have a boat. I have a boat.\" And then, more people started posting to Facebook and copying and sharing my post that said, \"Hey, contact the Darren Ott.\" And we put together a pretty large team. We teamed up with the Texas Freedom Force, which is our 501C3, and they have swift water boats, they have just about everything.

We're at the Jack Brooks Regional Airport, this is a staging area for the Texas National Guard which has some 14,000 troops here now deployed across the state from Corpus Christi to the Louisiana line, and more officers -- more soldiers on the way according to the Task Force Harvey commander who I spoke with a short time ago, who says they will be here for as long as they're needed and they have plenty of assets to air, land, and sea rescues, including these high water vehicles that are being used to being pulled people out from the worst of the flooded neighborhoods, particularly in Beaumont. The president said earlier today that there are 100,000 homes that have been damaged by the storm, and we've seen many of them across this particular city.  The other major concern here right now is the pump stations, the water. There is no running water for the city of nearly 120,000 people. They lost the main pump station and the secondary water source overnight, and that's why those nearly 200 patients from Baptist Beaumont Hospital had to be evacuated. The hospital spokesperson told us they're prepared for any storm that the building was flooded proof and they have plenty of resources and generators for power, but they cannot operate without running water. That was a game changer and that is why they began early this morning, beginning with 16 nursing home patients, who some of which needed dialysis treatment, putting them on a helicopter. Those patients were taken to Jasper. Others, to other hospitals across the region that were capable of taking care of them. But not just people need saving here, Martha. We saw an incredible rescue earlier today in a neighborhood on the north end of Beaumont where the Beaumont firefighters were called out because of two horses that had escaped their stable and had wound up on the front porch of a deeply flooded home in a neighborhood. And the horses were scared and stuck and couldn't get out, so these firefighters went back in there with a flat boat and I got out of the boat and started corralling these horses and trying to encourage them to make their way to dry land and it took a while. We watch them struggle with the first one horse and then the second horse. And I want to give props to those firefighters, as well as Kenneth Netherton, who was one of the many volunteers out here with boats, who able to help as well. He drove us out there and he helped these firefighters get these horses out of that deep water and they are being taken care of tonight. It is just -- it remains a disaster area, Martha.

That's a bit misleading considering we are in Houston right now in this neighborhood just flooded late yesterday afternoon. I mean, keep in mind, these people are out and they are looking to rescue people and we rode along with them again today in both trucks and boats, pulling out families, and their pets. In this area alone today, Martha, we pulled out at least 60 people or saw 60 people being rescued and they're going back in because more people are in there. They really are at the mercy of the reservoirs here because what happens is that they don't let enough water out of the reservoirs that surround these areas than the dam breaks and everybody gets flooded. If they do let a ton of water out, well, then, certain neighborhoods get flooded. That is exactly what is happening here today. But you see several people around Houston going back in and assessing the damage because the water has dropped and other people are packing up and getting out. Moments ago, we spoke to a prominent Houston judge. Watch. KELLY JOHNSON, JUDGE, 178TH CRIMINAL DISTRICT: You know, this has been a really emotional day because you see all of these great Houstonians coming together, thinking it's over. And I just let the community that's just been pillaged by letting the aqueduct go and seeing canoes come down a street when you can drive one block over and they're dry. I mean, it's just really unbelievable."

It's hard to believe. Some people stayed behind, many left, but yet, the water did come, and they are saying, for the next several days, until these reservoirs equal out, that water could come again and again. And the misery index level keeps rising with the water. Martha."

What we're seeing right now is we're focused along with our state partners and local partners down in southeast Texas and Beaumont as well as in Harris County. We're really looking to continue the search and rescue mission until it is complete until we have rescued those that we can rescue. And unfortunately, as he reported, we are going to find some recoveries. As tragic as that is, we are here to support the state in that search and rescue. We're conducting the evacuation of the hospital. We are also conducting a general population evacuation in support of the local officials there in Jefferson County. I think it's important to remember that this is a large event, it's large in scale, it's large in devastation, but Texas will recover, and FEMA, along with all of our federal partners across the entire federal family and as well as other states that are contributing to this response and will contribute to the recovery, are here for Texans to make them build back stronger and more resilient."

You know, when you evacuate a hospital, where's everybody going? Give us a sense of when these people are being taken out of their homes.

      "speaker": "HANNES",
      "utterance": "So, for the hospital, we rely heavily on our partners over at HHS, Health, and Human Services, that will coordinate that for us with the local officials. We take them from one hospital to another hospital that can meet their medical needs. Each patient is triaged if you will; segregated out to go to the proper hospital to meet their needs. It's a very orderly process, we have very good tracking of where they are going so that we can keep their family members aware of not only their condition but where they are being taken. And once the hospital is able to return to full service, we'll be able to bring them back. As far as the homes of those being evacuated, we are taking them a place that is high and dry. Shelters operated not only by the state of Texas but by the American Red Cross. And we are supporting those shelters with commodities such as food, water, medical care, infant and toddler kits, durable medical equipment, things that those with have access and functional needs will require -- medications. The larger shelters you've seen, that your folks have been at also have our disaster teams that provide medical assistance right there. We can create almost a mini hospital inside those large shelters to provide the full service of medical care while they're there in the shelter. But the ultimate goal is to get those folks out of the congruent shelter and into a more stable, interim sheltering situation so that we can help them rebuild their homes and get them back into their own neighborhoods."

You know, you go to the convention center or you go to a shelter and you're still thankful that you have some place that's clean and dry that you can stay. What's the plan for where they'll be moved to? We all remember the fields of trailers that people lived in for month, after month, after Katrina. What is the plan there?"

From there, we'll move them either to hotels or them, sometimes, will go with friends and family and will work with them for transportation assistance to get there. As well as we provide what we call rental assistance under or individual assistance program, where he will provide them additional money so that they can rent an apartment while they're repairing their home. We have a multitude of options as we look for that long term solution, whether it gets them into an apartment, or they can go back and build some commercial facilities, but to make them either apartments or construct new ones, and rebuild ones that are there. We have the ability to use various means of housing to support them in the long term. I have a team, not only in D.C., working with Hud, but also here with me, creating that long-term plan to present to the state of Texas in the near term so that we can start that process now and not wait until it's too late."

And I took to Facebook, I took social media and posted, \"Hey, calling all boats, jet skis, who has anything that can help.\" And probably within 15-20 minutes, I started receiving phone calls. So, Dakota called me up, he goes, \"Hey, I got four guys coming with boats.\" And I had a couple other guys call me with boats and we loaded up and started heading to areas that were -- they needed because of the devastation. We started out in the Inwood area, and we rescued probably about, I would say 20 to 30 families there and we just started moving all over the city. In the meantime, while we are rescuing, people just started tagging me, \"Hey, I have a boat. I have a boat.\" And then, more people started posting to Facebook and copying and sharing my post that said, \"Hey, contact the Darren Ott.\" And we put together a pretty large team. We teamed up with the Texas Freedom Force, which is our 501C3, and they have swift water boats, they have just about everything. I've been working with Joyce, and she's in contact with the office of Emergency Management with different cities here.

And when we pulled up, it was like something you would see in a movie when you have 100 people running at you that want to jump on the truck all at the same time, and you're the only truck there and you're telling some people they can't go back right now and they're not wanting to hear it.

We're at the Jack Brooks Regional Airport, this is a staging area for the Texas National Guard which has some 14,000 troops here now deployed across the state from Corpus Christi to the Louisiana line, and more officers -- more soldiers on the way according to the Task Force Harvey commander who I spoke with a short time ago, who says they will be here for as long as they're needed and they have plenty of assets to air, land, and sea rescues, including these high water vehicles that are being used to being pulled people out from the worst of the flooded neighborhoods, particularly in Beaumont. The president said earlier today that there are 100,000 homes that have been damaged by the storm, and we've seen many of them across this particular city. The other major concern here right now is the pump stations, the water. There is no running water for the city of nearly 120,000 people. They lost the main pump station and the secondary water source overnight, and that's why those nearly 200 patients from Baptist Beaumont Hospital had to be evacuated. The hospital spokesperson told us they're prepared for any storm that the building was flooded proof and they have plenty of resources and generators for power, but they cannot operate without running water. That was a game changer and that is why they began early this morning, beginning with 16 nursing home patients, who some of which needed dialysis treatment, putting them on a helicopter. Those patients were taken to Jasper. Others, to other hospitals across the region that were capable of taking care of them. But not just people need saving here, Martha. We saw an incredible rescue earlier today in a neighborhood on the north end of Beaumont where the Beaumont firefighters were called out because of two horses that had escaped their stable and had wound up on the front porch of a deeply flooded home in a neighborhood. And the horses were scared and stuck and couldn't get out, so these firefighters went back in there with a flat boat and I got out of the boat and started corralling these horses and trying to encourage them to make their way to dry land and it took a while. We watch them struggle with the first one horse and then the second horse. And I want to give props to those firefighters, as well as Kenneth Netherton, who was one of the many volunteers out here with boats, who able to help as well. He drove us out there and he helped these firefighters get these horses out of that deep water and they are being taken care of tonight. It is just -- it remains a disaster area, Martha. That neighborhood, the water is actually higher today than it was yesterday. And the skies are completely clear."

And as we've heard from the gentleman from FEMA before, he says they're working in a very organized manner to make sure everybody is notified. Rick, thank you. Thank you so much.

This is a really long haul. So, it's just what is the next thing you can do? So, yesterday for me, it was -- throw on a baseball cap and sweat. We set up a distribution center for our relief volunteers. I did a lot of grocery shopping until I could no longer, literally, I could not push my basket any further. It was that heavy, get that where it needs to be. Sweep, get out, wet backs, whatever it takes. So, that's what I want to do. Then, to help financially, to encourage people. And one thing I think someone of my situation can do, anyone with any kind of platform whatsoever, just bring attention to the need. Speak out and say, we are really devastated.

And I think that to see the people coming together is incredibly important, people are encouraging one another, and holding one another up, and the diversity is such a beautiful thing. We're really having to focus on everything Houston and our area of the country has to offer because it's a strong part of the country, and it's got a lot of heart to it. And so, we're really seeing that right now. And that's what we're going to have to focus on. One of the things I keep saying to people is right now, today, in Houston, Texas and the areas around us, the hands of Jesus have wet backs and saws in them, and the feet of Jesus is wearing rubber boots walking in deep water.

It could happen in a position now where he can actually get the Democrats, the Luis Gutierrez's of the world to come to the table and say there's a lot of things that we do agree with, but we will locked on the border, we won't do amnesty, and we won't give you a blanket pass to allow these people to stay here illegally."

You had two college Republicans were chased by these people and attacked at a gas station by the protesters. The woman who organized the protest in Berkeley that they disrupted is a transsexual Trump supporter. Here in the inauguration they broke windows of a Starbucks and they set a limousine on fire that was owned by a Muslim business man. Their name is alive to begin with. Who are they? Antifa, there is a professor in Dartmouth who has written a book supporting Antifa. This is how he describes them. They are Marxist, Leninist, revolutionary leftists, who have no allegiance to liberal democracy, and believe that physical violence is both ethically justifiable and strategically effective. That makes them the equivalent of the neo- Nazi. They commit violence in the name of an ideology that killed 25 million people in the 20th century. These people, Antifa, our neo- communists who commit violence in the name of an ideology that killed 100 million people in the 20th century. They are morally indistinguishable and need to be rejected by the Democratic Party, just like Republicans have rejected the neo-Nazis."

They recognize that they don't believe that people have a right to speak freely, that they believe that some people are unworthy of free speech because of their views. Certainly, Professor Brady has commented that in his book with some apparent support with the notion that not all speech is equal. That really challenges the basic of our country. Once you start to create this generation of speech intolerant kids, the question is, where we are heading. Who will decide what views are unworthy and what are not. I think the problem I have with Nancy Pelosi's statement is this effort to try to draw distinctions is not necessary and it's a bit dangerous. We are denouncing extremist groups, trying to keep others from speaking through intimidation or violence. That should be the measure. I don't see the distinction."

What's amazing is that the Democrats have declared themselves as the resistance, not just the opposition, they are the resistance. Antifa claims to be the pointy edge of the spear of that resistance. It is incumbent on Democrats to make clear that they reject not just their violent tactics, but their ideology, and their doctrines, just as it was incumbent on Republicans and Republicans did make clear that they rejected the neo-Nazis and white supremacists."

But you have a lot of faculty that support, not just Antifa but also speech codes and the erosion of free speech. We have had professors who have actively engaged in tearing down displays, even assaulting, and one case in California, pro-life demonstrators. She wasn't fired. She was criminally charged with the faculty stood behind her. What is troubling is that we are losing our sense of values that define us as academic institutions."

This popped up this afternoon after they had time to review after these documents and input from the people on Comey's team. One of them said that he had drafted a similar statement to what we saw on July 5th, way back in May. He hadn't interviewed Brian Paglia on outcome a lot of people involved in the immunity agreements for Heather Samuelson and Sheryl Mills were not in place yet. Byron, what you make of that?"

They interviewed her on Saturday, July 2nd, and the fourth of July was Monday and Tuesday, the fifth, James Comey comes out and says that she would not be charged. In addition, you have the others you just mentioned. One of the most common features of Washington investigations is trying to determine whether someone has made false statements to investigators, to the FBI, the grand jury, to somebody. That is often the way these things end up is in charge of the false statements. Was it appears here, the 17 people that they had not interviewed by the time that Mr. Comey began drawing his conclusions, and the 48 hours they gave themselves to evaluate all of Hillary Clinton three and a half hour of testimony, they just really weren't looking to see if these people were telling him the truth or not."

What they were first arguing is that James Comey was fired because he was too hard on Hillary Clinton. Now they are arguing that he was fired because he was too soft on Hillary Clinton. Both things cannot be true. The second thing that I would say is that, look, he said under oath that he made the decisions in July. If he said he committed perjury, they should just come out and say it. The third thing I would say is that the timing of this is incredibly fishy. It comes on the same day that we learn that Donald Trump's own lawyers are sending a memo to the special counsel where they are trashing James Comey in what appears to be an attempt to undermine his reputation, as we learn he is the star witness, are very likely of the star witness and the obstruction of justice case against President Donald Trump. The fact that this came out today is incredibly fishy. It should raise a lot of eyebrows. The second thing about timing is that it comes 24 hours after we know that Donald Trump called Chuck Grassley."

There were certainly people in law enforcement who said on July 5th, a - the head of the FBI should not come out and give a long explanation for what they were doing. They shouldn't have done it again on October 28th."
