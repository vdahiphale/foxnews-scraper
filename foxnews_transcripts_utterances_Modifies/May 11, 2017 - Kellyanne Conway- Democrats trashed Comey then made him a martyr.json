Tonight here on this program, we set the record straight. And that is tonight's \"Opening Monologue.\"  All right, the destroy Trump propaganda media continues to do the Democrats' dirty work by pushing insane tin hat conspiracy theories and making ridiculous and factually inaccurate historical comparisons to President Trump kicking James Comey to the curb.

He made a mockery of the rule of law. He did nothing while 4th Amendment privacy rights in this country were being violated day in and day out.   And of course, the most dangerous part of what he's been doing, he created a two-tiered justice system, one for Hillary, one for Bill Clinton, and one for the rest of us. Now, just take a look right there on the side of your screen. These are all the laws that Hillary Clinton broke with her private email server scandal. And along with the Clinton Foundation, which is another big issue -- well, Clinton's server had, let's see, top-secret information, special access program information on it, classified information on it.  Remember, she deleted -- you can't delete 30,000-plus emails! Now, she claimed they were personal about yoga, a wedding, a funeral, grandchildren and emailing with her husband, who doesn't email!  And even James Comey described her conduct in that 13-minute closing argument where we thought he was going to indict her, as \"extremely careless.\" Now, the legal standard is gross negligence! Can anybody tell me what the difference is? And back during the campaign, we learned that there was a very high chance that up to five foreign actors had hacked into Hillary's server. She totally compromised America's national security and he did nothing. And by the way, that likely put operatives in the field and their lives in danger. On top of all of this, you have the Clinton Foundation. Now we have the pay-to-play scheme. The Clintons were literally lining their pockets with millions and millions of dollars while Hillary was serving as secretary of state!   You might remember, Clinton signed off herself on giving the Russians 20 percent of America's uranium, that horrible Uranium One deal. Remember, she had to sign off personally on that. And many of the people that were involved or in and around that deal donated millions and millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation. And by the way, Moscow was doubling Bill Clinton's speaking fees.  Now, that's just the beginning of Comey's many, many mistakes. Now, most recently, Comey stood by while your 4th Amendment privacy rights were being trampled on with the Obama administration unmasking American citizens caught up in foreign surveillance incidentally. Now, the one law that we do know was broken in this whole Russia-gate conspiracy theory advanced by the left -- well, the one law was broken was against General Mike Flynn. OK, so he was incidentally picked up. Then they unmask General Flynn. And then classified information, top-secret classified information, was released. That is a crime. That is a felony. That is a violation of the Espionage Act.  And as we've been saying, Comey got what he deserved. And frankly, kind of lucky that the president let him collect a paycheck for as long as he did.  Now, of course, the propaganda destroy Trump media and the Democrats, well, they don't want you to know any of these facts, and they're not reporting these facts. And they're expanding on their lies like saying, \"Oh, Comey asked for more money.\" That turned out not to be true today. And that's why you're only going to hear about these issues, frankly, right here on this show. And by the way, instead what you have from the left and Democrats, they're now feigning selective moral outrage. They're pretending to forget that just a few short months ago, most of them were calling for Comey to be fired.  Now, the biggest hypocrite of all is Senator \"Crocodile Tears Chucky Schumer.\" Just take a look at what he said about Comey. This was the end of October. Boy, his tune has changed!   SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER, D-N.Y., MINORITY LEADER, OCT. 31, 2016: He owes not only Secretary Clinton but the American people an explanation for what appears to be an appalling action.  He's got a big burden of proof, so to speak, on him for why he did what seems to be such an appalling act that goes against the tradition of prosecutors at every level of government. It was -- when I heard about it, I found it hard to believe that Comey, who I thought had some degree of integrity, would do this. What Comey did -- I just respectfully disagree with my opponent. What he did was appalling, and prosecutors from one end of America to another know it.",

Because Democratic leaders were out there trashing this guy all through the fall. And now they want to make him a martyr. I would out to you today that in addition to what the president himself said, which is most important, in the interview with a different network, that Mr. McCabe, the acting FBI director today, under sworn testimony, said that the firing of Jim Comey does not impact their ongoing investigations at all and that they have sufficient resources. The media print the opposite. They said that they had asked for more resources. He said, We have enough of them. Somebody, a single source, quote, \"somebody close to the White House\" -- I don't know if they mean at the sandwich shop or the coffee shop across the street -- but quote, \"somebody close to the White House\" said that Mr. Rosenstein had tried to - - had threatened to resign.

He made a mockery of the rule of law. He did nothing while 4th Amendment privacy rights in this country were being violated day in and day out. And of course, the most dangerous part of what he's been doing, he created a two-tiered justice system, one for Hillary, one for Bill Clinton, and one for the rest of us. Now, just take a look right there on the side of your screen. These are all the laws that Hillary Clinton broke with her private email server scandal. And along with the Clinton Foundation, which is another big issue -- well, Clinton's server had, let's see, top-secret information, special access program information on it, classified information on it. Remember, she deleted -- you can't delete 30,000-plus emails! Now, she claimed they were personal about yoga, a wedding, a funeral, grandchildren and emailing with her husband, who doesn't email! And even James Comey described her conduct in that 13-minute closing argument where we thought he was going to indict her, as \"extremely careless.\" Now, the legal standard is gross negligence! Can anybody tell me what the difference is? And back during the campaign, we learned that there was a very high chance that up to five foreign actors had hacked into Hillary's server. She totally compromised America's national security and he did nothing. And by the way, that likely put operatives in the field and their lives in danger. On top of all of this, you have the Clinton Foundation. Now we have the pay-to-play scheme. The Clintons were literally lining their pockets with millions and millions of dollars while Hillary was serving as secretary of state! You might remember, Clinton signed off herself on giving the Russians 20 percent of America's uranium, that horrible Uranium One deal. Remember, she had to sign off personally on that. And many of the people that were involved or in and around that deal donated millions and millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation. And by the way, Moscow was doubling Bill Clinton's speaking fees. Now, that's just the beginning of Comey's many, many mistakes. Now, most recently, Comey stood by while your 4th Amendment privacy rights were being trampled on with the Obama administration unmasking American citizens caught up in foreign surveillance incidentally. Now, the one law that we do know was broken in this whole Russia-gate conspiracy theory advanced by the left -- well, the one law was broken was against General Mike Flynn. OK, so he was incidentally picked up. Then they unmask General Flynn. And then classified information, top-secret classified information, was released. That is a crime. That is a felony. That is a violation of the Espionage Act. And as we've been saying, Comey got what he deserved. And frankly, kind of lucky that the president let him collect a paycheck for as long as he did. Now, of course, the propaganda destroy Trump media and the Democrats, well, they don't want you to know any of these facts, and they're not reporting these facts. And they're expanding on their lies like saying, \"Oh, Comey asked for more money.\" That turned out not to be true today. And that's why you're only going to hear about these issues, frankly, right here on this show. And by the way, instead what you have from the left and Democrats, they're now feigning selective moral outrage. They're pretending to forget that just a few short months ago, most of them were calling for Comey to be fired. Now, the biggest hypocrite of all is Senator \"Crocodile Tears Chucky Schumer.\" Just take a look at what he said about Comey. This was the end of October. Boy, his tune has changed! SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER, D-N.Y., MINORITY LEADER, OCT. 31, 2016: He owes not only Secretary Clinton but the American people an explanation for what appears to be an appalling action. He's got a big burden of proof, so to speak, on him for why he did what seems to be such an appalling act that goes against the tradition of prosecutors at every level of government. It was -- when I heard about it, I found it hard to believe that Comey, who I thought had some degree of integrity, would do this. What Comey did -- I just respectfully disagree with my opponent. What he did was appalling, and prosecutors from one end of America to another know it."

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "All right, did you get that? \"Appalling action.\" Now, of course, \"Crying Chuck,\" well, he wasn't done there. Just days before the election, he went after James Comey yet again by saying, quote, \"I do not have confidence in him any longer. To restore my faith, I'm going to have to sit down, talk to him, get an explanation for why he did this.\" And now that Donald Trump is president, the king of hypocrisy, \"Chucky Schumer,\" is now singing a much different tune about James Comey. Interesting how politics plays a part in how you think about any one individual on any different day. Take a look."

This is about one of the most sacred things we believe in as Americans -- rule of law. Rule of law being threatened here. We know Director Comey was leading an investigation on whether the Trump campaign colluded with the Russians, a serious offense. Were those investigations getting too close to home for the president? The dismissal of Director Comey establishes a very troubling pattern. If Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein does not appoint an independent special prosecutor, every American will rightly suspect that the decision to fire Director Comey was part of a cover-up."

It's -- it is -- that's what's appalling. They should change the name of the Democratic Party to the hypocrite party. You know, I saw one person say -- this was a columnist -- that this is a coup. Well, that's cuckoo. I saw another person say it's a constitutional crisis. The only crisis here is in people's heads.

The level of activism on the part of the media in creating fake news, perpetuating these lies, not ever correcting the record. And the second thing that is new is Donald Trump. Donald Trump is an alien organism that's been injected into the body politic by the American people to reform that system. And therefore, the entire political ruling class -- all of the ruling elites -- and that includes the media, Sean -- are doing everything possible to reject him, to push him out of the system. That includes lying about him. It includes lying about his team. It includes lying about his record. And I hope that this president understands what he's up against here.

And in March, 41 percent of Democrats said they had an unfavorable view of Jim Comey to 12 percent of Democrats who said it was favorable. Why was it 41 unfavorable? Because Democratic leaders were out there trashing this guy all through the fall. And now they want to make him a martyr. I would out to you today that in addition to what the president himself said, which is most important, in the interview with a different network, that Mr. McCabe, the acting FBI director today, under sworn testimony, said that the firing of Jim Comey does not impact their ongoing investigations at all and that they have sufficient resources. The media print the opposite. They said that they had asked for more resources. He said, We have enough of them. Somebody, a single source, quote, \"somebody close to the White House\" -- I don't know if they mean at the sandwich shop or the coffee shop across the street -- but quote, \"somebody close to the White House\" said that Mr. Rosenstein had tried to - - had threatened to resign.

If influencing elections is bad, why did Barack Obama use his State Department and political operatives to try and unseat one of our greatest allies, the prime minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu?

He was resolute and decisive, exactly what we've seen in past decisions in his early administrations, Sean, and people who are questioning that just need to listen to him in these interviews. He said he had thought about it for a long time and he made the decision and it's final. But also, the acting FBI director says that he can still go forward with everything as is. The other thing I just wanted to mention is because it gets no coverage -- you know, the president is also talking about the economy and jobs, what's next on health care. He signed an executive order today on cyber security. He's doing so many things. He's preparing for his first foreign trip with five different stops.

Former Florida Congresswoman Corrine Brown found guilty on 18 fraud and tax evasion charges. Brown, a Democrat, was accused of illegally siphoning $800,000 from her charity into her own bank account. Brown blames her former chief of staff who pleaded guilty to corruption charges and testified against her. Unemployment claims falling by 2,000 last week.

So those are really important questions that need to be asked of the Justice Department. Why did the Justice Department, or why has not the Justice Department called on the FBI to start an investigation into the leaks?

      "utterance": "That was President Trump back in December during his thank you tour. The crowd again started chanting \"lock her up.\" Now that the former FBI Director James Comey has been fired, should the president grant supporters wish? It's really not his decision. That will be up to the attorney general and others in this case. Joining us now, Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi. OK, do you have any doubt the evidence is overwhelming and incontrovertible, and I will put up the laws that I believe she has violated, that she broke the law, committed felonies, Pam, on this?"

      "speaker": "PAM BONDI, FLORIDA ATTORNEY GENERAL",
      "utterance": "Sean, you have laid the case out multiple times. I think we all know not only did she get a pass, it wasn't negligent. It was criminal, everything that she has done. The president however now -- we have a separation of powers, and he is clearly respecting that. As the president of the United States, what has he said? He has said it would make it more divisive. We need to move on. He is focused on policy. He's focused on not polarizing our country any further, working together, creating health care law, doing all the positive things he wants to do. Every time you show the clip of Hillary Clinton condemning James Comey for her losing the election, she should be writing him a thank you note that she's not in prison right now. Frankly, she should be writing two. She should be writing you a thank you note that you are not director of the FBI, because if you had been, she would have been in prison, Sean."

    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Attorney General Bondi, this is really important. The president doesn't have a say in this. And I think he disappointed some people when he said after the election let's move on, I'd rather not get involved in this. But it is not his decision, is it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BONDI",
      "utterance": "Exactly, Sean. Exactly, Sean. And that's what he's doing. He is being presidential. It's his job to create policy. That's what he is doing. He is moving forward. Andrew McCabe who is now acting director of the FBI was working with James Comey. Whether they decide to go forward against Hillary Clinton, that has got to be up to the FBI and the great prosecutors in the Justice Department. And frankly, we shouldn't be knowing what's going on as it's happening. It should be a criminal investigation if they choose to go that direction. And, frankly, that's the president's job."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "And 18-USC-793, the legal standard is gross negligence. James Comey called talked about extreme carelessness. Is there any legal distinction in your mind as an attorney general?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BONDI",
      "utterance": "No. I think it is clearly gross negligence. Any time you talk having classified information, that could jeopardize lives. Sean, you and I know, and really we should've started this off by saying there are so many great men and women around this country in the Federal Bureau of Investigation who do great work every day. And hopefully they will have a new permanent leader soon. They have Jeff Sessions at the helm of the attorney general's office. And they are going to continue to do great things, and it's going to be up to them to investigate it and not the White House."

Go to Facebook.com/SeanHannity, @SeanHannity on Twitter, let us know what you think. All right, that's all the time we have for this evening. Thanks for being with us.
