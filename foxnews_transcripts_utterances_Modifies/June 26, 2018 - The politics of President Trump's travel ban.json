If you just took the 3.0 version of this, not the first two, which were quite different, the biggest problem was the problem the president created for himself through all this extravagant hostile rhetoric towards Muslims. George W. Bush of course, who was president right after 9/11, went out of his way to signal that the United States did not have a quarrel with all Muslims, just the Islamist terrorists. And so I think that commentator you just put up there has a point that the atmospherics around this were terrible.  One of the lessons of this decision is not everything that has terrible atmospherics, that's perhaps even stupid and offensive, is unconstitutional or even in this case, because there was a statutory argument against it, against the statutes either. I don't consider this so much victory or even a vindication, which is the president's other word for this. I think when he got from the Supreme Court today was a rather grudging almost acknowledgment that, OK, you can do this if you insist. There's no rhetoric in any of the majority or concurring opinion say, yes, this is absolutely necessary, et cetera.

In fact, I think the first version of the ban actually would have held up under the decision-making that the court had today.  Another issue where atmospherics was bad, though, is that you had a district court doing an injunction against a national ruling. And this is a trend that we are seeing a lot, particularly during the Trump administration where district courts are thwarting national issues, and Clarence Thomas specifically said in his concurring opinion that this is something that might have to be taken up soon to discuss the legality of it. The fact that this was a five-four decision is also significant because it means that we are getting very narrow decisions based on highly political cases. It is a tremendous argument in favor of those people who did vote for Donald Trump that they were able to get a five-four decision on this and also the decision that forbids the state of California from forcing pro-life groups to advocate for abortion. But the fact that they are five- four decisions means we're going to see this court continue to be a very political issue.",
