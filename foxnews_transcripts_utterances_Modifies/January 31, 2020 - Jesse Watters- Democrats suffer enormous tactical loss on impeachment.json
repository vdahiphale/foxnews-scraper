Yes, the five is here in Miami for the Super Bowl but first let's get into some breaking news because there's a pivotal moment in President Trump's impeachment trial.  House managers and Trump's legal team have wrapped up the debate on witnesses and we are awaiting the statement from Senator Mitch McConnell on how things are going to play out from here. So, let's get the latest from Chad Pergram. Chad?",

They want to have final arguments from the defense counsel, from the impeachment managers. Maybe speeches from senators and how they bring this end for a landing.  That's what's going on right now. And there's negotiation going off -- going on off the Senate floor that's right now we are in this weird quorum call, they're not actually trying to take attendance in the Senate. What they're trying to do is negotiate some sort of an agreement offstage. Now one rumor that was burning through the capitol earlier this afternoon is that there was an agreement that they would postpone a final vote on the verdicts, with both articles of impeachment until next Wednesday. Chuck Schumer, the minority leader says that's not true. Listen.",

One thing I've been told this afternoon, that continuing to conduct the Senate trial here of President Trump while they have State of the Union at the Capitol next Tuesday is a logistical nightmare. And so, they might have to take a pause.   Obviously, there are pressures inside the Democratic caucus to get certain centers running for president to Iowa to campaign. And on the other side of the other disagreement among Republicans on how soon they should wrap this up. You know, senators want to do their due diligence even if it's fait accompli that the president will not be convicted and removed but they want to have their say on the Senate floor. And there is concern that if they lead this out until Wednesday or Thursday there is always another bombshell that might erupt somewhere on Capitol Hill. When you have the votes to move something you move quickly. And that would not be the case here if something comes in over the trends between now and next Wednesday or Thursday, and that's why some Republican senators are pressuring Mitch McConnell right now to say let's get this over with and perhaps vote this weekend.

This was that seminal vote that we were hearing so much about the past couple of days, a gateway vote whether or not they would open the door to call witnesses or not. This is a pretty important vote here because, you know, you had Susan Collins from Maine and Mitt Romney from Utah, Republicans announcing last night that they would, you know, vote for witnesses and you had Lamar Alexander, Republican from Tennessee last night saying he would oppose it, and Lisa Murkowski saying this morning that she would oppose it. So we expect this to go down. What is unclear after this, the Senate is going to take a recess according to the Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, what happens next? It was pretty clear that Mitch McConnell had the votes to block this democratic effort to extend the trial and call witnesses. It's pretty clear that they have the votes down the road to exonerate the President of the United States on both articles of impeachment, but what setup Majority Leader Mitch McConnell lacks right now are votes on how you get from A to C. He lacks the votes on B which is how you finish the trial. Do you have additional debate? How much time do you allocate for the defense counsel and the impeachment managers to present their closing arguments? Emily, that is the key question. And right now there is a problem on the Republican side of the aisle. They don't have the votes for that middle step. And that's why a lot of people think this could go deep into the night. They're trying to negotiate some sort of an agreement off stage. There are senators on the Republican side who want to wrap this tonight saying, wait a minute, we have the votes to exonerate the president. Let's vote now. Why stretch this out through State of the Union. This proposal that was floated earlier in the day, maybe vote on Wednesday, the day after the State of the Union. But what we know now is that this effort to summon witnesses, that's going to go down. That's what they're voting on right now. And then we will have a recess of an undetermined period in the Senate trial as they try to negotiate what's next offstage. That part is very unclear and very murky at this hour, Emily.",

So now at this point, if the Democrats know that the Republicans will prevail on no additional witnesses, why not just try to get it done this weekend?

I'm sure that they were watching the vote on Air Force One a short time ago. Clearly, it was no surprise. They knew that Mick Mulvaney had the votes to turn down witnesses. And it's interesting because the President has said all along, hey, look, I'd like to have witnesses. I'd like to hear from John Bolton. I'd like Mick Mulvaney to testify. I'd like to have Mike Pompeo go up there and tell his story, but I also want to hear from people like Hunter Biden, and the whistleblower, and maybe even Joe Biden. I mean, it was clear that if they were going to be witnesses, that the republicans and the president, in particular, we're going to push for it. Democrats can't just have their witnesses, the White House and the President are going to want to have his witnesses as well. So I mean, this does alleviate a long protracted battle, because I'm sure that there's no way that Pat Cipollone was going to let John Bolton get up there in front of Congress and testify without going through all of the courts. And that could be a lengthy process. That could take place over the course of weeks, if not months. So this is going to alleviate a long drawn out battle. It could go well into the Democratic primary contest. But I think what we're seeing here in the Senate is a no surprise to the White House. I think they're probably pretty happy with the outcome. But as Chad Pergram was saying, now, how do you get to the end. The White House is confident that there are not 67 votes to take the president out. There might be a couple of Republican defections, but that only is going to get you to maybe 50, 51 votes maximum. So certainly not the 67. So President Trump is confident that he's not going to be removed from office. And you -- and you watch because he tweeted about it again today saying that he believed that the process in the house was completely unfair. The Democrats had all the witnesses they want and a lot of it was being closed doors. Some of the transcripts of those closed-door sessions were not released. His team was not allowed any witnesses in the House proceeding. They didn't even have a chance to present its case until it got to the Senate. And that's something that he will definitely focus in on between now and November, and to say that, you know, Republicans are not getting a fair shake out of this process, and then nothing like this should ever happen to another American president. The President will say, Dana, that he's doing this for future presidents, not just himself.",

He said, look, we've been through all of these documents, we've heard all these arguments. We don't think that we need to have witnesses. But I'm going to refer to the final paragraph of this statement here from Mitch McConnell here, and I'm just reading this off my phone because things are happening in real-time here on Capitol Hill. \"Senators will now confer among ourselves with the House managers and with the President's Council to determine the next steps as we prepare to conclude the trial in the coming days, in the coming days.\" This is the first time definitively we've heard something from someone in leadership. You know, the Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell indicating that this is not going to wrap up eminently. I was told earlier in the day that they thought that there was no chance that they would finish this tonight. So the coming days is the key question. Now, again, you know, a couple of hours ago on another program, I was asked whether or not they would consider postponing State of the Union. There's a bit of a logistical issue here for Tuesday. I spoke to one congressional security source who told me that there had been no consideration of that whatsoever, but would not rule it out. You know, here's the other thing, that so much of what we see in politics is very scripted. It's very, you know, kind of wrote and we expect A then B, then C. What we're seeing here at the Capitol tonight is unfolding in real-time. We really don't know how this is going to turn out. We know that probably in a day or two, that they will exonerate the President of the United States on the articles of impeachment. But what happens in the interim? What happens tonight? What happens over the weekend? Who gets to speak? You know, that interim, you know, kind of process is very up in the air and Mitch McConnell nor Chuck Schumer nor any of us can interpret exactly what's going to happen because nobody really knows. Why? It will come down to the votes. They have to figure out some sort of agreement, 51 votes that can pass the Senate to set the remaining framework for this trial and get to final verdict for the President, as Mitch McConnell says, \"in the coming days.\"",

Yes, the five is here in Miami for the Super Bowl but first let's get into some breaking news because there's a pivotal moment in President Trump's impeachment trial. House managers and Trump's legal team have wrapped up the debate on witnesses and we are awaiting the statement from Senator Mitch McConnell on how things are going to play out from here. So, let's get the latest from Chad Pergram. Chad?"

They want to have final arguments from the defense counsel, from the impeachment managers. Maybe speeches from senators and how they bring this end for a landing. That's what's going on right now. And there's negotiation going off -- going on off the Senate floor that's right now we are in this weird quorum call, they're not actually trying to take attendance in the Senate. What they're trying to do is negotiate some sort of an agreement offstage. Now one rumor that was burning through the capitol earlier this afternoon is that there was an agreement that they would postpone a final vote on the verdicts, with both articles of impeachment until next Wednesday. Chuck Schumer, the minority leader says that's not true. Listen."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY)",
      "utterance": "We have stood for one thing. We do not want this rushed through. We do not want it in the dark of night. Members have an obligation to tell the American people and to the people of their states why they are voting. So, we are not -- we are going to use whatever power we have to present it -- prevent it from being rushed through, but right now there is no agreement."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERGRAM",
      "utterance": "And so, we are waiting to see what might come out tonight that will inform us how long they go tonight, how long they go tomorrow and do they may be postpone a vote until after the State of the Union. One thing I've been told this afternoon, that continuing to conduct the Senate trial here of President Trump while they have State of the Union at the Capitol next Tuesday is a logistical nightmare. And so, they might have to take a pause. Obviously, there are pressures inside the Democratic caucus to get certain centers running for president to Iowa to campaign. And on the other side of the other disagreement among Republicans on how soon they should wrap this up. You know, senators want to do their due diligence even if it's fait accompli that the president will not be convicted and removed but they want to have their say on the Senate floor. And there is concern that if they lead this out until Wednesday or Thursday there is always another bombshell that might erupt somewhere on Capitol Hill. When you have the votes to move something you move quickly. And that would not be the case here if something comes in over the trends between now and next Wednesday or Thursday, and that's why some Republican senators are pressuring Mitch McConnell right now to say let's get this over with and perhaps vote this weekend. Dana?"

Listen to this from the Democrats who are saying that the president, even if he is acquitted that they don't think that that would be legitimate if they don't have additional witnesses. Watch."

Why can't Democrats take a page out of that book and lose gracefully? These people have not accepted defeat when Trump won in 2016. They didn't even accept the Mueller report. And now they are saying the Senate trial where he's going to be acquitted that he is not going to be acquitted and it's not a fair trial. I mean, this is like flipping a coin, heads, I win, tails, you lose. My 8- year-old daughters have a better grip on reality than that. You can't accuse this guy of cheating every single time he beats you or else you just look like sore losers. And at the end of this whole thing we got to wrap it up, vote on witnesses, vote to acquit and do what Americans do best. In an election year we debate and then we vote."

You know what drives me crazy, though? How can the meds -- I said the meds -- the media and the Dems always be so outraged when you knew the ending to this? We talked about this, we said this is how it was going to end. This is like leaving the theater after seeing the \"Titanic\" and saying, you didn't tell me this ship was going to sink. Now I'm sad. This is all Kabuki theater. The media and the Dems think you are stupid and that you're going to fall for this even though you knew it ahead of time. Another film analogy, the Dem, this is political stalking. They are stalking the president. This is political stocking.

And then we had Adam Schiff just now on the floor not a little while ago that said, the Dershowitz -- the Dershowitz defense of unconstitutionality. So, we have these people literally attacking the notion that the White House is defending the defendant on trial and they're treating this entire trial, that the jury -- the juror aspect of it as a fact-finding.

And then all of a sudden that didn't matter, and instead they sat on it for four weeks. And so, it's difficult for me to believe anything out of that man's mouth frankly, but especially when it comes to an actual appreciation of or commitment to actual fact-finding or an actual result that makes sense or transparent process in any way possible because this entire thing has been predictable, political game playing."

The Democrats only want their witnesses. They don't want Republican witnesses and that's just not fair. So, to be lectured on fairness from him is ridiculous. And this is why you can't trust Democrats with power. They will abuse it, they will run over the Constitution, they will put up fabricated pieces of evidence, they will lie about it, deceptive articles, bogus subpoenas, and then they'll claim that they knew what the framers wanted. I listened to hours and hours and days and days of testimony from probably some of the smartest litigators I've ever heard in my entire life, and they destroyed the Democrats' defense on the facts. They destroyed on the evidence, precedent, the Constitution and the history of this. These are weak articles, they never should've been set up, this half-baked cake was poisonous. And then are all of a sudden saying the Senate has to swallow it. The Senate doesn't have to do that. The Senate can do whatever it wants. And what the Senate wants to do is get this over with and get onto the 2020 election."

      "utterance": "This is where they take a standard roll call vote in the Senate. This was that seminal vote that we were hearing so much about the past couple of days, a gateway vote whether or not they would open the door to call witnesses or not. This is a pretty important vote here because, you know, you had Susan Collins from Maine and Mitt Romney from Utah, Republicans announcing last night that they would, you know, vote for witnesses and you had Lamar Alexander, Republican from Tennessee last night saying he would oppose it, and Lisa Murkowski saying this morning that she would oppose it. So we expect this to go down. What is unclear after this, the Senate is going to take a recess according to the Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, what happens next? It was pretty clear that Mitch McConnell had the votes to block this democratic effort to extend the trial and call witnesses. It's pretty clear that they have the votes down the road to exonerate the President of the United States on both articles of impeachment, but what setup Majority Leader Mitch McConnell lacks right now are votes on how you get from A to C. He lacks the votes on B which is how you finish the trial. Do you have additional debate? How much time do you allocate for the defense counsel and the impeachment managers to present their closing arguments? Emily, that is the key question. And right now there is a problem on the Republican side of the aisle. They don't have the votes for that middle step. And that's why a lot of people think this could go deep into the night. They're trying to negotiate some sort of an agreement off stage. There are senators on the Republican side who want to wrap this tonight saying, wait a minute, we have the votes to exonerate the president. Let's vote now. Why stretch this out through State of the Union. This proposal that was floated earlier in the day, maybe vote on Wednesday, the day after the State of the Union. But what we know now is that this effort to summon witnesses, that's going to go down. That's what they're voting on right now. And then we will have a recess of an undetermined period in the Senate trial as they try to negotiate what's next offstage. That part is very unclear and very murky at this hour, Emily."

I guess we didn't know on the witnesses, Jesse. I mean, that was in question, but we know the ultimate and which is acquittal. So now at this point, if the Democrats know that the Republicans will prevail on no additional witnesses, why not just try to get it done this weekend? I don't understand their political benefit of dragging it out. WATTERS: Well, when you drag it out, there's an opportunity for more bombshells."

And I just don't see why the Republicans in the Senate, they don't have the votes right now to say let's just wrap it and go. Why don't they just say let's do that get it over with? Why do they have to say oh, well, I want two hours to say something, and then I want another couple of hours to say something? We've already heard from all of these managers. We've heard from the President's defense councils. We don't need to hear from 100 senators to say what they want to say."

And because they don't know the roadmap next, this is why the Senate is now in a recess of an undetermined period. They're going to go off stage and try to figure out what's next. But 51-49, that was the breakdown. And that's kind of what we thought earlier today once we got the announcement from Lisa Murkowski that she would oppose calling witnesses and the announcements last night from Lamar Alexander, Mitt Romney, Susan Collins, and so on. Everything was set in stone. But again, the problem is Mitch McConnell doesn't know how to get to a final vote.

You know, there's a lot of senators even though those who want to extinguish this trial as quickly as possible, who say we are senators, this is an impeachment trial. We have not been given the opportunity to deliberate and speak on the Senate floor. It is our right. I mean, that's the fundamental right of the Senate is unlimited debate. And if you're going to neuter, that you fundamentally change the essence of the Senate.

      "utterance": "Well, he's kind of reveling in the fact that Mitch McConnell has this problem. The problem is not with Democrats, the problem is with Republicans. You know, they have the majority. If you have the majority, move. And so that's the issue right now. And so he's going to talk to his caucus about if they come back into session, what things does he put on the table, what proposals. You might remember that very lengthy session Tuesday night, last week, going into the wee hours of Wednesday, where they considered multiple proposals from Schumer about how to consider this trial, what witnesses to call, talking about calling John Bolton, talking about calling Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House Chief of Staff, you could have a similar, you know, reprise of that in the next few hours if the Senate were to be in session. And this is why McConnell has recessed the Senate so they don't get into that right away. And then you have a lot Senators, some of those vulnerable centers having to take those challenging votes or dragging the Senate down into this quagmire over the next few hours as they fight over this. What they try to do is he's going to go back and say, OK, what are the issues here, what should we be considering? You know, there was a proposal from Dick Durbin, the Democratic whip along with Sherrod Brown from Ohio and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, to allow all senators to have a 10-minute wedge of time to talk, you know, put their positions on the record about the trial, again, because senators have not spoken on the Senate floor during this lengthy trial. And so, you know, Senators think, you know, they represent X number of people in each state. They should at least be able to express their views on the Senate floor in a debate in only the third presidential impeachment trial in Senate history. Some people regardless of whether you think you should impeach the president knighted states or not say, if you don't do that, then what good is the Senate at all if you can't even debate that on the Senate floor?"

      "utterance": "I love to be down there with you in Miami where the President is winging its way toward at least most of the way there. He'll be landing in West Palm Beach pretty soon. I'm sure that they were watching the vote on Air Force One a short time ago. Clearly, it was no surprise. They knew that Mick Mulvaney had the votes to turn down witnesses. And it's interesting because the President has said all along, hey, look, I'd like to have witnesses. I'd like to hear from John Bolton. I'd like Mick Mulvaney to testify. I'd like to have Mike Pompeo go up there and tell his story, but I also want to hear from people like Hunter Biden, and the whistleblower, and maybe even Joe Biden. I mean, it was clear that if they were going to be witnesses, that the republicans and the president, in particular, we're going to push for it. Democrats can't just have their witnesses, the White House and the President are going to want to have his witnesses as well. So I mean, this does alleviate a long protracted battle, because I'm sure that there's no way that Pat Cipollone was going to let John Bolton get up there in front of Congress and testify without going through all of the courts. And that could be a lengthy process. That could take place over the course of weeks, if not months. So this is going to alleviate a long drawn out battle. It could go well into the Democratic primary contest. But I think what we're seeing here in the Senate is a no surprise to the White House. I think they're probably pretty happy with the outcome. But as Chad Pergram was saying, now, how do you get to the end. The White House is confident that there are not 67 votes to take the president out. There might be a couple of Republican defections, but that only is going to get you to maybe 50, 51 votes maximum. So certainly not the 67. So President Trump is confident that he's not going to be removed from office. And you -- and you watch because he tweeted about it again today saying that he believed that the process in the house was completely unfair. The Democrats had all the witnesses they want and a lot of it was being closed doors. Some of the transcripts of those closed-door sessions were not released. His team was not allowed any witnesses in the House proceeding. They didn't even have a chance to present its case until it got to the Senate. And that's something that he will definitely focus in on between now and November, and to say that, you know, Republicans are not getting a fair shake out of this process, and then nothing like this should ever happen to another American president. The President will say, Dana, that he's doing this for future presidents, not just himself."

      "speaker": "PERGRAM",
      "utterance": "Yes. So Mitch McConnell just put out a statement about that vote that went down rejecting witnesses. He said, look, we've been through all of these documents, we've heard all these arguments. We don't think that we need to have witnesses. But I'm going to refer to the final paragraph of this statement here from Mitch McConnell here, and I'm just reading this off my phone because things are happening in real-time here on Capitol Hill. \"Senators will now confer among ourselves with the House managers and with the President's Council to determine the next steps as we prepare to conclude the trial in the coming days, in the coming days.\" This is the first time definitively we've heard something from someone in leadership. You know, the Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell indicating that this is not going to wrap up eminently. I was told earlier in the day that they thought that there was no chance that they would finish this tonight. So the coming days is the key question. Now, again, you know, a couple of hours ago on another program, I was asked whether or not they would consider postponing State of the Union. There's a bit of a logistical issue here for Tuesday. I spoke to one congressional security source who told me that there had been no consideration of that whatsoever, but would not rule it out. You know, here's the other thing, that so much of what we see in politics is very scripted. It's very, you know, kind of wrote and we expect A then B, then C. What we're seeing here at the Capitol tonight is unfolding in real-time. We really don't know how this is going to turn out. We know that probably in a day or two, that they will exonerate the President of the United States on the articles of impeachment. But what happens in the interim? What happens tonight? What happens over the weekend? Who gets to speak? You know, that interim, you know, kind of process is very up in the air and Mitch McConnell nor Chuck Schumer nor any of us can interpret exactly what's going to happen because nobody really knows. Why? It will come down to the votes. They have to figure out some sort of agreement, 51 votes that can pass the Senate to set the remaining framework for this trial and get to final verdict for the President, as Mitch McConnell says, \"in the coming days.\""

It's like when you're dealing with a drug addict, who says no, no, I change I swear, I change. No, this story has been the same. We knew how the vote was going to go. We know how it's going to go next week or the week after that because we know the kernel. The nugget of this story is that it was initiated three years ago, right? This quixotic adventure is not about a phone call. It was about the day Hillary lost. So we all know that. What we're being forced to participate in is the Democrats version of revenge porn. And that's why it is so exhausting to be sitting here and listening every day to this and then have to feel bad for the viewers who had to sit through this crap."

      "utterance": "So well said, Greg. I'm not going to spike the football, Juan, because I don't want to do that. I'm not a Showboat. Democrats just suffered an enormous tactical loss right then on the floor of the Senate. We know how it ends from now. This is a strategic retreat by the Democrats. They're still trying to empty their clips, but it's pretty much done. McConnell has guided this thing through the system very well, very methodically, very maturely, a little bit of a speed bump here, but I'm sure he's kind of -- kind of bring the boat to home. Now, this now looks more than ever, like this whole impeachment thing was a move to protect Joe Biden. Trump had zeroed in on his family's corruption. They tried to knock him out at the knees. It went all the way up to the Senate trial, and then we get an acquittal. And you have to look at yourself and think this thing backfired, because now everybody's talking about where is Hunter. Everybody understands Joe quid pro Joe is his new nickname, not sleepy anymore. His crowd size is microscopic at this point, and Bernie Sanders is surging in Iowa. So it did not go as planned. And my only thing now is what do the Democrats do next? You know, they boycotted the inauguration, they teed up a special counsel investigation, they tried to impeach the president, he gets acquitted. What are they going to do in the second term? I mean, they handled the first loss so terribly. What happens with a landslide? I'm scared, Juan, hold me."

I know because I can see that on the Republican side right now, Mitch McConnell scorched earth strategy to protect the president that clearly it's no longer the GOP, it's the party of Trump, and they are protecting Trump at all --no holds barred. Let's just protect Donald Trump. They couldn't get to Republicans right now to say shut down a fair trial, no witnesses, so that's why the two broke away. They could -- but remember, the American people and Democrats couldn't get four to simply say, let's have a fair trial, let's have some witness."

What will they look like with a ticket led by Donald Trump where they have to defend the fact that they allowed the Senate, the institution to suffer such damage, that they allowed the American people to be diluted that John Bolton is off the charts. Everybody around, Donald Trump goes down. And they say, oh, we got to protect Donald Trump."

      "utterance": "Right, because while this is all going on, he's actually earning the paycheck that he donates whereas everyone else on the Hill, they are not earning the paychecks that we pay and that our tax dollars pay. I think we're so far beyond strategy at this point. We're so far beyond tactics. It's just ego. The ego of -- the ego of Schumer, especially in those comments right there, where he's basically saying that he has zero faith in his fellow senators. It was their prerogative and their assessment during that vote to determine whether they needed additional evidence to vote and to move on those articles of impeachment. The votes said enough. So why all of a sudden when it suits them versus the political process, and then all of a sudden, oh, no, it's a trial that we see mirrored in actual courts, and therefore witnesses are a must. But there was zero discussion of evidence. I think the GOP has extended a generous amount of patience, but it's not infinite. And so to your point about just around the corner, and just around the corner, and what about this, at one point, is it going to end? The statement we just saw right there in the vote, it ends now."
