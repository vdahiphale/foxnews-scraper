      "sentences": "All right. Welcome to “Hannity.” We have two huge, massive breaking news stories on the deep state.  One, how incontrovertible, exculpatory evidence was purposefully withheld from the FISA court. The evidence is in. That blockbuster news and Peter Strzok's hidden testimony released tonight. We've got all the details.  We begin with other news. The system was rigged. Now, countless students who apply to Georgetown, USC, Stanford, Yale, all these other top universities were likely cheated out of their spot because in this case, it is a zero sum game all because dozens, perhaps now as many as 800 I'm reading wealthy families selfishly made massive payments to this man right here, named Rick Singer, in order to fix a SAT score, bribe official college boards people, and steal spots reserved for student athletes.  They never played the sport. They even went as far as to photoshop the pictures of the faces of these kids and put them on the bodies of real athletes. That's how far this went. Now, a $5 million class action lawsuit has been filed against eight of these universities on the basis that certain students were cheated out of a spot because of the university's failure to prevent the scam. Others are claiming well damages asserting that their Stanford University degrees have been irreparably damaged and devalued.  Either way this is not a good look for some of America's quote prestigious universities which allowed massive corruption to fester at some of the highest levels. Now one of the most notable people charged in this ongoing scandal was \"Full House\" actress Lori Loughlin, as you can see there paying $500,000 bribes to fraudulently secure spots at USC for her two daughters. And when Loughlin was arrested, one of her daughters apparently was spending spring break on board a yacht owned by USC's board of trustees' chairman Rich Caruso.  The system in this case appears to be rigged. We give every person the presumption of innocence.   But think about the people that work hard, the students that study, they get the A's, play by the rules, earn them. Then, you have a bunch of people only care about status and bragging rights and those spots are taken. We'll have more on this later tonight. But, first, we have other breaking news out of Chicago before we get to our top story. Jussie Smollett was back in court today. He pled not guilty to those 16 felony charges, stemming from an elaborate hate crime hoax scheme and found guilty. Smollett could face up to 48 years in prison, forced to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars in fines. Now, this comes as we are now learning that a former top aide to former First Lady Michelle Obama urged the Chicago Police Department to turn over the case to the FBI. Of course that never happened and now all eyes are directly on Smollett who was allegedly defrauding the city of Chicago from the very beginning, all while dragging Trump supporters through the mud.   Now, before we get to our top story, I want to focus on “Hannity” watch. The radical 2020 Democratic candidates, yet another Democrat has jumped into the race. This case being former Congressman Robert Francis \"Bozo\" O'Rourke. That's what I call him. He's flailing his way into the race this week, literally telling \"Vanity Fair\" that he was born to run for president. How regal. Needless to say, Bozo got off to a hot start in Iowa. Take a look.",

      "sentences": "Maybe we should make it the legal drinking age. All right. We'll have more on this the radical ways the Democrats are trying to reshape America. Very dangerous times.   First, let's get to our top story, major huge breaking news. We begin our “Hannity” watch tonight on the deep state. Trump, Russia collusion is, has always been and remains a myth. And the highest ranking member of the FBI knew it. Breaking just moments ago, according to \"The Hill's John Solomon who will join news a minute, there is now evidence that the Trump campaign associates George Papadopoulos and Carter Page both made exculpatory statements at the very beginning, the very start of the FBI's Russia probe back in 2016.  Now, according to Solomon, both men made comments to the FBI informant Stephan Halper, making it clear they were never involved. They had no knowledge of any collusion whatsoever. Zero. Nothing.  The FBI pressed forward anyway. Possibly hiding that exculpatory evidence from the all important FISA court where we know a fraud was committed. In fact, Halper's account was never presented to the court. That's FISA abuse. That's fraud before a FISA court. That's prosecutorial misconduct. That is an effort by a few high ranking bureaucrats to undermine Donald Trump and his allies and, frankly, help steal an election. It's the biggest abuse of power, corruption scandal in modern history and it is now the house of cards is beginning to fall.   Tonight, we have other major breaking news. Last week, it was Bruce Ohr. Last night, it was Lisa Page. Now, we have the full transcript from Peter Strzok's testimony on the Hill, again, courtesy Georgia Congressman Collins, thank you.  This is a huge development. For context, let's remember Peter Strzok virulently, anti-Trump, pro-Hillary Clinton, FBI investigator. He is involved in every single role here, every integral role in both the FBI's Clinton investigation, wait a minute, matter and the subsequent probe into the Trump campaign. And Strzok helped author Hillary's exoneration letter, and he was among the agents who later interviewed Hillary. He says he knew he was in the room when they took out the words from the DOJ -- oh, gross negligence, the legal standard oh, reckless disregard.  And, remember, they added the new stature of intent, Lisa Page told us last night this went right in to Loretta Lynch's office, all of it. What did she know? When did she know it?  What did she tell Obama? What did know? When did he know it? At the same time he was texting his FBI girlfriend Lisa Page that Hillary would win and should win 100 million to zero. Trump supporters were smelly Walmart people. That Trump was deplorable, even vowed to stop Trump and so much more.  We are talking about hundreds of graphic anti-Trump pro-Hillary texts. And now according to Strzok's foreign testimony, we now know that Obama's DOJ led by Loretta Lynch corroborating the testimony of Lisa Page entered into an agreement with the FBI, actually restricting the FBI access to Hillary Clinton's emails during their so-called investigation, including emails related to the Clinton Foundation and according to Strzok, I'll quote him, my recollection is that access to those emails were based on consent that was negotiated between the Department of Justice attorneys and the counsels for Clinton. Puts a lot of light on that tarmac meeting with Bill and Loretta Lynch, doesn't it? And Strzok even commented that there was an even an extensive filter in place to work through the various consent agreements with Team Clinton. In other words, let me break it down. The FBI's investigation was controlled from the very top of Obama's Department of Justice. Let me say it again -- the top.   In other words, this was never a real investigation. The people involved in it are now telling us. In other words, it's now gone from oh, Peter Strzok, Lisa Page, Comey, McCabe and others to oh, Loretta Lynch herself, to the head of the DOJ. The outcome, they made sure was never in doubt.  Now, I wonder if Roger Stone got a consent agreement when the FBI raided his house predawn raid with, you know, navy frogs and amphibious vehicles and 16 vehicles and 27 men armed, you know, in the dark of night, predawn raid, with CNN cameras. Meanwhile, Strzok also confirmed that the language in Clinton's exoneration letter was in fact changed, as I said, from gross negligence which is the legal definition, in the law. They changed it to extreme carelessness at the behest, again, of the DOJ and their attorneys who were working for Loretta Lynch on behalf, clearly, of Hillary Clinton. Strzok testified: My recollection is attorneys brought it up and that these, of course, were DOJ attorneys.   This is yet more damning evidence that Obama's DOJ literally rigged the investigation from the beginning so that Hillary Clinton could continue as a presidential candidate when even the number one general counsel at the FBI argued she should be charged with a felony of the Espionage Act. They guaranteed that she can continue without facing any criminal charges. Or as Lindsey Graham put it earlier today on the Senate floor, anyone else -- you, me, everybody else -- we don't have equal (ph) justice under the law in this country anymore. We'd be in jail.

One supporting the person they wanted to win and one out to get the person they wanted to lose.

      "sentences": "Well said, Senator Graham. Good for you. If America has an equal justice under the law system, equal application under our laws, a special counsel into the Clinton's crimes that were rigged will be appointed by the new attorney general immediately. And, of course, while the FBI gave Hillary a free pass, Mueller special counsel investigation into the Trump campaign, that was tainted. We now know from the get-go, from day one, from the beginning.  Remember, when Strzok texted that his work on the Russia collusion investigation, remember it was an insurance policy? Well, he couldn't really explain any of that away. The excuses were beyond weak and pathetic.  Obviously, he had incentive to take down Trump at all costs. Remember, Hillary should win 100 million to zero.  When Robert Mueller appointed him as a lead investigator as a special counsel probe, was he ever asked about his obvious political bias? No, according to Strzok's testimony never. Mueller didn't care, didn't inquire about the known political bias, an investigation into a political campaign. That's probably why I have been warning everybody about Mueller. And he hired, of course, Hillary Clinton's former Clinton Foundation attorney, Jeannie Rhee, or the fact that Andrew Weissmann actually attended Hillary Clinton's election night party, it never happened.  But breaking tonight, in a sign that we are nearing the end of the witch- hunt, Andrew Weissmann is now stepping away from team Mueller. Maybe time to investigate him. I guess he is not happy that the witch-hunt is going to come up short of their goal. And here with more is \"The Hill's\" John Solomon, Ohio Congressman Jim Jordan, and author of the number one bestseller, \"The Russian Hoax: The Illicit Scheme to Clear Hillary Clinton and Frame Donald Trump\", now in paperback. Let's start, John Solomon, with you and your breaking news. This is amazing. Papadopoulos and Page, exculpatory information was withheld from the FISA court on top of what we know?",

You can see in Pete Strzok how the FBI took evidence of criminality, the negligent handling of email turned it into exoneration, and then took the innocence of innocence and turned it into a criminal investigation against Donald Trump. It's extraordinary.  What we learned is that these two men, the two focuses, George Papadopoulos and Carter Page, the people on whom they opened up the entire Russia collusion investigation were captured talking to an FBI informant in making exculpatory statements, spontaneous admissions of innocence. They did not meet with Russia. They did not hack emails with the Russians and, in fact, they said they would consider that treasonous, wouldn't be involved in it. Multiple statements of innocence, no evidence that was told to the FISA court. It's important to note these statements of innocence occurred in August and September of 2016, one month before the first FISA warrant was issued.",

      "utterance": "All right. Welcome to “Hannity.” We have two huge, massive breaking news stories on the deep state. One, how incontrovertible, exculpatory evidence was purposefully withheld from the FISA court. The evidence is in. That blockbuster news and Peter Strzok's hidden testimony released tonight. We've got all the details. We begin with other news. The system was rigged. Now, countless students who apply to Georgetown, USC, Stanford, Yale, all these other top universities were likely cheated out of their spot because in this case, it is a zero sum game all because dozens, perhaps now as many as 800 I'm reading wealthy families selfishly made massive payments to this man right here, named Rick Singer, in order to fix a SAT score, bribe official college boards people, and steal spots reserved for student athletes. They never played the sport. They even went as far as to photoshop the pictures of the faces of these kids and put them on the bodies of real athletes. That's how far this went. Now, a $5 million class action lawsuit has been filed against eight of these universities on the basis that certain students were cheated out of a spot because of the university's failure to prevent the scam. Others are claiming well damages asserting that their Stanford University degrees have been irreparably damaged and devalued. Either way this is not a good look for some of America's quote prestigious universities which allowed massive corruption to fester at some of the highest levels. Now one of the most notable people charged in this ongoing scandal was \"Full House\" actress Lori Loughlin, as you can see there paying $500,000 bribes to fraudulently secure spots at USC for her two daughters. And when Loughlin was arrested, one of her daughters apparently was spending spring break on board a yacht owned by USC's board of trustees' chairman Rich Caruso. The system in this case appears to be rigged. We give every person the presumption of innocence. But think about the people that work hard, the students that study, they get the A's, play by the rules, earn them. Then, you have a bunch of people only care about status and bragging rights and those spots are taken. We'll have more on this later tonight. But, first, we have other breaking news out of Chicago before we get to our top story. Jussie Smollett was back in court today. He pled not guilty to those 16 felony charges, stemming from an elaborate hate crime hoax scheme and found guilty. Smollett could face up to 48 years in prison, forced to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars in fines. Now, this comes as we are now learning that a former top aide to former First Lady Michelle Obama urged the Chicago Police Department to turn over the case to the FBI. Of course that never happened and now all eyes are directly on Smollett who was allegedly defrauding the city of Chicago from the very beginning, all while dragging Trump supporters through the mud. Now, before we get to our top story, I want to focus on “Hannity” watch. The radical 2020 Democratic candidates, yet another Democrat has jumped into the race. This case being former Congressman Robert Francis \"Bozo\" O'Rourke. That's what I call him. He's flailing his way into the race this week, literally telling \"Vanity Fair\" that he was born to run for president. How regal. Needless to say, Bozo got off to a hot start in Iowa. Take a look."

In other words, they want to increase the number of court justices, illegally reshape the court. We're going to have more in a mini monologue featuring everything you know -- need to know about Robert Francis O'Rourke that the left wing, destroy, hate Trump media mob will never tell you, including the time he almost killed somebody during a DUI hit and run incident. And we'll show you what President Trump has to say about, well, Bozo's decision to run.

      "utterance": "Maybe we should make it the legal drinking age. All right. We'll have more on this the radical ways the Democrats are trying to reshape America. Very dangerous times. First, let's get to our top story, major huge breaking news. We begin our “Hannity” watch tonight on the deep state. Trump, Russia collusion is, has always been and remains a myth. And the highest ranking member of the FBI knew it. Breaking just moments ago, according to \"The Hill's John Solomon who will join news a minute, there is now evidence that the Trump campaign associates George Papadopoulos and Carter Page both made exculpatory statements at the very beginning, the very start of the FBI's Russia probe back in 2016. Now, according to Solomon, both men made comments to the FBI informant Stephan Halper, making it clear they were never involved. They had no knowledge of any collusion whatsoever. Zero. Nothing. The FBI pressed forward anyway. Possibly hiding that exculpatory evidence from the all important FISA court where we know a fraud was committed. In fact, Halper's account was never presented to the court. That's FISA abuse. That's fraud before a FISA court. That's prosecutorial misconduct. That is an effort by a few high ranking bureaucrats to undermine Donald Trump and his allies and, frankly, help steal an election. It's the biggest abuse of power, corruption scandal in modern history and it is now the house of cards is beginning to fall. Tonight, we have other major breaking news. Last week, it was Bruce Ohr. Last night, it was Lisa Page. Now, we have the full transcript from Peter Strzok's testimony on the Hill, again, courtesy Georgia Congressman Collins, thank you. This is a huge development. For context, let's remember Peter Strzok virulently, anti-Trump, pro-Hillary Clinton, FBI investigator. He is involved in every single role here, every integral role in both the FBI's Clinton investigation, wait a minute, matter and the subsequent probe into the Trump campaign. And Strzok helped author Hillary's exoneration letter, and he was among the agents who later interviewed Hillary. He says he knew he was in the room when they took out the words from the DOJ -- oh, gross negligence, the legal standard oh, reckless disregard. And, remember, they added the new stature of intent, Lisa Page told us last night this went right in to Loretta Lynch's office, all of it. What did she know? When did she know it? What did she tell Obama? What did know? When did he know it? At the same time he was texting his FBI girlfriend Lisa Page that Hillary would win and should win 100 million to zero. Trump supporters were smelly Walmart people. That Trump was deplorable, even vowed to stop Trump and so much more. We are talking about hundreds of graphic anti-Trump pro-Hillary texts. And now according to Strzok's foreign testimony, we now know that Obama's DOJ led by Loretta Lynch corroborating the testimony of Lisa Page entered into an agreement with the FBI, actually restricting the FBI access to Hillary Clinton's emails during their so-called investigation, including emails related to the Clinton Foundation and according to Strzok, I'll quote him, my recollection is that access to those emails were based on consent that was negotiated between the Department of Justice attorneys and the counsels for Clinton. Puts a lot of light on that tarmac meeting with Bill and Loretta Lynch, doesn't it? And Strzok even commented that there was an even an extensive filter in place to work through the various consent agreements with Team Clinton. In other words, let me break it down. The FBI's investigation was controlled from the very top of Obama's Department of Justice. Let me say it again -- the top. In other words, this was never a real investigation. The people involved in it are now telling us. In other words, it's now gone from oh, Peter Strzok, Lisa Page, Comey, McCabe and others to oh, Loretta Lynch herself, to the head of the DOJ. The outcome, they made sure was never in doubt. Now, I wonder if Roger Stone got a consent agreement when the FBI raided his house predawn raid with, you know, navy frogs and amphibious vehicles and 16 vehicles and 27 men armed, you know, in the dark of night, predawn raid, with CNN cameras. Meanwhile, Strzok also confirmed that the language in Clinton's exoneration letter was in fact changed, as I said, from gross negligence which is the legal definition, in the law. They changed it to extreme carelessness at the behest, again, of the DOJ and their attorneys who were working for Loretta Lynch on behalf, clearly, of Hillary Clinton."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Strzok testified",
      "utterance": "My recollection is attorneys brought it up and that these, of course, were DOJ attorneys. This is yet more damning evidence that Obama's DOJ literally rigged the investigation from the beginning so that Hillary Clinton could continue as a presidential candidate when even the number one general counsel at the FBI argued she should be charged with a felony of the Espionage Act. They guaranteed that she can continue without facing any criminal charges. Or as Lindsey Graham put it earlier today on the Senate floor, anyone else -- you, me, everybody else -- we don't have equal (ph) justice under the law in this country anymore. We'd be in jail. Take a look."

One supporting the person they wanted to win and one out to get the person they wanted to lose.

      "utterance": "Well said, Senator Graham. Good for you. If America has an equal justice under the law system, equal application under our laws, a special counsel into the Clinton's crimes that were rigged will be appointed by the new attorney general immediately. And, of course, while the FBI gave Hillary a free pass, Mueller special counsel investigation into the Trump campaign, that was tainted. We now know from the get-go, from day one, from the beginning. Remember, when Strzok texted that his work on the Russia collusion investigation, remember it was an insurance policy? Well, he couldn't really explain any of that away. The excuses were beyond weak and pathetic. Obviously, he had incentive to take down Trump at all costs. Remember, Hillary should win 100 million to zero. When Robert Mueller appointed him as a lead investigator as a special counsel probe, was he ever asked about his obvious political bias? No, according to Strzok's testimony never. Mueller didn't care, didn't inquire about the known political bias, an investigation into a political campaign. That's probably why I have been warning everybody about Mueller. And he hired, of course, Hillary Clinton's former Clinton Foundation attorney, Jeannie Rhee, or the fact that Andrew Weissmann actually attended Hillary Clinton's election night party, it never happened. But breaking tonight, in a sign that we are nearing the end of the witch- hunt, Andrew Weissmann is now stepping away from team Mueller. Maybe time to investigate him. I guess he is not happy that the witch-hunt is going to come up short of their goal. And here with more is \"The Hill's\" John Solomon, Ohio Congressman Jim Jordan, and author of the number one bestseller, \"The Russian Hoax: The Illicit Scheme to Clear Hillary Clinton and Frame Donald Trump\", now in paperback. Let's start, John Solomon, with you and your breaking news. This is amazing. Papadopoulos and Page, exculpatory information was withheld from the FISA court on top of what we know?"

You can see in Pete Strzok how the FBI took evidence of criminality, the negligent handling of email turned it into exoneration, and then took the innocence of innocence and turned it into a criminal investigation against Donald Trump. It's extraordinary. What we learned is that these two men, the two focuses, George Papadopoulos and Carter Page, the people on whom they opened up the entire Russia collusion investigation were captured talking to an FBI informant in making exculpatory statements, spontaneous admissions of innocence. They did not meet with Russia. They did not hack emails with the Russians and, in fact, they said they would consider that treasonous, wouldn't be involved in it. Multiple statements of innocence, no evidence that was told to the FISA court. It's important to note these statements of innocence occurred in August and September of 2016, one month before the first FISA warrant was issued."

The law requires them to provide the FISA court with any exculpatory evidence, failing to do so can be a crime.

They didn't tell the court that Christopher steel fired by the FBI because he's out leaking information. And now, because of John's reporting, we know they didn't tell the court other exculpatory information about Carter Page and George Papadopoulos. That's a lot not to share with a secret court especially, Sean, when you are getting a warrant to go spy on the other party's campaign. But that is exactly what happened. And that's why you are so right. This has been wrong from the get-go. That's why these investigations are important. And that we do what you said earlier. We have a real single standard in this country. It shouldn't be two standards. It shouldn't be just one set of rules for us regular folk and a different set if your name is Clinton, Comey, Lynch, Learner (ph), Page, Strzok.

Also, tonight, after launching massive lawsuits against The Washington Post, CNN, an attorney for Covington High School student Nicholas Sandmann telling Fox News, lawsuits are on deck for the Associated Press, for HBO, I would assume, Bill Maher and NBC. Joining me now with reaction, Relatable podcast host, Allie Beth Stuckey; Fox News contributor, Mike Huckabee. Governor, you and I both share a passion and love of Israel. And this Prime Minister has been as good with moral clarity than any I've seen in my lifetime. And I hope he gets reelected. You've been to Sderot, you've been to Gaza, you've seen the tunnels, you've made the tours. Such a small area that they must defend. They do not have defensible borders."

Well, who did? A Boy Scout troop? I mean, who has the capacity to launch rockets towards Tel Aviv? This is a bunch of terrorists. I'm so frustrated that a lot of people in the American media and in the U.N. don't understand that Israel is under attack constantly by a group that by anybody's definition is not a country, it's not a government, it's a terrorist organization. Israel has to fight back. It's their only way."

We can see through it. And it's why Donald Trump is going to be reelected next year. The frustration with the media, the fact they don't want to be told who to vote for, they're not going to believe the hype about a Beto or Kamala Harris, it's just not going to work. And as they continue to go to the left, as they continue to insult as they did with Paul Begala, he might as well have been Louis Farrakhan talking because it's the kind of language Farrakhan uses."

Meantime, actress Lori Loughlin, who is accused of cheating her kids into USC, has been dropped by the Hallmark Channel. Her 19-year-old daughter, Olivia Jade, has been dropped by Sephora makeup, and it appears neither of Loughlin's daughters will return to USC for fear of being bullied. And speaking of top access, when Jussie Smollett was still considered a victim, (inaudible), and a former senior aide to Michelle Obama, reportedly reached out to Chicago's top prosecutor Kim Foxx, requesting the investigation be turned over to the FBI. Foxx responded, \"Spoke to Superintendent Johnson, that's Chicago's top cop. I convinced him to reach out to the FBI to ask that they take over the investigation.\" Smollett family member got the same message and responded, \"Oh, my God, this would be a huge victory.\" Foxx recused herself before Smollett was charged. Today, Jussie Smollett pleaded guilty - or not guilty to 16 felony counts and the feds confirmed they are also investigating him for mail fraud. Sean."

Joining us now with reaction, Fox News contributor, Rachel Campos-Duffy, and Fox News Correspondent-at-large, Geraldo Rivera. Geraldo, you're looking at this. It's pretty extensive. I mean, you have a very sophisticated scheme. Tests are taken. Photoshopping pictures of your kid and putting them on athlete's bodies and posting it. The schools have a way of determining - all right. Did the kid play the sport or not play the sport? Because most have rankings and stuff like that."

      "utterance": "It's awful that college admissions is just another scam open to the highest bidder. It's really - it's pathetic. It's nauseating. My dad was one of 17 children. He was the first one in that huge crew to go to high school. He always preached. My mother, one of eight, first one to go to high school in her family, always preached education to us kids. I was the first in my family of five to go to college, in my case, community college, because college was the great equalizer. College was the way even if you started off in the modest place, you could be anybody with a college education. And to see how people are buying these admissions to the elite schools, it's so disheartening. I feel sorry in a way for the kids whose lives have been ruined by their parents' eagerness to cheat, but it's just been a very unsavory chapter."

And that meant that I - I went to school a year, dropped out because I ran out of money to work. Went to school a year, dropped out until I had more money to work. And I eventually did it little over three years. And everyone that goes to college loves their colleges, loves them. It's competitive. You've got to have the goods or else you're not going to survive. And this is a zero-sum game. There's only X number of slots. That's why this is difficult for most people to comprehend. They didn't care about the person that lost the slot."

      "speaker": "RACHEL CAMPOS-DUFFY, CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Well, that's absolutely right. And listen, the idea, as Geraldo said, of getting an education is the American dream. And the American dream is based on the idea of equal opportunity. And that means that you can't game the system. And I think that what's interesting is, the school - the backlash has been intense. It's been harsh. I think the schools' reputations have suffered from it. And hopefully they will police for this corruption. But I think the bigger story here, Sean, is that there are other legal ways to game the system. If your daddy is rich and buys the library, you can get in. And also, there's a diversity racket that gives people an advantage as well."
