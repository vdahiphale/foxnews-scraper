One which was border security, one which was national defense against terror, which are these guys, and then you have law and order, the domestic leg of this. So this is -- this is what he's good at. But there's another part of this and -- something like this space force will sound comical like the way SDI was comical, but it wasn't. SDI was not -- it was a serious Reaganesque idea, it was Reagan idea that people laughed at, but he was talking basically about protection, security. Space force, the reason why it's important is it shows you that Trump is a long-term thinker and he's ready to basically give up being popular in the short run for long-term ideas. So his ideas generally like the wall, those are long- term. That's for the future. The hypersonic systems, the nukes, when he's talking about -- these are -- his long-term ideas for the long-term safety long after he's gone. And it's so funny when the left always talks about, oh, it's for the children. It's for the children. Everything he talked about right there is for the children.",

He landed at 4 a.m. He found out he was fired for sure in a tweet at 9 a.m., speaks to the president at noon. And then when he comes to the podium, it was almost like he was reluctant. He was somebody who did not want to be in Washington. He took great pleasure in reminding everybody he was not from Washington. He didn't want to be part of it. He didn't like the whole aspect of it. And then as he's speaking, you start to realize, you know what? Maybe he was really sort of starting to really respect the work the career foreign officials were doing. He's talked a lot about them.  But he had one fatal flaw. And that is that he had lost the confidence of the president.

But there's another part of this and -- something like this space force will sound comical like the way SDI was comical, but it wasn't. SDI was not -- it was a serious Reaganesque idea, it was Reagan idea that people laughed at, but he was talking basically about protection, security. Space force, the reason why it's important is it shows you that Trump is a long-term thinker and he's ready to basically give up being popular in the short run for long-term ideas. So his ideas generally like the wall, those are long- term. That's for the future. The hypersonic systems, the nukes, when he's talking about -- these are -- his long-term ideas for the long-term safety long after he's gone.

He landed at 4 a.m. He found out he was fired for sure in a tweet at 9 a.m., speaks to the president at noon. And then when he comes to the podium, it was almost like he was reluctant. He was somebody who did not want to be in Washington. He took great pleasure in reminding everybody he was not from Washington. He didn't want to be part of it. He didn't like the whole aspect of it. And then as he's speaking, you start to realize, you know what? Maybe he was really sort of starting to really respect the work the career foreign officials were doing. He's talked a lot about them. But he had one fatal flaw. And that is that he had lost the confidence of the president. And around the country and the world, excuse me, once you see that there might be daylight between a secretary of state and a president, that's it. You have to go. And so there will be a smooth transition now as Mike Pompeo from the CIA comes over to the State Department. He and the president will have to show, and I think they well, a united front from the get-go."

We all remember the moron comment, which was a two- to three-day story, which was hard to get over. But I mean, he's a great patriot and a great man and a great businessman and a great leader. But they're going to have great leadership at State. And I love this woman. I believe her name is Gina Haspel, who's now going to lead the CIA. And, you know, people are saying that she was in charges of these black sites where there was torture that was happening. She was just following orders. She didn't design the interrogation program.

She still lives in a world where you don't see actual people, just the group they belong to. And so she looked at the audience and only saw \"them.\" I wonder what they saw looking back.
