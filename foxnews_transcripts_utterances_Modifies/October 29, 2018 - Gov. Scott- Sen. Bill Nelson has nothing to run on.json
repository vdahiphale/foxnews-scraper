      "sentences": "And welcome to \"Hannity.\" Terror strikes Pennsylvania. Over the weekend, a vile anti-Semitic racist murdering 11 people, injuring six more during what is literally a baby- naming ceremony at a Pittsburgh synagogue. Hate crimes charges have been filed against the monster responsible, who should be punished to the fullest extent of the law.  And predictably and sadly, without skipping a beat, the mainstream media and their friends on the left are once again twisting the strategy and literally rushing to politicize this tragedy. Now, when we thought it couldn't get any worse -- well, they are now blaming president Trump for the senseless actions of a madman who actually hates President Trump.  Now, we're going to show you the most despicable coverage of the weekend's attacks, including a new low for CNN and humpty dumpty. And we are also going to call out to a glaring double standard of the media surrounding the Democratic Party, their love fest with radical racist anti-Semite Louis Farrakhan and others.  And with just eight days to go into the midterms, we have a brand-new undercover Project Veritas video. We will debut right here on the show, showing just how radical -- and we always knew she was radical -- Arizona Senate candidate Kyrsten Sinema really is. And we'll give you updates on so many of the races across the country, so many important elections. They are neck and neck as we now head towards the finish line. It's your choice this election. Not the media's, not the pollsters. All right. Sit tight. A lot of news. Time for our breaking news opening monologue.",

This is the deadliest attack against Jewish community on American soil in our history. President Trump immediately condemned this heinous act of evil over the weekend.   Let's take a look.",

As president, he deported a known Nazi death camp guard, even after President Obama failed to do so. And he is the most pro-Israel president since, well, the U.N. partition plan, 1947-'48. Even moving finally the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to its rightful capital, Jerusalem, a promise made by many past presidents, never fulfilled.

In Washington, and The Washington Post, Dana Milbank writing, quote, Trump's America is not a safe place for Jews. Also in The Post, an editor writing that Trump has, quote, stoked the fears of those like Bowers, and according to a columnist in New York Times, quote, Trump has flirted with the deepest racists and Nazis and it has not gone unnoticed, least of all by then.  This is beyond despicable, beyond low, beyond disgusting, obviously in the lead up to an election. Not only is President Trump historically supportive of the Jewish community and Israel, but the monster responsible for Saturday's act, they tend to omit this, of terror, actually hated Donald Trump. Why? In large part for being so close to our closest friends and allies in Israel. Robert Bowers postings online about his contempt for the president and the fact that he has this close alliance with Israel.   Still, the mainstream media's coverage was even worse on air as they tried to spike some type of political football over a story that is so serious, so horrific, fake news CNN, a GQ correspondent, on their network, actually said President Trump was worse than ISIS.

They refuse to tell the truth about what my loud positions have been against all violence, purposely lying about my positions. Over and over again, go back to the Kavanaugh hearings, it's been recalling for security of every American regardless of their political opinions, constantly denouncing violent actions. You have heard me say this a million times. America's issues must be addressed at the ballot box, saying over and over again, and I have posted the tapes on Hannity.com, when Barack Obama was president, we must protect America's presidents.  And, by the way, I even said I would physically defend CNN reporters or anyone else if I saw any physical act of aggression against them, and I meant it. You know, if you call out lies, call fake news for what it is, if you point out a political agenda under the guise of so-called news, that is not a call for violence. It is a simple, fundamental truth. The media doesn't want to hear it. There is a reason the American people are chanting \"CNN sucks!\"  They are earning that chant, literally minute-by-minute, second by second, 24/7, hatred of all things Trump! Of course, the media's purposely lying and it's downright reckless. It's irresponsible. You know what?

By the way, prior to Obama's run for president, this photo was purposely hidden from we the people, for eight years when Obama was president. And just a few weeks ago, Farrakhan actually appeared on stage, this is a few weeks ago. Look who is there? Bill Clinton, beloved by the Democratic Party, Al Sharpton, Jesse Jackson.  Then there is the DNC deputy chairman, Minnesota candidate for attorney general, Keith Ellison. He wants reportedly work for Farrakhan and allegedly met with the hate preacher several times since. Now, sadly, the Democrats' radical ties don't stop at Farrakhan. The far left activist Linda Sarsour, she actually issued public support for the Muslim Brotherhood, Sharia law, praised also Farrakhan's Nation of Islam.  And she blamed the Jewish, quote, media for her negative image. And despite this, she was honored by the Obama White House as a champion of change in 2011. And more recently, she introduced Democratic Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York at a rally. By the way, you won't hear about any of this from the mainstream media.  Why? Well, it's eight days before an election. The media desperately wants the Democratic Party to win the midterms. They want to Trump to lose. The gloves for them are off. There is nothing they will not say or do to help the Democrats win. They have a political agenda. They always have, since day one, they have hated Trump. The day he came down the escalator. They will stop at nothing to vilify those they disagree with while shielding all of those they support. This is the same reason you want to hear about the constant stream of violent acts that we have covered on this program carried out by left-wing mobs against conservatives. By the way, CNN says you can't call them mobs.  And recently, gunshots were actually fired into a Florida GOP campaign office. Thank God no one was hurt. And meanwhile also in Florida, a man there has just been arrested for threatening to kill a Republican congressman. At a rally for Republican Senate candidate, Marsha Blackburn, with Lindsey Graham this weekend, multiple members of the let's angry mob dragged out by security after trying to derail her event.  And in the lead-up to the midterms, so many serious acts of violence and incivility have been documented, two local Republicans punched in Minnesota, one a woman, another cold-cocked from behind, had a concussion.  GOP campaign manager in Nevada was also assaulted, threatening packages purportedly containing ricin were sent to, let's see, President Trump, Secretary of Defense Mattis, FBI Director Wray, CIA Director Haspel. We know what happened with the president's son, Don Jr. He was targeted with a suspicious package sent to his home, forcing his ex-wife to become hospitalized. A truck with a Trump bumper sticker, well, that was set on fire. So many prominent Republicans have been run out of restaurants, airports, and more. And I've almost been saying daily and nightly, all of this has got to stop.  While every person definitely is responsible for his or her own actions, we have been calling for calm, peace, security. Americans can settle their differences at the ballot box in eight days. Violence is not an acceptable answer to any political disagreement. By the way, Hillary says we can't be civil. Eric Holder says kick ‘em. And we've had far worse. What, Maxine Waters saying create a crowd, followed them into restaurants, department stores, grocery stores? Create a crowd, tell them they are not wanted anywhere anymore. Eight days from now, you, we the people have a chance to settle our differences in a peaceful, Democratic way. And tonight, we have so many updates from so many important races around the country, including even more shocking developments out of Arizona tonight. Remember, we first showed you Democratic Senate hopeful Kyrsten Sinema calling Arizona the meth lab of democracy, calling Arizonans, who she was to vote for her, crazy. That the state was famous but only in a Lindsay Lohan kind of way. She once said it was okay for Americans to go fight with the Taliban after 9/11? Arizona, think about that tonight. And Sinema even once promoted an event at Arizona State University featuring a radical lawyer who represented the blind sheik. And meanwhile, Martha McSally, her Republican opponent, 28 years of service, six tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan, while Sinema was leading as, quote, McSally said, anti-war protesters with a pink tutu on.  Now, it gets even worse. We have tonight exclusively video from projectveritas.com. Sinema campaign staffers caught on tape, openly admitting just how far left she really is, and they are now hiding it from the voters in Arizona. Just take a look at the footage. You decide.",

This is the most radical crop of Democrats to ever seek elected office.  There are no more moderates. Remember Claire McCaskill, Missouri, now pretending, she was caught on tape admitting support for a widespread gun restriction by Project Veritas, taking a very different public stance.  Thankfully, Republican Josh Hawley is now surging.  Tennessee Republican Marsha Blackburn taking up momentum over Phil Bredesen after people for him said that he was just lying to the people of Tennessee about his support for Kavanaugh and his campaign referred to people in Tennessee as ignorant, the people they want voting for him. North Dakota, Heidi Heitkamp also caught by Project Veritas on tape. Her campaign admitting on video that while she campaigned as a moderate, she, like every other Democrat, he's really just another far left Schumer senator. And other Republicans were also gaining momentum around the country. Look at West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, now, aw two-point lead against incumbent Joe Manchin. Remember, Joe was against the tax cut, supports Obamacare. John James in Michigan now a chance. It's outside, but he was down 20.  He's only down six against Debbie Stabenow. And if you look at Republican Rick Scott, he is tied neck and neck, 46 each, with Bill Nelson down in Florida. Governor Scott has been great for the state of Florida. He will join us tonight along with Ron DeSantis, who is running for governor. Meanwhile, Republican Mike Braun in Indiana, he is now beginning to build a lead over incumbent Democrat Joe Donnelly. If you are in Indiana, remember, a vote for the libertarian is pretty much a vote for Donnelly. And Democrat Jon Tester, he's feeling heat in Montana, still holds a slight lead.  And even Democrat Bob Menendez is in the fight for his life, believe it or not, in New Jersey. Granted, it's an outside shot, but he's within the margin of error. The New York Post now releasing a blistering editorial, telling voters to oust this corrupt senator. And over in the House, according to Real Clear Politics, Republicans now are projected to keep at least 200 seats, Democrats, 205. That means Republicans are down. That means control of the House and whether Nancy Pelosi becomes a speaker comes down to 30 toss-up states and most toss ups are being held by Republicans. I listed them all at hannity.com. So, we are eight days away from the midterms. That balance of power rests in your hands. Democratic Party, their agenda is, what, impeach the president, they want their crumbs back, rescind the tax cuts, they want Obamacare, how did that work out for you? They want to block Supreme Court nominees, they want open borders, they want to eliminate ICE, sanctuary cities, and, by the way, launch every investigation into Trump they can ever think of. Tonight, there are three potential outcomes. Republicans can maintain control of both the House and pick up seats in the Senate. That's option one. Option two, Republicans, it will be a split decision. Nancy Pelosi becomes speaker, but Republicans pick up the seats in the Senate. Finally, the final outcome, the Democrats take both the House and Senate.  Pelosi and Schumer leading the way. God, help us if it is the latter. You have the power to shock the world.

Over the weekend, a vile anti-Semitic racist murdering 11 people, injuring six more during what is literally a baby- naming ceremony at a Pittsburgh synagogue. Hate crimes charges have been filed against the monster responsible, who should be punished to the fullest extent of the law. And predictably and sadly, without skipping a beat, the mainstream media and their friends on the left are once again twisting the strategy and literally rushing to politicize this tragedy. Now, when we thought it couldn't get any worse -- well, they are now blaming president Trump for the senseless actions of a madman who actually hates President Trump. Now, we're going to show you the most despicable coverage of the weekend's attacks, including a new low for CNN and humpty dumpty. And we are also going to call out to a glaring double standard of the media surrounding the Democratic Party, their love fest with radical racist anti-Semite Louis Farrakhan and others. And with just eight days to go into the midterms, we have a brand-new undercover Project Veritas video. We will debut right here on the show, showing just how radical -- and we always knew she was radical -- Arizona Senate candidate Kyrsten Sinema really is.

As president, he deported a known Nazi death camp guard, even after President Obama failed to do so. And he is the most pro-Israel president since, well, the U.N. partition plan, 1947-'48. Even moving finally the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to its rightful capital, Jerusalem, a promise made by many past presidents, never fulfilled. Israeli Prime Minister, well, Bibi Netanyahu just thanked President Trump for his leadership and condolence letter to the Pittsburgh community and the Jewish community in America.

In Washington, and The Washington Post, Dana Milbank writing, quote, Trump's America is not a safe place for Jews. Also in The Post, an editor writing that Trump has, quote, stoked the fears of those like Bowers, and according to a columnist in New York Times, quote, Trump has flirted with the deepest racists and Nazis and it has not gone unnoticed, least of all by then. This is beyond despicable, beyond low, beyond disgusting, obviously in the lead up to an election. Not only is President Trump historically supportive of the Jewish community and Israel, but the monster responsible for Saturday's act, they tend to omit this, of terror, actually hated Donald Trump. Why? In large part for being so close to our closest friends and allies in Israel. Robert Bowers postings online about his contempt for the president and the fact that he has this close alliance with Israel. Still, the mainstream media's coverage was even worse on air as they tried to spike some type of political football over a story that is so serious, so horrific, fake news CNN, a GQ correspondent, on their network, actually said President Trump was worse than ISIS.

They refuse to tell the truth about what my loud positions have been against all violence, purposely lying about my positions. Over and over again, go back to the Kavanaugh hearings, it's been recalling for security of every American regardless of their political opinions, constantly denouncing violent actions. You have heard me say this a million times. America's issues must be addressed at the ballot box, saying over and over again, and I have posted the tapes on Hannity.com, when Barack Obama was president, we must protect America's presidents. And, by the way, I even said I would physically defend CNN reporters or anyone else if I saw any physical act of aggression against them, and I meant it. You know, if you call out lies, call fake news for what it is, if you point out a political agenda under the guise of so-called news, that is not a call for violence. It is a simple, fundamental truth. The media doesn't want to hear it. There is a reason the American people are chanting \"CNN sucks!\" They are earning that chant, literally minute-by-minute, second by second, 24/7, hatred of all things Trump! Of course, the media's purposely lying and it's downright reckless. It's irresponsible. You know what? If something happened to me, think about that, under other Fox News employee, by that twisted standard and paradigm, they would be held responsible. And with all due respect to a lot of people, I have likely had more threats against me in my career than any one of them, real threats to me, to my family, to people that work for me.

We were like a lone voice here when Democrats and their connections to some of the most despicable, racist, anti-Semites in America today, let's go for one example.

Farrakhan, by God's grace, has pulled a cover off of that satanic Jew. Call me an anti-Semite. Stop it. I'm anti-termite."

      "utterance": "Now, that disgusting hatemonger, racist, anti-Semite, has been revered by many top Democrats. Here he is smiling, posing for a picture with former President Barack Obama. By the way, prior to Obama's run for president, this photo was purposely hidden from we the people, for eight years when Obama was president. And just a few weeks ago, Farrakhan actually appeared on stage, this is a few weeks ago. Look who is there? Bill Clinton, beloved by the Democratic Party, Al Sharpton, Jesse Jackson. Then there is the DNC deputy chairman, Minnesota candidate for attorney general, Keith Ellison. He wants reportedly work for Farrakhan and allegedly met with the hate preacher several times since. Now, sadly, the Democrats' radical ties don't stop at Farrakhan. The far left activist Linda Sarsour, she actually issued public support for the Muslim Brotherhood, Sharia law, praised also Farrakhan's Nation of Islam.  And she blamed the Jewish, quote, media for her negative image. And despite this, she was honored by the Obama White House as a champion of change in 2011. And more recently, she introduced Democratic Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York at a rally. By the way, you won't hear about any of this from the mainstream media.  Why? Well, it's eight days before an election. The media desperately wants the Democratic Party to win the midterms. They want to Trump to lose. The gloves for them are off. There is nothing they will not say or do to help the Democrats win. They have a political agenda. They always have, since day one, they have hated Trump. The day he came down the escalator. They will stop at nothing to vilify those they disagree with while shielding all of those they support. This is the same reason you want to hear about the constant stream of violent acts that we have covered on this program carried out by left-wing mobs against conservatives. By the way, CNN says you can't call them mobs.  And recently, gunshots were actually fired into a Florida GOP campaign office. Thank God no one was hurt. And meanwhile also in Florida, a man there has just been arrested for threatening to kill a Republican congressman. At a rally for Republican Senate candidate, Marsha Blackburn, with Lindsey Graham this weekend, multiple members of the let's angry mob dragged out by security after trying to derail her event. And in the lead-up to the midterms, so many serious acts of violence and incivility have been documented, two local Republicans punched in Minnesota, one a woman, another cold-cocked from behind, had a concussion.  GOP campaign manager in Nevada was also assaulted, threatening packages purportedly containing ricin were sent to, let's see, President Trump, Secretary of Defense Mattis, FBI Director Wray, CIA Director Haspel. We know what happened with the president's son, Don Jr. He was targeted with a suspicious package sent to his home, forcing his ex-wife to become hospitalized. A truck with a Trump bumper sticker, well, that was set on fire. So many prominent Republicans have been run out of restaurants, airports, and more. And I've almost been saying daily and nightly, all of this has got to stop.  While every person definitely is responsible for his or her own actions, we have been calling for calm, peace, security. Americans can settle their differences at the ballot box in eight days. Violence is not an acceptable answer to any political disagreement. By the way, Hillary says we can't be civil. Eric Holder says kick ‘em. And we've had far worse. What, Maxine Waters saying create a crowd, followed them into restaurants, department stores, grocery stores? Create a crowd, tell them they are not wanted anywhere anymore. Eight days from now, you, we the people have a chance to settle our differences in a peaceful, Democratic way. And tonight, we have so many updates from so many important races around the country, including even more shocking developments out of Arizona tonight. Remember, we first showed you Democratic Senate hopeful Kyrsten Sinema calling Arizona the meth lab of democracy, calling Arizonans, who she was to vote for her, crazy. That the state was famous but only in a Lindsay Lohan kind of way. She once said it was okay for Americans to go fight with the Taliban after 9/11? Arizona, think about that tonight. And Sinema even once promoted an event at Arizona State University featuring a radical lawyer who represented the blind sheik. And meanwhile, Martha McSally, her Republican opponent, 28 years of service, six tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan, while Sinema was leading as, quote, McSally said, anti-war protesters with a pink tutu on. Now, it gets even worse. We have tonight exclusively video from projectveritas.com. Sinema campaign staffers caught on tape, openly admitting just how far left she really is, and they are now hiding it from the voters in Arizona. Just take a look at the footage. You decide."

      "utterance": "Somehow polls show Sinema still neck and neck with McSally. The people of Arizona need to ask themselves, who do you want representing you?  A war hero who supports the president, put her life on the line for her country, and for all of you in Arizona? Or somebody think that's okay to join the Taliban and thinks you're crazy? A radical left-wing activist who has far left views and clearly act hatred for the people of her own state? This is the most radical crop of Democrats to ever seek elected office.  There are no more moderates. Remember Claire McCaskill, Missouri, now pretending, she was caught on tape admitting support for a widespread gun restriction by Project Veritas, taking a very different public stance.  Thankfully, Republican Josh Hawley is now surging. Tennessee Republican Marsha Blackburn taking up momentum over Phil Bredesen after people for him said that he was just lying to the people of Tennessee about his support for Kavanaugh and his campaign referred to people in Tennessee as ignorant, the people they want voting for him. North Dakota, Heidi Heitkamp also caught by Project Veritas on tape. Her campaign admitting on video that while she campaigned as a moderate, she, like every other Democrat, he's really just another far left Schumer senator. And other Republicans were also gaining momentum around the country. Look at West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, now, aw two-point lead against incumbent Joe Manchin. Remember, Joe was against the tax cut, supports Obamacare. John James in Michigan now a chance. It's outside, but he was down 20.  He's only down six against Debbie Stabenow. And if you look at Republican Rick Scott, he is tied neck and neck, 46 each, with Bill Nelson down in Florida. Governor Scott has been great for the state of Florida. He will join us tonight along with Ron DeSantis, who is running for governor. Meanwhile, Republican Mike Braun in Indiana, he is now beginning to build a lead over incumbent Democrat Joe Donnelly. If you are in Indiana, remember, a vote for the libertarian is pretty much a vote for Donnelly. And Democrat Jon Tester, he's feeling heat in Montana, still holds a slight lead. And even Democrat Bob Menendez is in the fight for his life, believe it or not, in New Jersey. Granted, it's an outside shot, but he's within the margin of error. The New York Post now releasing a blistering editorial, telling voters to oust this corrupt senator. And over in the House, according to Real Clear Politics, Republicans now are projected to keep at least 200 seats, Democrats, 205. That means Republicans are down. That means control of the House and whether Nancy Pelosi becomes a speaker comes down to 30 toss-up states and most toss ups are being held by Republicans. I listed them all at hannity.com. So, we are eight days away from the midterms. That balance of power rests in your hands. Democratic Party, their agenda is, what, impeach the president, they want their crumbs back, rescind the tax cuts, they want Obamacare, how did that work out for you? They want to block Supreme Court nominees, they want open borders, they want to eliminate ICE, sanctuary cities, and, by the way, launch every investigation into Trump they can ever think of. Tonight, there are three potential outcomes. Republicans can maintain control of both the House and pick up seats in the Senate. That's option one. Option two, Republicans, it will be a split decision. Nancy Pelosi becomes speaker, but Republicans pick up the seats in the Senate. Finally, the final outcome, the Democrats take both the House and Senate.  Pelosi and Schumer leading the way. God, help us if it is the latter. You have the power to shock the world.

I can't imagine the level of anxiety and concern that that puts those individuals and their family. This should be a time of healing this should be a time of concern. Instead, we see this finger pointing. Mostly in the direction of President Trump trying to figure out how much blame we can assign to him. As opposed to comforting those who were injured or who lost loved ones in Pittsburgh. This should be a time when we come together as an American and talk about how great we are as a country.

      "utterance": "And joining us now, Florida Republican gubernatorial candidate, Ron DeSantis who would like to replace Rick Scott. You know, I'm looking at your opponent, if you don't mind me going through. Supported by Bernie Sanders, which is interesting. Financed by all of these rich billionaires on the far, far left. A 40 percent increase in the corporate tax rate he supports. Wants to eliminate stand your ground. Against all of the president immigration policies, wants to abolish ICE, and supports the impeachment of Trump and he is corrupt. Didn't he take free tickets from the FBI undercover guys?"

      "utterance": "yes, from an undercover agent posing as c contractor with the city. But then the lobbyist who arrange that junket also paid for Gillum to go and have this luxury stay in Costa Rica which is worth about $1,000. And then what happened was Mayor Gillum turned around and gave that same lobbyist a contract with the city for $2 million. So, it's quintessential pay to play municipal corruption. And by the way, that undercover FBI agent, new documents that came out the other day, he actually under-wrote a Gillum fund-raiser for $4,300. Gillum never disclosed that but these documents prove it. So, there is now doubt that there's corruption in Tallahassee. It is one of the most corrupt cities in Florida. It also has the highest crime rate in Florida. And this is a guy who has taken a pledge attacking our men and women in law enforcement. He will not standby them."

If you got a 40 percent increase in your business taxes, you're not going to have anybody coming into Florida. They're all going to leave to friendlier tax states."

And all of the flow of investment that we're prime to get particularly on the heels of the federal tax bill in getting rid of the SALT that will come to a screeching halt. But here is the thing, Sean. He would raise more taxes than just that. That's just what he's touting you--"

You can help Republicans win back the House and Senate or just pick up seats in the Senate, lose the House, split decision, or it could be really bad day. I don't even want to think about that.
