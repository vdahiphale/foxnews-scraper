The company took a hit in the stock market but bounced back. The airlines quickly pointed out that they don't have too many in service. Southwest saying they had eight planes in their daily flights, American Airlines, 24 operating 85 flights, United Airlines, nine planes, roughly 40 flights per day. But the Boeing CEO releasing a statement saying this is an abundance of caution. Obviously, a lot of concern about safety.  Let's bring in our panel, start there, Tom Bevan, Real Clear Politics co- founder and president, national security analyst Morgan Ortagus, and Mo Elleithee, executive director of the Georgetown Institute of Politics. There was some criticism early on that the U.S. was late to the game here after Canada said they are going to ground the planes as well. Some people pointed to the defense secretary being a former CEO of Boeing. However, this move today clearly cautionary.",

I can unveil reveal the cover of my next book in the presidential three days series, \"Three Days at the Brink, FDR's Gamble to Win World War II.\" It tells the story of a secret meeting that essentially won the war, a now forgotten conference in Tehran where President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, and Joseph Stalin plotted the war's end game, including the D-Day invasion. We have all kinds of new nuggets from that meeting, and then bounce back from that to how FDR got to that point, much like we did in the Eisenhower and Reagan three days book before this. \"Three Days at the Brink\" will be out in October.

      "utterance": "I don't think there is any defense of Paul Manafort here, and I don't really care how he was called. He was caught for illegal activity that seems to have taken place over decades. And when someone like that is brought to justice, I think it is a good day for America and a good day for everyone. There is a lot of talk as it relates to the Russia aspect that he was briefing the U.S. embassy in Ukraine on his activities. And really I think what his lawyers are throwing out here is just a lot of red herrings. It is not the embassy's objective to police foreign registration, and that is really what he is getting in trouble for here. So he clearly continues to have his day in court, especially at a state level, and his problems are not going away."

But if the standard is now we are going to prosecute people FARA violations and we're going to drain the swamp, let's do it, because there are 50 or 100 Paul Manaforts running around Washington doing the exact same thing. And so if that is the new standard, let's go ahead and drain the swamp."

Even staunch supporters of the president are urging him not to do it, if for no other reason than the political optics look bad, if for no other reason. And back to your earlier point, Bret, I think that is absolutely right and why the state charges are going to be so important to see how that plays out, because of the president can't do anything. He can pardon him on all the federal stuff but he can't touch the state stuff. And Paul Manafort has some bad stuff there, too."

John Ratcliffe, representative, saying \"Lisa Page confirmed to me under oath that the FBI was ordered by the Obama DOJ not to consider charging Hillary Clinton for gross negligence in the handling of classified information.\" Getting this testimony, Tom, is significant. It seems to open up a lot of other questions."

    {
      "speaker": "BEVAN",
      "utterance": "It is -- yes. This testimony happened last summer. Why are we just seeing it now? President Trump tweets out, there's more to come, more to come. He has the power to declassify all this stuff and make it available, be transparent. All he has to do is use his power. He could do it today. He could do it tomorrow. He could do it right now. So I don't understand why it's taking so long for all this stuff to come to light. The American public, this has been going on for a long, long time, and we need to know as much as we can."

    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",

      "speaker": "ORTAGUS",
      "utterance": "When the story of the history is written of all of this, Lisa Page is going to be such a fascinating and integral character in this. Look at the number of people, Comey, McCabe, Strzok, all of these people. She is giving Congressional testimony to counter them, to contradict them. And they are all in trouble multiple times over, some of them from your interviews with them, Bret, for not completely telling the truth. So pay attention to Lisa Page. She is taking down some of the biggest names in the FBI."

      "speaker": "ELLEITHEE",
      "utterance": "I don't think -- if what she says is true, I don't think this is the first time that prosecutors have gone to law enforcement and said I'm not sure what you have got gets us enough to prosecute. That happens all the time in the justice system. So I don't know. Based on what I have read, whether it is that or something more. I would suspect more of the former. What we have seen from Lisa Page is plenty of testimony now that says there really wasn't any bias by the FBI. That there was some folks out there that were out to get Donald Trump and there were folks there that were out to get Hillary Clinton. Maybe not out to get, but certainly had opinions on it. She said, we've got these opinions. We do our job. And I think that is worth noting."

      "utterance": "Governor Gavin Newsom in California essentially ending the death penalty in that state after a referendum was on the ballot in November, 2016, asking this question. It was called California proposition 62 about repealing the death penalty, yes, repeal it, there you see, no, don't repeal it. The president getting in this, tweeting today, \"Defying voters, the governor of California will halt all death penalty executions of 737 stone cold killers. Friends and family of the always forgotten victims are not thrilled, and neither am I!\" Just so you know, the death penalty in America, the yellow states on this map, these are states with the death penalty. The greenish are states with a gubernatorial moratorium, and the others are states without the death penalty. And there you see the breakdown. We're back with the panel. Quickly, Mo, interesting move by Governor Newsom?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ELLEITHEE",
      "utterance": "Yes. Look, it ultimately doesn't change very much in California, which has been under a court ordered moratorium since I think 2006. So there hasn't been an execution there. But it does send a message. And I thought the governor's approach was interesting. It was not, I have the death penalty. It was one of empathy for the victims while also saying, we cannot have a system that could, that could end up, as is statistically showng, execute innocent individuals. And I think that is something that a lot of people can understand."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ORTAGUS",
      "utterance": "That is true, but I think there is a legislative process for all of this that if you are morally opposed to the death penalty that you can go without undoing jury decisions that were offered by the American people, by the people in California. That is inherently not democratic. So I think that is the problem. You look at the victims, as Mo mentioned today, I didn't hear a lot of understanding in the victim's voices. I heard a lot of angry."

    {
      "speaker": "BEVAN",
      "utterance": "Yes, I'm sure it does. But this to me was phony. He stood up there and said I cannot execute 737 people, I can't do that. To Mo's point, California hasn't executed anyone in 12 years. So he was offering a solution in search of a problem, not to mention it violated the will of the voters from the referendum. And he stood up there and said this is my right as governor, my right as governor. I found it to be just totally political and potentially, if he is thinking about running for president at some point in the future, but I think it will be injected into the 2020 discussion."

And Janice caught that moment that she found out on camera today."

      "utterance": "Congrats. That is a really big moment. I'm happy for Janice. This honestly could not happen to a nicer person. She really is that great, and the book is a fantastic, optimistic read about life. Tonight, I also have some big book news as well. I can unveil reveal the cover of my next book in the presidential three days series, \"Three Days at the Brink, FDR's Gamble to Win World War II.\" It tells the story of a secret meeting that essentially won the war, a now forgotten conference in Tehran where President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, and Joseph Stalin plotted the war's end game, including the D-Day invasion. We have all kinds of new nuggets from that meeting, and then bounce back from that to how FDR got to that point, much like we did in the Eisenhower and Reagan three days book before this. \"Three Days at the Brink\" will be out in October. I'm excited about that. Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight. That's it for the “Special Report,” fair, balanced, and still unafraid.
