You knew that was going to happen. Now, I guess, facts don't matter as long as you are morally right. I mean, Left. All right. More than that this moment, plus we count down the most outrageous moments from the media this week, Mollie Hemingway and Jeff Lord are here. They're going to dissect it all for us. And individual ICE agents are being sued by illegal aliens and liberal advocacy groups, you cannot make this up, just for doing their jobs. And a former agent is here to sound off -- and is he mad.  But first rage versus results, and the great Democrat freak out, that's the focus of tonight's “Angle”.  Being a liberal means never having to say you're sorry. An overstatement? Well, maybe. But given some of the more recent politically inspired acts of vandalism and violence and of defamation and libel, it's closer to the truth than not.  10 years ago, even five years ago, it would have been unthinkable that major political and media figures would bend over backwards to excuse criminal behavior, because they agreed with the perpetrators' political motivation. Yet in this age of rage, this happens all too frequently.",

When water cannons and dogs were released on civil rights marchers, when children were blown up in churches? Trump hating comedians undeterred by actual facts are suddenly aggressively unfunny. Comedian Billy Eichner saying, \"If it turns out the attack was staged, that is disgusting. But don't give me any BS about MAGA supporters being the victim here. A bunch of white supremacists falsely accused of inspiring a crime are still a bunch of white supremacist. They poison the soul of our country and of the world and their crimes against humanity will be felt long after we've forgotten about Jussie Smollett\".  Crimes against humanity, OK. Billy like what? Policies that grow the economy and spur wage and job growth across the board, including for African-Americans, that crime against um humanity or the crime against humanity of creating, what, Opportunity Zones in some of our most debilitated communities? Or is it the crime of criminal justice reform, that's a crime against humanity?   You see what I'm saying? It's patently ridiculous. But this is all very enlightening, is it not? Because here's what's really happening, Trump's policies are actually working. We see it all around us. The Mueller report, it looks like it's going to be a dud and liberal heroes are self-combusting before our very eyes, so the Democrat Protectorate are in total freak-out mode. Let's look back. The Kavanaugh accuser Blasey Ford flamed out. Their indigenous 2020 hopeful, Elizabeth Warren, was knocked off her high horse. Virginia's Democrat leaders are tangled up in blackface and MeToo scandals. And now with Smollett their dream of the perfect Trump inspired hate crime has also fizzled.  So now we're back to Donald Trump being Hitler, Pol Pot and Stalin all rolled into one, that's the best they have. And while they mild the requisite, \"If Jussie did it\" -- and this is wrong -- well, they quickly then revert to their tired old narrative that today minorities should live in fear.  Comedian Hari Kondabolu tweeting, \"What Jussie Smollett is accused of is despicable. However, don't forget that we believed he was the victim of such horrendous hate crime, because it's the type of thing that happens way too often, especially in the Trump era. He may have taken advantage of a very realistic fear\". And the queen of racial fear-mongering, mad Maxine Waters, she freely admits.

What the President has that -- who has done more for black Americans than any other President in the history of the presidency. People like Jussie Smollett and the Left -- because that's the only thing that they can sell, is to keep black people on their side, is to keep using fear, racism and division.  And then they trying to make Jussie the victim, when a reality -- he belongs in jail. He's the reason why blacks are hating whites, and white to hating blacks. When a reality, we have a sitting President just like you saw yesterday at the White House that is doing way more for black Americans and people of color in the history of the presidency of the United States of America.

Here now, Art Arthur of the Center for Immigration Studies, and immigration attorney Gunther Sanabria. Gunther, as Claude just explained, this was not an illegal immigration raid. This was authorized according to the facts that they had, mostly it looks like it was financial crimes involved. This kind of part and part of what you do. You see problems on site, you have to detain individuals and find out what's going on.",

He is saying, quote, \"My dear departed grandmothers as well as my deceased parents must be turning in their grave right now to see their families name, reputation, and proud Jamaican identity being connected in any way, jokingly or not, with the fraudulent stereotype of the pot smoking joy-seeker, and in the pursuit of identity politics.\" Awkward. Family squabble aside, Kamala is tapping into the wide acceptance of marijuana in the country, and she thinks she's going to get political juice from embracing it. And more states and more politicians look to line their pockets with the revenue from marijuana legalization. Joining me now is Alex Berenson. I had Alex on the podcast a couple weeks ago. I got a huge reaction. He's a former \"New York Times\" reporter. Get this, he's the author of a new book, you've got to read this. It's called \"Tell Your Children, The Truth about Marijuana, Mental Illness and Violence.\" Alex, people think \"New York Times\" reporter, former current, doesn't matter, why would he write a book about the dangers of marijuana. So here's the question. Why the heck did you? ALEX BERENSON, FORMER \"NEW YORK TIMES\" REPORTER: It was really my wife who encouraged me to write the book. She is a psychiatrist. She deals with the criminally mentally ill. And she would tell me, she'd come home from her job at a forensic hospital which is really where they send the criminally insane, and she would tell me about case after case where people had committed horrible crimes under the in fact or who had become schizophrenic after years of using. And, in my grand knowledge, I would say to her, that sounds like \"Reefer Madness.\" That is not true. That can't be real. And she is the one who trained at Harvard and Columbia. She's the one who sees these people every day. She said to me, you know what, maybe you should look at the studies yourself. And when I did, I was shocked at the strength of the science showing that marijuana is linked to mental illness. It is linked to psychosis, and then psychosis, which is a break from reality, is linked to crime.",

Policies that grow the economy and spur wage and job growth across the board, including for African-Americans, that crime against um humanity or the crime against humanity of creating, what, Opportunity Zones in some of our most debilitated communities? Or is it the crime of criminal justice reform, that's a crime against humanity? You see what I'm saying? It's patently ridiculous. But this is all very enlightening, is it not? Because here's what's really happening, Trump's policies are actually working. We see it all around us. The Mueller report, it looks like it's going to be a dud and liberal heroes are self-combusting before our very eyes, so the Democrat Protectorate are in total freak-out mode. Let's look back. The Kavanaugh accuser Blasey Ford flamed out. Their indigenous 2020 hopeful, Elizabeth Warren, was knocked off her high horse. Virginia's Democrat leaders are tangled up in blackface and MeToo scandals. And now with Smollett their dream of the perfect Trump inspired hate crime has also fizzled. So now we're back to Donald Trump being Hitler, Pol Pot and Stalin all rolled into one, that's the best they have. And while they mild the requisite, \"If Jussie did it\" -- and this is wrong -- well, they quickly then revert to their tired old narrative that today minorities should live in fear. Comedian Hari Kondabolu tweeting, \"What Jussie Smollett is accused of is despicable. However, don't forget that we believed he was the victim of such horrendous hate crime, because it's the type of thing that happens way too often, especially in the Trump era. He may have taken advantage of a very realistic fear\". And the queen of racial fear-mongering, mad Maxine Waters, she freely admits. She believed Jussie's ridiculous story because his views checked all the liberal boxes."

Joining me now with reaction two men who were at the White House event with President Trump last night, Pastor Mark Burns and Pastor Darrell Scott along with Ari Fleischer, Former White House Press Secretary and a Fox News Contributor. Pastor Burns, I'm going to start with you. The narrative in the wake of the Smollett case is already set, right? It's, he may have lied, but Trump is still a racist. So your reaction to the event just the past week and the fact that the President got virtually no coverage of, what by all accounts, was an amazing event last night."

Listen, I said it on Twitter, I'm a saying it here on your show. Its people like Jussie Smollett is the reason why -- one of the reasons why our nation is still so racially divided. What the President has that -- who has done more for black Americans than any other President in the history of the presidency. People like Jussie Smollett and the Left -- because that's the only thing that they can sell, is to keep black people on their side, is to keep using fear, racism and division. And then they trying to make Jussie the victim, when a reality -- he belongs in jail. He's the reason why blacks are hating whites, and white to hating blacks. When a reality, we have a sitting President just like you saw yesterday at the White House that is doing way more for black Americans and people of color in the history of the presidency of the United States of America. It is foolish, it is preposterous and it's got to quit. And matter of fact, black people are getting tired of hearing the same old racists story--"

People might not look like every Tweet or might be upset about this comment or that comment over the past two and a half, three years. But the policies, Pastor, are working. And it's stunning.

But that the political divide is hiding behind -- the Left is hiding behind race to feel this political divide. And the truth of the matter is, the Left hasn't had anything to be outraged over in a long time. And so they're you know they can't get outraged over criminal justice reform. They can't get outraged over prison reform. They can't get outraged over low unemployment and historic levels of unemployment for African-Americans. They can't get outraged over the Opportunity Zone Act and an urban revitalization. So they have to either dig up something old or try to manufacture something new, because they need this outrage to fuel their base so they can try to unseat this President. They're even outraged over a Mueller report now that hasn't even come out yet. They're mad about it. They're ready to sit new -- they're ready they indict Mueller now, because Mueller is not siding with them. It's crazy, it's ridiculous."

The first year it was a little harder to get a huge -- but now it's oversubscribed, because people are seeing the fruits of what Trump's economic policies are actually accomplishing for all Americans, especially the most underprivileged and that blue-collar middle class.

And then you nailed it, when you said that, Democrats worse fear is he does better with blacks. Republicans typically lose the black vote 90 to 10. If Republicans -- Donald Trump loses it 85/15 or even 80 to 20, do you realize that will likely shut the Democrats out of the White House permanently if Republicans can make those kind of inroads into their historical overwhelmingly Democratic black community?

No, no, that was a beautiful moment in -- at a time where race relations -- we'll put up the graphic -- race relations are going in the wrong direction here. I want to show everybody this. Blacks and whites, do you think race relations are very good or somewhat good? In 2013 black said 66% thought they were very good, OK? By 2016, the end of Obama's term, they were -- it was down to 49%. In 2018, it's down to 40%. He's doing better among whites with race relations -- question.

President Trump is putting money in the most geographical urban areas that is helping create jobs for black people in this country. Presidents has created the First Step Act. President Trump is overly -- overly showing that he is going to be -- and is the most supportive President of black Americans in this country.

Not that there aren't hate crimes, because there are, and they should be prosecuted. But when the Jussie Smollett case kind of starts collapsing, this is what columnist for the Chicago Tribune are writing. This is Dahleen Glanton. \"Just because one person lied about a racist and homophobic incident, does not let all bigots off the hook. There are real victims here. These angry Trump supporters contend. Although they helped put so-called \"bigot-in-chief\" in the White House, they insist they are being unfairly blamed for forcing America down this treacherous and agonizing road of intolerance\".

They're the ones of resistance and opposition, and Maxine Waters -- mad Maxine is angry and everybody's so angry. They need to take a chill pill, sit back and enjoy this ride, because this President is not only-- Listen, as far as black history is concerned, he's not simply celebrating black history; President Trump is making black history. He's doing historic things in the black community that no other President has ever done. I've lived through 12 Presidents. I was born doing Eisenhower's administration. I said it before, I repeat it again. He's the most Pro black in the sense of being proactive rather than reactive.

The country is a racist country, it's hot, it's anti-Semitic, it's anti- immigrant. It's all very negative. I think Trump's like -- I'm impatient for results.

This group of troops will join the 5,000 active- duty troops already sent to the border. They're set to arrive March 1st.

At least one of the plaintiffs is illegal, but many others are suspected to be as well. The suit names nine federal officials, and, get this, 30 unnamed ICE agents, claiming the workers were targeted, saying in part, quote, \"The officers' goal that day was far more extensive than what the search warrant authorized. They planned to detain and arrest every worker in the plant who was or appeared to be Latino. Joining me now is Claude Arnold, a retired special agent in ICE.

This is a frivolous lawsuit the purpose of which is to deter any individual ICE agents from doing their jobs. And I say that because you will notice they are being sued in their individual capacities. The government isn't being sued. They are being sued in their individual capacities. And there were things that were done very unorthodox in relation to this lawsuit, like researching the agents home addresses and serving them with their lawsuits at their home addresses. These are all intimidation tactics. Normally when an agent gets sued it's served upon government counsel at a government office. It's things like this --"

The investigation was predicated upon suspicious activity reports. It was a financial investigation. Now, the motivation, or part of the financial scheme involved the employment of illegal aliens, so of course, ICE HSI is involved. And of course, they anticipated the possibility that they would encounter illegal aliens at the plant which is why ICE was involved. And of course, their suspicions were proven correct. But they were executing a federal criminal search warrant, signed by a federal judge, and I don't care if you are doing a search warrant for drugs, for financial violations, whatever, you secure the location. You detain all occupants of that location, and you interview them."

Attorneys say it is the first lawsuit filed against a largescale worksite that was conducted by the Trump administration, but I don't remember, again, anger by these same advocacy groups for many of the Obama era raid. When Obama took office, ICE workplace raids from 503 in 2008 to more than 8,000 in 2009. You tell me that these lawsuits aren't politically motivated? Here now, Art Arthur of the Center for Immigration Studies, and immigration attorney Gunther Sanabria. Gunther, as Claude just explained, this was not an illegal immigration raid. This was authorized according to the facts that they had, mostly it looks like it was financial crimes involved. This kind of part and part of what you do. You see problems on site, you have to detain individuals and find out what's going on."

      "speaker": "GUNTHER SANABRIA, IMMIGRATION ATTORNEY",
      "utterance": "Correct, but the problem is how they did it. There were Latinos in there, there were immigrants in there. There were illegal immigrants in there. There were people with papers in there. And why were they not considered victims? If this was a raid and the owner of this business had been charged with poor conditions, abuses, maybe labor law violations, why were there not agents there that spoke Spanish and asked these people if they were victims of any kind of abuse? That's not what happened. They raided the place. They put them in handcuffs. They push them, they shove them, they insult them. And there was even racial slurs thrown in there. So why do we do it this way? That's a problem."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "It's a meat processing plant, so some of the concern, Art, would be that there are a lot sharp pieces of metal around. This is an active factory processing center, lots and lots of knives and other implements. I'm sure if they are worried about all this stuff. I don't carry out these raids, but you don't give someone a subscription to a magazine and say here, can I help you? What else would you like? Would you like a blanket? That's not how it works. It's the real world."

      "speaker": "ART ARTHUR, CENTER FOR IMMIGRATION STUDIES",
      "utterance": "But this is the situation where I think the facts are very much in dispute. I was the sanctions counselor in San Francisco, I had jurisdiction over two-thirds of the state of California. This is completely from what has been alleged, completely the opposite of the way that these audits are carried out. You need reasonable suspicion to stop somebody. You actually need to get a confession or have strong evidence to actually make an arrest of illegal alienage in the United States. So quite frankly, I find the facts of this to be a little bit concerning. I don't necessarily believe the facts. It will come out in court. But the other thing is, there is plainly an officer security issue for the reasons that you stated. This is a meatpacking plant that actually got cited for a number of violations, I believe, thereafter. So quite frankly, anything could have happened. They had to control the situation and they had to do their jobs."

You can see on the surface, are you just pulling -- you're just questioning Latino guys over here, or gals, or whatever they may be, or are you questioning all people, are you stopping all people? That will be key to this case because otherwise it will look like, what, profiling, you're illegal because you are Latino, which is not cool. That is not a cool thing."

    {
      "speaker": "SANABRIA",
      "utterance": "I agree with that. Why not just come in like normal people? Every time they raid a place where there are Latinos has to be a valid situation. Why can't you come in, ask a person, ask everybody for their names or documents or identification. There was never a case where they raid a place where there are Latinos and you find guns. The Latinos go out the door, guns blazing. That doesn't happen. There is always a peaceful situation, a peaceful arrest. But every time ICE agents come in, in a violent way."

But if you are one of those offers going into one of these plants, you've probably seen a lot in your day, I imagine. I'm trying to put myself in their shoes. I think we should blame the employers, frankly, here. E- Verify should be the law of the land, and if you violate E-Verify, the sanctions should be so onerous on you that you either have shut down for a while or you are shut down, period. That is where it should be. The workers, you have got to deal with the workers, but the owners of these business are unscrupulous completely."

She was citing her Jamaican roots when she was asked about legalizing marijuana and why she smoked marijuana in the past. But her Jamaican born dad, Donald Harris, he is not laughing. He is saying, quote, \"My dear departed grandmothers as well as my deceased parents must be turning in their grave right now to see their families name, reputation, and proud Jamaican identity being connected in any way, jokingly or not, with the fraudulent stereotype of the pot smoking joy-seeker, and in the pursuit of identity politics.\" Awkward. Family squabble aside, Kamala is tapping into the wide acceptance of marijuana in the country, and she thinks she's going to get political juice from embracing it. And more states and more politicians look to line their pockets with the revenue from marijuana legalization. Joining me now is Alex Berenson. I had Alex on the podcast a couple weeks ago. I got a huge reaction. He's a former \"New York Times\" reporter. Get this, he's the author of a new book, you've got to read this. It's called \"Tell Your Children, The Truth about Marijuana, Mental Illness and Violence.\" Alex, people think \"New York Times\" reporter, former current, doesn't matter, why would he write a book about the dangers of marijuana. So here's the question. Why the heck did you? ALEX BERENSON, FORMER \"NEW YORK TIMES\" REPORTER: It was really my wife who encouraged me to write the book. She is a psychiatrist. She deals with the criminally mentally ill. And she would tell me, she'd come home from her job at a forensic hospital which is really where they send the criminally insane, and she would tell me about case after case where people had committed horrible crimes under the in fact or who had become schizophrenic after years of using. And, in my grand knowledge, I would say to her, that sounds like \"Reefer Madness.\" That is not true. That can't be real. And she is the one who trained at Harvard and Columbia. She's the one who sees these people every day. She said to me, you know what, maybe you should look at the studies yourself. And when I did, I was shocked at the strength of the science showing that marijuana is linked to mental illness. It is linked to psychosis, and then psychosis, which is a break from reality, is linked to crime."

Cigarettes are legal, alcohol is legal, people can go gamble their houses away, we think marijuana fits in that category. We're going to warn people about it and let them make their own choices, so be it. I don't think that is the right choice, but so be it. But let's not pretend that this is medically necessary for people. And let's really not pretend that this is a good idea for teenagers, that this is a good idea for people whose brains are still developing, that this is a good idea for people who have psychiatric conditions who have anxiety or depression. Let's be honest about what the risks here are. And the is called \"Tell Your Children\" because I want people to be able to have those conversations with their kids. I want people who are in their 20s who might be using and seeing psychiatric side effects that they didn't expect who are feeling weirdly more depressed or are having weird thoughts, to have some idea that, you know what, this is not -- this is not benign drug. And there is a low to this high."

The left has done a fantastic job of confusing people about this issue. Cannabis advocates have done a fantastic job.
