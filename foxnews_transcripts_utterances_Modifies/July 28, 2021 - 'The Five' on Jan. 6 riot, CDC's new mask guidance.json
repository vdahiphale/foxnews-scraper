So, the CDC pulling an about-face on masks, reversing their indoor policies they set just two months ago to help prevent the spread of the delta variant. Fully vaccinated people apparently should now begin wearing masks indoors but only in places with high COVID transmission rates. Here is the agency's director. ROCHELLE WALENSKY, CDC DIRECTOR (via telephone): In a rare occasion, some vaccinated people infected with the delta variant after vaccination may be contagious and spread the virus to others. In areas with substantial and high transmission, the CDC recommends fully vaccinated people wear masks in public indoor settings to help prevent the spread of the delta variant and protect others. This includes schools.",

And Jesse, right before we came out, apparently the vice president's plain, the aide went back to the press that's on the plane and handed out some masks and said D.C. apparently is one of these areas and so you guys are back in it.",

We've had it, Joe Biden has blown this, this was his big mandate, tackling the pandemic and now no one knows what's going on. It's just too confusing for the American people, and this is the thing he had the highest approval rating on. And that's not going to continue if he keeps this up. If you have deaths that are not rising, actually deaths continue to fall, they are under 300 daily deaths per day for the last month and a half, and if cases are going up a little bit, if you are vaccinated that's not your problem. But to slap a mask on your face because other people are not vaccinated? That doesn't make any medical sense. And to now mandate vaccines for federal employees when two-thirds of blacks and Hispanics have not been vaccinated, it sounds like they are just now punishing people for not being vaccinated instead of saving lives. Now, you cannot open the southern border to migrants from Mexico and Central America where they are seeing a big rise in cases and expect the delta not to spread. And the delta is spreading in Texas, Arizona, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida, all of these southeastern states where, coincidentally, Joe Biden is buzzing them into. So if you're really serious about stopping delta, close the southern border. But what did he do? He closed the northern border to Canada. What sense does that make? It makes no sense.",

It's why they embrace shaming Americans but don't care about the thousands of unvaxxed non-Americans because it's not about health. They don't care whether these people live or they die. What they are interested in is conflict theater. Conflict theater is going to help at least prop up CNN for maybe another year. They have the lowest ratings in I think six years. And that's why they are giddy because they have a new group to target. And as the national hall monitor network, they can exercise their false sense of moral superiority over people.

Even so, vaccinated individuals represent a very small amount of transmission occurring around the country.\" But instead, they are telling the American people that in two-thirds or almost two-thirds of counties in this country, if you look at the map, I did and added it up, that you're going to need to mask up. It is purely political. It's in most red areas. It's throughout the south and into the southwest and guess why? Because those states are doing better in terms of unemployment, in terms of the economy than the blue states are.

I saw some really bad stuff all last year, and none of those people lifted a damn finger.

We've had it, Joe Biden has blown this, this was his big mandate, tackling the pandemic and now no one knows what's going on. It's just too confusing for the American people, and this is the thing he had the highest approval rating on. And that's not going to continue if he keeps this up. If you have deaths that are not rising, actually deaths continue to fall, they are under 300 daily deaths per day for the last month and a half, and if cases are going up a little bit, if you are vaccinated that's not your problem. But to slap a mask on your face because other people are not vaccinated? That doesn't make any medical sense. And to now mandate vaccines for federal employees when two-thirds of blacks and Hispanics have not been vaccinated, it sounds like they are just now punishing people for not being vaccinated instead of saving lives. Now, you cannot open the southern border to migrants from Mexico and Central America where they are seeing a big rise in cases and expect the delta not to spread. And the delta is spreading in Texas, Arizona, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida, all of these southeastern states where, coincidentally, Joe Biden is buzzing them into. So if you're really serious about stopping delta, close the southern border. But what did he do? He closed the northern border to Canada. What sense does that make? It makes no sense."

And Don Lemon is all on this, and it explains your confusion over the border. It's why they embrace shaming Americans but don't care about the thousands of unvaxxed non-Americans because it's not about health. They don't care whether these people live or they die. What they are interested in is conflict theater. Conflict theater is going to help at least prop up CNN for maybe another year. They have the lowest ratings in I think six years. And that's why they are giddy because they have a new group to target. And as the national hall monitor network, they can exercise their false sense of moral superiority over people. I also find it weird that they love condemning Americans but you better not say anything about China. None of these Americans had anything to do with the spread of COVID or the origins of COVID, but you are so free to demonize them but god forbid you say anything about the experts who knew about, what's the name of the shit?

Even so, vaccinated individuals represent a very small amount of transmission occurring around the country.\" But instead, they are telling the American people that in two-thirds or almost two-thirds of counties in this country, if you look at the map, I did and added it up, that you're going to need to mask up. It is purely political. It's in most red areas. It's throughout the south and into the southwest and guess why? Because those states are doing better in terms of unemployment, in terms of the economy than the blue states are. And by the way, in terms of messengers for people to get vaccinated, can you think of two worse people than Don Lemon and Gavin Newsom?

What you have there is the blood flowing in the streets. I mean, it's just this 12 dead this weekend, there were 12 last weekend, 17 the weekend before that, you know, it's so much bigger than the 90 murderers who are released although that is certainly part of the problem. You have a situation here where we are losing an entire generation of young black man and nobody cares about it unless there's a white cop involved. It is horrific what's happening. This is the civil rights issue of our time. There is a ghetto civil war going on. Everybody has got guns. They are dealing the drugs. They are fighting over turf. And they are firing into crowds, willy-nilly, as if that was a sign of macho, you shoot up a barbecue and you kill a 6-year-old.

If anybody is picked up here in New York just for simple assault, they are right back out on the street immediately. And this is a unique kind of evil and cowardice, attacking elderly people. But just really quickly I want to point out one, just -- I have mentioned this on the show before, but there were two elderly Asian women who were stabbed in San Francisco by a man named Patrick Thompson. And the knife was as long as the arm of one of these elderly Asian women. And the handle broke off and the serrated knife was stuck inside of her. Where did he come from?

She has 700 lawyers under her tutelage, and she ran on this anti-cop, de-incarcerate platform, and now it's working out. She doesn't sentence people. Pre-trial sentencing doesn't happen, no bail. Everybody gets out. Soros funded, Gutfeld, $2 million to her super PAC, from George Soros. So people you ask why? Well, they voted for her. They voted for her so at a certain point, you had to say, Chicago, I feel sorry for you, but you're putting people in office that are raising body counts.

And on January 6, we became the barbarians. We don't like that. Having said that, it would be fun to do a hearing on the crime wave and interview the police from Seattle, Portland, Minneapolis, New York City just to provide real context about actual threats to democracy. We're being lectured by phony politicians about threats to our country while they ignored a mounting pile of dead and it's all for politics. I also reject the idea that having politicians jobs disrupted for two hours is somehow worse than billions of dollars of destruction and dozens of deaths including police officers. That's why I would like to see a hearing about that, because I'm not -- I'm not getting -- I can't stomach the crying. I can't stomach the crying. I saw some really bad stuff all last year, and none of those people lifted a damn finger. What a backwards world we live in where the media didn't give two F's about police officers getting killed, about businesses torched, but they lionized a response in which an unarmed female protester was shot dead point-blank. Imagine if she was BLM. Imagine that. How would this turn out differently if it was a BLM protest? Just think about that. That's why this is a circus. That's a clown show.

The person most recognized would be I guess, Simone Biles, maybe Katie Ledecky, who also, you know -- she barely lost, you know, last night. But that young 17-year-old girl from Alaska, she surprised everybody and got the gold. So, I wish Simone the best. I hope that the rest of the team can go on and will, you know, if she decides to talk more about it, great. But I also want to mention one other thing, which is, the United States ended up with a silver by the Russian Olympic Committee got the gold. And you know, the Russians were kicked out of the Olympics for the doping scandal, but their Olympic Committee gets to compete. And I think that that is wrong.

And as she was running for that volt, she's running about 50 miles per hour or more. You will be catastrophically injured if you're in your own head and not competing -- not competing as you normally would. And in terms of the Larry Nassar scandal, this is her first game -- Olympic Games, since that scandal broke. It broke right after the Rio de Janeiro Olympics. So, it's not -- it's not unfathomable to think that there is some post- traumatic stress going on here. And she's not allowed to have the support system in Japan as she would because of COVID.
