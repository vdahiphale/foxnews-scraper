Instead of allowing him to do that, they impeached him for obstructing Congress. They tried to put Trump below the law.

They never allowed the president to exercise executive privilege. And when he suggested he might, they impeached him for obstructing Congress. Now I'd like you to ask Mr. Jeffries the following. What are we supposed to do in the Senate regarding executive privilege? If it's going to be invoked, who determines whether or not the privilege applies? Clearly to me any president would ask for executive privilege regarding these witnesses. And if they were that important, why didn't you call them in the House? Do you need them to make your case? The people called by the Senate were Blumenthal, Vernon Jordan, and Monica Lewinsky. Blumenthal asserted executive privilege.

You violated every norm of what we do. It took five years for Starr to look at Clinton. Mueller looked at Trump for almost two years. And you took 48 days. So here's what I would say. The sooner this is over, the better for the country. We can get back to do the business of the American people and do things that really matter to them. I have been very consistent. I supported Mueller. I trusted him to be fair. This has been a political hit job. This is political revenge. And what they're doing to the presidency is a danger to the institution itself.",

And they have a very good relationship with Jane Raskin. She was on the -- on the Robert Mueller defense team. There are a number of people inside the White House at a very senior level who did not want the president to have Alan Dershowitz on his team. That was an issue of great consternation, particularly given the recent reports about his very close ties to Jeffrey Epstein. They did not want that association.

The president's eight-member defense team includes some famous faces.

He said to the House, who was trying to impeach him in 48 days, from the time they authorized impeachment until they voted on the articles was 48 days. It's the first impeachment in modern history without outside counsel. It was a partisan railroad job. And one of the reasons he's being impeached is that they had to do it in such a hurry, he could not exercise executive privilege. And I have got a quote from Senator Schumer I won't read today, but I'll let it out tomorrow, saying that any president has the right to defend the office, and Article II obstruction of Congress is about the president saying, I want to go to court and exercise executive privilege over documents and witnesses. Instead of allowing him to do that, they impeached him for obstructing Congress. They tried to put Trump below the law. Abuse of power is so poorly defined here, I don't know how presidents in the future can conform their conduct. It's the first impeachment in history where there's no allegation of a crime by the president."

    {
      "speaker": "GRAHAM",

There are a lot of senators who I think will wind up acquitting the president but believe that we need to hear the House's case, the president's case, answer to the House's case, and ask questions and then that's when the witness requests will be. So the idea of dismissing the case early on is not going to happen. We don't have the votes for that. So we'll play it out along the Clinton model."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "All right. You say then -- the next big issue, you say there is no need to hear from witnesses in this trial, but, sir, that directly contradicts what you said as a Republican House impeachment manager in 1999 during the Clinton impeachment trial. Let me put up a quote from then. You said: \"There may be some conflict that has to be resolved by presenting live witnesses. That's what happens every day in court and I think the Senate can stand that.\" Question, why were witnesses OK then, but they're over the line now?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Well, the people being asked for by Senator Schumer are the secretary of state, the chief staff to the president of the United States, the national security adviser to the president of the United States, and the acting OMB director. All of these witnesses were available to the House. The president said he would claim executive privilege. Here's what has happened. In the House, they did this in 48 days. They never allowed the president to exercise executive privilege. And when he suggested he might, they impeached him for obstructing Congress. Now I'd like you to ask Mr. Jeffries the following. What are we supposed to do in the Senate regarding executive privilege? If it's going to be invoked, who determines whether or not the privilege applies? Clearly to me any president would ask for executive privilege regarding these witnesses. And if they were that important, why didn't you call them in the House? Do you need them to make your case? The people called by the Senate were Blumenthal, Vernon Jordan, and Monica Lewinsky. Blumenthal asserted executive privilege. But that was litigated in the House, and the court ruled against Blumenthal. What they're doing here is they've got a railroad job in the House and they're trying to fix it in the Senate, and I'm not going to be part of that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "OK. Let me ask you about this question of executive privilege because you're quite right, President Trump has said if the Senate tries to call Chief of Staff Mulvaney or former National Security Adviser John Bolton that he will assert executive privilege. And you've indicated you'll support him. Take a look."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GRAHAM",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "GRAHAM",
      "utterance": "But in the 1974 case of the United States v. Nixon, during the height of Watergate, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously on the Nixon tapes. And here was the key quote from the court. \"The generalized assertion of privilege must yield to the demonstrated specific need for evidence in a pending criminal trial.\" So, isn't the precedent, the legal precedent about executive privilege, is that it must yield to the need of evidence? And there is evidence that John Bolton, for instance, could give that it was impossible to get any other way. Isn't the precedent clear that he cannot invoke executive privilege to prevent John Bolton from testifying?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GRAHAM",
      "utterance": "No, he can invoke executive privilege. There's a Supreme Court case that says when you deal with national security issues the privilege of the president is at its highest. The president has never had a chance to invoke executive privilege regarding John Bolton or anybody else. They're asking the Senate now to destroy that privilege. You have a supreme court case on executive privilege because it went to court. And here's what Schumer said in 1998. \"To suggest that any subject of investigation, much less the president with obligations to the institution of the presidency, is abusing power and interfering with an investigation by making legitimate legal claims using due process and asserting constitutional rights is beyond serious consideration.\" They've literally impeached President Trump because he wanted to exercise executive privilege. They said, no, that is obstructing Congress. This privilege attaching to Bolton has never been to court and, at a minimum, it should go to court."

      "speaker": "WALLACE",

One, in the Nixon tapes case in 1974, the court said the assertion of executive privilege must yield to evidence in a criminal case. And the president is being tried in a criminal case. And in an --"

      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "Well, he's being tried for high crimes and misdemeanors. You can argue that it doesn't rise to that, but that's what the trial is all about. And secondly, the Supreme Court has also ruled that when it comes to deciding whether or not executive privilege, it doesn't -- it's not going to go to the court, because there was a case involving a judge named Judge Walter Nixon, in which the court basically said, you know what, we're not going to weigh in, when the Senate is involved in an impeachment trial, their word stands."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GRAHAM",
      "utterance": "So the point you're trying to make here is that we've got a Supreme Court case that was litigated after Nixon invoked executive privilege. The president has never been able to go to court because they wouldn't let him. I'm not going to legitimatize a House impeachment process that calls the secretary of state, the chief of staff, and the national security adviser of any president and deny them their day in court to protect those essential national security advisers, come to the Senate and destroy the privilege because it could never be used in the House. The bottom line here is if these people were that important to the case, they should have called them in the House. Executive privilege was raised by Clinton. He went to court and he lost. You're trying to get the Senate to legitimatize what I think is a political railroad job. I'm going to vote to honor the privilege. And if the privilege is to be decided by the United States Senate, I hope we will all honor the privilege because here's the way to destroy it. You impeach a president. You don't let him to exert executive privilege in the House. You deny him or her their day in court. You come to the Senate and you strip it away. You've destroyed executive privilege through the impeachment process. That would really make the presidency far less effective and would hurt the constitutional balance of power. That's exactly what they're trying to get us to do. Listen to Schumer in '98 if you don't believe me."

Your best guess as a vote counter, will the Senate end up calling witnesses?"

Here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to be consistent. I'm going to vote against calling the four witnesses requested by Senator Schumer. They're all covered by executive privilege. They're part of the national security team of the president. They could have been called in the House. They chose not to. Apparently they don't need them to make their case. Hunter Biden and Joe Biden and the whistle-blower, we can look at those allegations of misconduct outside of impeachment. I want this trial to get over with as quick as possible.

There are reports that Republican Senate Leader McConnell is going to put out a rule on Tuesday that for the opening arguments, 24 hours for each side, he's prepared to put the Senate in session 12 hours a day. So basically the House prosecutors would get two 12-hour days and the defense would get two 12-hour days to make their opening arguments. One, is that true? And two, if it is, how do you respond to the Democratic impeachment managers who say this is just a rush to get this over with?"

But when it comes to Donald Trump, Nancy Pelosi may pray for him privately, but she has orchestrated the church of holy hell. From the time Trump has been sworn in to now, it has been one thing after another. Here's what I would say to the House folks. You took 48 days to impeach this president. You did not allow him to call any witnesses. He could not have a lawyer present during the House Intel Committee. This has been a partisan railroad job. And you're asking for fairness in the Senate? You violated every norm of what we do. It took five years for Starr to look at Clinton. Mueller looked at Trump for almost two years. And you took 48 days. So here's what I would say. The sooner this is over, the better for the country. We can get back to do the business of the American people and do things that really matter to them. I have been very consistent. I supported Mueller. I trusted him to be fair. This has been a political hit job. This is political revenge. And what they're doing to the presidency is a danger to the institution itself."

I guarantee you, he'll get a better deal in the Senate than in the House. But his mood is to go to the State of the Union with this behind him and talk about what he wants to do for the next -- rest of 2020 and what he wants to do for the next four years. He is very much comfortable with the idea this is going to turn out well for him. He believes politically this has helped him. He thinks it's a threat to the presidency. The one thing he talks to me constantly about is, what does the next president do after this if this is successful? He does not want to legitimatize attack on the presidency. And that's my number one goal is to do this trial in a fashion that no House Republican or Democrat ever again will do again what this House did."

Donald Trump pressured a foreign government to target an American citizen for political and personal gain, and withheld $391 million in military aid from a vulnerable Ukraine without justification as part of his effort to solicit foreign interference in the 2020 election. That is a corrupt abuse of power. And that is precisely why we are here right now getting ready to proceed with a Senate trial."

Do you -- the Senate impeachment managers, do you know what the rules of this trial are going to be, that you're going to have to operate under?  And secondly, what about this talk that Senator McConnell is going to put out a rule that you have two days, 24 hours, basically two 12-hour sessions, to deliver your opening arguments? Do you have any problem with that?"

    {
      "speaker": "JEFFRIES",
      "utterance": "Well, we do not know what the rules are going to be at this moment. We certainly look forward to being able to review the resolution.  The most important thing is that the American people deserve a fair trial. The Constitution deserves a fair trial. Our democracy deserves a fair trial. And we believe that a fair trial involves witnesses, it involves evidence, it involves documents. We intend to present that to the American people.  We're going to proceed in a serious, solemn, and sober fashion, as we've done in the House, now as we transition to the Senate. We need to just follow the facts, apply the law, be guided by the Constitution, present the truth to the American people as it relates to the solicitation of foreign interference in the 2020 election.  The senators are going to have to decide. The American people are going to have to decide is that the right thing for a president to do? Should we protect the corruption of our democracy?"

      "speaker": "WALLACE",

You have 24 hours, but you have got two days. And we'll keep the Senate in session from 1:00 in the afternoon to 1:00 in the morning. Are you OK with that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JEFFRIES",

And ultimately the decision will be made by the 100 senators, all of whom have sworn an oath to be impartial. We certainly hope that they conduct themselves in that fashion. We have a very strong case to present.  There were 17 different witnesses who testified in the House proceeding, 12 of whom testified publicly. Many of them were Trump appointees, individuals like Ambassador Sondland, who gave a million dollars, of course, to Trump's inauguration, who testified under oath that this was a quid pro quo."

      "speaker": "WALLACE",

One, you have an overwhelming case. The case that you have built is sufficient that the president should be removed from office. But, two, we need to call more witnesses. Don't those contradict each other?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JEFFRIES",
      "utterance": "They don't. There's a strong case that was developed in the House. But as was the situation in the Clinton impeachment, and Senator Graham just acknowledged, there were three additional witnesses, including Monica Lewinsky, who was at the center of the impeachment in 1998, who did not testify before the House proceedings but was called to be present as it relates to what took place in the Senate.  And if Senator McConnell is saying that we're going to follow the Clinton model, then let's just follow the Clinton model."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "What about the argument that we heard from Senator Graham in the previous segment, why should the Senate take the time and go to the trouble to litigate whether or not they can hear from witnesses, like former National Security Adviser John Bolton, when the House could have done it and you decided that you were in too much of a rush to do that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JEFFRIES",

    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "Well, but, wait, you can't have it -- but, again, you can't have it both ways, Congressman. You say it was an urgent matter, it was a threat, and then Nancy Pelosi waited a month to even hand over the Articles of Impeachment."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JEFFRIES",
      "utterance": "Yes, I'm glad you raised that, because there's two parts to this process. There is the impeachment process and then, of course, there's the removal trial that takes place in the Senate. And Speaker Pelosi's decision, which was the right one, to temporarily, for a short period of time, hold those Articles of Impeachment, have created the space for us to have a discussion about a fair trial.  And in that space, what we've seen is John Bolton has come forward to say he's willing to testify before the Senate. Lev Parnas has come forward to say he is willing to testify before the Senate. We've acquired additional information in terms of correspondence between the Office of Management and Budget and the Department of Defense, which says that the president was the one who directed the aid be withheld from Ukraine.  We've had five Republican senators say that a fair trial should involve hearing from witnesses. And we've also seen that the non-partisan Government Accountability Office has concluded that the White House broke the law. That's additional information that I would think senators who believe in a fair trial would want to hear."

If Democrats get to call witnesses, then Republicans get to call witnesses.  If you want -- and I assume he's your top witness, former National Security Adviser John Bolton. If you want to call John Bolton and the Republicans say, well, then, we're going to call Hunter Biden, are you willing to pay that price?"

      "utterance": "Well, what I will say, Chris, is that the standard that should apply is relevance as it relates to the central allegation in this case of the president pressuring the Ukrainian government for his own personal and political gain. What I would think is relevant is the fact that in 2017 the Trump administration allocated $150 million in military aid to Ukraine and allegedly there were no concerns with corruption in Ukraine.  In 2018, the same Trump administration allocated $200 million in military aid to Ukraine. It was never held up. There were never any congressional hearings about alleged corruption in Ukraine under Republican control. The president had two different calls with the Ukrainian president. In April on the 21st and on July 25th..."

      "speaker": "JEFFRIES",
      "utterance": "Well, the key question is, what was the intervening event? Because the president had two calls, of course. He never mentioned the word corruption. In May of 2019, the Department of Defense, Trump's Department of Defense, indicated in a letter to Congress that all necessary preconditions for the receipt of the aid had been met, including the implementation of anti-corruption reforms by the Ukrainian government. It seems that the intervening event may have been the announcement by Joe Biden that he was running for president."

GOP strategist Karl Rove, Charles Lane of \"The Washington Post\" Jonathan Swan from \"Axios,\" and pollster Kristen Soltis Anderson, also a Fox News contributor. Jonathan, let's start with the White House defense team and let's put it up on the screen because it's a really good cable news panel with people like Ken Starr and Alan Dershowitz, but more a panel, it seems to me, than a cohesive team of lawyers. How comfortable do you think White House Counsel Pat Cipollone is with having to try to run this operation? JONATHAN SWAN, NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER, \"AXIOS\": I don't want to speak for Pat Cipollone. I know that he's leading this. He's very much in charge, him and Jay Sekulow, the key lawyers here. And they have a very good relationship with Jane Raskin. She was on the -- on the Robert Mueller defense team. There are a number of people inside the White House at a very senior level who did not want the president to have Alan Dershowitz on his team. That was an issue of great consternation, particularly given the recent reports about his very close ties to Jeffrey Epstein. They did not want that association. So that was probably the most controversial part of it. But I actually don't think that this has been a huge issue having these additional people. The president wanted it and he sees it as a television trial."

You have five members of the Senate, I think three in particular, Alexander, Collins and Murkowski, who are inclined to have witnesses, two others who say they're open to it. But I think it all depends on how -- what's the sense of the end of 48 hours of the presentation of the two cases, do they need to hear from more? But think about this, the Democrats are basically saying, we did not prove our case in the House and in order to prove the case in the Senate we've got to have these witnesses.

And the Democrats, I think, for political reasons, did not want to spend a year litigating the president's claim of executive privilege. They wanted to get this thing into the Senate. And now I think they have a very plausible, and for many people, politically popular argument there ought to be witnesses. I think even a lot of Republicans in polls say we'd like there to be witnesses. Of course, I think the witnesses the Republicans want are people like the whistleblower and Hunter Biden and it could be a big can of worms.

First of all, do you think impeachment will be a big issue given the way we consume news these days or do you think it will be largely forgotten by next November?

His job approval has stayed extremely steady throughout this entire process, even as a majority of Americans in Fox News' own polling say that they would like to see the president impeached. The trial thus far -- or, pardon me, the hearings in the House did not move the president's numbers.

We -- we all know that he's goofy, but we all have a goofy uncle that shows up at the summer picnic that we sort of like. And that's the quality of Joe Biden. He's sort of the goofy uncle at the summer picnic that we have a sort of confidence that if he were president, we'd make it through. So, yes, he represents, in my opinion, the most serious threat to the president of all the field. And I think that at a -- as I wrote in my column two weeks ago, he is likely to be the Democratic nominee but if -- if I had to pick one. But -- but, ironically, I'd like to take the field against him, but you can't do that because I don't think he's a 50/50 candidate and all -- better than 50/50.

And it's a -- it's a great bonus for him. I think Elizabeth Warren played this card in part because she really needed to, that -- she wasn't winning the progressive wing of the party and I think she wanted to, you know, sort of stir up sentiment among women in the Democratic primary race. But there's a huge risk in that because Bernie Sanders' people are now firing back and saying this whole thing was an unfair setup, that it's a -- it's -- she's not accurately portraying their conversations, so on and so forth. Between this and the fact that the senators will have to sit quietly through a week or so of impeachment at least, I think you have to say that Joe Biden comes out ahead. And just to pick up on something Karl said. African-Americans have stood by Joe Biden. They are a key piece of the Democratic electorate. And it turns out the most pragmatic segment, because clearly they are focused on somebody who can beat Trump in the fall and they see it as Joe Biden."

      "speaker": "ANDERSON",
      "utterance": "You're right, that there's a gap of about ten points in almost every poll where you ask both of these questions. And I think that gap is driven by folks saying, I like what's going on with my 401k, I like what's going on in my bank account, but I wish he would stop the tweets. I wish he would conduct himself much more conventionally, presidentially. There's a lot in terms of tone and style that Donald Trump does that will rub people the wrong way, even if those very same people feel like the economy is doing better. So the big question is, which one of these is going to win out when it comes to people making their voting decision? I think, in a normal environment, you would see a president with these kinds of economic numbers and political scientists would build their models that would say, yes, the incumbent is likely to get re-elected. But with this big gap, it's possible that the economy does not win out. That people say, look, I like what's going on in my bank account, but I don't know that I want four more years of this, the atmospherics, the tone, the style."

      "speaker": "SWAN",
      "utterance": "Look, this is something that they're watching very closely. And I wouldn't call it confidence because it's sort of like knocking wood every, you know, couple week. Trump didn't have that many tools after he passed the tax cuts to keep the economy frothy. He's now put in place two of them, USMCA, which was very significant, and then the China deal really calmed the markets. It was -- you know, we're probably not going to see a phase two deal. That was a phase one. We're probably not going to see a phase two deal before the election. But if nothing major happens with China between now and November, they feel, you know, pretty -- as good as you can with something as unreliable as the economy."

    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "Let -- let me just pick up on that with you, Karl, because I famously remember that in 1945, the Brits threw out Winston Churchill just after he had let them to victory out Hitler and the Nazis. He still lost. And I guess the question is, is a president with an economy -- and the numbers are really quite extraordinary, is a president with an economy this strong beatable?"

    {
      "speaker": "ROVE",
      "utterance": "He is. But the economy is very -- a very strong weapon in his arsenal. And I would expect from -- from my contacts inside Trump world, that they're going to make a very strong effort to get a trade deal moving with the United Kingdom in order to keep this sense of amendment. We've got a second act. There are things that we're going to do to keep the prosperity growing. But -- but I think this tension between the strong economy and the president's re-election numbers points to one very important thing, who his opponent is as a Democrat. And then the conduct of that Democratic campaign and the president in the period of July, August, September, and October are going to be critical probably how each day plays out more than any election since probably 1980 when people were sitting there saying, well, we've got concerns about Jimmy Carter, but is that guy, Ronald Reagan, up to it."
