Plus, 2020 Democrats make the case for impeachment in this week's debate. We’ll ask our Sunday panel how it's playing in the battleground states. All right now on Fox News Sunday. And hello again from Fox News in Washington. A [unintelligible] fight is now shaping up between the Senate and House over the impeachment of President Trump. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says she won't send the articles of impeachment to the Senate until the two parties there agree on the rules for a trial. But if the articles are never sent over, does that mean the president was never actually impeached? In a moment we'll talk with Marc Short, the chief of staff to Vice President Pence.

      "speaker": "Marc Short",

The reality is that she said in the House that this president poses such a grave danger to the globe that we have to trample on his constitutional rights, not allow us to have any witnesses in front of the Intelligence Committee, not allow us to have counsel present, now allow us to provide evidence in our own defense. We're going to trample those rights to rush this through and now we're going to hold it up to demand a longer process in the Senate with more witnesses. I don't know when they became so concerned about due process after trampling over the president's rights, but to your opening segment, I think the president believes that we're winning right now. He believes that we’ve won on taxes. The economy is booming; unemployment is at record low. Military spending is rebuilding."

      "speaker": "Chris Wallace",
      "utterance": "The president says that he wants his day in court. How frustrated is he right now by what Pelosi is doing? And he’s been sort of back and forth on this. Does he want a full trial in which he can call witnesses -- Republicans can call witnesses to defend him?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Marc Short",
      "utterance": "He’s frustrated with what he found to be a completely unreasonable impeachment, so, sure, he’s frustrated by that, but he’s also anxious to get not just acquitted, but exonerated in the Senate. So, he’s looking forward to his opportunity to have a fair trial in the Senate."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Chris Wallace",
      "utterance": "And does a fair trial mean both sides call witnesses?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Marc Short",
      "utterance": "I think what’s happened, and 20 years ago in the Clinton impeachment, is that you saw that they agreed to let both sides lay out their case, “and then we’ll take a vote about additional witnesses.” That’s what they agreed to. And it wasn’t just -- it was a 100-0 vote on the process, including Chuck Schumer supporting that process. So, when Schumer says he wants the same proceedings that happened with Clinton, I don’t -- I think that’s what we welcome, too. He’s trying to now change the rules and have a whole different process. And, Chris, if her case is so airtight as she said that she had to ram it through, and it’s undeniable, why does she need more witnesses to make her case?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Chris Wallace",
      "utterance": "That’s a question for Speaker Pelosi. I hope we have her on. What does the president make of Pelosi this week inviting him to deliver his State of the Union address to Congress, a joint session, on February 4th? Does he read that as her acknowledging that her case is going nowhere?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Marc Short",

      "utterance": "And how does he feel about the fact that she invited him this week?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Marc Short",
      "utterance": "Well, I think it’s the same thing, Chris. In the midst of the impeachment, we had 15 to 20 House Democrats over in a black-tie event for a Christmas party with the president. It’s like, how serious are they really doing this, or, again, is it really just a political exercise to placate the radical left of their base? That’s what we think this has been all along. It’s why this was the seventh impeachment vote. It wasn’t the first. They’ve tried seven times. They had 70 votes for impeachment even before Mueller even testified on the Russian collusion hoax. They’ve been trying to do this from day one of this administration, and the reality is that they continue to see us racking up victories for the American people, and they know they can’t beat him at the ballot box."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Chris Wallace",
      "utterance": "On Friday night, President Trump tweeted this headline. We’re going to put it up. “Russian president Vladimir Putin says U.S. president Donald Trump’s impeachment is farfetched and predicts the U.S. Senate will reject it.” That’s President Trump retweeting what Putin said about him. At the same time, the president -- the White House threatened to veto the big spending bill, which would avoid a government shutdown, unless Democrats dropped a provision that would have said the president must release any funding that Congress approves -- military aid -- for Ukraine. I know there were separation-of-power issues there, Congress dictating what the president must do or not do, but does President Trump still believe that it was Ukraine, not Russia, that interfered in the 2016 election?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Marc Short",
      "utterance": "Chris, it doesn’t have to be an either/or. It can be both. But that reporting was once again miserable reporting by the Washington Post. We requested $250 million in aid to Ukraine. If Congress did its job and completed their spending bill on September 30th, we would have had it then. It was delayed for over three months because they did a sham impeachment. They’re the ones actually delaying aid to Ukraine. What our admiration said is that they tried to put a special provision there that said there’s no executive review on any of this aid, not just Ukraine, but other countries. But ultimately, the aid is in there, and we’re going to deliver that aid to Ukraine. So, it’s actually incredibly misleading and misappropriate reporting by the Washington Post to say that we were issuing a veto threat over aid to Ukraine. It was on the policy writers in which Congress was trying to say, “We’re taking the executive branch ability to review that aid.” Any executive would have had concern over that, whether it’s Republican or Democrat alike."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Chris Wallace",
      "utterance": "And I pointed that out; there were separation of power concerns. But you said it doesn’t have to be either/or. Forget the question of Russia. Does the president believe that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Marc Short",
      "utterance": "He thinks we should at least investigate it, Chris. I mean, go back to 2016. I know this is inconvenient for a lot of people in the mainstream media, but when Russia interfered in our election, Barack Obama was president and Joe Biden was vice president. And Joe Biden himself said he was in charge of Ukraine policy, and his son is getting between $50,000 and $80,000 a month to serve on a board where he has no experience whatsoever. So, his question is, why shouldn’t we investigate it? It seems like we can never get enough investigation of interference -- foreign interference in our elections for three years, but as soon as the president asks for it, it’s like, “Hey, we must impeach him.”"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Chris Wallace",
      "utterance": "Well, that’s not why it happened, as you know. I mean, there was a phone call, and there was a question of conditionality of a White House visit and giving the military aid, and that it was on that basis that he was asking for the investigation. But let me take your point --"
    },

    {
      "speaker": "Chris Wallace",

      "utterance": "[unintelligible] --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Chris Wallace",
      "utterance": "Let me just finish. A member of the Trump National Security Council, Fiona Hill, said, “This idea that Ukraine interfered in the election is Kremlin disinformation.” So, why does the president think it’s still worth investigating whether Ukraine did something?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Marc Short",
      "utterance": "Why don’t we go and try to find the bottom line and the answers? We’re not questioning Russia’s interference, Chris. I’m accepting that. But it doesn’t mean that -- just because Russia interfered doesn’t mean others didn’t as well."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Chris Wallace",
      "utterance": "Well, but they’re saying -- Fiona Hill -- that the whole question of Ukraine is Russian --"

      "utterance": "I don’t think --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Chris Wallace",
      "utterance": "-- disinformation. And in fact, according to reporting you may say is inaccurate, Putin, supposedly in a meeting they had in Germany, told the president that it was Ukraine, and he apparently said to some people in the administration, “Putin told me it’s Ukraine.”"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Marc Short",
      "utterance": "I’ve read that, again, reporting in the Washington Post. I never heard that. I believe that there can be -- just because you’re saying, you know, “My house was robbed last night” means your house couldn’t have been robbed last night. It’s quite possible that both were interfering in elections, so why not investigate that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Chris Wallace",
      "utterance": "Okay, let’s turn to a new subject. An evangelical magazine, Christianity Today, ran an editorial this week under a headline, and there you can see it. “Trump should be removed from office.” It said, “That he should be removed, we believe, is not a matter of partisan loyalties, but loyalty to the Creator of the Ten Commandments.” Here is editor Marc Galli, who wrote that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Mark Galli, Christian Today editor",
      "utterance": "The question is, when does his behavior, which is described as immoral accurately, rise to the level where he is no longer fit to serve office? And to me, we crossed that line with the impeachment hearings."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Chris Wallace",
      "utterance": "Now, your boss, Vice President Pence, is an evangelical. How does he feel about President Trump being called by Christianity Today a, quote, “leader of such grossly immoral character?”"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Marc Short",
      "utterance": "Well, I don't want to put words in the vice president’s mouth, but, Chris, I think for a lot of us who are celebrating the birth of our Savior this week, the way that we look at it is that this president has helped to save thousands of similar unplanned pregnancies. This president has helped to make sure that religious liberty is protected. This president has done more -- as we celebrate today in our churches across the country this morning, they’re singing “O Little Town of Bethlehem.” There’s been no president -- no president has been a greater ally to Israel than this president. So, for many of us who are Christian, we look at this and say, “I am thankful that Donald Trump is president, and I’m thankful that Mike Pence is vice president.”"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Chris Wallace",

Finally, I want to ask you about the president’s comments in Michigan this week, where he suggested that the late Congressman John Dingell might be in hell, looking up, rather than in heaven, looking down. Here’s the reaction of Dingell’s wife, Debbie, to the president’s comments."

      "utterance": "I loved my husband very much. I’m still having a hard time. He was my partner and the love of my life, and so I was already having a hard time with this holiday, and the comment that he made was just -- it made me sad."

      "speaker": "Chris Wallace",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "Marc Short",
      "utterance": "Chris, I’m sorry that she’s hurting, and I’m sorry -- and I certainly, you know, hope that -- wish her the best as she deals with her circumstances. I think that our administration respects the service of John Dingell, and service -- we respect -- in uniform. We respect his service to our country and Congress, and we respect her service to our country in following her husband in Congress. I think that, you know -- I’m sorry that she’s in this circumstance today, but, you know, in light of where we were on -- what was it, Wednesday night -- I think the president saying -- you know, John Dingell was not exactly a wallflower. John Dingell called the president an imbecile in his closing months. John Dingell himself, as well, had a lot of critical comments about the president, yet he took time to call Debbie Dingell to express his personal condolences at the passing. He lowered flags to half-mast. I think at the time in the moment the president's feeling that, you know, that in midst of an impeachment vote that that was something that came up in his rally speech."

The Congress doesn't return until January 6th and was kind of referred to by Marc Short earlier. There were two resolutions at that time. One was a resolution to proceed that was passed by 100 to 0 and then there was a second resolution about who the witnesses would be. I think that --"

The first resolution did not approve witnesses, but ultimately there was a second resolution and there were three witnesses in the Clinton impeachment. And I think what the speaker is trying to do is to ensure that there's going to be a fair trial. I think they're going to continue to be discussions. I don't know. I'm not part of those very tight discussions but Senate Schumer's trying to work with Senator McConnell to make sure there's a fair hearing. I think there are witnesses that would not -- that the president would not allow to testify like the chief of staff, like John Bolton, and others that people would like to get that testimony from to ensure it is a fair trial."

You have no idea what's going to happen in the next two weeks as the leaders are trying to negotiate what's going to happen and as I remind you, Republican impeachment with President Bill Clinton, that managers weren't appointed until January 6th. I hope that the leaders are going to continue to talk. I think what -- you know, this was one of the hardest votes I think that and one of the most important votes I’ll cast in my career, however long it may be and it was about protecting our national security. I did not come out for this impeachment last summer under enormous pressure from Tom Steyer buying 40 ads and MoveOn.org because I was worried about the division in this country but it became very clear there was a danger to our national security. There was a danger to our democracy and that's why we are aware of what's happening and have to protect it as we go into this next year's election."

You say well, it always is a delay over -- between Christmas and New Year's, but Nancy Pelosi has made it clear she's hoping that by holding it up, it creates some leverage that will allow Chuck Schumer to make a deal with Mitch McConnell on the ground rules for the trial. The question is, why does she think she has any leverage here? The president and top Republicans say she's threatening not to give them something they don't want anyway. Take a look."

He wasn’t laid out to rest in the rotunda. Quite frankly, Nancy had called me and tried to work through funeral details, and I didn’t want anything that other former members weren’t allowed, so we didn’t do that, and it wasn’t the president’s to give. He called me to tell me he was lowering the flags, and to this day and this minute, I’m grateful that he did it. I was grateful for the call.

Extending this out is not in the interest of the Democrats who make up the majority in the House of Representatives, those 30 Democrats from Trump-friendly districts who are going to have to defend this decision back home. They don't want this story to extend. They want to be able to go back to their districts and say we did this because we thought we had to.

So, in terms of timeline, we might be operating on similar timelines as we saw in 1999. I believe she's right. First of all, she's not just one of the smartest Democrats and I know a lot of Democrats. I think she's one of the smartest and impartial defenders of the Constitution. She is -- she's using every tool in her toolbox to make sure that the resolutions that are conducted in the Senate -- now she can't control the Senate, McConnell has made that clear -- but she wants to make sure that every tool will be used or utilized so that when she sent over the managers she understand what game that the Senate will be playing."

It's the Constitution, Donna, that says -- Chris showed the language from the Constitution earlier. Sole power to the House for impeachment. Sole power to the Senate for the trial. And the issue is not whether Mitch McConnell is impartial. It's not his job to be impartial. That's the job of Chief Justice Roberts who will be overseeing this trial. Of course Mitch McConnell is a partisan Republican. No one is expecting him to be partial. But the problem here as Ben said is that Nancy Pelosi initiated this process to please her progressives and she rushed it through to please those House members that she knows want to go back home and talk about something else. And now she is in a bind here."

Wow, she's had quite a streak here but I would -- I mean, she held her caucus together. I mean, look, oh of these 31 who have -- who come from districts where President Trump won the election, she's going to see a number of defections. She did not see any large defections. She held them together. Anyway, the bigger point here is is this going to be like an O.J. Simpson jury? Jury nullification. In the O.J. Simpson case it was “we don't like the cops.” In this case “oh, we don't like the Democrats.” So, we're going to ignore the facts. We're going to ignore the evidence. There will be no evidence. Not guilty. The problem would be that would be a sham. So, Nancy Pelosi does -- can't control what goes on in the Senate according to the Constitution as you read here for us, Chris, but she can try to say “if this is going to be a sham well then I don't need to really put any energy into the managers that I send over there. Send political. Send rhetorical people. If it's a matter of actual witnesses, if John Bolton, Mick Mulvaney, are called to give firsthand testimony about the president's actions, then I need to send someone who knows about the case.”"

In Florida, 50 percent now oppose impeaching and removing the president, while 46 percent support those actions. In Wisconsin, another swing state, 52 percent oppose impeaching and removing President Trump, while 40 percent are in favor. Juan, will what the Democrats did this week in impeaching the president -- will it help the president in terms of 2020, his reelection prospects, and will it endanger the Democratic House majority?"

But what you do see in those polls is a distinct tilt in those very critical electoral college states against impeachment, and that’s not good news for the Democrats. It is better news for the president. By the way, those polls stand in contrast to our own Fox poll. This week, the Washington Post had a poll; it’s about 50 percent generally nationally who support impeachment and removal."

But the -- but it’s also the case that in those swing states the majority supported the impeachment inquiry, and a majority, if you look again at the national polls, say, “We want to have, for example, witnesses and a fair trial in the Senate.” And finally, what you see is that a majority -- and this is -- a super-majority in the national polls say he did something wrong. So, I think the Democrats in those swing districts, Chris, need to talk more in terms of “he did something wrong; this is unconstitutional” more so than they need to talk about impeachment, because that’s not helping the Democrats right now."

I think Pelosi and the Democrats thought they’d be able to peel off some Republicans in this process. They have not been able to do that, so it’s seen as this highly partisan exercise. Also, I think the Democrats overpromised. They were -- they said bombshells were coming -- bribery, extortion, collusion -- and the articles themselves seem to be pretty weak tea, and I think that’s a problem they have going forward.

On the other hand, I do believe that -- what we saw this at the debate this past week -- was that the Democrats are ready to take off the gloves. We’re within 45 days of the Iowa caucuses, over 1,600 precinct caucuses. I’ve done a few in my life. It’s now down to the final weeks before we choose someone who will ultimately, I think, be in a front-row -- get a front-row seat. I can’t help but think about the political calculus. This is not about the political calculus of the president or -- in his reelection -- or the Senate or the House. It’s about our Constitution and validity and integrity of our election. I keep saying, I experienced the Russian hacking. This was not a myth; this was not a hoax. This happened in real time, and if we don’t protect our elections from future interference of foreign governments, then we don’t have a democracy anymore.

This is a situation where I think you have a field that a lot of Democrats are not particularly satisfied with, because they see a lot of the different defects that each candidate has. You kind of want someone who’s able to step forward and really inspire a lot of people. I think that Mayor Pete has done that to this point, and whether he’s going to be able to ride that into the future in success in Iowa is, I think, a real question. To me, one of the most interesting aspects of this debate was the success of Amy Klobuchar, who I think did a very good job. This is a kind of a do-or-die moment for her, though. If she loses in Iowa, if she’s not able to make some noise there, she may not be able to withstand much future into this cycle."

      "speaker": "Chris Wallace",
      "utterance": "It’s a Christmas tradition here to share the story of how one family has found a way to express the meaning of the holiday season. It’s a moving example of love for our country and personal generosity. Once again, here is our power player of the week."

      "speaker": "Chris Wallace",
      "utterance": "It’s that plainspoken wisdom that has driven Morrill Worcester for years on a mission that has touched America’s heart. Each December, Worcester places wreaths at Arlington National Cemetery, and thousands of volunteers are there to help him."

      "speaker": "Morrill Worcester",

      "speaker": "Chris Wallace",
      "utterance": "This story begins back in 1962 when Worcester, then a 12-year-old paperboy from Maine, won a trip to Washington. What impressed him most was Arlington, its beauty and dignity and those rows and rows of graves."

      "speaker": "Morrill Worcester",
      "utterance": "These wreaths are real fresh raked, just made and I just didn’t want to throw them away."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Chris Wallace",
      "utterance": "He thought of Arlington and all those graves. When the cemetery approved, he and a dozen volunteers drove the wreaths down and laid them on the headstones. And so it continued for years until a few Christmases back when an air force sergeant took this picture, which ended up on the Internet."
    },

      "speaker": "Morrill Worcester",
      "utterance": "It kind of struck a nerve and people emailed it to each other and it really went around the world."

      "speaker": "Chris Wallace",
      "utterance": "We were there the next year as he and his workers at the Worcester Wreath Company loaded up 5,265 wreaths. Then they embarked on what Worcester calls the world's longest veteran's parade, a 750 mile journey that at some points attracted more than 100 vehicles. And when they got to Arlington so many people wanted to participate."

      "speaker": "Chris Wallace",
      "utterance": "For years, Worcester paid for all of this out of his own pocket and he started Wreaths Across America, sending hundreds to cemeteries and war memorials around the country. But he will need help to reach his new goal."

      "speaker": "Morrill Worcester",
      "utterance": "I really would, yeah. Some time. I don't know how but hey, you know."

This month, volunteers placed 2.2 million wreaths on veteran's graves at more than 2,000 locations in all 50 states, including 254,000 wreaths here at Arlington National Cemetery. And now, another Christmas tradition. Here's a look from the last few years at the Wallace grandkids as they keep getting bigger and bigger and here they are again. Oh my. We've got Sabine and Livie and Caroline and James and William and Jack who has had a very big year and is walking up a storm. From our family to yours have a very Merry Christmas."
