And also give some kind of background in terms of what was going on during the campaign. You know, at the time, to say, so I'm getting this information. Everything is happening. It almost looks like an episode of 24, Jack Bauer. Like, okay, does somebody have information about the opponent? You're taking some wins then. There's momentum building for Donald Trump in terms of this campaign. And it's going to be him against, you know, Hillary Clinton. So, what, if anything in terms of all of these stories that you're hearing about the Clintons and the Clintons Foundation, all of the above -- you want to try to take it down and see if there's any merit to it.  And I think that's what he was doing and once he found out that this wasn't someone who had any information about that but in fact, the two agenda was to talk about an important topic which is adoptions of, you know, Russian children.

I don't see why this -- if all of this is innocent, why could it not have been talked about several months ago? And I also think he has one other problem. Just in terms of perception. And that is that, a month after the meeting -- he was on Jake Tapper's show and he says anything such as such is ridiculous.  Now, I can understand like maybe not remembering the meeting from a year ago but a month ago and it's Russian and it's weird in saying and like Rob Goldstone and there's actually emails and it says, the government is willing to help you. The Russian government is willing to help you. And he says, I love it. Especially if it's for later in the summer?

Whoever turns down gossip about an enemy -- no one ever does. And you don't even give a damn about the source.  If somebody behind the deli counter says that they got stuff on somebody else, from CNN or MSNBC, you are all ears. And by the way, this stuff is coming from the same place every single day. So, forgive me if I don't get all crazy and panicked over this. Every single time a show is supposed to drop and then that dies down. And it goes away. Just as it's about to die down, the times drops another shoe and then you have Maddow, CNN, and Morning Joe, all falling in line doing the same thing. I've not seen this level of paranoia about the Russians since the 1950s, you know, in the fallout shelter age. But back then, it was the Times defending the Russians. So, they are on this wrong side every single time. This is a pattern. And there might have been a mistake. Yes, maybe he should have talked about it. But get this, not everybody remembers meetings especially when you are busy. When I worked in publishing, I had meetings every month. I had dozens of meetings.   I had meetings with people, publicists who are not to be trusted, trying to tell you that a product works or their products doesn't work. You walk out of that meeting and you go, there is another hour of my life but I will never have. And you never remember it. You don't even -- you think I'm not going to bother anybody with this. I think that this is not a perfect administration but it is a human one. And every mistakes that's being made is a mistake that I would make. And like Donald, Jr., and me, I wasn't running for office. I wasn't involved. You know? I wasn't president or I wasn't running. I wasn't involved in the campaign.

You had districts that use to win by like 8,000 votes, now winning like 25- 30,000 votes in counties in Ohio and Pennsylvania. Of course you don't know that in June of 2016 but if you look back, all of this was totally unnecessary because they were going to win anyway.",

It's from Rob Goldstone, the British tabloid publicist who set up the meeting between Trump, Jr., and that infamous Russian attorney. Goldstone writes, \"This is obviously very high-level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government support for Mr. Trump.\" He goes on to say that it, \"would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and will be very useful to your father.\" Well Trump, Jr. responded by saying, \"if it's what you say, I love it especially later in the summer.\" Obviously closer to the election. Now that has Democrats like Hillary Clinton's former running mate, Senator Tim Kaine using word like perjury and even treason.

I think here he wanted to get out ahead of it and just tell his story to look, I have nothing to hide. This is exactly what happened. How it transpired. This was my thought process. And also give some kind of background in terms of what was going on during the campaign. You know, at the time, to say, so I'm getting this information. Everything is happening. It almost looks like an episode of 24, Jack Bauer. Like, okay, does somebody have information about the opponent? You're taking some wins then. There's momentum building for Donald Trump in terms of this campaign. And it's going to be him against, you know, Hillary Clinton. So, what, if anything in terms of all of these stories that you're hearing about the Clintons and the Clintons Foundation, all of the above -- you want to try to take it down and see if there's any merit to it. And I think that's what he was doing and once he found out that this wasn't someone who had any information about that but in fact, the two agenda was to talk about an important topic which is adoptions of, you know, Russian children. And then that was obviously not what the intent and purpose was."

He's the chair of the Oversight Committee in the House said, if you had all this information, why not give it to us now so that you don't have to like, wait until \"The New York Times\" finds out about it and pushes you to release it. I think it was smart to go on Sean Hannity's show. And I do think Sean asked him some questions that maybe others wouldn't think he might have asked. But I do think there's still some -- I'm not going to call it nefarious but I do think there's some room there to question the timeline as to why this all happened and I also if you go back --"

Well, actually, here's the emails before \"The New York Times\" could actually run the story. I think that lasted for like four hours as a good move. I don't see why this -- if all of this is innocent, why could it not have been talked about several months ago? And I also think he has one other problem. Just in terms of perception. And that is that, a month after the meeting -- he was on Jake Tapper's show and he says anything such as such is ridiculous. Now, I can understand like maybe not remembering the meeting from a year ago but a month ago and it's Russian and it's weird in saying and like Rob Goldstone and there's actually emails and it says, the government is willing to help you. The Russian government is willing to help you. And he says, I love it. Especially if it's for later in the summer? So, I don't think it's nefarious necessarily, I think people can question the judgment but he's questioning his own judgment and said that he would have done it differently if you had a chance to do it over."

If a Russian called Brian Stelter and said we have information on Donald Trump, he climbed on his big wheels and he pedal like the wind. You know whoever turns, by the way, we are all hypocrites. Whoever turns down gossip about an enemy -- no one ever does. And you don't even give a damn about the source. If somebody behind the deli counter says that they got stuff on somebody else, from CNN or MSNBC, you are all ears. And by the way, this stuff is coming from the same place every single day. So, forgive me if I don't get all crazy and panicked over this. Every single time a show is supposed to drop and then that dies down. And it goes away. Just as it's about to die down, the times drops another shoe and then you have Maddow, CNN, and Morning Joe, all falling in line doing the same thing. I've not seen this level of paranoia about the Russians since the 1950s, you know, in the fallout shelter age. But back then, it was the Times defending the Russians. So, they are on this wrong side every single time. This is a pattern. And there might have been a mistake. Yes, maybe he should have talked about it. But get this, not everybody remembers meetings especially when you are busy. When I worked in publishing, I had meetings every month. I had dozens of meetings. I had meetings with people, publicists who are not to be trusted, trying to tell you that a product works or their products doesn't work. You walk out of that meeting and you go, there is another hour of my life but I will never have. And you never remember it. You don't even -- you think I'm not going to bother anybody with this. I think that this is not a perfect administration but it is a human one. And every mistakes that's being made is a mistake that I would make. And like Donald, Jr., and me, I wasn't running for office. I wasn't involved. You know? I wasn't president or I wasn't running. I wasn't involved in the campaign. You know, when I make mistakes, he was just some dude who went to a meeting."

They were running against a very weak candidate and they were able to turn out voters that had not turned out in a long time and then actually switched voters. You had districts that use to win by like 8,000 votes, now winning like 25- 30,000 votes in counties in Ohio and Pennsylvania.

And collusion is only like, we talked about it in the last block, it's secretive or illegal coordination with the attention to deceive. There was no crime here and then there was no deceit. So, the only facts are this woman wasn't connected to the Russian government, she was not a Russian agent and there was nothing discussed about hacking, either. There is some collusion -- if you want to play this game -- between the Ukrainian government and the Clinton campaign. There were meetings at the Ukrainian Embassy. The DNC was involved. This is from Politico. Juan is laughing. From Politico. Ukrainian government officials try to help Hillary Clinton and undermine Trump by publicly crushing his fitness for office and helped research damaging information on Trump, as an advisor and disseminated documents smearing his aides. If she wants to criminalize politics, then the Clinton campaign is going to have to go behind bars too."

Here's the exchange that's probably the most problematic from the White House. It's from Rob Goldstone, the British tabloid publicist who set up the meeting between Trump, Jr., and that infamous Russian attorney. Goldstone writes, \"This is obviously very high-level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government support for Mr. Trump.\" He goes on to say that it, \"would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and will be very useful to your father.\" Well Trump, Jr. responded by saying, \"if it's what you say, I love it especially later in the summer.\" Obviously closer to the election.

It's actually just across the river from New York in Weehawken, New Jersey. The landmark features a bust of Hamilton and the actual boulder where he is said to have rested after he was shot. As you know, he was born in the Caribbean but he died back here in Manhattan as a true New Yorker. And you can visit the treasury secretary's gravesite at Trinity Church near Wall Street."

He is a consultant with Data Analysis Experince, and he created an app called chemoWave, and it's an app that tracks symptoms of patients that help your loved one control side effects. It is free on iTunes. ChemoWaves. Rick Grenell is free of cancer now so that is also very good news."
