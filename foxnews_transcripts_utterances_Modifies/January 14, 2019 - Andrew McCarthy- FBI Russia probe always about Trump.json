      "sentences": "Good evening and welcome to \"Tucker Carlson Tonight.\" We want to bring you the latest on what was really a remarkable story that broke late Friday in The New York Times. We didn't have time to address it then. According to what are, apparently, high-level sources within the Department of Justice, in 2017, the FBI secretly began an investigation into whether the President is in fact a Russian agent.  The FBI apparently believed that President Trump could be a one-man sleeper cell, personally taking direct orders from his handlers in Moscow, and working from within the Oval Office to subvert this country. The FBI said they believe that could have happened, so they spied, apparently, on the President of the United States.  Well, shocking doesn't even begin to describe this story. Nothing like this has ever happened in this country. These allegations are literally without precedent. That is not overstatement.  And, by the way, the allegations are not true. The FBI did not find that Donald Trump is a Russian agent. No charges were ever filed against him. None will be. But an equally important question remains unanswered. How did this happen? Deciding that a sitting President should be investigated for treason is not a small thing. Officials within the FBI had to push for this investigation and then marshal evidence to justify it. Leaders at the very highest levels of the agency had to sign off on the whole thing.  All of that happened. But on what grounds, exactly? That's what we would need to know in order to understand this. Well, thanks to The Times story, we have some sense of the answer. And if you're imagining a secret transmitter covered in Cyrillic scripts discovered, hidden in the Lincoln Bedroom, no. Think again.",

According to the FBI, the words you just heard are evidence that Trump may have betrayed this country. That's their view. But there's another way to look at those words. Maybe Trump is right. Nuclear - Russia, rather, is a nuclear-armed power that's on the other side of the planet. It does not have the power to invade the United States. It can't close international shipping lanes. It does not seriously threaten our key allies like Japan or Great Britain. Is there some reason, then, that we should inherently be in conflict with Russia? Is there moreover vast public support in this country for fighting a proxy war in Syria with the Kremlin?  And how many American parents are anxious to send their kids to die for the territorial integrity of Ukraine, an issue that we're supposed to think is very important? Well outside a few neighborhoods in Washington, not very many people, it turns out.   So, Trump did raise a fair question at that press conference in 2016. In Washington, saying that out loud is considered treason.",

Who knows? By the way, he's allowed to if he wants to. It doesn't make him evil. It just means he disagrees with prevailing orthodoxy in D.C., and that's OK. We're supposed to have spirited debates over questions like this, but no longer. Policy differences are now criminal offenses. Today on CNN, professional dumb person, Max Boot listed 18 reasons that the President may be a Russian spy. If you look to the reasons, a lot of them turned out to be political positions that Boot just doesn't agree with.  Firing Jim Comey, pulling out of Syria, criticizing the European Union, and this is our favorite one we're quoting, \"Supporting populists.\" So, the permanent war caucus in Washington has succeeded in criminalizing dissent from their agenda. That's what this is.   And, by the way, if it were happening in a less-developed country, we'd know exactly what to call it. It's an attempted coup. A political leader gets elected on a platform that law-enforcement agencies don't like, so those agencies try to put him in jail. It happens all the time in other places. Now, it's happening here. Former FBI lawyer and anti-Trump activist, Lisa Page described the FBI's thinking in her closed-door testimony before Congress. Russia is the most dangerous country in the world, Page reportedly said, because Russia works to, \"Weaken our ability, America's ability, and the West's ability to spread our democratic ideals.\" So, spreading our democratic ideals, as with the Iraq War, is now the most important thing that America does, the one thing we must defend at all costs. When did FBI lawyers start talking like neocon propagandists? No wonder Max Boot is on board with this.  Our entire media and political classes are with Max Boot and Lisa Page too. They have lost their minds. This past September, NBC News breathlessly reported that Russia was using, quote, sophisticated microwaves to cause brain damage to U.S. diplomats in Cuba.  No surprise there. Really, it sounds like something those dastardly Russians would do just because. Well now, months later, scientists have determined that the Kremlin probably didn't have anything to do with that. The real culprit? Noise from crickets. And, by the way, not even Russian crickets. Indies short-tailed crickets, non-Slovak crickets. Whatever! The media didn't correct the story. They ignored it, and they moved on. They know who the bad guys are. Evidence does not deter their storyline. Russian espionage is so - so widespread, in fact, that the act of denying that you spied for Russia is now confirmation that you did.   Watch.",

      "sentences": "Does every show on cable news have the same writer? Well, yes, it's the DNC. You've heard the script so many times that it's like background noise, Muzak in an elevator. We never pause to ask the obvious question, which is, does it make sense? Does what they're saying logically add up that Trump is doing the bidding of Russia? I don't know. Let's assess it, just for a second. If you were Russia, let's say you're Vladimir Putin, how would you try to undermine American interest? Well you'd probably try to get America stuck in costly expensive foreign wars. You'd look at Iraq and Afghanistan, you would say, those wars have made America much weaker. Why not try and replicate that experience in, say, Syria and Libya? You might encourage America to do that. You might also encourage the U.S. to adopt a self-destructive energy policy. You'd have the American government sharply restrict the exploration of oil and natural gas in the name of the environment, so that America produces less energy.  Why would you do that? Because global energy prices would rise and the U.S. would have to import more. Who would that benefit? Russia, a petro-state. Their economy is dependent on energy.  But Trump, and this is weird behavior for a secret Russian agent, has done just the opposite of that. The United States, for the first time, in my lifetime, is an energy exporter. In fact, it's the largest producer of oil and gas in the world. Is that good for Russia? No, it's not. Who's pushing the opposite? Oh, weirdly, it's the Left. They're the ones pushing a Green New Deal that would have this country shutting down oil and gas wells across the nation. Huh! Someday we're going to look back in shame and confusion and wonder how so many supposedly smart people went completely off the deep end. That's the task for future historians. For now, it is time for some radical transparency.  Last fall, the President ordered the de-classification and release of Carter Page's FISA application. How did an American citizen who clearly didn't act as an agent for Russia have his phones tapped and his email read by the federal government, on what basis? We have a right to know that. We still don't. So, the President ordered it. He also ordered the un-redacted release of all text messages related to the Russia investigation sent by Jim Comey, Andrew McCabe, Peter Strzok, Lisa Page, and Bruce Ohr, the FBI officials. Well instead of releasing them, the Department of Justice dithered, for reasons that were never really clear. The President got distracted. And we've never seen those documents. It's obvious, at this point, that the reason for not releasing them isn't protecting American national security. They've just leaked the information about the FBI investigation to The New York Times on Friday. Clearly, they have no problem leaking information when it helps them. They haven't been released because those documents might embarrass the FBI.   This endless shadow investigation has caused vastly more harm to this country than any Russian Facebook ad. The President should order the de- classification of all documents related to this. It's clearly an abuse of federal power. If you want to restore confidence in the federal government, bring in some sunlight. Tell the DoJ to do that. And if DoJ personnel refuse to do that, fire them, and replace them with people who understand that they serve elected leaders, which is to say the electorate, which is to say voters, the people, and not the other way around. The President appears afraid to do this. He seems to be intimidated by his own lawyers, but why? What can official Washington do to him now? Call him a Russian agent, plan to impeach him? Too late, they already have. Andy McCarthy is a former Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, and he joins us tonight.  Andy, I don't want to overstate this. But reading the justifications in The Times story for this investigation into a sitting President, it seems like FBI officials disagreed with his policy positions on Russia. Is that an appropriate pretext for a criminal investigation?",

      "sentences": "Over the weekend, a group of Republican lawmakers and their many consultants agonized over the future of the party. They're worried because the Republicans' share of national elections is shrinking. Why is that? Well, focus group experts say it's because of shifting demographics and the GOP must win over more minority voters in order to survive, particularly Hispanic voters, and that's probably true. The question is how do you do it? And the geniuses who run the Republican Party in Washington think there's really only one way to win more Hispanic votes, you need more illegal immigration, and you need to give amnesty right away to those people who are already here illegally. Well Democrats, needless to say, are cheering from the sidelines. They agree with this strongly. It helps them. But is it factually true as a political matter? It's worth thinking about that. A closer look at the numbers suggests that Hispanic opinion on immigration is a lot more complex than they're telling you on television. A Harvard- Harris Poll last summer found that a majority of Hispanics want stricter enforcement of America's immigration laws. According to - according to a Pew survey, meanwhile, only 14 percent of American Hispanics think our country needs more immigrants. Fully a quarter believe America has too many immigrants already. And the most anti-immigration Hispanics of all are those who are foreign- born, less-educated, and speak mostly Spanish. Why is that? It's obvious. These are the very people who face the stiffest competition over wages from future waves of lower-skilled immigrants. So, it turns out that opening the borders is not the key to winning the Hispanic vote. So, what is the key? Well maybe allowing parents to raise their own children. How about that? Turns out, Hispanic voters are for that, passionately. One Pew survey show that 73 percent of Hispanic Americans believe it is better to have one parent stay at home to raise children, rather than having both parents work. That's well above the national average on that question of about 60 percent. Hispanics put their belief into practice too. 38 percent of Hispanic mothers stay at home when their kids are small. That's 9 percent above the national average. So, think about what that means for a minute in political terms. Three-quarters of Hispanic voters believe a parent should stay at home to raise children, but less than half can actually afford to do that. That means there are millions of Hispanic parents who wish they could be at home raising their kids, but they can't be because they can't afford it. So, here's a crazy idea for the Republican Party and its legions of overpaid consultants. Why not work to give these voters what they want most? Why not run on a platform that unites children with their parents at home? 19 unhappy social activists on Twitter would not like this. But who cares? Those people are miserable and pathetic, and there is no reason they should have this level of control over our society. How about ignoring them for once? Republicans ought to make giving parents the choice to raise their own kids their party's top priority. Hispanic voters would love that. Voters of all colors would love that. Why wouldn't they love that? Nothing would make this a happier country. Well now we head to California, which was once the greatest place to live, really, in the world, and it's becoming tougher to live in California by the day. What's happening? Trace Gallagher is on this story for us tonight. Trace?",

Newsom says, this time around, the effort is aimed at providing clean drinking water in some of the state's rural towns and cities. But the Association of California Water Agencies says the tax is unnecessary because the state has many alternate funding solutions. And the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association - Association called the proposal an example of, \"California's knee-jerk reaction to default to a new tax whenever there is a new problem.\" Meantime, California has already banned plastic bags and straws. Now, paper receipts are on the chopping block. One Democratic state lawmaker wants to make it illegal to give out a paper receipt unless the customer specifically wants one.

The French government recently admitted that protesters have destroyed about 60 percent of the speed cameras in all of France. You might think global warming and speed cameras are not related, but they are. Both are weapons our leaders use to bully the population. Elites love to impose gas taxes on everyone else while flying private to conferences in Switzerland, where they worry about melting ice caps. That's obviously a scam. Let's just be honest about it. Speed cameras, meanwhile, are not about safety. Studies have shown they actually increase accidents by making people slow down abruptly. The goal of cameras is not to help you but to take your money. This is government as opposition, government hurting you on purpose for its own gain. Our leaders don't care. Our media don't care either. They live in city centers. They don't drive their own cars, are not affected. Now, the Yellow Vests of France are reacting to this, and they're angry for the same reason so many people all over the world are angry, because their governments have stopped treating the well-being of ordinary people as their top priority. America doesn't have Yellow Vests. The only people who riot in this country are Antifa. So, here's a suggestion. Instead of spending your time, Antifa, screaming at people in restaurants or smashing moss-covered statues, why not knock over a speed camera or two? Yes, it would be vandalism. We're not encouraging it. But at least you might be helping somebody. Of course, they won't do that. They don't fight the system. They fight to preserve it. Well back in America, Democratic Congresswoman, Tulsi Gabbard, announced that she's running for President last week. And since then, she has been savaged by the Left. Gabbard is a veteran of the Iraq War. She's been smeared as a puppet of Bashar Assad in Syria because she opposes keeping American troops in that country. Wow! She's also been accused of bigotry for opposing gay marriage in 2004 when, by the way, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton and every other major Democrat opposed gay marriage. So, what is this really about? Glenn Greenwald is good at thinking through what things are really about. He co-founded The Intercept, and he joins us tonight. Glenn, this is not a defense of Tulsi Gabbard or we're endorsing all of her views or whatever. But I'm just watching this and I'm thinking, when did Tulsi Gabbard get to be the enemy of everyone?

      "utterance": "Good evening and welcome to \"Tucker Carlson Tonight.\" We want to bring you the latest on what was really a remarkable story that broke late Friday in The New York Times. We didn't have time to address it then. According to what are, apparently, high-level sources within the Department of Justice, in 2017, the FBI secretly began an investigation into whether the President is in fact a Russian agent. The FBI apparently believed that President Trump could be a one-man sleeper cell, personally taking direct orders from his handlers in Moscow, and working from within the Oval Office to subvert this country. The FBI said they believe that could have happened, so they spied, apparently, on the President of the United States. Well, shocking doesn't even begin to describe this story. Nothing like this has ever happened in this country. These allegations are literally without precedent. That is not overstatement. And, by the way, the allegations are not true. The FBI did not find that Donald Trump is a Russian agent. No charges were ever filed against him. None will be. But an equally important question remains unanswered. How did this happen? Deciding that a sitting President should be investigated for treason is not a small thing. Officials within the FBI had to push for this investigation and then marshal evidence to justify it. Leaders at the very highest levels of the agency had to sign off on the whole thing. All of that happened. But on what grounds, exactly? That's what we would need to know in order to understand this. Well, thanks to The Times story, we have some sense of the answer. And if you're imagining a secret transmitter covered in Cyrillic scripts discovered, hidden in the Lincoln Bedroom, no. Think again. There were no cloak-and-dagger clues in this case, apparently. The FBI assumed that Donald Trump might be a Russian agent not because of anything he did in secret, but because of things he said in public, very public, standing on a stage, on camera, while running for president. Here's one of them."

      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "That was then-candidate Trump speaking at a press conference in Florida, at Doral, in July of 2016. According to the FBI, the words you just heard are evidence that Trump may have betrayed this country. That's their view. But there's another way to look at those words. Maybe Trump is right. Nuclear - Russia, rather, is a nuclear-armed power that's on the other side of the planet. It does not have the power to invade the United States. It can't close international shipping lanes. It does not seriously threaten our key allies like Japan or Great Britain. Is there some reason, then, that we should inherently be in conflict with Russia? Is there moreover vast public support in this country for fighting a proxy war in Syria with the Kremlin? And how many American parents are anxious to send their kids to die for the territorial integrity of Ukraine, an issue that we're supposed to think is very important? Well outside a few neighborhoods in Washington, not very many people, it turns out. So, Trump did raise a fair question at that press conference in 2016. In Washington, saying that out loud is considered treason."

    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Never spoke ill about Russia. That's the evidence a United States Senator holds up to prove that the President may be working for our enemies. So, maybe Trump does like Russia. Who knows? By the way, he's allowed to if he wants to. It doesn't make him evil. It just means he disagrees with prevailing orthodoxy in D.C., and that's OK. We're supposed to have spirited debates over questions like this, but no longer. Policy differences are now criminal offenses. Today on CNN, professional dumb person, Max Boot listed 18 reasons that the President may be a Russian spy. If you look to the reasons, a lot of them turned out to be political positions that Boot just doesn't agree with. Firing Jim Comey, pulling out of Syria, criticizing the European Union, and this is our favorite one we're quoting, \"Supporting populists.\" So, the permanent war caucus in Washington has succeeded in criminalizing dissent from their agenda. That's what this is. And, by the way, if it were happening in a less-developed country, we'd know exactly what to call it. It's an attempted coup. A political leader gets elected on a platform that law-enforcement agencies don't like, so those agencies try to put him in jail. It happens all the time in other places. Now, it's happening here. Former FBI lawyer and anti-Trump activist, Lisa Page described the FBI's thinking in her closed-door testimony before Congress. Russia is the most dangerous country in the world, Page reportedly said, because Russia works to, \"Weaken our ability, America's ability, and the West's ability to spread our democratic ideals.\" So, spreading our democratic ideals, as with the Iraq War, is now the most important thing that America does, the one thing we must defend at all costs. When did FBI lawyers start talking like neocon propagandists? No wonder Max Boot is on board with this. Our entire media and political classes are with Max Boot and Lisa Page too. They have lost their minds. This past September, NBC News breathlessly reported that Russia was using, quote, sophisticated microwaves to cause brain damage to U.S. diplomats in Cuba. No surprise there. Really, it sounds like something those dastardly Russians would do just because. Well now, months later, scientists have determined that the Kremlin probably didn't have anything to do with that. The real culprit? Noise from crickets. And, by the way, not even Russian crickets. Indies short-tailed crickets, non-Slovak crickets. Whatever! The media didn't correct the story. They ignored it, and they moved on. They know who the bad guys are. Evidence does not deter their storyline. Russian espionage is so - so widespread, in fact, that the act of denying that you spied for Russia is now confirmation that you did. Watch."

The President's tweet couldn't have been scripted better if it was written by Putin himself. Someone has to have told the President that undercutting the FBI, insulting past presidents, and Members of the U.S. government, and criticizing their actions to keep a state safe is really advancing Russia's mission. Our own intelligence community has said that those very things are exactly what Russia is after. So, in the President's response, he's really just making Russia's job easier."

      "utterance": "Does every show on cable news have the same writer? Well, yes, it's the DNC. You've heard the script so many times that it's like background noise, Muzak in an elevator. We never pause to ask the obvious question, which is, does it make sense? Does what they're saying logically add up that Trump is doing the bidding of Russia? I don't know. Let's assess it, just for a second. If you were Russia, let's say you're Vladimir Putin, how would you try to undermine American interest? Well you'd probably try to get America stuck in costly expensive foreign wars. You'd look at Iraq and Afghanistan, you would say, those wars have made America much weaker. Why not try and replicate that experience in, say, Syria and Libya? You might encourage America to do that. You might also encourage the U.S. to adopt a self-destructive energy policy. You'd have the American government sharply restrict the exploration of oil and natural gas in the name of the environment, so that America produces less energy. Why would you do that? Because global energy prices would rise and the U.S. would have to import more. Who would that benefit? Russia, a petro-state. Their economy is dependent on energy. But Trump, and this is weird behavior for a secret Russian agent, has done just the opposite of that. The United States, for the first time, in my lifetime, is an energy exporter. In fact, it's the largest producer of oil and gas in the world. Is that good for Russia? No, it's not. Who's pushing the opposite? Oh, weirdly, it's the Left. They're the ones pushing a Green New Deal that would have this country shutting down oil and gas wells across the nation. Huh! Someday we're going to look back in shame and confusion and wonder how so many supposedly smart people went completely off the deep end. That's the task for future historians. For now, it is time for some radical transparency. Last fall, the President ordered the de-classification and release of Carter Page's FISA application. How did an American citizen who clearly didn't act as an agent for Russia have his phones tapped and his email read by the federal government, on what basis? We have a right to know that. We still don't. So, the President ordered it. He also ordered the un-redacted release of all text messages related to the Russia investigation sent by Jim Comey, Andrew McCabe, Peter Strzok, Lisa Page, and Bruce Ohr, the FBI officials. Well instead of releasing them, the Department of Justice dithered, for reasons that were never really clear. The President got distracted. And we've never seen those documents. It's obvious, at this point, that the reason for not releasing them isn't protecting American national security. They've just leaked the information about the FBI investigation to The New York Times on Friday. Clearly, they have no problem leaking information when it helps them. They haven't been released because those documents might embarrass the FBI. This endless shadow investigation has caused vastly more harm to this country than any Russian Facebook ad. The President should order the de- classification of all documents related to this. It's clearly an abuse of federal power. If you want to restore confidence in the federal government, bring in some sunlight. Tell the DoJ to do that. And if DoJ personnel refuse to do that, fire them, and replace them with people who understand that they serve elected leaders, which is to say the electorate, which is to say voters, the people, and not the other way around. The President appears afraid to do this. He seems to be intimidated by his own lawyers, but why? What can official Washington do to him now? Call him a Russian agent, plan to impeach him? Too late, they already have. Andy McCarthy is a former Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, and he joins us tonight. Andy, I don't want to overstate this. But reading the justifications in The Times story for this investigation into a sitting President, it seems like FBI officials disagreed with his policy positions on Russia. Is that an appropriate pretext for a criminal investigation?"

So just imagine, at the end of 2016, Jim Clapper and John Brennan and Jim Comey sitting in a room saying, \"We don't like Donald Trump's positions. We should open an investigation, and let it leak out later that he's a Russian spy.\" The FBI did this to Henry Wallace in the 1940s.

      "utterance": "Over the weekend, a group of Republican lawmakers and their many consultants agonized over the future of the party. They're worried because the Republicans' share of national elections is shrinking. Why is that? Well, focus group experts say it's because of shifting demographics and the GOP must win over more minority voters in order to survive, particularly Hispanic voters, and that's probably true. The question is how do you do it? And the geniuses who run the Republican Party in Washington think there's really only one way to win more Hispanic votes, you need more illegal immigration, and you need to give amnesty right away to those people who are already here illegally. Well Democrats, needless to say, are cheering from the sidelines. They agree with this strongly. It helps them. But is it factually true as a political matter? It's worth thinking about that. A closer look at the numbers suggests that Hispanic opinion on immigration is a lot more complex than they're telling you on television. A Harvard- Harris Poll last summer found that a majority of Hispanics want stricter enforcement of America's immigration laws. According to - according to a Pew survey, meanwhile, only 14 percent of American Hispanics think our country needs more immigrants. Fully a quarter believe America has too many immigrants already. And the most anti-immigration Hispanics of all are those who are foreign- born, less-educated, and speak mostly Spanish. Why is that? It's obvious. These are the very people who face the stiffest competition over wages from future waves of lower-skilled immigrants. So, it turns out that opening the borders is not the key to winning the Hispanic vote. So, what is the key? Well maybe allowing parents to raise their own children. How about that? Turns out, Hispanic voters are for that, passionately. One Pew survey show that 73 percent of Hispanic Americans believe it is better to have one parent stay at home to raise children, rather than having both parents work. That's well above the national average on that question of about 60 percent. Hispanics put their belief into practice too. 38 percent of Hispanic mothers stay at home when their kids are small. That's 9 percent above the national average. So, think about what that means for a minute in political terms. Three-quarters of Hispanic voters believe a parent should stay at home to raise children, but less than half can actually afford to do that. That means there are millions of Hispanic parents who wish they could be at home raising their kids, but they can't be because they can't afford it. So, here's a crazy idea for the Republican Party and its legions of overpaid consultants. Why not work to give these voters what they want most? Why not run on a platform that unites children with their parents at home? 19 unhappy social activists on Twitter would not like this. But who cares? Those people are miserable and pathetic, and there is no reason they should have this level of control over our society. How about ignoring them for once? Republicans ought to make giving parents the choice to raise their own kids their party's top priority. Hispanic voters would love that. Voters of all colors would love that. Why wouldn't they love that? Nothing would make this a happier country. Well now we head to California, which was once the greatest place to live, really, in the world, and it's becoming tougher to live in California by the day. What's happening? Trace Gallagher is on this story for us tonight. Trace?"

But a similar proposal by former Governor, Jerry Brown, would have run residents $0.95 a month. That measure was abandoned after failing to get support in the legislature. Newsom says, this time around, the effort is aimed at providing clean drinking water in some of the state's rural towns and cities. But the Association of California Water Agencies says the tax is unnecessary because the state has many alternate funding solutions. And the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association - Association called the proposal an example of, \"California's knee-jerk reaction to default to a new tax whenever there is a new problem.\" Meantime, California has already banned plastic bags and straws. Now, paper receipts are on the chopping block. One Democratic state lawmaker wants to make it illegal to give out a paper receipt unless the customer specifically wants one. Supporters say paper receipts are coated in unhealthy chemicals. And, by the way, if this passes, each violation would result in a $25 fine for the businesses. Tucker."

Wouldn't it be nice if we actually got along with, as an example, Russia, I'm all for it.\" So, he says that, reflecting the views, I think, of a lot of Americans, and they say, \"He must be working for Putin.\" What's wrong with that would you say?"

You've read those indictments from some few months ago. And that's tells a very powerful story about Russian interference, alleged, it's an indictment. But it doesn't, and this is - goes to the fundamental point, it doesn't have one word in those 35 pages in one indictment, many pages in the second indictment that suggests collusion. So, there's interference in the - the Trump Administration. So, leave Congress aside. The Trump Administration agrees that there was interference and there are sanctions against Russia, and Russian individuals, because of - of interference. Now, in terms of the report, I'd hope that the report will in fact be a report that is consistent with Department of Justice practice, which is, you don't bring scurrilous charges. You don't make charges against people in reports. You either charge them, that is to say, you file an indictment, or you don't. And I think that's Bob Mueller's ultimate responsibility."

They began as a protest against a gas tax imposed to fight global warming. But now they have a new enemy, speed cameras. The French government recently admitted that protesters have destroyed about 60 percent of the speed cameras in all of France. You might think global warming and speed cameras are not related, but they are. Both are weapons our leaders use to bully the population. Elites love to impose gas taxes on everyone else while flying private to conferences in Switzerland, where they worry about melting ice caps. That's obviously a scam. Let's just be honest about it. Speed cameras, meanwhile, are not about safety. Studies have shown they actually increase accidents by making people slow down abruptly. The goal of cameras is not to help you but to take your money. This is government as opposition, government hurting you on purpose for its own gain. Our leaders don't care. Our media don't care either. They live in city centers. They don't drive their own cars, are not affected. Now, the Yellow Vests of France are reacting to this, and they're angry for the same reason so many people all over the world are angry, because their governments have stopped treating the well-being of ordinary people as their top priority. America doesn't have Yellow Vests. The only people who riot in this country are Antifa. So, here's a suggestion. Instead of spending your time, Antifa, screaming at people in restaurants or smashing moss-covered statues, why not knock over a speed camera or two? Yes, it would be vandalism. We're not encouraging it. But at least you might be helping somebody. Of course, they won't do that. They don't fight the system. They fight to preserve it. Well back in America, Democratic Congresswoman, Tulsi Gabbard, announced that she's running for President last week. And since then, she has been savaged by the Left. Gabbard is a veteran of the Iraq War. She's been smeared as a puppet of Bashar Assad in Syria because she opposes keeping American troops in that country. Wow! She's also been accused of bigotry for opposing gay marriage in 2004 when, by the way, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton and every other major Democrat opposed gay marriage. So, what is this really about? Glenn Greenwald is good at thinking through what things are really about. He co-founded The Intercept, and he joins us tonight. Glenn, this is not a defense of Tulsi Gabbard or we're endorsing all of her views or whatever. But I'm just watching this and I'm thinking, when did Tulsi Gabbard get to be the enemy of everyone? What is going on here?"

But what's really going on is twofold. One is that in 2 - 2016, she resigned from the Democratic National Committee because she accused Debbie Wasserman Schultz and the DNC of cheating on behalf of Hillary, and then supported Bernie Sanders, so Democrats hate her for that. But they also hate her because she's been questioning a lot of Washington orthodoxy that both political parties support, including why it is that we continue to try and change the regimes of countries far away like in Syria, and why we continue to prop up regimes that make the world hate us like we do in Saudi Arabia? So, for better or for worse, she deviates from a lot of the Washington Consensus. She's hard to put into a liberal or a conservative or a right-wing or a left-wing box, and - and that's what Washington really hates the most are people who are kind of independent-minded and critical thinkers."

You can criticize her.
