He was raping her and trafficking her. And also, the Obama administration was responsible for placing young people in human smuggling rings that brought them up to Ohio and were working like seven days a week, 16 hours a day.

And to go and to respond to the comment on The View, to me it belies an ignorance. It's exactly the point. We should care what happened under the prior administration because we should know what the laws are and what the laws aren't, and where the confusion lies, and why a subsequent administration can do things just like a prior one did or didn't.

OK, here's an uncomfortable truth about all of these. In terms of pepper spray and gas, Trump has actually -- sounds to me, Obama did it 80 times? That Trump uses less of it because Trump's stance on immigration was unambiguous. He was metaphorically the wall. He said don't come here. We're going to repel you. We do not believe that you're refugees. We believe you're cutting in line. Therefore, that gave a message fewer people were coming. And therefore, you didn't need to use these kinds of dispersing effects. So, I think, President Obama may have seem more compassionate, but by being ambiguous about the border and not telling people right away what our stance is encouraged people to come, and then you have to disperse them. But the compassionate way is law and order and telling them, look, this is what's going to happen. If you come here, this is what's going to happen. But if you do it the right way because the best answer is compassion and order. That's what we have. That's why we let in hundreds of thousands of people every year because we're compassionate and we have an orderly process.

It's basically for being messy with finances and in any way doing anything wrong with client's dollars. Every single one has to be accounted for appropriately and in line with the contract.

So what I'm trying to say is that the efficiency at the border now and the respect we should have for those who are securing our border physically for us at the southern line right now should be off the charts. And to go and to respond to the comment on The View, to me it belies an ignorance. It's exactly the point. We should care what happened under the prior administration because we should know what the laws are and what the laws aren't, and where the confusion lies, and why a subsequent administration can do things just like a prior one did or didn't.

It's not that they want to do it. That's why the Obama team did it. That is why it's happening. And remember, it's not that the border patrol or the Trump administration that brought the children up.

That is a -- what they're trying to do is say, under Obama, we only shot these things at adults, but the Trump administration, they're aiming at kids. That is not true. That's fake. OK, here's an uncomfortable truth about all of these. In terms of pepper spray and gas, Trump has actually -- sounds to me, Obama did it 80 times? That Trump uses less of it because Trump's stance on immigration was unambiguous. He was metaphorically the wall. He said don't come here. We're going to repel you. We do not believe that you're refugees. We believe you're cutting in line. Therefore, that gave a message fewer people were coming. And therefore, you didn't need to use these kinds of dispersing effects. So, I think, President Obama may have seem more compassionate, but by being ambiguous about the border and not telling people right away what our stance is encouraged people to come, and then you have to disperse them. But the compassionate way is law and order and telling them, look, this is what's going to happen. If you come here, this is what's going to happen. But if you do it the right way because the best answer is compassion and order. That's what we have. That's why we let in hundreds of thousands of people every year because we're compassionate and we have an orderly process. When you violate the process and you rush and you threw bottles and rocks, they're going to shoot -- spray at you, but they're not going to shoot it at kids. They're trying to get the guys who are throwing the bottles, so that's a lie."

So, first of all, not only does he come to the table already with the background being investigated for fraud, being accused of fraud, as well as bankruptcy and issues with funds with his client and his prior firm, but also these single -- or these dove tales, the single largest reason that attorneys are disciplined and or disbarred is for mingling funds. It's basically for being messy with finances and in any way doing anything wrong with client's dollars. Every single one has to be accounted for appropriately and in line with the contract. And he claims, well, the scope has changed and, therefore, you know, I'm sending up this new fund. Well, her contract didn't. And the other largest thing is that the ethics rules are clear. They are staunch that any type of material decision is a client's to make solely. It is never the attorneys.

The one point that you made that struck me is that she says that the defamation suit filed against President Trump was not done with her consent, which would seem like crazy to me.
