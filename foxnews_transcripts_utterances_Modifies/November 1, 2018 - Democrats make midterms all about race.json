I don't think an hour is going to do it, but we have to fit it into an hour so stay right there. States like this are not just front and center ahead of next Tuesday's mid-terms because of a close senate race. They resonate nationally because the issue of immigration has come to the fore once again. Since President Trump has refocused attention on the issue, of course he is being labeled a racist. You just heard him refer to that in his speech tonight in Missouri. And tonight, Hispanic border patrol agent and a family member of a victim of illegal immigrant crime will be here to react.  Plus, where the polls stand now and what ads are actually working the most with voters. The men who know the answer is Tom Bevin, Doug Shawn and Frank Luntz are all here. I cannot wit to talk to them. Everything you need to know in this raining days of this midterms.  And Democrats, by the way, have long decried dark money and dirty tricks and politics. They are always bemoaning that. Well we're going to layout tonight how they are shamelessly engaging in both this mid-term season. It's off the charts. But first, race to the bottom. That's the focus of tonight's ANGLE.  The better Donald Trump does among African-American voters, the more race obsessed the Democrats and their shameless media enablers become. When young African-Americans leaders were recently invited to the White House by the president, they were instantly derided by the left.",

It would be a wall-to-wall news day and night and he and the candidate would be labeled as racist. And a pathetic and a transparent double standard is what we just showed you because you know they are really not going to cover that. That's just some fringe guy making a video.   Democrats like Gillum and Stacey Abrams in Georgia are featured in endless puff pieces across all media. And most of these pieces focus on their race as their biggest selling point for the candidacy. OK, I assume they are about more than that. They have views and they have ideas. But it's always about race and race for the most part alone.  But black Republicans like John James running for senate I Michigan or Omar Qudrat, a Muslim Republican running for congress for California's 52nd district, they are hardly covered at all. So I guess race doesn't matter if you are a Republican. It's not historic at all. The reason again for this leftist race baiting, Trump's policies are working for African-Americans and the results are now beginning to come in. Democrats sense it. They are losing their grip on the black community. Black unemployment is down. Black entrepreneurism is up. And the polls are moving. Check out this new Harvard Harris poll. A year ago, President Trump's approval rating among black Americans was a paltry 10 percent. Today, it's almost triple at 29 percent. And look at this, a year ago, only 17 percent of African-Americans approve of the president's handling of the economy. Today, 40 percent approve of his economic prowess. And this may be the most revealing number of all. On the issue of immigration, 15 percent of black Americans like Trump's approach last year, not great.   This year, again, it's almost doubled, 29 percent approve of Trump's immigration stance. My friends, you might not like everything he tweets, I get that. But Donald Trump is standing up for all Americans. He doesn't care about your skin color. He doesn't care about your ethnicity or what religion you practice. He is about America and that is a good thing. And back to Obama for a moment because he is campaigning all across the country. Aside from his incredible example of being -- he's a great father and himself a historic figure. You have to ask this question, what did Obama actually do, substantively do for black America? African-American wages during his eight years were flat. Obamacare was a complete and total disaster. And he did little to protect the black community from the competition of cheap, illegal labor. Hardly talked about it.   Do not let the race hucksters convince you to embrace the failure of the past. For the Democrats, this is not about protecting minorities. It's about regaining raw political power even if it means turning American against American and stopping the economic revival we've seen, the best I think we've seen in decades across all races and all ethnicities. And that's THE ANGLE.  Joining me to discuss, Kimberley Strassel is a Fox News contributor and editorial board member of the \"Wall Street Journal\" and Niger Innis is a civil rights activist and leader of the Congress for Racial Equality and Jonathan Harris is a liberal analyst. Niger, let's start with you. How effective do you see these strategies in winning over African-American voters in the midterms? Let's start with what the Democrats are doing. Trump's a white nationalist. He cares about whiteness. He's a racist, embracing racist policies. The drum beat across all media today.",

We used to claim that Republicans have latent racism, now you are outright calling them white nationalist.   And there is an electoral strategy behind this and it is the speck. Look, you cited that poll, Democrats continue to argue every time there is a poll that says that African-Americans are supporting Donald Trump in greater numbers. But even they will admit that it has shifted a little bit. And in a race this close where two or three points could be the deciding factor, to have African-Americans come out and vote for Republicans or worse in their mind, simply not come out and vote for Democrats, stay home because they are not animated against Donald Trump.

States like this are not just front and center ahead of next Tuesday's mid-terms because of a close senate race. They resonate nationally because the issue of immigration has come to the fore once again. Since President Trump has refocused attention on the issue, of course he is being labeled a racist. You just heard him refer to that in his speech tonight in Missouri. And tonight, Hispanic border patrol agent and a family member of a victim of illegal immigrant crime will be here to react. Plus, where the polls stand now and what ads are actually working the most with voters. The men who know the answer is Tom Bevin, Doug Shawn and Frank Luntz are all here. I cannot wit to talk to them. Everything you need to know in this raining days of this midterms. And Democrats, by the way, have long decried dark money and dirty tricks and politics. They are always bemoaning that. Well we're going to layout tonight how they are shamelessly engaging in both this mid-term season. It's off the charts. But first, race to the bottom. That's the focus of tonight's ANGLE. The better Donald Trump does among African-American voters, the more race obsessed the Democrats and their shameless media enablers become.

It would be a wall-to-wall news day and night and he and the candidate would be labeled as racist. And a pathetic and a transparent double standard is what we just showed you because you know they are really not going to cover that. That's just some fringe guy making a video. Democrats like Gillum and Stacey Abrams in Georgia are featured in endless puff pieces across all media. And most of these pieces focus on their race as their biggest selling point for the candidacy. OK, I assume they are about more than that. They have views and they have ideas. But it's always about race and race for the most part alone. But black Republicans like John James running for senate I Michigan or Omar Qudrat, a Muslim Republican running for congress for California's 52nd district, they are hardly covered at all. So I guess race doesn't matter if you are a Republican. It's not historic at all. The reason again for this leftist race baiting, Trump's policies are working for African-Americans and the results are now beginning to come in. Democrats sense it. They are losing their grip on the black community. Black unemployment is down. Black entrepreneurism is up. And the polls are moving. Check out this new Harvard Harris poll. A year ago, President Trump's approval rating among black Americans was a paltry 10 percent. Today, it's almost triple at 29 percent. And look at this, a year ago, only 17 percent of African-Americans approve of the president's handling of the economy. Today, 40 percent approve of his economic prowess. And this may be the most revealing number of all. On the issue of immigration, 15 percent of black Americans like Trump's approach last year, not great. This year, again, it's almost doubled, 29 percent approve of Trump's immigration stance. My friends, you might not like everything he tweets, I get that. But Donald Trump is standing up for all Americans. He doesn't care about your skin color. He doesn't care about your ethnicity or what religion you practice. He is about America and that is a good thing. And back to Obama for a moment because he is campaigning all across the country. Aside from his incredible example of being -- he's a great father and himself a historic figure. You have to ask this question, what did Obama actually do, substantively do for black America? African-American wages during his eight years were flat. Obamacare was a complete and total disaster. And he did little to protect the black community from the competition of cheap, illegal labor. Hardly talked about it. Do not let the race hucksters convince you to embrace the failure of the past. For the Democrats, this is not about protecting minorities. It's about regaining raw political power even if it means turning American against American and stopping the economic revival we've seen, the best I think we've seen in decades across all races and all ethnicities. And that's THE ANGLE. Joining me to discuss, Kimberley Strassel is a Fox News contributor and editorial board member of the \"Wall Street Journal\" and Niger Innis is a civil rights activist and leader of the Congress for Racial Equality and Jonathan Harris is a liberal analyst. Niger, let's start with you. How effective do you see these strategies in winning over African-American voters in the midterms? Let's start with what the Democrats are doing. Trump's a white nationalist. He cares about whiteness. He's a racist, embracing racist policies. The drum beat across all media today."

You know, I've been calling it for close to a couple of decades and my father, the great Roy Innis, before me. You know, he called it racial hustling.

But look, the rhetoric here has changed so much this election, Laura. We used to talk of -- the complaint used to be well tougher voter I.D. laws. Let's not move to claims of outright suppression. We used to claim that Republicans have latent racism, now you are outright calling them white nationalist. And there is an electoral strategy behind this and it is the speck. Look, you cited that poll, Democrats continue to argue every time there is a poll that says that African-Americans are supporting Donald Trump in greater numbers. But even they will admit that it has shifted a little bit. And in a race this close where two or three points could be the deciding factor, to have African-Americans come out and vote for Republicans or worse in their mind, simply not come out and vote for Democrats, stay home because they are not animated against Donald Trump. That could be the difference between victory and defeat and that is why you see this rhetoric reaching such extraordinary levels."

I think, you often hear of like there's a hidden trump vote that could move the polls 3 to 5 percent. It's not just whites, you know, that are afraid to tell their pollster that they are voting for Donald Trump.

The problem is we've only had one poll, two polls in October. One of them was completed two weeks ago, so we literally have almost no data in Montana to tell us what's going on there. It seems like it's a close race. Trump has obviously been there. And this could be one of those surprises on election night purely because we don't have really good data on what's going on.

She is also running ads saying, look, with people on camera saying, look, she is not one of those crazy Democrats like Bernie and the others. If this race definitely has a different feel to it. The polls are very, very close. Our Real Clear Politics average has Josh Hawley up two points. But this race is definitely close. You can't really count out McCaskill. She is a hard campaigner, she's a good campaigner. She's obviously doing what she needs to do to try and win this race. But this one feels different.

That being said, the lead in the polls that I have seen is down to somewhere between four and six points. So it's a tossup according to Charlie Cook. It could go either way.

Trump actually got higher slight higher rates in those types of polls as opposed to talking to live pollsters. So there is a big of that effect. We may see it come back here in 2018.

Anonymous and potentially illegal mailers targeting Republican voters in Montana, Indiana, and Missouri attempting to scare them into staying home. And then there is the dark money. The \"New York Times\" reporting on a group called the Hub Project. It's run by Obama alums match with a stated goal of funding progressive candidates to the tune of $30 million this cycle, mostly through anonymous sources. Joining us to discuss is Victor Davis Hanson, senior fellow at the Hoover Institution. Victor, I thought the Democrats were against these practices.  They abhor them. They abjure them."

      "utterance": "No, the parties have switched, Laura. The wealthy and the poor are in the Democratic Party and the middle-class has fled. You can see that in the 2008 and 12 and 16 campaigns. They vastly outraised Republicans. Obama was the first president to refuse public financing of campaigns. He paid a $375,000 penalty for fines. And then you look at the wealthiest 20 counties in the United States, 15 of the 20 are Democratic. The great wealth, Laura, in this country is no longer mining or agriculture or steel. It's high-tech. It's media, it's high finance. So Apple, Google, Amazon, Bloomberg, Facebook. That's why we have $1 billion coming into this race. And I'll just end by thinking that it's not always logical how you spend that money when you have so much of it. Some of it is very sloppy on their part. They feel that Ted Cruz is public enemy number one, maybe Devin Nunes is public enemy number two. And they are pouring $75 million into a Senate race they are probably not going to win that could have been used a lot better elsewhere. But Nunes here where I am in central California, he's sort of Emmanuel Goldstein of \"1984.\" They have two minutes of hate and they're not distributing the funds to candidates that would have a far better chance than his opponent. But you're right about the malfeasance. It's sort of like the ends are so justified, that they are so noble, redistribution, identity politics, equality, that any means necessary to obtain them are considered OK."

We're here in Arizona, immigration ground zero, 40 percent of all illegal drugs come in through Arizona, as you know.  It's a really important state. But the race card being played all day long, and frankly for most of this election cycle against supporters of president and his agenda and so forth. Your final thoughts on that?"

      "utterance": "It's the same idea, though. It's flipped. So the civil rights people that were in large part in the north, at least, Democratic, now they believe that your superficial appearance is essential rather than incidental to your character. And it's conservatives who are live and let live. It's just incidental what a person looks like. They flipped just like the money question that we discussed earlier."

And everyone, I want you to stay there for a preview of a very important \"Ingraham Angle\" from Arizona tonight. We're going to continue right when we come back."

Tomorrow we'll bring you a special focus group of Arizonans of every political stripe to discuss this pressing issue. We'll also talk with Senate candidate Martha McSally as she looks to close the deal versus Kyrsten Sinema. So be sure to turn in. It's going to be a very important \"Ingraham Angle\" tomorrow night. That is all the time we have tonight here. Shannon Bream and the \"Fox News @ Night\" team is there in Washington to take it away. Shannon.
