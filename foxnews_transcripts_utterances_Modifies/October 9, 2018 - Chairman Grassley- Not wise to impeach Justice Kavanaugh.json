Some new comments we've gotten from the president, certainly, do a lot of Washington insiders that sounded like a trial balloon from the president that maybe Ivanka Trump, his daughter, could be the next U.S. ambassador to the U.N.  But a few moments ago, Ivanka Trump herself tweeted out she has no plans to replace Nikki Haley. The president a couple of moments ago told reporters that he has a list of five names. He's only revealing two of those names.  We'll get to that in a moment.   These are big shoes to fill with Nikki Haley. As you mentioned, she's been seen as a rising star in the Republican Party. Also, someone who was thriving on the world stage. As she put it, she was going into the U.N. with body armor every single day. Calling out Russia, Syria, Iran, while also helping to craft the tough talk that was mixed with delicate diplomacy that has brought progress with North Korea.  Now, given Haley a central role in all of those hot spots, it surprised a lot of people. Such an abrupt announcement that Vice President Mike Pence, Chief of Staff John Kelly, had a little inkling this was happening. Usually, big personnel announcements are held until after the midterms.  That enabled the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee Bob Menendez to declare, this suggests more chaos. Saying, \"I am deeply concerned about the leadership vacuum she leaves and the national security impact of her departure at this time of what he calls continued disarray for this administration.\"  Now, the president countered that he got a heads-up about six months ago from Haley that she wanted a breather after jumping right into this big post after a busy tenure as governor of South Carolina and while Haley had been a skeptic of the candidate Trump in 2016.  She decided today unprompted to tell reporters she has no plans to challenge him in 2020. Listen.",

But a few moments ago, the president told reporters, he thinks Grenell is doing such a great job. He may want to keep him in Germany. President would not reveal the other three names. By the way, there's a lot of speculation washing tonight that maybe Haley wants to make a little bit of money. She's been in the public sector for a long time, and then, could run for Senate down the road in South Carolina or even though she shut the door on 2020, she could run for president in 2024.

The fiance waited outside for five hours until finally calling police. Turkish investigators believe Khashoggi was killed shortly after he entered the building and that his body was dismembered and removed. And a Turkish newspaper with ties to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan says on the day Khashoggi went missing two private jets from Saudi Arabia arrived in Turkey carrying 15 Saudi nationals, many of whom went directly to the consulate and returned to the airport a few hours later. Turkish investigators believe this was a Saudi hit team targeting Jamal Khashoggi, But Saudi Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman denies his country had any involvement, saying his government was, quote, \"very keen to know what happened to him.\" To which award-winning journalist Judy Miller writes, quoting, \"There is unfortunately no Arabic word for chutzpah since such an egregious act would undoubtedly have required the brash 33-year-old prince's authorization or acquiescence.\" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is calling for transparency from the Saudi government but the State Department is, for now, holding its opinion.

      "utterance": "That's right, Martha.  And there is some news breaking this hour. Some new comments we've gotten from the president, certainly, do a lot of Washington insiders that sounded like a trial balloon from the president that maybe Ivanka Trump, his daughter, could be the next U.S. ambassador to the U.N. But a few moments ago, Ivanka Trump herself tweeted out she has no plans to replace Nikki Haley. The president a couple of moments ago told reporters that he has a list of five names. He's only revealing two of those names.  We'll get to that in a moment. These are big shoes to fill with Nikki Haley. As you mentioned, she's been seen as a rising star in the Republican Party. Also, someone who was thriving on the world stage. As she put it, she was going into the U.N. with body armor every single day. Calling out Russia, Syria, Iran, while also helping to craft the tough talk that was mixed with delicate diplomacy that has brought progress with North Korea. Now, given Haley a central role in all of those hot spots, it surprised a lot of people. Such an abrupt announcement that Vice President Mike Pence, Chief of Staff John Kelly, had a little inkling this was happening. Usually, big personnel announcements are held until after the midterms.  That enabled the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee Bob Menendez to declare, this suggests more chaos. Saying, \"I am deeply concerned about the leadership vacuum she leaves and the national security impact of her departure at this time of what he calls continued disarray for this administration.\" Now, the president countered that he got a heads-up about six months ago from Haley that she wanted a breather after jumping right into this big post after a busy tenure as governor of South Carolina and while Haley had been a skeptic of the candidate Trump in 2016. She decided today unprompted to tell reporters she has no plans to challenge him in 2020. Listen."

That would be Dina Powell, former deputy national security advisor here at the White House, close with Ivanka Trump. Rick Grenell, he's won praise as ambassador to Germany, for not just getting tough with Iran, but also tough with European companies trying to do business with Iran. But a few moments ago, the president told reporters, he thinks Grenell is doing such a great job. He may want to keep him in Germany. President would not reveal the other three names. By the way, there's a lot of speculation washing tonight that maybe Haley wants to make a little bit of money. She's been in the public sector for a long time, and then, could run for Senate down the road in South Carolina or even though she shut the door on 2020, she could run for president in 2024. Martha?"

She had her differences with Donald Trump. But she did not go the never Trump route that so many other people did. She thought about how to work with him to improve the country and also serve the Republican Party.

But let's say they were policy reasons, there is policy disagreements of some kind. It wouldn't it be refreshing the fact that we don't know that she didn't go decide and leaked them and publicly air her differences. I remember when the -- when that the senior official wrote that infamous op-ed in the New York Times, she wrote a counter op-ed in The Washington Post in which she said, \"I'm also a senior official in the Trump administration. I support the president, his direction, but we don't agree on everything. And when I disagree with him, I pick up the phone and call him, and tell him.\" So, if there was a policy difference here, what a classy lady that she didn't air that -- air those differences in any way in the public but just told the president to his face."

Those things carry with them a lot of foreign policy risks. So, for someone who I think most analysts myself included would suggest probably does have further ambitions somewhere down the line, it might be prudent to step away now with this record of very clear success, moral clarity being a powerful voice for the country on the world stage."

But Dina Powell is clearly somebody that the family likes and would probably be supportive of and here's a picture that was on Nikki Haley's Twitter feed just a couple of weeks ago, I believe. It was Saturday. Her, with Dina Powell, and Dina Powell's husband as she is showing the couple some of her favorite places in South Carolina. So, anything to read into that?"

I think it's really important to have in this position someone who can act as a surrogate of the president, who really shares that foreign policy vision that was so powerful and got so many Republicans excited. A turn away from the previous 16 years of warfighting mistakes. And so, I think, Richard Grenell would be a great example. He has that experience from the Bush White House. He served in the U.N. for eight years there.  And yet, he also was a strong proponent of Donald Trump, and he really seems to get him and his impulses."

And in many cases, they've not done very well because globalization hasn't been done very well. Some of the trade and immigration and market policies have not been ideal.

And his 20 -- 12 years on the D.C. circuit court of appeals, nobody said that he wasn't qualified to be. So when they couldn't this keep him off the bench, by pointing out that he wasn't qualified, then they threw everything at him that he could. They threw it on the wall, if it didn't stick on Monday, they threw something on the wall on Tuesday. If it didn't stick, it came back with something.

But I want to remind you between 1789 and about 2001, there wasn't filibusters of Supreme Court justices. And then, Schumer gave the same speech that we can bring ideology into it. That poisoned the well. He wanted to make sure that George W. Bush didn't get a Hispanic on the card. And so, you know, it establishes a pattern through eight years of George W. Bush. And then obviously, it was continued by Republicans when there was a Democrat president and it continues today. I would like to have somebody to sit down with me that's a Democrat, and say, you know, we've had enough of this. We are going to go back to the way that judges were viewed between 1789 and the year 2001 that ideology didn't pay a major role. It was only based upon your confidence and you and your judicial temperament. In other words, were you going to be a judge or were you going to be a super legislature? That's basically what went into it. And this thing has been an uproar since then. You know, some people would say well, Grassley, you're wrong, look at the way they treated Bork, yes. Look at the way they treated Thomas, yes. But then there was a period of time during the 1990s when there seem to be common sense prevailed and Ginsburg and Breyer were approved almost unanimously. And then all of a sudden George Bush gets elected president, the Supreme Court decides he ought to be president, instead of recounting millions and millions of votes, and that's when Schumer gave his speech and that's why the well has been poisoned since."

The fiance waited outside for five hours until finally calling police. Turkish investigators believe Khashoggi was killed shortly after he entered the building and that his body was dismembered and removed. And a Turkish newspaper with ties to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan says on the day Khashoggi went missing two private jets from Saudi Arabia arrived in Turkey carrying 15 Saudi nationals, many of whom went directly to the consulate and returned to the airport a few hours later. Turkish investigators believe this was a Saudi hit team targeting Jamal Khashoggi, But Saudi Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman denies his country had any involvement, saying his government was, quote, \"very keen to know what happened to him.\" To which award-winning journalist Judy Miller writes, quoting, \"There is unfortunately no Arabic word for chutzpah since such an egregious act would undoubtedly have required the brash 33-year-old prince's authorization or acquiescence.\" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is calling for transparency from the Saudi government but the State Department is, for now, holding its opinion.

Quote, \"I knew that key issues would be whether the judge had a pattern of similar behavior since that helps establish who is telling the truth when there's a standoff and whether there were corroborators on either side. Knowing this is why Ronan Farrow and I were so alert to the significance of other accusers such as Deborah Ramirez. Her allegations show that if true, yes, there was a pattern of misconduct, and likely another side of the judge.\" Here now Tom Shillue and Kat Timpf, both are Fox News contributor.
