      "sentences": "All right. Welcome to this big breaking news edition of HANNITY live from Miami. Hello, Miami!  All right. We begin tonight, a Fox News alert. Tonight, the witch hunt, the Schumer-Schiff sham show, it is thankfully for the sake of the country, over.  The United States Senate, they officially voted to deny the Democrats' latest witness stunt. And the final vote to acquit the president is now inevitable, will take place, now, we expect 4:00 p.m. Wednesday afternoon.  The country can now hopefully finally move on from this fact-free, partisan impeachment sham that will go down in history as one of the biggest and single most embarrassing Democratic blunders of all time. Now, this three-year-long never-ending temper-tantrum, it will be over Wednesday. The damage to the country as of tonight, incalculable. The exact same people, those people that lied, Russia, Russia, Russia, impeach, impeach, collusion, collusion, three years of this, those that advanced their conspiracy theories almost daily, those that totally ignored what was the biggest single abuse of power, corruption scandal in history, those who ignored the dirty dossier, premeditated fraud on the FISA court to deny one American his civil liberties, his constitutional rights, those that were for spying on a presidential candidate illegally, his the transition team, deep into the Trump presidency, those same people, and, of course, their allies, the media mob, they failed at that what that was the latest coup attempt.  Now, all while they have not lifted a single finger at all to help you, we, the American people -- didn't create a single job, they didn't make us any more safe, or secure, or prosperous. They have dragged this out. They're being their usual immature selves. Clearly, their hatred of President Trump now surpasses their desire to do anything for the American people as evidence by the last three years.  This is actually a sad and a very dangerous chapter we are closing in this country's history.   Earlier today, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, he secured the vote to block further witnesses and prevent further distraction. In other words, they didn't take on what's the sole constitutional role of the House, to impeach. And, by the way, now, that the end is in sight, it cannot be soon enough, after key GOP senators, Lamar Alexander, Lisa Murkowski, announced their opposition to caving to the Democrats' latest, last-minute Hail Mary for what? More witnesses? We had the opinion witnesses, hearsay witnesses. The only one fact witness says, what did the president want? Nothing, no quid or pro or quo, like Joe.   They did exactly what the United States Constitution as Professor Dershowitz rightly pointed out, required of them. Senator Murkowski released the statement very powerful, reading, quote: The House chose to send articles of impeachment that are rushed and flawed. I carefully considered the need for additional witnesses and documents to cure the shortcomings of its process, but ultimately decided that I will vote against considering motions to subpoena. And, last night, Senator Lamar Alexander tweeting: If this shallow, hurried, wholly partisan impeachment were to succeed, it would rip the country apart, pouring gasoline on the fire of cultural division that already exists. It would create the weapon of perpetual impeachment to be used against future presidents whenever the House of Representatives is on -- of a different political party.  Senators, thank you. Thank you for standing for the American people. Thank you for standing for truth, for facts, for fairness. Thank you for standing against what is a rage-fueled partisan witch hunt. Thank you for standing for our Constitution.   Any effort to extend their charade any longer is not a waste of time; it puts a further divide in this country. All right. Here with the very latest -- he has been a very colorful voice throughout this entire process -- Texas Senator Ted Cruz is with us.  Senator, good to see you. I applaud your colleagues. I applaud you the entire time. I'm a little bewildered why we have to wait until Wednesday, to be honest, but I guess we all know what will happen by then.",

The vote we had today, not to extend the trial, not to have yet more additional witnesses, we already had 18 witnesses testify in the House, we've seen thousands of pages of documents that the House managers and the White House defense lawyers focused on. And throughout all of it, the House managers never prove their case. And so, their strategy, as you know, was just a Hail Mary. If they haven't proven their case, their only hope was: bring additional witnesses, drag it out weeks or months, and go on a fishing expedition, hope that somebody said something that would give them some basis for impeachment because they haven't proven it.  And this was a vote for the Republicans -- we're right on the edge, and today, holding 51 of the majority to say, we're done, we got enough, this is over. That means were headed straight to Wednesday afternoon, a vote on the final judgment. And the president is going to be acquitted of these charges and he should be.",

      "sentences": "Well, look, I'll return the compliment on Alan Dershowitz. He was my professor on law school, was a phenomenal -- in fact, he was my professor in criminal law 101, the very first week of law school, and was an amazing teacher.   And I think his presentation of the Senate was one of the most impactful presentations of the entire trial. And in particular, he walked through the history of what the Constitution requires. This is not just a vote on whether you like the president or not, whether you agree with the president or not, whether your politics are the same. This is a vote over whether the constitutional standard is met, and the Constitution says for impeachment, that the only grounds for impeachment are treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.  And what Professor Dershowitz walked through very effectively and actually before him what Ken Starr walked through very effectively, is that the constitutional threshold requires a grave, serious crime of the level of treason or bribery.  House managers didn't even try to allege a crime and they certainly didn't prove one and that's why as a matter of law. And, by the way, we did this whole digression on quid pro quo and all the discussion about additional witnesses whether there was a quid pro quo, whether there wasn't a quid pro quo, as a matter of law, it didn't matter. It was a side diversion. That was one of the things we clarify during the questioning period that I think it was fairly critical to getting the four votes to end, to not have additional witnesses, is that we asked, actually Lindsey Graham and I together wrote the question asking, even if you assume, for the sake of argument, that there was a quid pro quo, does not change the legal analysis, is this a high crime or misdemeanor? And the president's lawyers answered exactly right, that even if it were a quid pro quo -- you got disputed testimony on that -- it doesn't matter because the president has the authority to investigate corruption, and there was more than sufficient evidence of potential corruption with Burisma and the Bidens for the president to ask for an investigation on it.",

Some people need to learn what is in the Constitution. We all needed a reminder.   By the way, now, remember, how did we get here in the first place? Remember the complaint, non-whistle-blower, hearsay whistle-blower, whistle-blower that Schiff lied about ever having contact with. Oh, we'd love to hear from the whistle-blower when in fact his office had. It was secret depositions in the basement of the Capitol. These were the audition witnesses.  Schiff, he had the chance to call any witness he wanted, every Democrat could have called the witnesses they wanted. Well, where you got to hand-pick, you know, and, from the people you heard from, selectively leaking, and literally lying, without any GOP input, all of the considerations, due process, considerations that New Gingrich and the Republicans gave in the case of Bill Clinton, and Bill Clinton's attorneys were denied Donald Trump and his attorneys. And after all of that, the congenital liar and his band of Democrats, they still were begging the Senate now to do the House's job for them. Again, the House conducts the impeachment proceeding. That is their sole constitutional power. The Senate's duty is to examine the evidence and render a verdict after a trial.   So, it means the time has now come and it is here, to end this madness once and for all. For the Democrats, it means even more anxiety, more desperation, more pouting, more temper tantrums, and party infighting. Just look at what happened on the Senate floor last night. You can't make this up. You have the congenital liar Schiff going after nutty Nadler and trying to stop him from speaking.   Take a look.",

After that temper tantrum which is really been going on for three years, the president tweeted, quote: Nadler ripped final argument away from Schiff because he thinks Schiff did a terrible job. They are fighting big time.  Nancy Pelosi, by the way, is total complete meltdown mode, upset that the president's words did an amazing job, his entire team did an amazing job dismantling the Democrats pathetically weak case and she claims that they should actually be disbarred. Wow. Now, it's complete lunacy, unhinged, rage, panic, and all of the above, and it's all built of dysfunction. This has gone on for three long years. Why? Facts were on the president's side. The Democrats, well, the truth was the enemy for them.  Because the four facts that Jim Jordan always reminded all of us will never change. The four facts that exposed everything the Democrats have been lying to you about, and the mob and the media doesn't want you to hear. No linkage between aid and investigation during the phone call, aid was never mentioned. Zelinsky and Trump said, no, there was never any pressure. No one in Ukraine even knew that there was a slight pause as it relates to aid. And Ukraine took zero action, nothing, they did nothing, to get the aid. They announced nothing. In other words, they didn't announce an investigation and they got the aid. And don't forget, after that, there were five significant high-profile meetings after the July 25th call where no linkage to aid again was ever discussed. And it gets even better because the Democrats accusing the president of, well, in this particular case is exactly what they were caught doing, because Democrats were working with Ukraine to try to dig up dirt on the Trump campaign and the DNC operative, Alexandra Chalupa, remember, she went to the Ukrainian embassy chronicled in the January 11th 2017 \"Politico\" article, yes, to dig up dirt on Trump and his associates and sabotage the Trump campaign and, oh, by the way, help Hillary Clinton win. It was Schiff who was caught on tape, remember that? Colluding with a guy he thought was a Russian who had dirt on Donald Trump to impact the election.  What do you have on Donald? Compromising materials. What's the nature of it? Pictures of naked Trump. Did Vladimir see them?  He's the only one caught on tape colluding with Russians. The only one that paid for Russian misinformation was Hillary Clinton and the dirty dossier that became bulk of information to spy on the president's campaign and transition team and presidency.",

Today's average is at almost 45 percent, so the average of approval has gone up.

      "utterance": "All right. Welcome to this big breaking news edition of HANNITY live from Miami. Hello, Miami! All right. We begin tonight, a Fox News alert. Tonight, the witch hunt, the Schumer-Schiff sham show, it is thankfully for the sake of the country, over. The United States Senate, they officially voted to deny the Democrats' latest witness stunt. And the final vote to acquit the president is now inevitable, will take place, now, we expect 4:00 p.m. Wednesday afternoon. The country can now hopefully finally move on from this fact-free, partisan impeachment sham that will go down in history as one of the biggest and single most embarrassing Democratic blunders of all time. Now, this three-year-long never-ending temper-tantrum, it will be over Wednesday. The damage to the country as of tonight, incalculable. The exact same people, those people that lied, Russia, Russia, Russia, impeach, impeach, collusion, collusion, three years of this, those that advanced their conspiracy theories almost daily, those that totally ignored what was the biggest single abuse of power, corruption scandal in history, those who ignored the dirty dossier, premeditated fraud on the FISA court to deny one American his civil liberties, his constitutional rights, those that were for spying on a presidential candidate illegally, his the transition team, deep into the Trump presidency, those same people, and, of course, their allies, the media mob, they failed at that what that was the latest coup attempt. Now, all while they have not lifted a single finger at all to help you, we, the American people -- didn't create a single job, they didn't make us any more safe, or secure, or prosperous. They have dragged this out. They're being their usual immature selves. Clearly, their hatred of President Trump now surpasses their desire to do anything for the American people as evidence by the last three years. This is actually a sad and a very dangerous chapter we are closing in this country's history. Earlier today, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, he secured the vote to block further witnesses and prevent further distraction. In other words, they didn't take on what's the sole constitutional role of the House, to impeach. And, by the way, now, that the end is in sight, it cannot be soon enough, after key GOP senators, Lamar Alexander, Lisa Murkowski, announced their opposition to caving to the Democrats' latest, last-minute Hail Mary for what? More witnesses? We had the opinion witnesses, hearsay witnesses. The only one fact witness says, what did the president want? Nothing, no quid or pro or quo, like Joe. They did exactly what the United States Constitution as Professor Dershowitz rightly pointed out, required of them."

Thank you for standing for the American people. Thank you for standing for truth, for facts, for fairness. Thank you for standing against what is a rage-fueled partisan witch hunt. Thank you for standing for our Constitution. Any effort to extend their charade any longer is not a waste of time; it puts a further divide in this country. All right. Here with the very latest -- he has been a very colorful voice throughout this entire process -- Texas Senator Ted Cruz is with us. Senator, good to see you. I applaud your colleagues. I applaud you the entire time. I'm a little bewildered why we have to wait until Wednesday, to be honest, but I guess we all know what will happen by then."

      "utterance": "Well, Sean, that's exactly right. I think the last 24 hours were pivotal. For all intents and purposes, this impeachment process is over. The vote we had today, not to extend the trial, not to have yet more additional witnesses, we already had 18 witnesses testify in the House, we've seen thousands of pages of documents that the House managers and the White House defense lawyers focused on."
    },

      "utterance": "bring additional witnesses, drag it out weeks or months, and go on a fishing expedition, hope that somebody said something that would give them some basis for impeachment because they haven't proven it. And this was a vote for the Republicans -- we're right on the edge, and today, holding 51 of the majority to say, we're done, we got enough, this is over. That means were headed straight to Wednesday afternoon, a vote on the final judgment. And the president is going to be acquitted of these charges and he should be."

      "utterance": "And you had -- I know now the congenital liar, you had Jerry Nadler, they kept repeating, we have so proven our case beyond any reasonable doubt. I want to stick to the constitutional aspects of this. Now, Professor Dershowitz did say you were one of his best students, and he's going to join us on set here a little bit, but there are constitutional concerns here. The power constitutionally, the sole power to impeach, that lies with the House. The sole power for the trial lies with the Senate."

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "I could not understand the argument, if they totally, completely prove their case went beyond any reasonable doubt and the case is a slam- dunk case, why they were trying to get your body, the United States Senate, to take on the constitutional role of the House when they rushed it through so urgently so that they could go on vacation and then hold it back from the Senate for so long?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CRUZ",
      "utterance": "Well, look, I'll return the compliment on Alan Dershowitz. He was my professor on law school, was a phenomenal -- in fact, he was my professor in criminal law 101, the very first week of law school, and was an amazing teacher. And I think his presentation of the Senate was one of the most impactful presentations of the entire trial. And in particular, he walked through the history of what the Constitution requires. This is not just a vote on whether you like the president or not, whether you agree with the president or not, whether your politics are the same. This is a vote over whether the constitutional standard is met, and the Constitution says for impeachment, that the only grounds for impeachment are treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors. And what Professor Dershowitz walked through very effectively and actually before him what Ken Starr walked through very effectively, is that the constitutional threshold requires a grave, serious crime of the level of treason or bribery. House managers didn't even try to allege a crime and they certainly didn't prove one and that's why as a matter of law. And, by the way, we did this whole digression on quid pro quo and all the discussion about additional witnesses whether there was a quid pro quo, whether there wasn't a quid pro quo, as a matter of law, it didn't matter. It was a side diversion. That was one of the things we clarify during the questioning period that I think it was fairly critical to getting the four votes to end, to not have additional witnesses, is that we asked, actually Lindsey Graham and I together wrote the question asking, even if you assume, for the sake of argument, that there was a quid pro quo, does not change the legal analysis, is this a high crime or misdemeanor? And the president's lawyers answered exactly right, that even if it were a quid pro quo -- you got disputed testimony on that -- it doesn't matter because the president has the authority to investigate corruption, and there was more than sufficient evidence of potential corruption with Burisma and the Bidens for the president to ask for an investigation on it."

I took a second class from him called \"Thinking About Thinking\" that was co- taught with him and Stephen Jay Gould and Robert Nozick, world famous philosopher, and I think I got an A-plus in that one. So, you can average those two out."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "An A-plus, wow. OK, that averages to an, A -- B-plus, A-plus. All right. Senator, you did great work. You educated the public. Thank you for your -- your duty basically. Some people need to learn what is in the Constitution. We all needed a reminder. By the way, now, remember, how did we get here in the first place? Remember the complaint, non-whistle-blower, hearsay whistle-blower, whistle-blower that Schiff lied about ever having contact with. Oh, we'd love to hear from the whistle-blower when in fact his office had. It was secret depositions in the basement of the Capitol. These were the audition witnesses. Schiff, he had the chance to call any witness he wanted, every Democrat could have called the witnesses they wanted. Well, where you got to hand-pick, you know, and, from the people you heard from, selectively leaking, and literally lying, without any GOP input, all of the considerations, due process, considerations that New Gingrich and the Republicans gave in the case of Bill Clinton, and Bill Clinton's attorneys were denied Donald Trump and his attorneys. And after all of that, the congenital liar and his band of Democrats, they still were begging the Senate now to do the House's job for them. Again, the House conducts the impeachment proceeding. That is their sole constitutional power. The Senate's duty is to examine the evidence and render a verdict after a trial. So, it means the time has now come and it is here, to end this madness once and for all. For the Democrats, it means even more anxiety, more desperation, more pouting, more temper tantrums, and party infighting. Just look at what happened on the Senate floor last night. You can't make this up. You have the congenital liar Schiff going after nutty Nadler and trying to stop him from speaking. Take a look."

After that temper tantrum which is really been going on for three years, the president tweeted, quote: Nadler ripped final argument away from Schiff because he thinks Schiff did a terrible job. They are fighting big time. Nancy Pelosi, by the way, is total complete meltdown mode, upset that the president's words did an amazing job, his entire team did an amazing job dismantling the Democrats pathetically weak case and she claims that they should actually be disbarred. Wow. Now, it's complete lunacy, unhinged, rage, panic, and all of the above, and it's all built of dysfunction. This has gone on for three long years. Why? Facts were on the president's side. The Democrats, well, the truth was the enemy for them. Because the four facts that Jim Jordan always reminded all of us will never change. The four facts that exposed everything the Democrats have been lying to you about, and the mob and the media doesn't want you to hear. No linkage between aid and investigation during the phone call, aid was never mentioned. Zelinsky and Trump said, no, there was never any pressure. No one in Ukraine even knew that there was a slight pause as it relates to aid. And Ukraine took zero action, nothing, they did nothing, to get the aid. They announced nothing. In other words, they didn't announce an investigation and they got the aid. And don't forget, after that, there were five significant high-profile meetings after the July 25th call where no linkage to aid again was ever discussed. And it gets even better because the Democrats accusing the president of, well, in this particular case is exactly what they were caught doing, because Democrats were working with Ukraine to try to dig up dirt on the Trump campaign and the DNC operative, Alexandra Chalupa, remember, she went to the Ukrainian embassy chronicled in the January 11th 2017 \"Politico\" article, yes, to dig up dirt on Trump and his associates and sabotage the Trump campaign and, oh, by the way, help Hillary Clinton win. It was Schiff who was caught on tape, remember that? Colluding with a guy he thought was a Russian who had dirt on Donald Trump to impact the election. What do you have on Donald? Compromising materials. What's the nature of it? Pictures of naked Trump. Did Vladimir see them? He's the only one caught on tape colluding with Russians. The only one that paid for Russian misinformation was Hillary Clinton and the dirty dossier that became bulk of information to spy on the president's campaign and transition team and presidency."

I started my speech by saying Nixon should have been impeached, he was running, but he committed crimes. The point I was making the president has done nothing illegal.

But I thought one of the best themes out of the president's defense team was that the Democrats are trying to take the vote away from the American people. And people out there know it. The only reason the president was impeached was because the Democrats had more votes in the House. But if you look at the Real Clear Politics average of President Trump's approval rating, in October 2019, it was 41.5 percent or so. Today's average is at almost 45 percent, so the average of approval has gone up. Keep in mind, everybody, President Trump's approval rating in 2016 on Election Day was 37 percent, which means he starting with plus seven-point advantage in the middle of an impeachment trial. So, look, I don't think it's going to -- I think it's not going to hurt the president. I think, in fact, it shows to the American people how much he's had to put up with for the last three years."

So, from a legal perspective, the first one that Schumer is saying, no witnesses, no documents, that's a lie. There were 18 witnesses in the House inquiry. Over the course of the nine days of arguments and opening statements, we heard 192 clips of testimony from 13 witnesses in over 28,000 documents were given in the house record to the Senate.
