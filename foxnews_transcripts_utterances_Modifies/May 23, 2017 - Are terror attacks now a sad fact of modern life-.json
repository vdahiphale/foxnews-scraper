A lot of fast-moving developments today after last night's horrific terror attack in Manchester, England. Police are now naming the bomber as 22-year-old Salman Abedi. Abedi was born in the U.K., but is the son of a Libyan refugee family. A massive hunt is now underway for accomplices. Fox News correspondent, Rick Leventhal joins us from Manchester with the very latest. Rick?",

So there is clearly concerned there could be a follow on attack which is awful news for the residents of the United Kingdom, and certainly for the half a million people who live here in Manchester who suffered through a horrific attack, roughly 23 hours ago. The scene much different here now behind me, you could see police are still here, the road is still close, but no screams, no sirens.  And the train station, Victoria Station, one of two main transit hub here also closed. It is connected directly to the Manchester arena, the largest indoor concert venue in the U.K., it's believed that the bomber blew himself up somewhere right between the train station and the concert venue in a public area there, just as a pack house of 21,000 people began streaming for the exits, and those people were mostly teens and preteens who had just enjoyed a Ariana Grande concert and then were headed for the exits when this suspect blew himself up with an improvised explosive device that included nuts and bolts to maximize the carnage.  The victims included 18-year-old Georgina Bethany Colander. She was a student who loved pop music and Ariana Grande, and in fact had met her a couple years ago and posted their picture together on Instagram. Another victim, an 8-year-old girl named Saffie Rose Roussos, who is mom and sisters were among the dozens of wounded, and they are among those dozens now being treated at eight area hospitals. Here's more from the prime minister who spoke just a short time ago.",

The venue: an Ariana Grande concert where the audience was predominantly young people. Twenty-two dead so far, some as young as an 8-year-old little girl. The killer, Salman Abedi, the son of Libyan refugees turned ISIS terrorist, and that's not irrelevant. The son of refugees. Last night's attack was the fifth terror attack in Europe so far just this year, and recently, recall the Bataclan concert hall in Paris, where ISIS fighters gunned down 130. To Nice, where a truck driven by an ISIS supporter barreled through a Bastille Day celebration, killing 85 innocent people. Brussels Christmas market, Westminster Bridge and on and on and on. But what's happening in Europe? For years, Europe has had an open border policy, free to travel from European country to European country without a visa and unchecked. Add to that an extremely liberal immigration policy. In Germany alone, Angela Merkel is allowing a million Syrian refugees into their country. Now, check out the pictures, and you see mostly young men flooding into Germany, potentially an army of jihadists, now able to move freely throughout Europe. Simply put, that's an insane immigration policy. Meanwhile, here at home, Trump is trying to limit these potential terrorists from entering the United States. It's not a Muslim ban. It's a ban on a country of origin, a moratorium, actually. After all, there's no doubt. Many of them hate us. No doubt many of them may even want to kill us. So wake up, America. Wake up, liberals. And wake up, Ninth Circuit Court judge. While you fight Trump over political correctness, you make us less safe right here in America, period. Because radical Islamic terrorists are right now plotting ways to get to America and carry out their jihad. There's no reasoning with this evil. Once they're here, they're here. We cannot let them in or terror will hit us here at home, just like it is in Europe. Kat -- I'm going to start with Kat. So it gets a little hard-core there. But isn't that really the essence of it?

A lot of fast-moving developments today after last night's horrific terror attack in Manchester, England. Police are now naming the bomber as 22-year-old Salman Abedi. Abedi was born in the U.K., but is the son of a Libyan refugee family. A massive hunt is now underway for accomplices. Fox News correspondent, Rick Leventhal joins us from Manchester with the very latest. Rick?"

      "speaker": "RICK LEVENTHAL, FOX NEWS",
      "utterance": "Hey, Eric. We've just learned that the British prime minister has raised the threat level from severe to critical. So there is clearly concerned there could be a follow on attack which is awful news for the residents of the United Kingdom, and certainly for the half a million people who live here in Manchester who suffered through a horrific attack, roughly 23 hours ago. The scene much different here now behind me, you could see police are still here, the road is still close, but no screams, no sirens. And the train station, Victoria Station, one of two main transit hub here also closed. It is connected directly to the Manchester arena, the largest indoor concert venue in the U.K., it's believed that the bomber blew himself up somewhere right between the train station and the concert venue in a public area there, just as a pack house of 21,000 people began streaming for the exits, and those people were mostly teens and preteens who had just enjoyed a Ariana Grande concert and then were headed for the exits when this suspect blew himself up with an improvised explosive device that included nuts and bolts to maximize the carnage. The victims included 18-year-old Georgina Bethany Colander. She was a student who loved pop music and Ariana Grande, and in fact had met her a couple years ago and posted their picture together on Instagram. Another victim, an 8-year-old girl named Saffie Rose Roussos, who is mom and sisters were among the dozens of wounded, and they are among those dozens now being treated at eight area hospitals. Here's more from the prime minister who spoke just a short time ago."

And he's a former Republican presidential candidate, a conservative and radio talk show host, and he's the former chairman of Godfather's Pizza, but his specialty is rocket science, and I'm not kidding, Herman Cain is here. I will get to the specialists in a second. But Eboni, I want to first talk to you about Theresa May raising the threat level from severe to critical, basically saying they believe another terror attack is imminent."

And of course, it's an attack there, but it's an attack on us, and an attack on our way of life. I love that President Trump called them losers. I think that's great. Do they want to be called monsters? I think we need to be careful, although it is terrifying thing to not let that interfere with our way of life as much as possible."

And President Trump's initiative to do better vetting and control who comes into this country, now the people who are against that it makes them look stupid quite frankly. Because that's the one thing we can do. We can do better vetting and we can know who's here, and we can know who's overstayed their visas, but because of pushback politically, they are avoiding the common sense things that could be done."

      "speaker": "ELVIRA SALAZAR, LEAD ANCHOR OF MEGA TV",
      "utterance": "Oh, I have no doubt and I agree with what you're saying, but I think what President Trump did was even more important and intelligent, going to Saudi Arabia and talking to the other Muslim world. He was in front of what, 70 representatives of the Muslim world and telling them we need your help because we cannot do it alone. And they are your enemies as well as they're ours. Ninety five percent of the victims that ISIS or al-Qaeda has hit upon or has killed are Muslim. So what we need to do is we need to go to the root of the problem until those countries that are helping these guys become radicalized, hey, you've got to stop. You've got to stop the financing and you're going to stop helping them, or allowing the Iman's to preach this radicalized ideas based on the Koran."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "We do need to look though at homegrown terrorism. Because, of course, this guy was born here, just like the Orlando shooter was born here. San Bernardino, one was born here, the other one was from Saudi Arabia, which, of course, not on the list of the ban that Trump is trying to get passed through, and she was here legally as well. So homegrown terrorism is a huge problem which the solutions aren't quite so easy, but it's one that we really need to take a look at."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOLLING",
      "utterance": "I'm going to jump into that a little bit in the monologue later in the show. However, we need to note, and we did in the intro, that Mr. Abedi is the son of Libyan refugees."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "That's true, but at the same time even Trump's ban would only be temporary for refugees, so there's really no way to vet someone son, eventually future son because he doesn't exist yet."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOLLING",
      "utterance": "I'm sorry I cut you off. But what I was getting at was the freedom to become a refugee and get into Europe and then travel freely throughout the continent can be dangerous, can be seen as dangerous."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "So what we have to do, Eric, is more than one thing at one time and I'm sure we can do it, right? We can have important constitutional extreme vetting and we can watch out for this homegrown domestic terrorism because this is ideological and we know this. We know that we have to stamp out the ideology. As Kat said, San Bernardino, homegrown, this Manchester person, born in England, so we can't just act like it's just other issue, it's that and the homegrown issue, and we have to be able to do more than one thing at a time."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAIN",
      "utterance": "And it starts with enforcement of laws that are already there, and making sure that we know who's here, as well as better vetting of those who want to come here."

      "speaker": "SALAZAR",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOLLING",
      "utterance": "Is it not the same issue, Elvira? It points to the exact same threats, whether it's a Muslim -- I'm sorry, a radical Islamic terrorists that wants to come here or someone who may want to come through our southern border. What's the difference?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SALAZAR",

    {
      "speaker": "KATTY KAY, BBC ANCHOR",
      "utterance": "Europe is getting used to attacks like this. We have to because we are never going to be able to totally wipe this out. As ISIS gets squeezed in Syria and Iraq, we're going to see more of these kinds of attacks taking place in Europe. And Europe is starting to get used to that. None of us are used to having children targeted in this way, young girls targeted in this way."
    },

    },
    {
      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "You absolutely shouldn't get used to it. That's what they want. It's not just about the carnage, right? It's about the fact that it is so disgusting. It's about the fact when you see the scene and you have girls who are still wearing their little kitten ears, little Ariana Grande kitten ears, it's about trying to spread fear throughout the entire culture and destroy the way of life. To say, OK, I guess this is how it is. It's very important to not change our way of life, to now show that we're afraid, to call them losers. I thought that was the most savage, wonderful thing to say, you're losers."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAIN",
      "utterance": "That previous clip -- forgive me for being direct. That's a silly statement to say we're going to get used to terror, when there are so many things we can do with the technology that we have, with the intelligence community that we have. With all the resources we have, we do not have to settle for it, as some people are suggesting. We can do a lot about it. And to Kat's point, about the way of life, the reason the people who do this are losers is because their way of life has lost against our way of life. That's really the big difference between how they think and how we think. They are jealous of us having the biggest economy in the world, and the most powerful military in the world, and the most freedom in the world."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "I agree wholeheartedly, Mr. Cain. And I would go a step further and say I utterly reject what Katie was saying there. Because here's the thing, it's goes to down to foreseeability to your point. Many of this -- this guy was already on their watch, Eric. They knew. They were already looking at him. San Bernardino, already looking at him, a ten month probe on the Orlando shooter, so we're doing a lot very right around identifying these potential threats but we're doing something very wrong, Eric, about following up."

He was like a week before he went to the place where he bought all the ammunition in order to conduct the attack, and he also wanted to buy a heavy set armor, body armor. And then the guy -- the owner of the store said no, I'm not going to sell that to you. And then, he turned around and he called the FBI, and the FBI never followed up. The FBI would have been able stopped the Orlando massacre if the FBI would have kept a closer eye."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOLLING",
      "utterance": "So why are we concerned with Donald Trump saying I want to be careful, I want to vet people from these seven nations, not Muslim people, but seven nations that have known ties to terror. Why are we so upset with his proposal?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "Because of his past comments. That's the interpretation because of his past comments. It's completely legal, without a question, for a president to ban based on immigration, based on geographic location because -- we even had Rudy Giuliani come out and say Trump asked him how to do the Muslim ban legally. So there are signs -- this is the courts point of view, I'm not even taking -- I'm just saying their argument is that it is a religious ban based on his own past statement."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOLLING",
      "utterance": "But they rejected Rudy's account of that as well, and they pushed back. And clearly, I mean, these are six of the seven in President Trump's nation moratorium came from President Obama himself. So it's clearly not a Muslim ban."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "True, Eric, on its face. But absent candidate Trump's rhetoric on the campaign trail -- see, this is where that rhetoric is going back to haunt him, as Kat say, he specifically talked about banning Muslims. Now, though, what you're saying is right, this notion of a geographical target around criminally profiling areas where we know these types of terror arises."
    },

      "speaker": "BOLLING",

There were all these metal detectors, all these security, so he just moved the bomb a little further outside. You go to the airport, and everything is such an involved process. There's nobody in the parking lot. There're 20 groups of people everywhere.

So our most effective tool clearly is that.

And what the headline is saying is that Trump said to Rogers, \"Hey, say there is no evidence.\" So that \"if\" is very important. It's a small world -- word, but it's very big in the context. We have to understand that, apparently, the president said to Rogers, \"If there is no investigation, go out publicly and say it.\" That's not correct either, because President Trump at the time apparently didn't know that Rogers could not say one way or the other.

Bowie State has also draped his cap and gown over a front-row chair that will remain empty in his honor.

The killer, Salman Abedi, the son of Libyan refugees turned ISIS terrorist, and that's not irrelevant. The son of refugees. Last night's attack was the fifth terror attack in Europe so far just this year, and recently, recall the Bataclan concert hall in Paris, where ISIS fighters gunned down 130. To Nice, where a truck driven by an ISIS supporter barreled through a Bastille Day celebration, killing 85 innocent people. Brussels Christmas market, Westminster Bridge and on and on and on. But what's happening in Europe? For years, Europe has had an open border policy, free to travel from European country to European country without a visa and unchecked. Add to that an extremely liberal immigration policy. In Germany alone, Angela Merkel is allowing a million Syrian refugees into their country. Now, check out the pictures, and you see mostly young men flooding into Germany, potentially an army of jihadists, now able to move freely throughout Europe. Simply put, that's an insane immigration policy. Meanwhile, here at home, Trump is trying to limit these potential terrorists from entering the United States. It's not a Muslim ban. It's a ban on a country of origin, a moratorium, actually. After all, there's no doubt. Many of them hate us. No doubt many of them may even want to kill us. So wake up, America. Wake up, liberals. And wake up, Ninth Circuit Court judge. While you fight Trump over political correctness, you make us less safe right here in America, period. Because radical Islamic terrorists are right now plotting ways to get to America and carry out their jihad. There's no reasoning with this evil. Once they're here, they're here. We cannot let them in or terror will hit us here at home, just like it is in Europe. Kat -- I'm going to start with Kat. So it gets a little hard-core there. But isn't that really the essence of it? Let's limit the jihadists from coming here in the first place."

And in the United States, you want to talk about immigration? Every single lethal attack carried out by an Islamic extremist since 9/11 has been by someone who was either a citizen or who was here legally. So yes, of course, we don't want jihadists here. But there -- we have to look at what statistically has been happening, where these problems have been coming from. They've been homegrown. And we need to look at that especially, rather than go into somewhere where we're going to start risking our civil liberties because of an emotional experience that we're having with regards to the threat."
