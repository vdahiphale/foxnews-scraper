And the coronavirus count, at least with cases and hospitalizations, they're going kind of in two different directions. The cases are rising, the hospitalizations not nearly as much. And, in fact, deaths across the country continue to come down day by day.  We're going to pick it all apart for you right now.

Right now, the Department of Health only shows cumulative hospitalizations for the virus across the whole state, no info about the current number of patients, what communities they're in, how many, many are in ICU or on ventilators.  However, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis now says that information will soon be included in the state's reporting, because health experts have argued that data is extremely valuable, especially as Florida grapples with a surge of new cases, particularly among young people, one of the driving forces behind closing bars there.",

And, really, herd immunity is essentially when a large amount of the population, upwards towards 60 to 70 percent, have been exposed to the virus and have developed some sort of immunity to it. Now, whether that is because of widespread infection or because of vaccines, right now, because that we have had so -- we know how severe this affects our elderly, the widespread transmission of the virus will cause a lot of deaths, which is why we're in a race for a vaccine. We have some excellent, promising results that have many companies, and so, hopefully, that we can do some sort of mitigation of the spread of this illness while we're waiting for a vaccine. Unfortunately, there's still viral transmission. Ever since mid-June, we're seeing rising cases, Neil.  And there's a combination of these mass gatherings, whether it was the protests, Memorial Day celebrations, what have you, but there has been civil unrest that has caused a lot of people to get together, whether it's indoors, outdoors, that likely promulgated some of the spread of this virus.

I would have liked to have seen fewer cases of community spread, but, unfortunately, I think the civil unrest and these stay-at-home orders, the lockdown orders in states prematurely, may have led to this, Neil.

Anarchy is anti-American, law and order is essential, peace in our streets will be secured. While the Democrat mayor of Seattle proclaimed that CHAZ was to be quote \"the summer of love,\" in fact it was not. And other failed Democrat politicians also remain passive, were even silent in the face of anarchy, but while that happened President Trump set the tone -- law and order must prevail to preserve peace in our streets. The president is not the Democrat governor of the state of Washington, the president is not the Democrat mayor of Seattle but nevertheless, the president must lead by example and be prepared to act in the face of failed Democrat leadership, which is what we saw in Democrat Seattle, in Democrat Wisconsin. President Trump has always stood on the side of law and order and we are pleased to report that law and order has prevailed and Seattle has been liberated from the anarchists. In President Trump's America, autonomous zones will have no sanctuary. The BHAZ, B-H-A-Z, which stood for the Black House Autonomous Zone, across from the White House was swiftly dismantled. 100 anarchists were arrested for rioting and destruction of federal property here in D.C. I believe that number's now above 300. Four men have been charged in federal court for attempting to tear down the statue of Andrew Jackson in Lafayette Square. And there are 200 open domestic terrorism investigations. You contrast the President's vision of law and order to that of the failed CHAZ experiment and anarchy and here's what you find in the failed Democrat experiment that took place out in Seattle. The Seattle Times said the shooting at Seattle's CHOP protest tragically killed a 16 year old boy, leaving a 14 year old seriously injured. That's what happens in an autonomous zone. The police chief Carmen Best, who did a marvelous job winding down the CHOP zone, noted that CHOP has become lawless and brutal and enough is enough and she took action. According to reports, quote \"police also investigated several vehicles circling the CHOP zone with people inside carrying fire -- firearms and wearing body armor.\" This was no quote \"summer of love,\" as the Democrat mayor in Seattle said and President Trump compelled action. He has said \"take back your city now, if you don't do it, I will.\" He has said \"this is not a game, these ugly anarchists must be stopped immediately. Move fast.\" And finally, the Democrat mayor in Seattle, who was long delayed, finally gave the order to dismantle the CHAZ and it was an admission -- it was an admission that President Trump's vision is right, that anarchy is wrong and that law and order bring peace. And with that, I will take questions. Kristen?",

And the coronavirus count, at least with cases and hospitalizations, they're going kind of in two different directions. The cases are rising, the hospitalizations not nearly as much. And, in fact, deaths across the country continue to come down day by day. We're going to pick it all apart for you right now.

As you well know, hospitalizations are a very important metric to watch when it comes to measuring how severe COVID-19 is impacting a particular community. And most states offer detailed information about that very data, either on their Web sites or their public dashboards. Florida does not, however. Right now, the Department of Health only shows cumulative hospitalizations for the virus across the whole state, no info about the current number of patients, what communities they're in, how many, many are in ICU or on ventilators. However, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis now says that information will soon be included in the state's reporting, because health experts have argued that data is extremely valuable, especially as Florida grapples with a surge of new cases, particularly among young people, one of the driving forces behind closing bars there."

So, I -- yesterday, I actually said that I wasn't going to tell the president that he needed to wear a mask, but I recommended it, but, also, there's a logical reason, which the president just reiterated, on why he doesn't wear masks. He's constantly tested and those around him are constantly tested. But the good news is, for messaging purposes, he is saying that he is all for masks, especially when you cannot maintain social distancing. And I think that's the message going forward to Americans right now, as we're seeing rising cases in 35 states. Social distancing and mask wearing, unfortunately, that's our normal for right now. But the good news is, it's not forever, Neil."

And, really, herd immunity is essentially when a large amount of the population, upwards towards 60 to 70 percent, have been exposed to the virus and have developed some sort of immunity to it. Now, whether that is because of widespread infection or because of vaccines, right now, because that we have had so -- we know how severe this affects our elderly, the widespread transmission of the virus will cause a lot of deaths, which is why we're in a race for a vaccine. We have some excellent, promising results that have many companies, and so, hopefully, that we can do some sort of mitigation of the spread of this illness while we're waiting for a vaccine. Unfortunately, there's still viral transmission. Ever since mid-June, we're seeing rising cases, Neil. And there's a combination of these mass gatherings, whether it was the protests, Memorial Day celebrations, what have you, but there has been civil unrest that has caused a lot of people to get together, whether it's indoors, outdoors, that likely promulgated some of the spread of this virus. And so we have to take a step back and do what we can to lessen community spread."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "SAPHIER",
      "utterance": "Well, I would say -- it's really hard to say. I mean, if you look at the map right now, Neil, it's really just the small area of the Northeast, the ones that were hit the hardest in the beginning, that are still doing OK, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut. And the rest of the country are now hitting their first wave of the virus. I would have liked to have seen fewer cases of community spread, but, unfortunately, I think the civil unrest and these stay-at-home orders, the lockdown orders in states prematurely, may have led to this, Neil. The good news right now, as you have been mentioning, your reporters have been mentioning, the deaths are not paralleling the new cases."

And, also, Neil, the great news is that, yes, there are younger people testing positive right now, but that means now is the time to protect the vulnerable, because, if the young people have the cases, then it may be in a month where we actually see the elderly being infected again."

So which was it here? But -- and then, if you can establish that, by what quantum of information or evidence do you need to know something before you brief the commander in chief? If there's a 1 percent chance it's true, are you going to tell him about it? Probably not. So, in D.C., almost every sentence begins, if true, and then they run with it. If true, it's treason. If true, he's unfit to be the commander in chief. How about we just find out whether or not it's true or not? Let's do that first."

John Ratcliffe briefed the House and the Senate yesterday morning and yesterday afternoon. You know what he did in between? Do you know what he did over his lunch hour, Neil? He dropped his youngest daughter off at the Naval Academy, where she will begin a decade's worth of service to this country in uniform. Robert O'Brien has a child that wears a uniform. Mike Pompeo wore the uniform of this country. If they believed that Russians were setting boundaries on soldiers, they would all three be in the president's office before this interview ended. So, look, I know they don't like President Trump. I know they don't want him to get reelected. But this is military. This is -- this is our country's interests.

So I asked President Trump, in this environment, of which there is double-digit unemployment right now, does he fear that the vice president's plan might actually play better in this election? And the president used that question to talk about what he thinks would happen to the stock market if he is not reelected. Watch here."

He's answering -- I mean, he's answering questions like this from a teleprompter. I said, what's that all about? But his people, the people around him are radical left. They are going to raise taxes.

And she -- there is not one regulation that Elizabeth Warren doesn't like. I think Donald Trump, for all his missteps in terms of handling COVID and some other issues, he's on pretty strong grounds that the -- that there's going to be an economic 180 going on in this country if Biden gets elected.

The more people you have packed together in small areas, particularly if they not wearing masks, particularly if it's indoors, the greater risk you have of spread. So, I think travelers will probably have to make decisions on that. But, fundamentally, the issue is larger than any one airline. It's larger than any one group. The virus has the upper hand in the U.S. right now. And if we work together, we can gain the momentum and begin to put it back into control, because, right now, not only is it at a high level, but it's increasing rapidly in many parts of the U.S."

There's certain things that we're learning are really dangerous. First off, we're seeing big increases in young adults all over the country. So, the message has to get out more than what stays in young adult -- starts in young adults doesn't stay in young adults. We're all in this together. And we have seen many outbreaks from bars. You're talking about a small amount of space, lots of people together, not wearing masks, obviously, from many different places for many hours. That's essentially a formula inviting the virus in. What we need to do is keep the virus out. And that means there's a lot of things that we can do out of doors. That's way safer than indoors. There are things that we can do to safely restart our economy. For example, some states early on have allowed storefront pickup of -- from retail. That's a really smart idea. You're not going indoors and you're doing business there. So, there are lots of things that we can do to get used to this new normal of COVID.

This is not a political statement. This is a statement that we're opposed to the virus, not that we're opposed to or in favor of any individual or group. But it's really important. It's one of the key things that we can do, wear a mask, wash your hands, and watch your distance. If we do that, we will be able to get our economy back sooner and faster.

And I think it's important that we consistently look at what the needs are, see what the changes are that we should be making to those -- to those dollars that have already been appropriated. But I want to also encourage people to not be driven so much by fear, whether small business, big business, airlines, or farming. Use the common sense and the guidelines that the government's provided, along with the brain that God gave you. But don't be so fearful that the cure does, in fact, become worse than the disease itself. I don't -- while I understand what your previous guest was talking about, I don't share his level of concern about it. I -- we need to protect elderly people. We need to protect grandma. But 35-year-olds, you know, we're going to have to learn to live with the disease, rather than let the disease force us to trade living in for surviving. And that's not just an economic position.

Anarchy is anti-American, law and order is essential, peace in our streets will be secured. While the Democrat mayor of Seattle proclaimed that CHAZ was to be quote \"the summer of love,\" in fact it was not. And other failed Democrat politicians also remain passive, were even silent in the face of anarchy, but while that happened President Trump set the tone -- law and order must prevail to preserve peace in our streets. The president is not the Democrat governor of the state of Washington, the president is not the Democrat mayor of Seattle but nevertheless, the president must lead by example and be prepared to act in the face of failed Democrat leadership, which is what we saw in Democrat Seattle, in Democrat Wisconsin. President Trump has always stood on the side of law and order and we are pleased to report that law and order has prevailed and Seattle has been liberated from the anarchists. In President Trump's America, autonomous zones will have no sanctuary. The BHAZ, B-H-A-Z, which stood for the Black House Autonomous Zone, across from the White House was swiftly dismantled. 100 anarchists were arrested for rioting and destruction of federal property here in D.C. I believe that number's now above 300. Four men have been charged in federal court for attempting to tear down the statue of Andrew Jackson in Lafayette Square. And there are 200 open domestic terrorism investigations. You contrast the President's vision of law and order to that of the failed CHAZ experiment and anarchy and here's what you find in the failed Democrat experiment that took place out in Seattle. The Seattle Times said the shooting at Seattle's CHOP protest tragically killed a 16 year old boy, leaving a 14 year old seriously injured. That's what happens in an autonomous zone. The police chief Carmen Best, who did a marvelous job winding down the CHOP zone, noted that CHOP has become lawless and brutal and enough is enough and she took action. According to reports, quote \"police also investigated several vehicles circling the CHOP zone with people inside carrying fire -- firearms and wearing body armor.\" This was no quote \"summer of love,\" as the Democrat mayor in Seattle said and President Trump compelled action. He has said \"take back your city now, if you don't do it, I will.\" He has said \"this is not a game, these ugly anarchists must be stopped immediately. Move fast.\" And finally, the Democrat mayor in Seattle, who was long delayed, finally gave the order to dismantle the CHAZ and it was an admission -- it was an admission that President Trump's vision is right, that anarchy is wrong and that law and order bring peace.

Should the -- should the administration be following the local guidelines (OFF-MIKE)"

    {
      "speaker": "MCENANY",
      "utterance": "The president said that we should follow our local authorities with masks, so that's the decision that he encourages people to follow those authorities. The CDC guidelines, I would also note, say recommended but not required and we are very much looking forward to the Fourth of July celebration. Yes."

      "speaker": "QUESTION",

      "utterance": "Does the president want this intelligence to be corroborated or not, or what has he told his advisers on this front?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCENANY",
      "utterance": "The president is -- it's unverified. It's being assessed. It's going through the same process normal intelligence would go through, but what's unfortunate is we're having this discussion because of the New York Times deciding to run with this erroneous information about the president being briefed, which was not true. And the erroneous information that there was a conclusion when in fact there was not a conclusion. Yes?"

      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "utterance": "And can you also say does the president generally have confidence in the intelligence communities findings and conclusions about Russia?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCENANY",
      "utterance": "Yes, he does have confidence and he's many times acted on verified intelligence and there's times he's decided that's in our strategic interest not to act. I would give you the example of Soleimani and al- Baghdadi. And then the example of Iran shooting down the -- when Iran engaged in actions and the president said it's not time to engage because shooting down a -- shooting down a entity is not the same as loosing lots of civilian lives. Yes."

    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "utterance": "Thank you, Kayleigh."

      "utterance": "Shooting down a drone. Excuse me. Yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "utterance": "The president has come under criticism this week for statements that he has made that his detractors say are dog whistles to a certain segment of his base that he is trying to gin up for reelection. Those include comments like kung-flu or heritage while talking about Confederate statues. And most recently they included the video that I know you discussed in here the other day, but the video of a supporter of his using the term \"white power.\" So why hasn't the president denounced that video and called that a hateful statement?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCENANY",
      "utterance": "The president took down that video, that deletion speaks strongly. What I would note, the president has repeatedly condemned hate. August of 2019 and one voice, our nation must condemn racism, bigotry and white supremacy. These sinister ideologies must be defeated if hate has no place in America. In April 2019, we have no tolerance for those who disrupt this peace and we condemn all hate and violence, especially in our places of worship. August 2018, I condemn all types of racism. He's repeatedly done this."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "utterance": "Why hasn't he denounced that specific video and said that that is hateful language that was used in it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCENANY",
      "utterance": "He deleted it. The deletion speaks for itself. His repeated condemnations of hate speak for themselves, and this is a president who has repeatedly condemned hate and repeatedly encouraged for us all to come together. Yes?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "utterance": "Thank you, can -- did the president meet today with Senate Republican Leader McConnell about the future recovery aid package, and is there any sort of agreement on additional unemployment insurance or stimulus payments?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCENANY",
      "utterance": "Yes, so I have no announcements with regard to his meetings, but what I would say is he did mention that in a phase four, he would be open to direct payments. On the point of unemployment insurance, one thing that he's concerned about is he does not want to see an incentive not to work. An enhanced unemployment benefits that Senator Schumer has suggested would be an incentive for people not to get back to work and he wants to encourage people to get back to work. And at the same time, he's mentioned a payroll tax holiday, a big one for our workers. That helps those who are on the lowest end of the payroll, it would help the Americans who need it most. So those are some things he's talked about for phase four."

    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "utterance": "Hi, you used the word embers to describe the coronavirus, but yesterday, another all-time record of 47,000 cases, and four times this week, a new record. Why do you use the word embers when many people would say it's like a wildfire?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCENANY",
      "utterance": "So I used the word embers because that is what the president has acknowledged that would happen around the country. You would see spikes across the country. He said, at time, you would see a fire across the country, embers, fires, but at the same time I would note the increase in cases that are -- the increase in testing is -- sixfold increase in testing, you identify more cases. I would also note that Secretary Azar said that we've seen nationwide that fatalities at a two month low. So this is a different situation when those who are testing positive are younger. We have increased tests. We are aware where there are surges. It's why Dr. Birx is on the ground, but we believe we are equipped to handle what we see on the horizon."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "utterance": "So how does the president -- the president made a conscious decision to talk less about the virus. Town hall, Sean Hannity, someone mentioned it was only three minutes that he discussed it. He tweets about it far less often than he used to?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCENANY",
      "utterance": "The president is not focused on talking, he's focused on action, and this administration has taken historic action with regard to the coronavirus. We have an excess amount of PPE, surge -- a huge amount of ventilators in the stockpile, things that could never be done, we were told, have been done under this administration, testing more than 600,000 a day. This president has done a historic job with regards to the coronavirus."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "utterance": "Thank you. The president yesterday tweeted that he is angry against China. Is anger against China in India also? So, India has banned 59 apps from China, including TikTok. How -- does the president (OFF-MIKE) about it and what are his views on this?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCENANY",
      "utterance": "So, with regard to India and China, we're closely monitoring the situation. He is as well. Both India and China have expressed a desire to de-escalate and we support a peaceful resolution of the current situation, and he said that China's aggressive stance along the India-China border fits with the larger pattern of Chinese aggression in other parts of the world and these actions only confirm the true nature of the Chinese Communist Party."

    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "utterance": "What will we expect the president to play in on Israel's plan to annex part of the West Bank and the Jordan Valley, and how much does this delay perhaps have to do with the concern about (OFF-MIKE) here in the United States who, of course, are really an important part of the presidents base in reelection?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCENANY",
      "utterance": "Yes, so I have not spoken to him about that specific issue, but he's a great supporter of Israel and I would just leave it at that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "utterance": "But, Kellyanne, there could be something this week, so I'm just wondering what the delay is and maybe you could weigh in. There are concerns this could be the final nail in the coffin on the Palestinian state. What is the president thinking about?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCENANY",
      "utterance": "So no announcements on that front, and I won't get ahead of him on anything that would happen this week or beyond. Yes?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "utterance": "The president has said in this room that he wants to meet the Taliban leadership. Now that world leaders are coming here again, is that on the corral, is that going to happen soon? Is there a timetable?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCENANY",
      "utterance": "So, again, I won't get ahead of the president on that. What the president wants is to see our troops come home from Afghanistan. He has been on the record being against keeping a sustained presence in Afghanistan. He does not believe in foreign adventurism and wars that drag on. He believes the ultimate way to secure our troops is to bring them home. Yamiche."

    {
      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "utterance": "Well, has the -- has the report of the Russian bounty for Taliban fighters affected that calculus?"
    },

      "speaker": "MCENANY",
      "utterance": "That's unverified intelligence that's currently being assessed. Yamiche?"

      "speaker": "QUESTION",
      "utterance": "Hi. Thanks, Kayleigh. The first question I have -- two questions. The first is, on Monday, the president went after stripping racist names on buildings.
