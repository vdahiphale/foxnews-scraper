      "sentences": "I'm Laura Ingraham. This is “The Ingraham Angle” from a very busy, of course, Washington tonight. A really positive day, that's the picture painted by Republicans today after testimony from one of Schiff's witnesses, as I just mentioned, to Sean, backfired. Congressman Lee Zeldin, Chris Stewart, and Mike Turner, all give us insight in moments. Also tonight, the hypocrisy of the Democrat leadership over impeachment has been laid bare. Byron York, Matt Schlapp, they'll walk us through it and Ed Henry has news of buyer's remorse already building in the democratic caucus.  And at this hour new reporting suggesting that the whistleblower who kicked this entire drama off, might have had his own issues with a conflict of interest. You will not believe for whom it looks like he worked. Lee Smith, Victor Davis Hanson will spell it all out.  But first, the Democrats witching hour that's the focus of tonight's Halloween ANGLE. Today, House Democrats embarrassed themselves by passing a resolution to a prove an impeachment inquiry that they had already been conducting for weeks behind closed doors.  Now from the beginning their pattern of leaking and lying to damage Trump in an election year, of course, was so obvious. It was cheesy, it reminds me of one of those old movies that kind of scared you as a kid, but then made you laugh as an adult.",

And the whistleblower also reportedly worked for Susan Rice, no conflicts of interest here at all. More on this later on in the show. None of these Democrats, though, in the end as that first movie clip made clear, should be taken seriously. They're partisans. They have no philosophy or agenda that will actually end up making your lives better.

Don't worry we're not like you know. And there's a list - put it up please. This is the list. This is the all - every single one of these Congressmen have tied themselves to Pelosi and Schiff. They're - each and every one of them is now vulnerable in the next election. Each and every one, the Republicans should pick off all of those seats.

Biden's office even saw to it that he got invited to a luncheon that included then CIA director, guess who, John Brennan, then FBI director, Jim Comey, and then national Intel Director James Clapper. This can't even be real. This is all becoming absurd. And get this, the report also adds this detail. The whistleblower \"worked with a DNC operative who dug up dirt on Trump campaign during 2016, inviting her into the White House for meetings.\" So let all that sink in this Halloween night. The Whistleblower invited an anti-trump DNC operative into the Obama White House during the 2016 election. Fox News has not itself yet confirmed this whistleblower identity, but last week Fox News did confirm three instances of alleged bias against Trump that were noted by the Intel Inspector General.

Why this would be significant is, remember some of the troubles that the acting chief staff had in explaining this. You remember back to the Clinton days, of course, the context here -- sometimes you've got to get it out of the day to day staff that is already there, and bring in some fresh legs, some fresh minds, and look at this a different way. I understand that Tony Sayegh has got support not just in that building there at the White House, but folks outside the White House like Donald Trump Jr. and others have thought this is a good idea in private to bring in some seasoned communications veterans to help his father push back. The president, as you know, can often be his own best spokesman and often helped -- not just help, leads the shaping of the message on practically everything. In this case, you see Tony Sayegh there, he is somebody who got very high marks inside the administration for helping Treasury Secretary Mnuchin in terms of shaping the tax cut rollout, the message that I mentioned, that was a big success for the White House.

According to RealClearInvestigations, he worked for Biden. Yes, he worked for Biden, on Ukraine policy when Biden was VP. He worked for Deep State henchmen Brennan too. And the whistleblower also reportedly worked for Susan Rice, no conflicts of interest here at all. More on this later on in the show. None of these Democrats, though, in the end as that first movie clip made clear, should be taken seriously. They're partisans. They have no philosophy or agenda that will actually end up making your lives better. Their policies, to the extent that there are any, spawn only economic misery and less freedom for you and for me.

He's been talking about releasing the transcripts. But - I mean, I'll believe it when I see it. But I would - I think would be a fantastic thing to have it out there, because they've already leaked out all the information that they feel can be spun favorably for them. What they, obviously, haven't leaked is the rest of the story. In some cases, it's the other 90% of the story or the other 100 percent of the story.

If I had to like plan this out right now and we'll read the script later, but I bet that whistleblower knew exactly what was going on with Hunter Biden, and apparently that wasn't any big deal.

It's supposed to about the intelligence community - empowering them and restricting them. We're not doing our work. You said that - Nancy Pelosi was saying don't be giddy.

New reporting from RealClearInvestigations reveals troubling ties. First, they say he was detailed to the National Security Council in 2015 under Susan - unmask them, Rice, quickly becoming Biden's point man on, guess what, Ukraine policy. Biden's office even saw to it that he got invited to a luncheon that included then CIA director, guess who, John Brennan, then FBI director, Jim Comey, and then national Intel Director James Clapper. This can't even be real. This is all becoming absurd. And get this, the report also adds this detail. The whistleblower \"worked with a DNC operative who dug up dirt on Trump campaign during 2016, inviting her into the White House for meetings.\" So let all that sink in this Halloween night. The Whistleblower invited an anti-trump DNC operative into the Obama White House during the 2016 election. Fox News has not itself yet confirmed this whistleblower identity, but last week Fox News did confirm three instances of alleged bias against Trump that were noted by the Intel Inspector General. So you do your own thinking on this. Joining me now is, Lee Smith, Investigative Journalist, author of the fantastic new book huge bestseller already, \"The Plot Against the President;\" along with Victor Davis Hanson, Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution. Victor, again, we're not going to name this person as we haven't independently confirmed the name. But because you call yourself a whistleblower, does not entitle you under any law to remain anonymous and you aren't considered a roving Inspector General of the executive branch of the White House either.

And this person hasn't done any of that. He's only known to the Democratic members officially of the House Intelligence Committee. But what the whistleblower - I can't understand and it's incoherent, the whistleblower and Lieutenant Colonel Vindman have made three or four implicit charges that Trump was too easy on the Russians, he was too hard on the Ukrainians. He mixed the personal and the professional. He had a quid pro quo. But they were in the White House in case of the whistleblower Lieutenant Colonel Vindman was in foreign service why didn't they say from 2011 and onward? Why didn't they say the Obama administration will not arm the Ukrainians? Trump did that. Why don't they say appeasement is reset? Trump risk a war with Russians and Syria. He killed 200 mercenaries. He canceled a missile bill. He's been the hardest person on Putin that we've seen in 20 - in the last 10 years. Why didn't they say Hunter Biden is engaging in a quid pro - Joe Biden with a son a quid pro quo? Or why didn't they say, my gosh, we have Barack Obama engaging in a quid pro quo with a hot mic in South Korea? So all the things that they're revealing right now happened and they didn't say a word. And you know why that was? because under Obama he tolerated no leaks. They would have been facing criminal prosecution or at least they would have been monitored like The Associated Press reporters or Fox's own James Rosen. And the media would have demonized them.

To me, when you look at this, Victor Davis Hanson, this all starts to sound and feel and smell like what happened with the setup of the Russia investigation, the same actors, the same players, the same motivations. And it's all to stop this America first president, or candidate back then, then a president, who wanted to take a different approach to foreign aid and a different approach to foreign policy, and they wanted him out. The deep state wanted him out, the intel community wanted him out, foreign policy establishment experts wanted him out.

And apparently the whistleblower and Lieutenant Colonel Vindman did, too, because Donald Trump, as I said earlier, has been very pro-Ukrainian, anti-Russian, and didn't quite do anything like Joe Biden, of course he didn't, and Barack Obama in these quid pro quos. But you would think after the 22 months and the $35 million that the bar would have been raised a little higher for the next iteration of impeachment hysteria, but in fact, it's gone really low. And the reason it has, Laura, is we are only a year away from the election, and we are looking at a Horowitz report, a Barr and Durham report. And we look at these debates and we see no agenda that polls 51 percent. And the Democrats have decided we don't have a choice now. We've got to either destroy Donald Trump or we are going to lose this election. And so they can't wait, or as General McRaven said, he's got to be removed, sooner the better.

This started on January 20th, 2017. \"The Washington Post\" ran an article headlined the drive to impeach Trump has begun. It was published at 12:19 p.m. on that day. Trump had been president for 19 minutes. And we have had a number of efforts earlier to impeach the president. One last thing. If you remember back in the Clinton years, Republicans thought Clinton just got away with murder. He got away with whitewater, he got away with file gate, he got away with travel gate, and when Lewinsky happened, they got him. I think that Democrats feel this way appear, and they couldn't get him on Russia, they couldn't get him on the emoluments clause, couldn't get him on other business stuff.

Why this would be significant is, remember some of the troubles that the acting chief staff had in explaining this. You remember back to the Clinton days, of course, the context here -- sometimes you've got to get it out of the day to day staff that is already there, and bring in some fresh legs, some fresh minds, and look at this a different way. I understand that Tony Sayegh has got support not just in that building there at the White House, but folks outside the White House like Donald Trump Jr. and others have thought this is a good idea in private to bring in some seasoned communications veterans to help his father push back. The president, as you know, can often be his own best spokesman and often helped -- not just help, leads the shaping of the message on practically everything. In this case, you see Tony Sayegh there, he is somebody who got very high marks inside the administration for helping Treasury Secretary Mnuchin in terms of shaping the tax cut rollout, the message that I mentioned, that was a big success for the White House. They think inside the White House they need someone like him to help now."

If Trump and Pence are both implicated in this non-scandal scandal, Pence's resignation or removal from office occurred first, Trump could nominate a new vice president under the 25th amendment. Rejection of a Trump vice presidential choice would then elevate Pelosi in the event that Trump's removal from office after an impeachment trial the Senate. Now, this is the level of fantasy, Ed, that they are engaged in. Again, they are dreaming. They say it is a solemn moment, but they are dreaming of impeachment fantasies.

And as you know, there are a lot of Democrats in private who will admit, it's not just Republicans saying this. It's going to be a heavy lift, even if they impeach him in the House, where they may have votes, because Nancy Pelosi is in charge, as you laid out. Removing him from the Senate is a much higher mountain to climb, and it's highly unlikely as we look at the facts tonight. So this is fantasy land."

And I think Trump is going to give people a little room. He has to realize it's a victory for him so long as he is not removed. If he keeps all the Republicans on board, he wins. And so he's got to give just a little bit of safe harbor. I know he is tempted to attack anybody who is not totally in his corner, but he has to give those people a little bit of safe harbor to say, I'm a little troubled by what happened, but I don't think this comes anywhere close to an impeachable offense, and then pivot to the process issues they have been focusing on."

It was open, it was transparent, it was fair. Both sides had equal access to witness and subpoenas. What the Democrats are doing now is absolutely the opposite. Even if they clothe it, the emperor has no clothes, and I'm talking about Adam Schiff. There is no transparency here. There's no relationship to what we did in 1998.

So if the public feels it's unfair, they won't be the support. And so that's why you hear the complaint, oh, they are worrying about process too much. No, not really, because of the public is the judge, because it's a political process. And politicians respond to the public.
