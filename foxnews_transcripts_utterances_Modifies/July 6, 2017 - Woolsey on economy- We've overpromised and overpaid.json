      "sentences": "All right, Hamburg, Germany, the protests continue, largely peaceful, but, again, they're not going when police have told them to go. So, remembering this from something similar with World Bank protests, IMF protests in places like Seattle and all, when the police say to go, and you don't go, it sometimes can get a little antsy. But, so far, they're just letting their views be known.  A lot of them sort of pre-registered for this event, knowing when it was coming, and got tickets to come here. So, a lot of them not just out of town, but way out of town, like across Europe and the globe, to show up for this event, a rally against pretty much capitalism and the leaders of richest countries, who they say are not sharing the wealth.  Former CIA Director James Woolsey joins us right now.  Ambassador, always good to have you. You have seen these at protests, different venues, different presidents, different reactions, Democrat, Republican, conservative leaders in a European country, more liberal leaders.  So, it is, you know, everyone's right in these free countries, largely democratically elected countries, to do this sort of thing. But their protests right now seem to be at the growing inequities, many of them say, between the rich and poor, and that these leaders are doing little about it. What do you make of that?",

And what we have to hope and count on are national leaders to make be the case is that these peaceful demonstrations, even in a context of economic deprivation and despair, that these peaceful demonstrations stay peaceful, and people let off steam, fine. Letting off steam is great. I used to be a protester. I think that it is-- but it -- we have to be very careful. For example, President Putin is likely to be very tough in these negotiations. And President Trump sees as a solution for a number of economic situations higher tariffs. Well, if you look back in time, again, history rhyming, high tariffs in the former Hawley-Smoot tariff, didn't work very well.",
