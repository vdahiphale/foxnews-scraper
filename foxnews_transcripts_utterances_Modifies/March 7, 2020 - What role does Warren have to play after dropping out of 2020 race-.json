According to \"The Salt Lake Tribune,\" a paper, a Utah woman is challenging a middle school rule after her daughter wasn't allowed to say no to a boy who asked her to dance on Valentine's Day. The mom says her sixth grader was asked to dance by a boy. The girl said no, but the School Principal stepped in and told her she had too and should. Yes, I say shoo them onto the dance floor. The Principal says that's not how it went down, but admits that they asked that all students agreed to dance with each other. Claiming the policy was to make sure to kids that no kids feel like they get left out. The mother says that's a load of crap. Kids should learn to handle rejection. Now, apparently the Principal and Superintendent are reviewing the policy. But look, I get turned down when I ask people to dance all the time, sometimes on the subway, which is why I only dance with my miniature horse, Sparkles.",

The mom says her sixth grader was asked to dance by a boy. The girl said no, but the School Principal stepped in and told her she had too and should. Yes, I say shoo them onto the dance floor. The Principal says that's not how it went down, but admits that they asked that all students agreed to dance with each other. Claiming the policy was to make sure to kids that no kids feel like they get left out. The mother says that's a load of crap. Kids should learn to handle rejection. Now, apparently the Principal and Superintendent are reviewing the policy.

I don't mean if you're playing video games, I mean if you need this bed because you feel like you're wasting too much time walking into another part of the room that you could be playing more video games. You're not alive. That's not a life. You could die and literally be in hell and be like this level is hard. You wouldn't even notice."

I mean, it's just -- this is where we're at. But you know when I think about it, this is less traffic for me at the park. Less people I've got to deal with at the zoo. I am going to lay in bed and play a video game and think you're in the real world. You know what I'm saying? Like, it's just -- this is what we're inventing? This is where we're at?
