It's 5:00 in New York City and this is \"The Five.\" A breakthrough on immigration, a big meeting today at the White House between President Trump and leaders of congress on both sides of the aisle. The American people got to witness this one, and it was pretty extraordinary. The president allowed cameras to roll for more than 45 minutes as he and lawmakers negotiated how best to reach an immigration deal. He's now open to an agreement coming in two phases. First, addressing young immigrants and border security with broader issues to be settled later.",

And I have to say, being in D.C., a lot a meetings are like that behind the scenes and then afterwards both sides go to their own cameras and microphones or they'll take turns and they're actually much more partisan in their plain to their base. And what this did was, basically, it was like watching a city council meeting on local access television, but you're actually in the cabinet room with the president and bipartisan lawmakers who did not know that this was going to happen. And what I thought was interesting as everyone actually was there and knew what they were talking about. One thing Dianne Feinstein try to do I thought was pretty smart and strategic is she suggests why don't we just do a clean DACA bill, and the president is like, yeah, that's great. And then McCarthy very subtle said, actually, that wouldn't include security. We need security. And so it's a little risky to be openly negotiating like that, but I thought -- amazingly refreshing.  Also I think that a lot of the hardliners, when it comes, especially, to dreamers and DACA have backed off. Above the falls, front page story on USA Today, included three quotes on the front page from -- I say pretty hardline immigration group saying if we need to do amnesty for children who were brought here illegally and it's not their fault, congress won't have any problem from us. So the president is really, actually, at this opportunity where he could do something. And what Lindsey Graham was saying is that your voters actually want you to do this but we're going to need you to take the heat. The president says he's willing to do so if the right wants to come after us and primary us because we're going to vote for something that makes actual common sense. It's a far cry from where we were on the campaign trail when it comes to immigration, but I think that if you can get to a good solution, let political bygones be bygones and just get it done.",

He's kind of like the martini that gets everybody talking. He drove a lot of momentum at that meeting. I've never seen so much bipartisanship. Dana said it's always behind closed doors. I've never seen that kind of wheeling and dealing among both sides like that ever before. It was an incredible scene to watch. The cornerstone of the deal is chain migration, lottery, the wall and merit-based. That's what Trump wants. The left wants the DACA. They want the clean DACA vote. Trump almost fell for it and then got rescued when he said, whoa, whoa, whoa, we're not going to do the DACA deal unless we have some border security.  The wall will be built. The chain migration is ridiculous. If we want to hire someone from H.R., we don't call K.G. and say, you know, is your uncle in H.R.? That's not how we do it. I don't know why America doesn't like that. And then the lottery, America is not a roulette table. I don't know why we're playing chance with our immigration system. We should use our brains. And then, merit-based, he said that's what Canada does. I thought the liberals love Canada. We want to emulate their health care system. Let's emulate their immigration system too. But, who know. I think the Democrats are squarely. If they do get anything clean, I don't trust that they're going to commit to merit, lottery, or the wall. That's what you've got to do it all at once.

I've written about this last month that it's pretty evident that Donald Trump has opened the door to a deal, a comprehensive deal, because -- guess what, he's the one that set March as the deadline for the dreamers to have a deal, and said to the Democrats let's make a deal. But he's been talking in hard terms just as Jesse was suggesting about the wall, about chain migration. And these things, the wall, it's not just going to happen. I mean, not only the Democrats not in the mood for it because they think it's ridiculous, but the dreamers have been, as you recall, attacking Nancy Pelosi as she was speaking in San Francisco, and say we're not a bargaining chip. Why are you doing this? Of course, they held off in December. Now we have it front and center. The key here is that Trump wants a deal. He says what we have in common is both sides want a deal. The problem in dealing with Donald Trump, the great businessman negotiator, is when you come to the nitty-gritty, when you come to the fine points, he's lacking. He doesn't know the fine points. He just knows we want a deal, so let's make a deal. But now, the problem has been -- remember the problem going back to George W. Bush in '06, the problem coming forward with Obama and the gang of eight, I think that was in '15 if I'm right, or '16. Is that you get the far right talk show people saying, oh, my God. This is amnesty. This is amnesty. If you want to come in this6 country, you should get to the back of the line. These people should all be thrown out, like you're going to throw 12 million people out. And then they say, oh, this is just a matter of law. It's a matter of law. They broke the law. They're bad people. The conversation devolved. I think that's what Trump is going to have to experience. He says he'll take the heat, but even for a stable genius, Jesse, it's going to be a lot of heat coming from the right.",

I happen to believe he's right because when you saw -- what you today, and I don't think you can underplay what you saw today. What you saw today was something no president really has done. This is the most transparent presidency you will ever see. I mean, well, I can't say that because we haven't seen what's going to happen next when the robots running our country. But he's a human cannonball. He jumps in, makes the loudest noise and the biggest splash and then the pool settles.

Today, he expanded coverage for veterans for mental health because of the rise in suicides. This is to lower suicide rates.

And in the transcript, Glenn Simpson tells the committee investigators that Steele shared with him that the FBI believe or felt what Steele was saying was credible in part because they had his words of human source inside the Trump campaign. Now, since the transcript has been released there's been a fair amount of pushback about that claims. Sources close to Simpson have told NBC News as well as the Washington Post that what he really meant was that the FBI had intelligence from the Australians and it related to that Trump campaign aide, George Papadopoulos, who, as you know, pled guilty to lying to the FBI. And that's really quite a different than what, in fact, is in this transcript, Juan.",

In an article, Laurie Rubel says colorblindness also holds back minorities, because it doesn't admit that racial strife still exists. According to Campus Reform, the teacher recommends injecting social justice issues into actual math lessons. So I came up with an example: See, Sally is carrying six ski masks to an Antifa rally. She encounters four evil white males who steal two of them. How many ski masks does she have left? Answer: You're racist. But even social justice might not be enough here. Enlightened teachers may still think effort leads to reward, which again, is very evil. Anyway, such conclusions turn a real problem into a bigger one. To deem achievement-based reward is a racist suggests that certain students can't handle actual effort and that becomes part of their identity: the kid who can't do what other kids can. I don't know. I don't think colorblindness or merit-based reward holds back students. It's teachers who seek to reduce education to mere identity politic algebra. This is no help for students once they hit the real world, where results matter, especially if you're looking for a raise. Facts have no feelings and the more you focus on identity, the less you focus on other things that really matter more. That math is so simple even I can do it and I majored in sleep.

It's 5:00 in New York City and this is \"The Five.\" A breakthrough on immigration, a big meeting today at the White House between President Trump and leaders of congress on both sides of the aisle. The American people got to witness this one, and it was pretty extraordinary. The president allowed cameras to roll for more than 45 minutes as he and lawmakers negotiated how best to reach an immigration deal. He's now open to an agreement coming in two phases. First, addressing young immigrants and border security with broader issues to be settled later."

      "utterance": "It's absolutely fascinating. And I have to say, being in D.C., a lot a meetings are like that behind the scenes and then afterwards both sides go to their own cameras and microphones or they'll take turns and they're actually much more partisan in their plain to their base. And what this did was, basically, it was like watching a city council meeting on local access television, but you're actually in the cabinet room with the president and bipartisan lawmakers who did not know that this was going to happen. And what I thought was interesting as everyone actually was there and knew what they were talking about. One thing Dianne Feinstein try to do I thought was pretty smart and strategic is she suggests why don't we just do a clean DACA bill, and the president is like, yeah, that's great. And then McCarthy very subtle said, actually, that wouldn't include security. We need security. And so it's a little risky to be openly negotiating like that, but I thought -- amazingly refreshing. Also I think that a lot of the hardliners, when it comes, especially, to dreamers and DACA have backed off. Above the falls, front page story on USA Today, included three quotes on the front page from -- I say pretty hardline immigration group saying if we need to do amnesty for children who were brought here illegally and it's not their fault, congress won't have any problem from us. So the president is really, actually, at this opportunity where he could do something. And what Lindsey Graham was saying is that your voters actually want you to do this but we're going to need you to take the heat. The president says he's willing to do so if the right wants to come after us and primary us because we're going to vote for something that makes actual common sense. It's a far cry from where we were on the campaign trail when it comes to immigration, but I think that if you can get to a good solution, let political bygones be bygones and just get it done."

He's kind of like the martini that gets everybody talking. He drove a lot of momentum at that meeting. I've never seen so much bipartisanship. Dana said it's always behind closed doors. I've never seen that kind of wheeling and dealing among both sides like that ever before. It was an incredible scene to watch. The cornerstone of the deal is chain migration, lottery, the wall and merit-based. That's what Trump wants. The left wants the DACA. They want the clean DACA vote. Trump almost fell for it and then got rescued when he said, whoa, whoa, whoa, we're not going to do the DACA deal unless we have some border security. The wall will be built. The chain migration is ridiculous. If we want to hire someone from H.R., we don't call K.G. and say, you know, is your uncle in H.R.? That's not how we do it. I don't know why America doesn't like that. And then the lottery, America is not a roulette table. I don't know why we're playing chance with our immigration system. We should use our brains. And then, merit-based, he said that's what Canada does. I thought the liberals love Canada. We want to emulate their health care system. Let's emulate their immigration system too. But, who know. I think the Democrats are squarely. If they do get anything clean, I don't trust that they're going to commit to merit, lottery, or the wall. That's what you've got to do it all at once. So it's a risky deal. Like what Trump says he's ready to take the heat. He loves heat. He loves it."

    {
      "speaker": "JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST",
      "utterance": "Yes, his genius stability. So I think this is something that's been evident. I've written about this last month that it's pretty evident that Donald Trump has opened the door to a deal, a comprehensive deal, because -- guess what, he's the one that set March as the deadline for the dreamers to have a deal, and said to the Democrats let's make a deal. But he's been talking in hard terms just as Jesse was suggesting about the wall, about chain migration. And these things, the wall, it's not just going to happen. I mean, not only the Democrats not in the mood for it because they think it's ridiculous, but the dreamers have been, as you recall, attacking Nancy Pelosi as she was speaking in San Francisco, and say we're not a bargaining chip. Why are you doing this? Of course, they held off in December. Now we have it front and center. The key here is that Trump wants a deal. He says what we have in common is both sides want a deal. The problem in dealing with Donald Trump, the great businessman negotiator, is when you come to the nitty-gritty, when you come to the fine points, he's lacking. He doesn't know the fine points. He just knows we want a deal, so let's make a deal. But now, the problem has been -- remember the problem going back to George W. Bush in '06, the problem coming forward with Obama and the gang of eight, I think that was in '15 if I'm right, or '16. Is that you get the far right talk show people saying, oh, my God. This is amnesty. This is amnesty. If you want to come in this6 country, you should get to the back of the line. These people should all be thrown out, like you're going to throw 12 million people out. And then they say, oh, this is just a matter of law. It's a matter of law. They broke the law. They're bad people. The conversation devolved. I think that's what Trump is going to have to experience. He says he'll take the heat, but even for a stable genius, Jesse, it's going to be a lot of heat coming from the right."

And he's working the assumption that if you're for Trump you will accept any kind of Trump there is. I happen to believe he's right because when you saw -- what you today, and I don't think you can underplay what you saw today. What you saw today was something no president really has done. This is the most transparent presidency you will ever see. I mean, well, I can't say that because we haven't seen what's going to happen next when the robots running our country. But he's a human cannonball. He jumps in, makes the loudest noise and the biggest splash and then the pool settles. And then he figures out something that everyone can agree to disagree on or agree not to do or to do. He figures out the deal. But he gets in there and he makes some noise. This was a response in my opinion to the book."

The media is chasing a mental health fantasy right now. They're chasing a mental health fantasy. Meanwhile, Trump is chasing a mental health reality. Today, he expanded coverage for veterans for mental health because of the rise in suicides. This is to lower suicide rates. So while the despicable media is believing in some batty doctor who basically fell off the face off the earth after calling him a danger to society, and now she's walking it back. What's her name? Bandy? I can't think of her name. He's out there trying to help and save lives. That is an amazing contrast. But again, you've got to go back to this meeting. That was really -- everybody who watched it was transfixed and it was pretty funny watching other networks admit, like, this is something good. And I have to say I'm really getting tired of hearing the word dreamers. We're all dreamers, all right? There is no dreamer privilege here. Just because you're a specific person doesn't make you a dreamer, everybody in the United States is a dreamer. So stop calling this specific group dreamer. That's dreamer privilege."

But in the course of the interview, the lawyer, Joshua Levy, makes the claim that after the dossier was made public a year ago this month by BuzzFeed, that someone was killed as a result.

    {
      "speaker": "HERRIDGE",
      "utterance": "Well, it's right. So Glenn Simpson, who you just see there on the screen, he testified that the British spy, Christopher Steele, who put the research together for the dossier went to the FBI in July, as well late September, early October, just before the presidential election because he felt he was witnessing a crime in progress based on the information he had about these alleged Russian contacts. And in the transcript, Glenn Simpson tells the committee investigators that Steele shared with him that the FBI believe or felt what Steele was saying was credible in part because they had his words of human source inside the Trump campaign. Now, since the transcript has been released there's been a fair amount of pushback about that claims. Sources close to Simpson have told NBC News as well as the Washington Post that what he really meant was that the FBI had intelligence from the Australians and it related to that Trump campaign aide, George Papadopoulos, who, as you know, pled guilty to lying to the FBI. And that's really quite a different than what, in fact, is in this transcript, Juan."

I don't know if people, necessarily, saw, you know, this coming, and just what the repercussions can be of a situation like this. There's been criticism where people have said, oh, why are we continuing to cover this or why are we continuing -- we should cover it. We should chase on the facts of the details. And when you do, you find out information like this. It doesn't look good. I think it helps, you know, the president in terms of what he was saying about the optics of this, and what the motivation was, and that people were trying to get after him and do some harm to his reputation, to his campaign, to his potential, you know, presidency. But it's really out of like a spy movie. It's almost incredible."

Bottom line, if you don't like Trump, then Steele is a whistle-blower. If you don't have a problem with Trump, Steele comes off as a crank. The bottom line, I don't really feel that we've moved anywhere on this.

And then an op-ed in the New York Times written by those people, Simpson -- I can't remember his co-partner. His partner saying that they wanted this transcript released, but, of course, they knew that it was going to be in there that somebody was killed. Like, of course, nobody wants anybody else to get killed. And it's impossible for us to just wait for a conclusion from the special prosecutor. I understand that.

Now we have Glenn Simpson saying, yeah, this guy was paid. That's a pretty big deal to me. So, this guy is getting paid by Hillary. He's double billing the FBI.

Donald Trump is a historical figure in the sense that he's not a politician, which gives a message to a lot of people who didn't live their lives in order to become president or become a politician and, therefore, have lived less careful lives. And he has lived a less careful life and has managed to be president.

She says, quote, \"It was working-class people who elected Trump, so I felt like it was very real and something that needed to be discussed, and especially about polarization in the family and people actually hating other people for the way they voted, which I feel is not American.\" Barr herself says she supports the president, but she may not agree with everything he says.

So she is truly a radical in the sense that, you know, when people hear the word \"radical,\" they think it's uniformly left wing, but a true radical is somebody who zigs when you think they're going to zag. But there's always some kind of internal logic to the things that she does. And there is an internal logic to the decisions that she makes. But she's -- but if you take two data points in her life, you cannot predict a third. Because she's that much of a radical or a rebel. The current crop of comedians, she's an icon.

It was going to be the first of its kind in the school, and the school is predominantly made up of low-income and minority students. But they ran into a hurdle. They were concerned that many of the young men did not have father figures in their lives to bring to the event. So they put out a call to Dallas area men to stand in for the missing dads. They expected, you know, a dozen of people or so to respond. Six hundred men showed up."
