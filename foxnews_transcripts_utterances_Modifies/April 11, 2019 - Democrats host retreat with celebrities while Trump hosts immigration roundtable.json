Congresswoman Ilhan Omar casually kind of dismissing the atrocities of 9/11 and now she's claiming bigots are attacking her for it. A heated debate on this ahead. Plus, why was Obama's Intel czar Jim Clapper so quick to attack Attorney General Bill Barr after he revealed that the Trump team was spied upon. An “Ingraham Angle” investigation ahead. And the rise and fall of Michael Avenatti. It's so sad. We examine how the media's embrace shielded a man who was on the wrong end of 36 federal indictments today. But first, Dems fail the vision test. That's the focus of tonight's “Angle.”  Yesterday gave us a bird's eye view of how starkly different the President's priorities are from those of the Democrats. Now yesterday, the President headed to Texas to focus on two important issues. First illegal immigration. And second, the energy secretary also had a couple of fundraisers. But back in Washington Congressional Democrats worked on their agenda which consists of basically harassing Attorney General Bill Barr about the Mueller Report. And well this. There he is, the goofy House Intel Committee Chair Adam Schiff taking a selfie like a junior high school girl at the House Democrats retreat. Now look at that. In the background there are two Trump painting elites from Tinsel Town singer John Legend and his wife model Chrissy Teigen.  Now Democrats including Speaker Pelosi., they sat mesmerized by the couple's take on politics in America.",

What we should be upset about is not about whether it's called spying or not, but we should be upset about is the red line that the Justice Department and the intelligence agencies under Obama including by Mr. Clapper authorized its use on a presidential campaign. That is a red line that had never been crossed since Watergate. That's the whole reason we have these courts and the FISA statute and all these protections as the attorney general Mr. Barr said in the hearings.  And so, I agree with Judge Starr.

Does China not pose a significant natural security threat to the country? According to Congressman Chris Stewart, China is mining intelligence from an estimated 23 million records of American federal workers, including intelligence and security personnel stolen in those OPM cyberattacks a few years ago. Does China not strong arm American businesses? According to \"Axios,\" China has forced U.S. companies to create joint ventures to do business there. American corporations do just that, handing over half of their companies to state controlled Communist Chinese partners. These are just two examples of something the U.S. deals with on a daily basis, which, again, raises the question, why are we not doing more to isolate China as we did with the USSR? And why are American companies willing to sell out the long-term security and safety of their fellow citizens for a quick buck? And by the way, 800,000 Muslims in reeducation camps in China. Reports are crematoriums are being built near these reeducation camps. Christian churches being levelled, last week, one of the biggest cathedrals in all of China smashed down by a cherry picker.

But first, Dems fail the vision test. That's the focus of tonight's “Angle.” Yesterday gave us a bird's eye view of how starkly different the President's priorities are from those of the Democrats. Now yesterday, the President headed to Texas to focus on two important issues. First illegal immigration. And second, the energy secretary also had a couple of fundraisers. But back in Washington Congressional Democrats worked on their agenda which consists of basically harassing Attorney General Bill Barr about the Mueller Report. And well this. There he is, the goofy House Intel Committee Chair Adam Schiff taking a selfie like a junior high school girl at the House Democrats retreat. Now look at that. In the background there are two Trump painting elites from Tinsel Town singer John Legend and his wife model Chrissy Teigen. Now Democrats including Speaker Pelosi., they sat mesmerized by the couple's take on politics in America."

Back in Texas, the President was speaking with real Americans who had stories to tell that were truly sad. Ranchers who described in vivid detail the bodies of illegal immigrants that they had found on their property just over the past year.

Failure to end infanticide. Failure to stand up to the anti- Semitism. Look I mean here in New York and all I've heard today is anger about what Rep. Omar continues to not only offend Jewish people but now victims of 9/11 and their families. It's just one thing after another and they continue to want to harass President Trump and not deal with the real issues. While President Trump's out there not only meeting with blue collar workers but helping create more jobs. He has helped create more women owned businesses. He's helped raise wages for families.

Because the people that were on that stage from the Union yesterday, they love this president. Well we drove into Crosby Texas it was like a 4th of July parade. There were thousands along the parade route. And then when we were in San Antonio earlier in the morning and the first person spoke up and said the president said what can we do for you in San Antonio. And a gentleman named Jean Powell said well we need to build the barrier. And he said and this is the reason and one rancher after the other rancher after the next property owner talked about finding dead bodies on their property seven last week, three last month.

If President Trump ordered Clapper's emails and phone calls to be secretly read by agents, he'd be the first one out of the blocks accusing the president of spying on him. Of course, the government's spying on the Trump campaign. What we should be upset about is not about whether it's called spying or not, but we should be upset about is the red line that the Justice Department and the intelligence agencies under Obama including by Mr. Clapper authorized its use on a presidential campaign. That is a red line that had never been crossed since Watergate. That's the whole reason we have these courts and the FISA statute and all these protections as the attorney general Mr. Barr said in the hearings. And so, I agree with Judge Starr. If the attorney general mentioned that this was going on, I would be worried if I were Clapper about all these changing stories and I'd be worried if I were some of these officials in the Obama DOJ, FBI and CIA who were misusing these authorities to spy on a presidential campaign"

That's what they were all upset but how dare he say what he thinks before they've done an investigation. How dare Bill Barr. He's just a puppet of Trump. Joe Scarborough is trashing him again, saying, basically, he's just worried about a bad tweet from Trump. That's how much they're demeaning a man with an impeccable record, impeccable record."

      "utterance": "It's a very classic overreaction, but it's also unfair. I was very pleased to see, by the way, that James Comey soft-pedalled this. But here's I think another key takeaway from what Bill Barr said as opposed to these characterizations and the somewhat hysterical reaction, and that is he did not say anything to suggest that the FBI as an institution was somehow implicated or corrupted. He did say there appears to be, he's not come to a judgement, a problem with the former leadership. There we have it. The FBI is you know is filled as you, and I, and John, you know, is filled with men and women of integrity. They deserve better leadership than they've had, and they're getting better leadership. But we also have an attorney general who I think is going to frankly clean house."

While this guy is probably in college, trying to pull all-nighters and get hot coffee at 1:00 a.m., the serious point is we were sending men and women to Afghanistan, some of them to die, to stop a future terrorist attack, and I wanted to do my small part as a lawyer was to make sure they had all the tools at their disposal within the law to stop the next attack. And that's what we did in the Bush administration, and there were no other successful attacks.

Are they not thieves of American ingenuity? In its latest report, the I.P. commission estimated that the cost to the U.S. economy from counterfeit goods, pirated software, and the theft of trade secrets could be as high as $600 billion annually. Does China not pose a significant natural security threat to the country? According to Congressman Chris Stewart, China is mining intelligence from an estimated 23 million records of American federal workers, including intelligence and security personnel stolen in those OPM cyberattacks a few years ago. Does China not strong arm American businesses? According to \"Axios,\" China has forced U.S. companies to create joint ventures to do business there. American corporations do just that, handing over half of their companies to state controlled Communist Chinese partners. These are just two examples of something the U.S. deals with on a daily basis, which, again, raises the question, why are we not doing more to isolate China as we did with the USSR? And why are American companies willing to sell out the long-term security and safety of their fellow citizens for a quick buck? And by the way, 800,000 Muslims in reeducation camps in China. Reports are crematoriums are being built near these reeducation camps. Christian churches being levelled, last week, one of the biggest cathedrals in all of China smashed down by a cherry picker. This is unconscionable. Why are we doing this. Up next, Gordon Chang on whether this type of disengagement is a serious policy prescription. Don't go away."

China is using the profits from trade to expand its military while its senior military officers openly boast about killing Americans. Twice in December, senior PLA, People's Liberation Army officers talked about unprovoked attacks on the U.S. Navy in the global commons. And in the second of those attacks, on December 20th, a rear admiral said, let's use our missiles to kill 10,000 Americans by sinking two aircraft carriers.
