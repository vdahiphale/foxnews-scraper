He came up to Capitol Hill around one o'clock and rammed his car over two Capitol Police officers and then into a security barrier. He jumped out of the car wielding a large knife, that's when he was shot at and killed by U.S. capitol police officers.  The dead officer is Billy Evans. He is a 17-year veteran of the U.S. Capitol Police. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says that Evans was a, quote, \"murder for democracy.\"  We also have a statement here from the Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, he says on this Good Friday I would ask that all Americans pray for healing for the surviving injured officer. Remember, there were two who were attacked here for comfort of officer Evans family and for all officers and families of our U.S. Capitol Police. Now, in just the past couple of moments we have gotten a statement from President Biden about this. He says, quote. \"We send our heartfelt condolences to Officer Evans' family and everyone grieving at this loss. We know what a difficult time this has been for the capitol and everyone who works there and those protected.\"  Biden has ordered flags to be flown at half-staff in honor of Officer Evans. And House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has ordered the same at the U.S. Capitol. The acting U.S. Capitol Police -- excuse me, the acting Washington, D.C. Police Chief Robert Contee says that there appears to be no nexus to terrorism with this attack at the capitol. And note that Constitution Avenue, the access point to the U.S. Capitol, this was blocked off, Juan, just two weeks ago until they brought this outer perimeter of fencing which they installed after the 1/6 riot in closer to the capitol. Had that fencing still been up two to three blocks out from the capitol this incident wouldn't have happened or not at that location? Juan?",

It is awesome watching Major League Baseball pray pretentious virtue league signaling when all Major League platforms for the all-star game fans can vote five times over a 24-hour period.  So, you want to talk about corruption? Look in the mirror, Major League Baseball. Look how you do your voting for all-stars. OK. Let's -- the only reason why MLB is doing this it's connected to the China problem. OK? If you can buy off the woke with this type of virtue signaling, it makes them feel good. It makes the woke feel so good that they really don't care about the slave labor, right? It doesn't really bother them.   So, they're actually buying off these kind of attention-seeking, short attention span activists so they don't chase them after the bigger issues. Now, about the idea of like how this is restriction to voting and that somehow this is a sign of opposing restrictions. This is not. You can't just vote by any way that you think fits. There are guidelines there to vote. You can't vote by shouting out the preferred candidate from your moving car, right? You have to have restrictions, restrictions enable the freedoms, right, from corruption by being transparent. Do you know who should be really for this? Stacey Abrams. She still thinks shah she won that election fair and square. This would have helped her. But the problem is the media has orchestrated this lie, calling it like the Jim Crow era legislation, when, in fact, all it's doing is talking about an I.D.  And here's my final point and my final question. Do any of you people know anybody who doesn't have an I.D.? Because I have been around. I have been around on this world for over half a century. I have never met somebody who doesn't have an I.D. I'm not sheltered. If you could just name one person, one person who doesn't an I.D. and maybe we could have them on the show and talk to them and how they get -- how they get through their lives without an I.D. How are they going to get a passport for their vaccine if they can't prove that's really them?  So, this is where old Democrat arguments go to die. You just push them a little bit.

Lies from Democrats in Georgia and lies from Joe Biden and lies from the White House press secretary Jen Psaki. This bill extends early voting to 17 days. OK? This bill requires voter I.D. for mail-in ballots, which replaces signature matching. Eighty percent of the country supports voter I.D. So, while they are placating and coddling the wokest left and the Twitter feeds that they're afraid of, they are actually against what the majority of the country wants while sowing this racial division that doesn't exist as a result of this law.

We proved the bill along the way and it got better. That was their statement. And then, as soon as all the boycotts and the threats came out, they said, whoa, we hate this thing and it's terrible and we want nothing to do with it. So, you shouldn't have at one point said we made it better, it's got extended hours it. It's got new protections. It's got drop boxes. Delta said it's got drop boxes. Now keep in mind those were illegal before COVID- 19, so they are actually adding things. But Delta has now to completely walk back from that statement and act like they hated the whole thing the whole time? I'm not sure.  But for Major League Baseball, good luck when they start looking around because there are dozens of states that have voter integrity measures, if that's what you want to call them. And many of them are more restrictive than Georgia. So, you are going to have to find a state without.  In fact, I went back and was looking in 2016 Vox ran this report from the group called are perceptions in electoral integrity. They ranked the whole country every state which were the best, which were the most safeguarded, they ranked George and Texas near the bottom, meaning they needed to beef up their election security. So here we are four years later, I wonder what that group would say. There are good moves, or this is a bad idea because you ranked them terrible four years ago.",

But the big question is, that election, our election was compromised because that story was made invisible through the collusion of social network titans and the press. If people had known how compromised the Biden family was that would have had an impact, somewhat maybe, who knows, marginally, I don't know, on the election and we'll never know.",

So, I would say that people should make the best decisions for themselves based on their individual health situation and what they are comfortable with. If you are comfortable with getting the vaccine, get the vaccine. If you are comfortable being around your family, be around your family. If you are comfortable traveling, do that. And I also think there's been a lot of skepticism because there have been different standards for different industries. For example, the airlines have been packing people into cans for months on end while they've kept restaurants closed. Why is that? If flying and traveling is really so dangerous, and we need the CDC to tell us that it's okay to travel, then why has the government not shut down the airlines? I mean, the standards have been different for everybody.

And experts have -- some experts are just very, very fearful of ending up on the wrong side of the media, if they -- if they report something that all of a sudden is a contradiction, or just -- they just are scared of blowback. So, they're constantly -- they're weighing the risks and benefits of what they're going to say before they say it. But I have to -- I have to say that we did learn -- we did get a huge lesson out of this thing for future pandemics. It's bureaucracy that is the barrier. It's the people like this who slow stuff down.  We beat -- we are beating this pandemic through the accelerated biomedical platforms and productions and diagnosis. That's what did this. And it happened in spite of this kind of bureaucratic confusion and chaos. Trump incentivize drug companies to work faster. And that's the solution for the future. Lastly, to this -- Joe Biden just said that too many Americans -- I'll read the quote. \"Too many Americans are acting as if this fight is over. It is not.\" Who is he talking about? I'm tired of -- tired of the Democrats and Joe Biden generalizing about how Americans are abusing science or how America doesn't understand what's going on. Right-leaning people focus on individuals.

He came up to Capitol Hill around one o'clock and rammed his car over two Capitol Police officers and then into a security barrier. He jumped out of the car wielding a large knife, that's when he was shot at and killed by U.S. capitol police officers. The dead officer is Billy Evans. He is a 17-year veteran of the U.S. Capitol Police. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says that Evans was a, quote, \"murder for democracy.\" We also have a statement here from the Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, he says on this Good Friday I would ask that all Americans pray for healing for the surviving injured officer. Remember, there were two who were attacked here for comfort of officer Evans family and for all officers and families of our U.S. Capitol Police. Now, in just the past couple of moments we have gotten a statement from President Biden about this. He says, quote. \"We send our heartfelt condolences to Officer Evans' family and everyone grieving at this loss. We know what a difficult time this has been for the capitol and everyone who works there and those protected.\" Biden has ordered flags to be flown at half-staff in honor of Officer Evans. And House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has ordered the same at the U.S. Capitol. The acting U.S. Capitol Police -- excuse me, the acting Washington, D.C. Police Chief Robert Contee says that there appears to be no nexus to terrorism with this attack at the capitol. And note that Constitution Avenue, the access point to the U.S. Capitol, this was blocked off, Juan, just two weeks ago until they brought this outer perimeter of fencing which they installed after the 1/6 riot in closer to the capitol. Had that fencing still been up two to three blocks out from the capitol this incident wouldn't have happened or not at that location? Juan?"

It is awesome watching Major League Baseball pray pretentious virtue league signaling when all Major League platforms for the all-star game fans can vote five times over a 24-hour period. So, you want to talk about corruption? Look in the mirror, Major League Baseball. Look how you do your voting for all-stars. OK. Let's -- the only reason why MLB is doing this it's connected to the China problem. OK? If you can buy off the woke with this type of virtue signaling, it makes them feel good. It makes the woke feel so good that they really don't care about the slave labor, right? It doesn't really bother them. So, they're actually buying off these kind of attention-seeking, short attention span activists so they don't chase them after the bigger issues. Now, about the idea of like how this is restriction to voting and that somehow this is a sign of opposing restrictions. This is not. You can't just vote by any way that you think fits. There are guidelines there to vote. You can't vote by shouting out the preferred candidate from your moving car, right? You have to have restrictions, restrictions enable the freedoms, right, from corruption by being transparent. Do you know who should be really for this? Stacey Abrams. She still thinks shah she won that election fair and square. This would have helped her. But the problem is the media has orchestrated this lie, calling it like the Jim Crow era legislation, when, in fact, all it's doing is talking about an I.D. And here's my final point and my final question. Do any of you people know anybody who doesn't have an I.D.? Because I have been around. I have been around on this world for over half a century. I have never met somebody who doesn't have an I.D. I'm not sheltered. If you could just name one person, one person who doesn't an I.D. and maybe we could have them on the show and talk to them and how they get -- how they get through their lives without an I.D. How are they going to get a passport for their vaccine if they can't prove that's really them? So, this is where old Democrat arguments go to die. You just push them a little bit. Like tell me who these people are. Don't just say a group of people."

Lies from Democrats in Georgia and lies from Joe Biden and lies from the White House press secretary Jen Psaki. This bill extends early voting to 17 days. OK? This bill requires voter I.D. for mail-in ballots, which replaces signature matching. Eighty percent of the country supports voter I.D. So, while they are placating and coddling the wokest left and the Twitter feeds that they're afraid of, they are actually against what the majority of the country wants while sowing this racial division that doesn't exist as a result of this law. So, it's based on a lie and it hurts the people that Democrats claim to be standing up for the most, which are the workers who will no longer be working in Atlanta at this all-star game."

We proved the bill along the way and it got better. That was their statement. And then, as soon as all the boycotts and the threats came out, they said, whoa, we hate this thing and it's terrible and we want nothing to do with it. So, you shouldn't have at one point said we made it better, it's got extended hours it. It's got new protections. It's got drop boxes. Delta said it's got drop boxes. Now keep in mind those were illegal before COVID- 19, so they are actually adding things. But Delta has now to completely walk back from that statement and act like they hated the whole thing the whole time? I'm not sure. But for Major League Baseball, good luck when they start looking around because there are dozens of states that have voter integrity measures, if that's what you want to call them. And many of them are more restrictive than Georgia. So, you are going to have to find a state without. In fact, I went back and was looking in 2016 Vox ran this report from the group called are perceptions in electoral integrity. They ranked the whole country every state which were the best, which were the most safeguarded, they ranked George and Texas near the bottom, meaning they needed to beef up their election security. So here we are four years later, I wonder what that group would say. There are good moves, or this is a bad idea because you ranked them terrible four years ago."

Did you -- are you missing a computer? That might have been a great follow-up question. Did you drop one off for repair? That might have been a decent follow-up question. You know, Shannon, he lost -- he lost his mother, a sister, and a brother. And is he a recovering addict and all of that is tragic. But when you write a book, and when you traffic in your father's name, you are going to be scrutinized. And all I'm asking is that the media and social media scrutinize him the same way they did the Trump children and the Bush children. Just be fair about it.

I mean, if I lost, I'd be looking for it. Right? I mean, most normal people would. But the bottom line is we knew this was his laptop in October. Mike Emanuel had -- you know, got his hands on the sheet where he --Hunter Biden signed it and dropped it off at the computer repair shop. There is a witness who said that Hunter Biden dropped it off at the repair shop and then the campaign never denied that it was his laptop. So, this is a story that we knew about. It was buried by the big tech companies. Twitter banned anybody who dared to share it. They banned the New York Post for weeks on end for publishing legitimate stories with e- mails and text messages to back up their claims. And, yet, here we are now with him saying, yes, it may have been my laptop and then using a talking point from the left in the media that it was a Russian disinformation campaign. So, the choices are it may have been my laptop or maybe it was stolen by the Russians and then used against me somehow. The bottom line is the evidence shows this is Hunter Biden's laptop."

Twitter locked down the New York Post who did the reporting on this. Now NPR which had a back review out of the new book yesterday had to issue a correction. They had said that U.S. intel discredited the laptop story. They have now had to since come back and say well, actually, that's not true. I mean, Juan, what does the mainstream media do with this story because it's uncomfortable for them the role they played, you know, in the days leading up to the election."

And so, they don't know. That's all they are saying. I will say this. I think that it's easy to go after Hunter Biden. The guy looks pretty weak. I thought that answer was totally limp. You know, nothing to it. Either he says he owns it or he doesn't. It's hard for me to believe he doesn't remember but that's what he says. And as Trey points out he's got a troubled past especially with drugs and the like and guns and women. Everybody knows. He has had a boat load of trouble. But look, you know, I see this as going after Joe Biden. I saw a poll this week said Joe Biden is at 60 percent approval among voters. And yet I hear his critics saying, you now, his wife calls herself Dr. Jill. Well, the wife earned a doctorate or people say Kamala Harris, she laughs too much. She snickers.

If you are a junky, I understand that everything could have happened because you live in a world of lies, right? So, the only -- the best way to remember stuff is to the stuff you said that was honest because you did that once or twice. But here's the problem, his memory is good enough to write a massive memoir. So, if he can remember hundreds and hundreds of pages of his life, he probably remembers this laptop because he gets into pretty graphic detail from what I understand about how his life unfolded with the drugs and the sex and all the other fun stuff and so, I don't know. But the big question is, that election, our election was compromised because that story was made invisible through the collusion of social network titans and the press.

But, look, I think that people are tired of this. I think they are constantly being lectured by people in Washington, D.C. by government bureaucrats about following the science and then they are -- they constantly change their mind and actually go against a lot of the settled science on what vaccines do to protect people from viruses in general. So, I would say that people should make the best decisions for themselves based on their individual health situation and what they are comfortable with. If you are comfortable with getting the vaccine, get the vaccine. If you are comfortable being around your family, be around your family. If you are comfortable traveling, do that. And I also think there's been a lot of skepticism because there have been different standards for different industries. For example, the airlines have been packing people into cans for months on end while they've kept restaurants closed. Why is that? If flying and traveling is really so dangerous, and we need the CDC to tell us that it's okay to travel, then why has the government not shut down the airlines? I mean, the standards have been different for everybody. And it makes a lot of distrust in the system and the very experts who are supposed to be leading us on this have been wrong and they keep changing their mind."

So, when we have the CDC Director coming out and saying things, and then a spokesperson for the CDC is the person who says, well, not exactly, it's very confusing to people. Everybody wants factual information. They want to make good decisions about getting vaccinated, not getting vaccinated, what makes sense for them, their health background, their doctors. But within one agency if you don't even have the same message, that's super confusing to people. And when you talk about things like vaccine passports and forcing people to do certain things, they don't have confidence in following your leadership if you sound like you don't know what you're talking about or you're not sure."

Now, it's not low risk to go through the airport, getting the bus, you know, go to the hotel, some of those things that have the higher risk. I think that's all they're saying. My point is some of this confusion does not equal corruption or conspiracy. I don't think it has any bad intent. Look, we've had -- what do we had -- 60 days of vaccinations. We've had a little over a year of this pandemic. And what you have our scientists at the CDC and elsewhere who are struggling, struggling every day to try to understand the virus and how we can fight it. And I think they're honorable people. I think they're essentially, you know, flying the plane while trying to fix the plane. So, that's to me, you know, evidence that they are trying to make progress.

I mean, misinformation is the enemy of all of us, regardless of the motive of the speaker, whether they're intentionally lying or just mistaken. If you don't get the right information, you're in bad shape. So, what do you think about the conflicting information and in particular having to show a passport, a vaccination passport to use on public carriers?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",

So, if you're going to support that passport ID, then you are as -- you are supporting a Jim Crow health law. How about that? Here's the reason why I think there's a contradiction in what these experts are saying. They're experts. They're not leaders, they're experts. And experts have -- some experts are just very, very fearful of ending up on the wrong side of the media, if they -- if they report something that all of a sudden is a contradiction, or just -- they just are scared of blowback. So, they're constantly -- they're weighing the risks and benefits of what they're going to say before they say it. But I have to -- I have to say that we did learn -- we did get a huge lesson out of this thing for future pandemics. It's bureaucracy that is the barrier. It's the people like this who slow stuff down. We beat -- we are beating this pandemic through the accelerated biomedical platforms and productions and diagnosis. That's what did this. And it happened in spite of this kind of bureaucratic confusion and chaos. Trump incentivize drug companies to work faster. And that's the solution for the future. Lastly, to this -- Joe Biden just said that too many Americans -- I'll read the quote. \"Too many Americans are acting as if this fight is over. It is not.\" Who is he talking about? I'm tired of -- tired of the Democrats and Joe Biden generalizing about how Americans are abusing science or how America doesn't understand what's going on. Right-leaning people focus on individuals. But for some reason, Joe, it's always about the group. It's always about Americans. Too many Americans. Be specific. Tell us who they are, again."

      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "I don't -- all I do is I just speak what's running through my brain, so oftentimes it's not funny. But it's -- the whole point of comedy is taking risks. So, every time you open your mouth, you're basically jumping off a cliff, and you never know where it's going to go. That's why cancel culture is so damaging to people who are comedians, people who go out on stage. I'm not one of those people. I've never done stand up. I've always been in publishing, packaging magazines and books. But it's scary time to be a free thinker."

      "utterance": "Here's the deal. How sad is it that Jesse Watters had to undermine my new show by having a child. Like, this was supposed to be my moment, Juan. This was supposed to be my moment. This whole week was about me. Then, he goes and has a kid or his wife as a kid on April Fool's Day, and then he named it after himself. It's crazy."

She's got the greatest face. They're -- look at that. It's absolutely amazing. You know what's funny about this? Look at that. She's the weather girl. That is a -- that's a Golden Retriever or Jesse likes to refer to them as (INAUDIBLE). But apparently, no one who is hurt. And there are dogs -- there's just dogs all over the place in Moscow apparently. That's all I got. Watch my show."

Take a look at the snowstorm that greeted the Detroit Tigers and the Cleveland baseball team as they played yesterday in Detroit. Home runs had to travel through falling flakes. And take a look at a centerfielder finding a fly ball in the snow. Usually, opening day at Comerica Park draws 42,000 fans. Yesterday, due to the pandemic, the stadium was limited to 8200. In New York, fans had to have proof of vaccination or a negative COVID test. In D.C., the entire weekend series between the Mets and Nationals had to be canceled because of a COVID outbreak among the Nats. I'm telling you, let's play ball in 2021. It's a little different. Trey?"

There's a gentleman in the Philippines who is seeing for the first time in two decades. He's been given back the gift of sight, which is a reminder of the power of medicine, miracles, and also for us not to take things for granted, like the ability to see. It's the first time in 20 years, he can see."

OK, this week, finally, my book is out Women of the Bible Speak. And I cannot thank folks enough for how overwhelming the response has been to this. Some retailers are out. We're getting it restocked. I wanted it to be a message of hope and inspiration and encouragement. So, I hope that is exactly how it's resonating with folks out there. There's also a Fox Nation series, and we have wonderful guests like Kathie Lee Gifford and Sara Evans talking about their own faith journeys and how they're inspired by the powerful, faithful women in the Bible. There's also a podcast, Women of the Bible podcast where you'll hear more about these stories. So, I hope in this Easter weekend, which we cover in the book, that you will be encouraged by the joy of the resurrection and the hope for all things moving forward. And again, thanks for the support of the book. I pray to bless everybody who picks it up."

There was a house that was on fire as a family went out to go grocery shopping on the weekend and it caught on fire. And the Palm Beach Fire Department showed up and the Flagler County Sheriff's Office deputy Jeckovich notice there was a dog stuck inside the burning home and he thought on his feet, thought very quickly, broke the front door because he heard the dog scratching, and he was able to escape. So, thank you to Deputy Jeckovich who broke the front door and let the dog out. And we know that this happened because of the body cam footage. So, thank you to the Sheriff's Department for sharing this scary but hopeful moment with all of us. And thank you to our heroes who work hard every day to save our pets, our homes, and our families."
