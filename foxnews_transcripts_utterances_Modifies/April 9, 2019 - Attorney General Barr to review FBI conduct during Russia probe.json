      "sentences": "All right. Welcome to “Hannity.” All right. Buckle up. An avalanche is coming. I have been telling you about this. It will destroy, if there's any remaining credibility of the tinfoil hat conspiracy theorists and the rage media mob in this country, along with their allies in the Democratic hate-Trump left, and those that have abused power inside and outside of government, you are about to face the justice that many of you deserve.  We have made a promise on this program that we will hold all of them accountable, which has been a central focus of this show. And tonight, we are making real, significant progress on multiple fronts.  Now, what's going to happen in the days and weeks ahead, is this is a short list of what will be made public, beyond the Mueller report. So much more that proves that the reporting and investigation that have gone on this show for over two years will all be proven to be true. All confirmed that the investigative reporting on the show with our ensemble team, that we have been accurate and correct all along. All while the media mob and the Democratic mob have lied to you repeatedly for two and a half years.  This is just a short list of what will soon be made public. For example, we'll get into this tonight, the -- at Judicial Watch, they released today, oh, it's blockbuster. Wait until you hear what we have. Criminal referrals this week by Devin Nunes. Attorney General Barr today pledging an investigation, this has been long overdue. The Horowitz report on FISA abuse, report on the issue of leaking classified information, other information. And, of course, the release of more closed-door testimony, thanks to Congressman Collins. We have more of that tonight and we will be sharing come as a matter of fact, very blockbuster there.  Also, FISA applications, Gang of Eight materials, those 302s, they are all coming out. And also, the Ukraine issue, which is surfacing, that has so much evidence that goes right to the doorstep of yes, Joe Biden. This will all come cascading down on all these bad actors and drowned all of those people that have abused their power. Let's start with Capitol Hill. Attorney General Bill Barr today testified before the House Appropriations Committee, and he was there to talk about the DOJ's budget, but the conversation soon turned to the Mueller report, and faced with the undeniable fact that Trump-Russia collusion was a giant hoax. We have the FBI nine-month investigation, the House Intel investigation, bipartisan Senate investigation, the words are clear, and the Mueller investigation, every single one of these investigations, yes, say there was no Russia collusion whatsoever. None.  And they all in the media mob got it wrong. And now, they are shifting to new conspiracy theories. We want Donald Trump's taxes. Oh, maybe the attorney general is covering up major, phantom crimes hidden deep within the special counsel's full report. The president obstructed justice, even though the attorney general and deputy attorney general said, no, it did not happen.   And, by the way, you can watch Rachel Maddow, the leader of this tinfoil hat conspiracy brigade, once again, they are hoping and hyping and lying to their viewers with a pack of twisted lies. \"Washington Post,\" \"New York Times,\" not much different, once again pushing articles based on hearsay from anonymous sources. The left demanding that the full report be released immediately. But the attorney general today testifying that the full report will be released within a week. No request for executive privilege by the president have been made, the only reactions were applied based on strict, legal guidelines -- you know, like not giving away sources and methods, not allowed to leak or give out grand jury information, that's against the law. Watch this.",

The third are information in the report that could interfere with ongoing prosecutions.

      "sentences": "And now, reports tonight, Barr will form a team to review the FBI's actions during the so-called phony collusion probe. The pendulum is swinging, the boomerang is now headed right back to the top, deep state actors, they will all be held accountable appeared -- mark my words -- criminal indictments are coming. And as we have reported, Congressman Devin Nunes is preparing criminal referrals as we speak for this very week. Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows saying that even more criminal referrals are on the way because of, quote, overwhelming evidence of abuse of power at the highest level of the DOJ and the FBI. And we will be getting the inspector general's report as the attorney general just mentioned, and the FISA applications against Carter Page and the results of the FISA investigation in the Senate.  And at some point, we'll also be getting the report into leaks by John Huber and we'll also be getting the 302s. That's the transcripts between, let's say, Bruce Ohr and Christopher Steele. We'll get those from the FBI, we'll get the Gang of Eight material. And thanks to Congressman Doug Collins, even today, we will be getting all of that closed-door testimony, those transcripts, from all of the key deep state actors.   And as I said, make no mistake, the evidence revealed will come cascading down on those guilty of corruption, bias, abuse of power, and I promise, it will drown them. Today, Collins, in fact, the congressman from Georgia, released testimony from James Baker. Remember, he was Jim Comey's number one lawyer. He was the general counsel at the FBI when Comey was the director. And his remarks on Capitol Hill that were revealed today behind closed-door testimony, it literally reveals the extreme bias and abuse of power that took place, that we have been telling you about at the highest levels of our government. Now, look at this, look at his remarks. James Baker was quite worried pro- Clinton political bias was affecting the FBI's investigation into then candidate Hillary Clinton. Thanks to John Solomon, we also know and I expect we will have confirmed tomorrow, that Baker later testified in a different closed-door hearing, Hillary Clinton's misconduct was alarming and appalling. And Baker said this, and its key: he believed that Clinton should have been indicted with crimes, the Espionage Act. All of these liberals concerned about obstruction of justice -- well, there was intent when Hillary deleted e-mails and acid washed her hard drive, we have the testimony of James Baker today, the exact date that they used Bleach Bit. But, of course, he was talked out of it by his boss, Jim Comey and a few others.  And that's not all. At this testimony released on Baker today is revealing what is rampant anti-Trumpet bias inside the highest levels of the FBI. Not rank-and-file. It's what we have been saying all along, we've been right all along, the chosen candidate, Hillary Clinton, got a free pass. We have a dual system of justice, no equal justice under the law, no equal application of our laws.  Trump, he was politically persecuted. They wanted him to lose, and they had an insurance policy when he won. When Baker testified that he was, quote, alarmed -- and listen to this -- freaked out when he saw the anti- Trump text between FBI investigator Strzok and FBI lawyer Lisa Page. Remember, Strzok was writing the exoneration with Comey in May, before they even did the investigation. And he was the one that interviewed Hillary Clinton. He also revealed, meaning James Baker, that Hillary Clinton's bought and paid for, phony, Russian dossier -- yes, it played a serious role in the FBI's investigation into Trump.   But we now know that Clinton paid for it. They knew it then, we knew it wasn't verified, it wasn't corroborated, and the author, well, you can verify he would never stand by himself, because he doesn't stand by it. In other words, there would have been no probable cause to investigate the campaign without Clinton's dirty Russian dossier. But, of course, Baker actually read the dossier. He had bits prior to the election, that came out today. He had a personal relationship with one of the attorneys from Perkins Coie, that's the law firm that the Clinton campaign funneled the money to so they could hire Fusion GPS, and op research firm, to then hire, of course, Christopher Steele, that then use phony, uncorroborated, Russian dirt to impact an election, how ironic.  And Baker admitted he was the intermediary between Perkins Coie and the FBI. Baker also, in this new information today, admitting he had contact with the reporter, left-winger, David Corn, prior to the election about the dossier. And he said Corn, a left-wing activist, was anxious to get the dossier into the hands of the FBI.  What does it all mean? That Comey's top lawyer, the number one lawyer at the FBI, the general counsel of the FBI, the general counsel of the FBI under Comey, James Baker, knew about rampant, pro-Hillary, anti-Trump bias, inside the FBI, to impact an election to favor one candidate over another. And, by the way, they did nothing to stop it, even though he believed crimes were committed. And that same attorney, James Baker, was in close contact with Clinton's bought and paid for law firm, and by the way, was being fed the dirty, totally phony, dossier from multiple sources, including a member of the media desperate to stop Trump. This is the United States of America, this is not banana republic. And there is more. Baker testifying in this new testimony, we just got today, that after Trump became president, the deputy attorney general who appointed Robert Mueller, Rod Rosenstein, well, he was seriously discussing a plot to remove the president under the 25th amendment. And in a separate incident, Baker alleging that Rod Rosenstein offered to wear a wire and spy on President Trump. Baker testifying that it was a very serious offer, and that Rosenstein wasn't joking.   It was revealed from today's release, it should shock the conscience of every American to their core -- let me put it this way: they tried to influence an election. And then when it didn't work, they tried to remove a duly-elected president.  Now, this damning evidence showing rampant abuse of power and corruption, it should be on the front pitch of every newspaper in this country. It is not because the rage-Trump media mob is complicit and what is a major cover-up of a deep state coup that threatened the very fabric of this great republic. And now tonight, because of judicial watch, Tom Fitton will join us later, we are finding out even more devastating information about how the deep state protected Hillary Clinton before turning their forces against Donald Trump. This is also a huge development, just out today, and we are going to break it down for you. The freedom of information act request by Judicial Watch from 2016, well, today bore fruit. It forced to the release of 422 pages of FBI documents surrounding Platte River Network. Remember Platte River Networks? That is where Hillary, the mom-and-pop shop, that had her server in a back room closet, remember that?  One government official was reviewing a batch of e-mails on the server wrote, quote: I can say now without reservation that there are literally hundreds of classified e-mails in this collection, 18 USC 793. Violation clear of the Espionage Act.  She continues: I'm very concerned about the release about the inadvertent release of the State Department's equities. When this collection is released in its entirety, the potential damage to the foreign relations of the United States could be significant, pretty much admitting that foreign actors got a hold of Hillary Clinton's e-mails. This is all coming out today. Now, get this -- FBI notes of an interview with an unidentified Platte Rivers Network official. This took place in February of ‘16. It shows an e-mail from December 11th, 2014. Hillary is wanting to run now for president, reading, quote: Hillary cover-up operation, work ticket, archive, clean up. Cover-up operation?  Then they go further, they actually give the exact date that they used the Bleach Bit to wipe the server clean, and the official being interviewed stated that the cover-up operation, e-mail, quote, probably related to a change to 60-day e-mail retention policy back up. Well, we know now that just a few months later, Platte River Networks downloaded the Bleach Bit from a vendor source called Source Forge at 11:42 a.m., hang on, March 31st, 2015. What was happening then? Oh, the Democratic candidates were debating, trying to get the nomination. Wow. Perfect time to get rid of all of this.   We know the exact second she obstructed justice in this case. That was after the deletions, prior to the beating up of the devices with hammers. Bleach Bit used on her server.  Let's sum this up. So, the FBI has proof Hillary Clinton mishandled hundreds if not thousands of top secret, classified e-mails. A clear violation of the espionage took place, and then bend over backwards, they didn't charge her, even Page and Strzok admitted that, oh, the attorney general and the DOJ were protecting her because they are all Democrats. The FBI also had proof that Clinton decided to erase 33,000 subpoenaed e- mails, acid washed the hard drives with Bleach Bit, beat up the device and with hammers, removed SIM cards, and yet they didn't even consider charging her with obstruction. It was a rigged investigation, and yet we spent the last two years on a witch hunt against Donald Trump based on phony campaign op research, Clinton putting together a phony Russian dossier. And as I said at the top of the monologue, the avalanche is coming. Equal justice is about to be served -- Comey, Clinton, Strzok, Page, McCabe, tick tock.   Joining us now, author of -- wow, what a book this was from the very beginning. It is \"The Russia Hoax: The Illicit Scheme to Clear Hillary Clinton and Frame Donald Trump\", Gregg Jarrett. And investigative reporter, Fox News contributor, Sara Carter. Let's start with you. The legal aspects of this, this is clear what has happened. It's really a small group of people.",

They are virulently anti-Trump. They are profane. And he is leading the investigation of Trump. There was never any credible evidence to launch the investigation, and Lisa Page verified that in her own testimony.  Comey grudgingly admitted it. And then they made matters worse. They lied to FISA judges to obtain a wiretap warrant, so all of this, I think, William Barr is going to investigate. And when he receives them, sometimes this week from members of Congress, a criminal referral, he will read what they are laying out. The facts, the evidence, and the law, which will initiate, I believe, a criminal investigation by Barr.",

Yet, his general counsel had been fighting with them for I don't even know how long, in fact, throughout the whole investigation, basically arguing that this was gross negligence, up until the very last day. And that's in Baker's testimony, when he finally changed his mind.  And he didn't answer as to why. It was as if he said he was talked into it. At the very last minute, he decided to change his mind. But you could see that he was appalled by it. He was disgusted by it. And then the fact that Comey came out and made that statement just shows that Comey was being dishonest from the very beginning.  Attorney General William Barr has a lot on his hands, because he doesn't just have to look at the Crossfire Hurricane investigation, when it started at the end of July, but he is really going to be looking at what happened before that, with Stefan Halper, the mole that was working for the FBI who was in London, and his contact with George Papadopoulos, and how that all unfolded. And also, all the information that leaked out on General Flynn. This is vitally important to understanding what was going on there.

And the reason it's money laundering is because when the parents allegedly paid the bribe money to the ring leader of the scandal Rick Singer they funneled it through his purported charity. In other words, they tried to hide the payment and then clean it. The parents were also charged with wire fraud because the Fed say they brought the money from outside of the United States, with the purpose of committing a crime inside the US. Some of the parents have already said they plan to fight the case in court and prosecutors say a few of the parents who fessed up early and cooperated may avoid jail time. But for Lori Loughlin, her husband and others, prosecutors say they won't listen to any plea deal that does not include at least two years of prison. And now People Magazine is reporting that Lori Loughlin has refused a plea deal because she won't accept the jail time.

This will all come cascading down on all these bad actors and drowned all of those people that have abused their power. Let's start with Capitol Hill. Attorney General Bill Barr today testified before the House Appropriations Committee, and he was there to talk about the DOJ's budget, but the conversation soon turned to the Mueller report, and faced with the undeniable fact that Trump-Russia collusion was a giant hoax. We have the FBI nine-month investigation, the House Intel investigation, bipartisan Senate investigation, the words are clear, and the Mueller investigation, every single one of these investigations, yes, say there was no Russia collusion whatsoever. None. And they all in the media mob got it wrong. And now, they are shifting to new conspiracy theories. We want Donald Trump's taxes. Oh, maybe the attorney general is covering up major, phantom crimes hidden deep within the special counsel's full report. The president obstructed justice, even though the attorney general and deputy attorney general said, no, it did not happen. And, by the way, you can watch Rachel Maddow, the leader of this tinfoil hat conspiracy brigade, once again, they are hoping and hyping and lying to their viewers with a pack of twisted lies. \"Washington Post,\" \"New York Times,\" not much different, once again pushing articles based on hearsay from anonymous sources. The left demanding that the full report be released immediately. But the attorney general today testifying that the full report will be released within a week. No request for executive privilege by the president have been made, the only reactions were applied based on strict, legal guidelines -- you know, like not giving away sources and methods, not allowed to leak or give out grand jury information, that's against the law. Watch this."

The second is information that the I.C., intelligence community, believes would reveal intelligence sources and methods. The third are information in the report that could interfere with ongoing prosecutions. And finally, we intend to redact information that implicates the privacy or reputational interest of peripheral players where there is a decision not to charge them.

The same can't be said for the high-ranking FBI and DOJ officials, just the upper echelon, responsible for the witch hunt against the Trump campaign. Remember, code name \"Crossfire Hurricane\", not the innocuous midterm report. Today, major news, the Attorney General Barr vowing to hold them accountable. This is key, in what \"The Hill's\" John Solomon is calling, quote, the single sentence Russia bombshell that Barr delivered to Congress today that very few in the media picked up of, but this is crucial.

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "And now, reports tonight, Barr will form a team to review the FBI's actions during the so-called phony collusion probe. The pendulum is swinging, the boomerang is now headed right back to the top, deep state actors, they will all be held accountable appeared -- mark my words -- criminal indictments are coming. And as we have reported, Congressman Devin Nunes is preparing criminal referrals as we speak for this very week. Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows saying that even more criminal referrals are on the way because of, quote, overwhelming evidence of abuse of power at the highest level of the DOJ and the FBI. And we will be getting the inspector general's report as the attorney general just mentioned, and the FISA applications against Carter Page and the results of the FISA investigation in the Senate. And at some point, we'll also be getting the report into leaks by John Huber and we'll also be getting the 302s. That's the transcripts between, let's say, Bruce Ohr and Christopher Steele. We'll get those from the FBI, we'll get the Gang of Eight material. And thanks to Congressman Doug Collins, even today, we will be getting all of that closed-door testimony, those transcripts, from all of the key deep state actors. And as I said, make no mistake, the evidence revealed will come cascading down on those guilty of corruption, bias, abuse of power, and I promise, it will drown them. Today, Collins, in fact, the congressman from Georgia, released testimony from James Baker. Remember, he was Jim Comey's number one lawyer. He was the general counsel at the FBI when Comey was the director. And his remarks on Capitol Hill that were revealed today behind closed-door testimony, it literally reveals the extreme bias and abuse of power that took place, that we have been telling you about at the highest levels of our government."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Now, look at this, look at his remarks. James Baker was quite worried pro- Clinton political bias was affecting the FBI's investigation into then candidate Hillary Clinton. Thanks to John Solomon, we also know and I expect we will have confirmed tomorrow, that Baker later testified in a different closed-door hearing, Hillary Clinton's misconduct was alarming and appalling. And Baker said this, and its key",
      "utterance": "he believed that Clinton should have been indicted with crimes, the Espionage Act. All of these liberals concerned about obstruction of justice -- well, there was intent when Hillary deleted e-mails and acid washed her hard drive, we have the testimony of James Baker today, the exact date that they used Bleach Bit. But, of course, he was talked out of it by his boss, Jim Comey and a few others. And that's not all. At this testimony released on Baker today is revealing what is rampant anti-Trumpet bias inside the highest levels of the FBI. Not rank-and-file. It's what we have been saying all along, we've been right all along, the chosen candidate, Hillary Clinton, got a free pass. We have a dual system of justice, no equal justice under the law, no equal application of our laws. Trump, he was politically persecuted. They wanted him to lose, and they had an insurance policy when he won. When Baker testified that he was, quote, alarmed -- and listen to this -- freaked out when he saw the anti- Trump text between FBI investigator Strzok and FBI lawyer Lisa Page. Remember, Strzok was writing the exoneration with Comey in May, before they even did the investigation. And he was the one that interviewed Hillary Clinton. He also revealed, meaning James Baker, that Hillary Clinton's bought and paid for, phony, Russian dossier -- yes, it played a serious role in the FBI's investigation into Trump. But we now know that Clinton paid for it. They knew it then, we knew it wasn't verified, it wasn't corroborated, and the author, well, you can verify he would never stand by himself, because he doesn't stand by it. In other words, there would have been no probable cause to investigate the campaign without Clinton's dirty Russian dossier. But, of course, Baker actually read the dossier. He had bits prior to the election, that came out today. He had a personal relationship with one of the attorneys from Perkins Coie, that's the law firm that the Clinton campaign funneled the money to so they could hire Fusion GPS, and op research firm, to then hire, of course, Christopher Steele, that then use phony, uncorroborated, Russian dirt to impact an election, how ironic. And Baker admitted he was the intermediary between Perkins Coie and the FBI. Baker also, in this new information today, admitting he had contact with the reporter, left-winger, David Corn, prior to the election about the dossier. And he said Corn, a left-wing activist, was anxious to get the dossier into the hands of the FBI. What does it all mean? That Comey's top lawyer, the number one lawyer at the FBI, the general counsel of the FBI, the general counsel of the FBI under Comey, James Baker, knew about rampant, pro-Hillary, anti-Trump bias, inside the FBI, to impact an election to favor one candidate over another. And, by the way, they did nothing to stop it, even though he believed crimes were committed. And that same attorney, James Baker, was in close contact with Clinton's bought and paid for law firm, and by the way, was being fed the dirty, totally phony, dossier from multiple sources, including a member of the media desperate to stop Trump. This is the United States of America, this is not banana republic. And there is more. Baker testifying in this new testimony, we just got today, that after Trump became president, the deputy attorney general who appointed Robert Mueller, Rod Rosenstein, well, he was seriously discussing a plot to remove the president under the 25th amendment. And in a separate incident, Baker alleging that Rod Rosenstein offered to wear a wire and spy on President Trump. Baker testifying that it was a very serious offer, and that Rosenstein wasn't joking."

      "utterance": "they tried to influence an election. And then when it didn't work, they tried to remove a duly-elected president. Now, this damning evidence showing rampant abuse of power and corruption, it should be on the front pitch of every newspaper in this country. It is not because the rage-Trump media mob is complicit and what is a major cover-up of a deep state coup that threatened the very fabric of this great republic. And now tonight, because of judicial watch, Tom Fitton will join us later, we are finding out even more devastating information about how the deep state protected Hillary Clinton before turning their forces against Donald Trump. This is also a huge development, just out today, and we are going to break it down for you. The freedom of information act request by Judicial Watch from 2016, well, today bore fruit. It forced to the release of 422 pages of FBI documents surrounding Platte River Network. Remember Platte River Networks? That is where Hillary, the mom-and-pop shop, that had her server in a back room closet, remember that?"

      "speaker": "She continues",
      "utterance": "I'm very concerned about the release about the inadvertent release of the State Department's equities. When this collection is released in its entirety, the potential damage to the foreign relations of the United States could be significant, pretty much admitting that foreign actors got a hold of Hillary Clinton's e-mails. This is all coming out today. Now, get this -- FBI notes of an interview with an unidentified Platte Rivers Network official. This took place in February of ‘16. It shows an e-mail from December 11th, 2014. Hillary is wanting to run now for president, reading, quote: Hillary cover-up operation, work ticket, archive, clean up. Cover-up operation? Then they go further, they actually give the exact date that they used the Bleach Bit to wipe the server clean, and the official being interviewed stated that the cover-up operation, e-mail, quote, probably related to a change to 60-day e-mail retention policy back up. Well, we know now that just a few months later, Platte River Networks downloaded the Bleach Bit from a vendor source called Source Forge at 11:42 a.m., hang on, March 31st, 2015. What was happening then? Oh, the Democratic candidates were debating, trying to get the nomination. Wow. Perfect time to get rid of all of this. We know the exact second she obstructed justice in this case. That was after the deletions, prior to the beating up of the devices with hammers. Bleach Bit used on her server. Let's sum this up. So, the FBI has proof Hillary Clinton mishandled hundreds if not thousands of top secret, classified e-mails. A clear violation of the espionage took place, and then bend over backwards, they didn't charge her, even Page and Strzok admitted that, oh, the attorney general and the DOJ were protecting her because they are all Democrats. The FBI also had proof that Clinton decided to erase 33,000 subpoenaed e- mails, acid washed the hard drives with Bleach Bit, beat up the device and with hammers, removed SIM cards, and yet they didn't even consider charging her with obstruction. It was a rigged investigation, and yet we spent the last two years on a witch hunt against Donald Trump based on phony campaign op research, Clinton putting together a phony Russian dossier. And as I said at the top of the monologue, the avalanche is coming. Equal justice is about to be served -- Comey, Clinton, Strzok, Page, McCabe, tick tock. Joining us now, author of -- wow, what a book this was from the very beginning. It is \"The Russia Hoax: The Illicit Scheme to Clear Hillary Clinton and Frame Donald Trump\", Gregg Jarrett. And investigative reporter, Fox News contributor, Sara Carter. Let's start with you. The legal aspects of this, this is clear what has happened. It's really a small group of people."

You know, he knows, and there always a plethora of evidence, that the process by the FBI was corrupted by political bias and personal animus. Just take a look at the text messages from Peter Strzok. They are virulently anti-Trump. They are profane. And he is leading the investigation of Trump. There was never any credible evidence to launch the investigation, and Lisa Page verified that in her own testimony. Comey grudgingly admitted it. And then they made matters worse. They lied to FISA judges to obtain a wiretap warrant, so all of this, I think, William Barr is going to investigate. And when he receives them, sometimes this week from members of Congress, a criminal referral, he will read what they are laying out. The facts, the evidence, and the law, which will initiate, I believe, a criminal investigation by Barr."

      "speaker": "SARA CARTER, CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "This is what is so interesting, Sean, because the most important point here is that Comey went out before the public and said no reasonable prosecutor would bring charges against Hillary Clinton. Yet, his general counsel had been fighting with them for I don't even know how long, in fact, throughout the whole investigation, basically arguing that this was gross negligence, up until the very last day. And that's in Baker's testimony, when he finally changed his mind. And he didn't answer as to why. It was as if he said he was talked into it. At the very last minute, he decided to change his mind. But you could see that he was appalled by it. He was disgusted by it. And then the fact that Comey came out and made that statement just shows that Comey was being dishonest from the very beginning. Attorney General William Barr has a lot on his hands, because he doesn't just have to look at the Crossfire Hurricane investigation, when it started at the end of July, but he is really going to be looking at what happened before that, with Stefan Halper, the mole that was working for the FBI who was in London, and his contact with George Papadopoulos, and how that all unfolded. And also, all the information that leaked out on General Flynn. This is vitally important to understanding what was going on there. And I'm telling you, Lieutenant General Flynn is a big mystery here. The answers are going to come forward."

All right. So the rest of the meeting tonight, they're focused on, OK, the Mueller report. While, may become he did obstruct justice, but let's go over what is coming. We have Tom Fitton in the next. All of the FOIA requests are coming out, Sara. Criminal referrals this week by Nunes, Barr pledging an investigation, the I.G. report on FISA abuse, leaking report by Huber, release of more closed-door testimony thanks to Doug Collins of Georgia -- the FISA applications, Gang of Eight materials, 302s, and now, of course, the Ukraine incident.

Here to explain more, Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton, Fox News contributor Jason Chaffetz. They use the word, Tom, \"cover-up.\" That's their word, talking about Clinton, they give us the date that Bleach Bit was used. And obviously, we now know from what you released today when they tested -- they only sampled 40 e-mails and they found four that were classified and top-secret. To me, this is damning evidence that she should have, from the get-go, been charged with violation of the Espionage Act, and I don't know. You know, she deletes subpoenaed e-mails and you Bleach Bit your hard drive, and bust up your devices, we know the intent is pretty clear. You want to eliminate the evidence."

And this is FBI notes, noting the Clinton e-mail cover-up, the cover-up activities. These are FBI notes and documents showing that there was this mass deletion of information. And, of course, the intelligence community had a heart attack, collectively, when they saw the hundreds of classified e-mails on her system. In fact, one of the individuals said, you know, in theory, her whole flow system should be classified, everything should be classified. And yet, nothing was done. You have to compare and contrast their refusal to act on this evidence of obstruction of justice and destruction of evidence, and lies, with what they were doing at the same time, targeting President Trump. By the way, that cover-up e-mail document? That was in December of 2014, around the very same time that Hillary Clinton secretly was forced to turn over her e-mails to the State Department, and they are talking about covering them up. And then the Bleach Bit took place less than a few weeks after it was first publicly disclosed as a result of Judicial Watch FOIA investigation that these e-mails existed. It comes out in the press, and within weeks, you got this mass deletion, and the documents show Hillary Clinton's lawyers told the vendors, don't talk to the FBI, you're not supposed to talk about the deleted information and what the lawyers may have asked you to do there."

As they go Left, as they try their best to be socialists and embrace the policies like The Green New Deal, they will alienate themselves increasingly from the mainstream of American voters. The President's challenge is to seem reasonable, to understand the concerns of the young folks, without being you know embracing these crazy notions of the Left."

You want to put the nukes in this guy's hand? He's using social media to threaten a nuclear holocaust. Are we sure about that? But Sean, listen, although the energy and the money in a Democratic primary right now may be with radical ideas, also it gives you headlines if you're a candidate right, let's be candid. When you put actual meat on the bone and you tell voting Americans what this stuff entails, for instance, The Green New Deal is going to cost a family $65,000 a year, when you mention your tax rates could be anywhere from 50 to 90 percent depending on who you vote for, when you tell them, hey that Medicare For All really means you're not the consumer of health care anymore, the government is, meaning the government's determining when you can crack your chest open for a life-saving surgery, all of a sudden every American recoils in horror and goes, oh that's not what I thought they were talking about. So, once the meat gets on the bone, this is going to end very badly for them when the primary season is over."

Wages aren't going up, they were up 3 percent. Jobs aren't growing, jobs are growing, why would employment set record low numbers.

Looks like the exit polls like in 2004, 2016, looks like many of them were wrong today in Israel, as the Prime Minister now is well-positioned with a right coalition, conservative coalition, that the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will continue in that position. Very crucial - crucial vote in Israel today. New charges filed also in the college admissions scandal. Here with the very latest live from our West Coast newsroom, Fox News correspondent Trace Gallagher. Trace, looks like those that listened to the prosecutors and said you better listen to us made a pretty smart move yesterday."

      "utterance": "Indeed they did, Sean, you know for Lori Loughlin, her fashion designer husband Mossimo Giannulli and 14 other parents, the new indictment adds a money-laundering charge which could up the jail time significantly. And the reason it's money laundering is because when the parents allegedly paid the bribe money to the ring leader of the scandal Rick Singer they funneled it through his purported charity. In other words, they tried to hide the payment and then clean it. The parents were also charged with wire fraud because the Fed say they brought the money from outside of the United States, with the purpose of committing a crime inside the US. Some of the parents have already said they plan to fight the case in court and prosecutors say a few of the parents who fessed up early and cooperated may avoid jail time. But for Lori Loughlin, her husband and others, prosecutors say they won't listen to any plea deal that does not include at least two years of prison. And now People Magazine is reporting that Lori Loughlin has refused a plea deal because she won't accept the jail time. And finally, we should mention their youngest daughter Olivia Jade finally got her trademark application accepted for her new line of makeup. The application had initially been denied because of punctuation mistakes, though we should note she's a Communications major, not English."

Just some humble advice, if he did it, we believe in due process presumption of innocence, if they did it and I think I'd fall on the sword very quickly. Alright, Congresswoman Omar under fire yet again. This is what she tweeted, listen to this, Stephen Miller is a white nationalist. No, he's not. And the fact that he still has influence on policy and political appointments is an outrage. But that's not all, look at this keynote speech that she gave to CARE not long ago just on earth, listen to what Congresswoman Omar said about the 9/11 attacks where we lost 3,000 - nearly 3,000 fellow Americans."

And you know both Ocasio-Cortez and to an extent Representative Abe and also Representative Omar, they're basically creatures of social media and identity politics I don't want to disparage them unnecessarily, but they have no achievement, they have no wealth of knowledge they draw on, so they - each night, they tweet something that's more ignorant than the last week. It's anti-Semitic, it's bigotry, shows an ignorance of the Middle East of history, of economics. And the question, Sean is though, why do they have such resonance, why do the three leading candidates Beto and Biden and Bernie, why are they falling all over themselves to apologize for their privilege or to apologize for the history of white toxic masculinity? I think the answer is that these three representatives have terrified the Democratic Party because they've suggested that they represent a constituency without which the Democrats can't win. I don't think that's true, but there's sort of a reign of terror going on that these three have engineered, and reminds me of the Hans Christian Andersen myth about the emperor with no clothes. All of us who are normal and rational look at these three and say you know what, they have no clothes on, but the myth said, if you ever said that, you would be considered stupid. So all of the Democrats say, oh these are very impressive people, but they are not."
