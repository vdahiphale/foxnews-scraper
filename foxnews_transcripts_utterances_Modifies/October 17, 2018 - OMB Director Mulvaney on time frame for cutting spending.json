A few surprises that we've gone through these numbers.  A few surprises buried in there. So, what are the deciding factors and whose voters are actually going to show up at the polls in 19 days? Good evening, everybody. I'm Martha MacCallum and this is \"The Story\" that everyone is trying to predict right now. So far, most of the experts that seem to agree that Republicans are likely to hold the Senate and lose the house. There is one huge question mark that hangs over all of this, and that's the memory of 2016 when conventional wisdom turned out to be so wrong.  One of the country's most prominent pollsters Nate Silver, who predicted that Hillary Clinton would win by 71 percent right before the elections is now doing a little bit of damage control ahead of these midterms. Writing this week that, \"Polls and forecasts are pretty good instruments. But they are not all that precise. And we should all be prepared for the possibility of another election night like this.\"",

I don't know whether we'll get more of that in a couple of weeks' time. I think the story here is that there's a theory in polling and in communication that goes back to the early 1970s, it's called the spiral of silence. And what it says is that when there's a situation where there's a kind of approved point of view that everyone thinks is the right one. But it conflicts with what people really think.  They don't want to say their opinion because they think they're going to be criticized for it. That was so true with Brexit where all the establishment said, you got to be against Brexit. And yet, people didn't feel that way same with Donald Trump.   Right up until recently, I felt that, that wasn't the case this time around because everyone is so open about their how they feel about President Trump and so on. But that changed slightly with the Kavanaugh battle where it seemed to me that again, you've got this approved view from the establishment about what you're supposed to think. You're supposed to be someone who believes in Dr. Ford and if you believe Kavanaugh, then, there's something not quite right about you. I think that's changed the dynamic.  And I think that once again, you're seeing people feeling something that isn't quite OK to say out loud, that might turn into real votes.",

And up into this point of the Trump administration, you've had the old traditional Republican part of the GOP coalition. Not quite know the value long term of Trumpism and you had some voters who like Trump better than they liked Republicans. And they didn't see the value in electing a Republican majority. In the Kavanaugh confirmation, Republicans saw that it took someone as tough as Donald Trump to stand by Kavanaugh and get him through that fire.  And Trumper saw that it took a Republican majority to achieve the president's objectives.

What's at the front of their mind when they go and vote? Then, it is to change their opinion. So, that's not good news for Republicans if health care really is at the front of people's minds. And so, they need to work really hard to raise the relevance of the issue where they're strong, and that's obviously the economy.   But there's one other I'd point to which is immigration. It's actually quite far down the list, but it's one where the base of the Republican Party strongly agrees with what President Trump stands for on that issue.  And as that news agenda changes perhaps with this caravan coming up through Central America, that could raise the relevance of an issue that could be good to get out the Republican base.",

But if some of these House races, Bradd, are happening in places where you have a lot of moderates -- you know, outside of the cities, in the suburbs.  And a lot of women who actually do care about things like immigration and border security, and those kinds of issues, and that will be an interesting factor here now.",

A lot of House races are in those large counties in metropolitan areas. Donald Trump ran ahead of Mitt Romney in 1,450 of the 1,500 smallest counties. And so, those counties dominate a lot of the Senate states, Missouri, Montana, Indiana, North Dakota. And so, you really are kind of seeing a tale of sort of two different kinds of Americas in this -- in this election. And for Democrats, have pinned their hopes on those dense suburbs, that were a lot of suburban women -- independent women have negative views of the president.   Republicans meanwhile, have a great chance in states where there are rural industrial voters. And you know, I think immigration rising is an issue favorite Republicans if it becomes a bigger issue toward the November elections. You know, Independents tend to side with Republicans on immigration and other security type issues. And they side with Democrats on things like healthcare and education.",

And reports of audio that are said to exist that reveal the horrific seven-minute torture and then killing of Jamaal Khashoggi involving first severing his fingers then beheading and dismembering him, as the killers blocked out his screams by listening to music on their headphones.

But what might be the big difference of course, is there was no corroborating evidence against Kavanaugh but in this case this story is turning against Saudi Arabia hard. The President stressing that all this is coming in a broader context. He did an interview with Fox Business today. He said the U.S. needs Saudi Arabia in the fight against Iran, various terrorists around the world, but that has left him open to critics saying that he's giving Saudi Arabia the benefit of the doubt, letting them off the hook when the details that you just mentioned keep pouring in about the death of Washington Post Columnist Jamal Khashoggi and they're simply horrifying. Reports tonight that he was butchered alive during that gruesome execution inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Audiotapes allegedly revealing Khashoggi was beheaded and then dismembered. One tape has a Saudi official declaring \"do this outside, you're going to get me in trouble.\" Another voice response \"shut up if you want to live when you return to Saudi Arabia.\" Well, the President said today he has asked for any tapes that do exist.  His Secretary of State Mike Pompeo as you mentioned headed home here to Washington after visits with leaders in Turkey and Saudi Arabia both men saying they've been promised a full investigation as they also stress they do not want long-term damage to the Saudi relationship.

And the one thing that's really bipartisan in Washington, D.C. is spending more money. It's what you essentially buy Democrat votes. So that's why we did what we did. You and I can talk maybe another time about the control of the House. I'm not as convinced as you are that that's getting ready to happen. But regardless, these are the president's priorities. He takes the deficit seriously, he's taking spending seriously, we're doing a great job of growing the economy and getting new revenues into the government.

So, when you say entitlements and Mitch McConnell talks about entitlements, social security and Medicare are a challenge to the deficit several years out. Right now, they're actually not what's driving the deficit this year. We had things like hurricane spending, and a bunch of different things, we had a CAPs deal that increased spending last year. So, it's actually the discretionary spending that's having a big impact right now. Keep in mind that the president's budget that we introduced last year, was the largest mandatory of spending reduction proposal in history. But it did not touch social just or Medicare. There is a lot of other entitlement programs that we could fix, that we can reform, without touching core social security and core Medicare.

A few surprises that we've gone through these numbers.  A few surprises buried in there. So, what are the deciding factors and whose voters are actually going to show up at the polls in 19 days? Good evening, everybody. I'm Martha MacCallum and this is \"The Story\" that everyone is trying to predict right now. So far, most of the experts that seem to agree that Republicans are likely to hold the Senate and lose the house. There is one huge question mark that hangs over all of this, and that's the memory of 2016 when conventional wisdom turned out to be so wrong. One of the country's most prominent pollsters Nate Silver, who predicted that Hillary Clinton would win by 71 percent right before the elections is now doing a little bit of damage control ahead of these midterms. Writing this week that, \"Polls and forecasts are pretty good instruments. But they are not all that precise. And we should all be prepared for the possibility of another election night like this.\""

      "utterance": "I think the short answer is no. By the way, what fun it is for me to see those clips again from election night. Can't get enough of that. I don't know whether we'll get more of that in a couple of weeks' time. I think the story here is that there's a theory in polling and in communication that goes back to the early 1970s, it's called the spiral of silence. And what it says is that when there's a situation where there's a kind of approved point of view that everyone thinks is the right one. But it conflicts with what people really think. They don't want to say their opinion because they think they're going to be criticized for it. That was so true with Brexit where all the establishment said, you got to be against Brexit. And yet, people didn't feel that way same with Donald Trump. Right up until recently, I felt that, that wasn't the case this time around because everyone is so open about their how they feel about President Trump and so on. But that changed slightly with the Kavanaugh battle where it seemed to me that again, you've got this approved view from the establishment about what you're supposed to think. You're supposed to be someone who believes in Dr. Ford and if you believe Kavanaugh, then, there's something not quite right about you. I think that's changed the dynamic. And I think that once again, you're seeing people feeling something that isn't quite OK to say out loud, that might turn into real votes."

      "utterance": "Well, yes. It's a very interesting the way you point that out.  And you know, when you look at these numbers, Democrats hold the lead by about seven percent. That's the same as about a month ago, Bradd. So, that number has not changed. President Trump's approval number went up to 47 percent. It was at 44 percent in the last poll that we looked at.  So, what's your read on this as you take it all in, Bradd?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TODD",
      "utterance": "Well, the Kavanaugh confirmation has been a pretty big deal for the Republican coalition. You know, we've -- if you read the book, we believe that there's a realignment that's taken place, and the Republican electoral coalition is slightly different than what it had been in previous years. And up into this point of the Trump administration, you've had the old traditional Republican part of the GOP coalition. Not quite know the value long term of Trumpism and you had some voters who like Trump better than they liked Republicans. And they didn't see the value in electing a Republican majority. In the Kavanaugh confirmation, Republicans saw that it took someone as tough as Donald Trump to stand by Kavanaugh and get him through that fire.  And Trumper saw that it took a Republican majority to achieve the president's objectives. That's pretty important going into the election."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Very interesting. Let's take a look at the one that shows what's really important to people, which elements are most important to them. Healthcare, 58 percent. The economy right near that at 48 percent - - I'm sorry, 54 percent. Interesting to note too that you go all the way down to the bottom, you've got the Mueller investigation, 30 percent say that, that is what matters to them. Steve, what's your take on that poll?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HILTON",
      "utterance": "Generally speaking, my view based on a lot of Elections I've worked on is that it's much easier to change the agenda -- the political agenda what is people -- what are people talking about? What's at the front of their mind when they go and vote? Then, it is to change their opinion. So, that's not good news for Republicans if health care really is at the front of people's minds. And so, they need to work really hard to raise the relevance of the issue where they're strong, and that's obviously the economy. But there's one other I'd point to which is immigration. It's actually quite far down the list, but it's one where the base of the Republican Party strongly agrees with what President Trump stands for on that issue.  And as that news agenda changes perhaps with this caravan coming up through Central America, that could raise the relevance of an issue that could be good to get out the Republican base."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Very interesting. And what's interesting about that, we are seeing -- you know, a lot of enthusiasm among women and democratic women saying that they are driven by the candidates who are out there. So, I think that's probably a positive sign for some of these Democratic candidates. But if some of these House races, Bradd, are happening in places where you have a lot of moderates -- you know, outside of the cities, in the suburbs.  And a lot of women who actually do care about things like immigration and border security, and those kinds of issues, and that will be an interesting factor here now."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TODD",
      "utterance": "It is. And the House and Senate are two really different stories.  You know, Donald Trump ran behind Mitt Romney's number in 86 of the 100 largest counties in the country. A lot of House races are in those large counties in metropolitan areas. Donald Trump ran ahead of Mitt Romney in 1,450 of the 1,500 smallest counties. And so, those counties dominate a lot of the Senate states, Missouri, Montana, Indiana, North Dakota. And so, you really are kind of seeing a tale of sort of two different kinds of Americas in this -- in this election. And for Democrats, have pinned their hopes on those dense suburbs, that were a lot of suburban women -- independent women have negative views of the president. Republicans meanwhile, have a great chance in states where there are rural industrial voters. And you know, I think immigration rising is an issue favorite Republicans if it becomes a bigger issue toward the November elections. You know, Independents tend to side with Republicans on immigration and other security type issues. And they side with Democrats on things like healthcare and education."

When she said, well, there it is 1/512, I think is the average, maybe 1/1,000th as you said. There must have been people sitting there saying, \"Well, I guess that's it. We're done.

Consider what Elizabeth Warren has done in the larger context of colleges and universities. Everybody knows about the application form, Martha. You check a box. White, Caucasian, African-American, Pacific Islander, Native American. Well, can you imagine the number of people saying, well, if Elizabeth Warren can check Native American, so can I. And so what happens when you have you know, thousands of people checking the right boxes because everyone knows that some groups are favored rather than others, this is going to create chaos. Next step, just give me a second, then you say well you must prove here what 20 percent, 30 percent.  We're now then into mongrelization. You remember the Nuremberg Laws in Germany.

Isn't it better to just do what Lincoln said which is regard all of us as citizens, all of us who came here legally or who were born here and just start on that equal basis? This could lead to a lot.

The President stressing that all this is coming in a broader context. He did an interview with Fox Business today. He said the U.S. needs Saudi Arabia in the fight against Iran, various terrorists around the world, but that has left him open to critics saying that he's giving Saudi Arabia the benefit of the doubt, letting them off the hook when the details that you just mentioned keep pouring in about the death of Washington Post Columnist Jamal Khashoggi and they're simply horrifying. Reports tonight that he was butchered alive during that gruesome execution inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Audiotapes allegedly revealing Khashoggi was beheaded and then dismembered. One tape has a Saudi official declaring \"do this outside, you're going to get me in trouble.\" Another voice response \"shut up if you want to live when you return to Saudi Arabia.\" Well, the President said today he has asked for any tapes that do exist.  His Secretary of State Mike Pompeo as you mentioned headed home here to Washington after visits with leaders in Turkey and Saudi Arabia both men saying they've been promised a full investigation as they also stress they do not want long-term damage to the Saudi relationship.

One official (INAUDIBLE) even traveling with the Crown Prince during his tour of the U.S. earlier this year. And just breaking a short time ago, the Washington Post revealing that tomorrow they will publish a special opinion page devoted to Khashoggi and his situation, his legacy if you will, including a never before published column that he had finished before what is believed to be his death. They have still not found his body. Interesting, that column allegedly talks about the importance of a free press in the Mideast. Martha?"

And if they can't get around that, what do we do as a nation to preserve our special relationship with Saudi Arabia and the interests that we all have in a stable Saudi Arabia. Because I don't think they know what to do now. A very disturbing addendum to the excellent report that you've just heard from Ed Henry was that Mohammed al Otaiba who was the Saudi counsel who was told to leave the room apparently during this procedure was recalled to Riyadh and he has been fired which might be laying the groundwork for blaming him in this episode which is impossible to believe if you see the number of people connected to the Crown Prince's office, his bodyguards, advisers, his people who were there, it's hard to imagine that a general counsel -- Consul General ordered such a barbaric act. I mean, I think this is a huge problem for Donald Trump at this point and for America and for the Saudis."

None of these things are known now. The Saudis are very quiet and this is a very, very difficult Kingdom to penetrate. So I think this meeting between President Trump and Pompeo will be crucial to the decision the president makes on how to handle this. Look, the Senate is going to do something no matter."

But I hope that nothing is done that people do take step back. This is very difficult for me because I did know Jamal, I have known him for many, many years but there are many, many interests to be balanced here if this is a horrific crime.

The most fundamental obligation of professors is to preserve intellectual honesty and institutional integrity, to convey to students that a college or a university is a place for diversity of ideas. There's no one path, like the one described in this letter. There's multiple paths in a world full of different ideas. And that's what is so disconcerting. You know, this is a school with about 217 full-time and part-time professors. Almost 100 of them signed this letter."

So, they are saying that they recognized how great it was for her to break party ranks but when she didn't, and she, you know, spoke her mind in another direction, that somehow that means that she doesn't uphold the values of the university?"

There's no mention in the letter whatsoever of recognizing the other side of the equation, the non-corroboration. In fact, it says that her story was corroborated in the letter.

We just believe that there's no ground upon which she could reach a different conclusion. now that's the type of imbecilic logic that leads to serious problems on universities."

But to sort of not recognize that the other side of the argument also has validity, and that as a senator she -- you know when she got up there, she talked about the hours that she went through, of the evidence, and how difficult a decision it was for her to reach. So, I just think to not recognize that she spent time and energy looking at everything, is somewhat, you know, an unfair academic criticism."

I'm thinking if there's a rape culture there, it needs to lead to punishment more often than occasionally and you better be calling the local police to get over there and deal with it.

I think it's noteworthy what you saw was the public part of the meeting. When the press left and we had the private part of the meeting, the last two times that we've talked about budgets in the cabinet meeting he's turned to me and asked me to talk about the budgets. Today it was all the president. The president led the entire discussion. Like I didn't even say a word. It was the president's idea. He's leading this.

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So, you know, I think that that was understood that that was kind of an exchange to get what you all wanted in defense spending and you had to kind of swallow some other spending increases that maybe you would rather not have done. But I guess one of the big questions is, you know, Republicans have had control of the House, the Senate, and the White House now since the president came into office. But there's a good potential that they're about to lose the House. So, how, why now? I mean doesn't it feel a little late to the table?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MULVANEY",
      "utterance": "No. First of all, keep in mind one of the reasons we've struggled had to make that deal with the devil that the president mentioned, is that appropriations bills like most bills, not all but most bills, take 60 votes in the Senate. And since the Republicans don't have 60 votes in the Senate that automatically implies Democrats have to participate, it has to be bipartisan. And the one thing that's really bipartisan in Washington, D.C. is spending more money. It's what you essentially buy Democrat votes. So that's why we did what we did. You and I can talk maybe another time about the control of the House. I'm not as convinced as you are that that's getting ready to happen. But regardless, these are the president's priorities. He takes the deficit seriously, he's taking spending seriously, we're doing a great job of growing the economy and getting new revenues into the government. In fact, the revenues are all-time highs but the deficit is still increasing. So we have to look at the spending side of the ledger and that's what you saw today."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So, I guess what's the time frame for that, when would you be able to get this done, and you know, who knows what the outcome is going to be in the House? I think if anybody's guess at this point. There are a lot of tossup states as you look at it. But what's the time frame for cutting spending, you know, it does feel like it's sort of the wire may be running out."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MULVANEY",

We're actually starting, believe it or not, right now on the 2020 budget. So, what we roll out in March or February of next year is actually already started, and started to get into the details right now. So, this is the exact appropriate time to have it. And the normal time to have these types of discussions. So, the president is doing the right thing at the right time."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "All right. Let's talk about the deficit which you mentioned. The treasury says it's $797 billion, that's a 17 percent increase over the previous year, it's the highest deficit that we've seen in six years. And you pointed out there's so many amazing positive strengths that we're seeing in the economy when you look at jobs, when you look at the cuts that have happened in regulation and what that has unleashed in the U.S. economy, I think by anyone's measure that's an extraordinary story. But the deficit is a tough picture."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MULVANEY",
      "utterance": "Sure. the deficit actually is not that tough, it's easy in the sense and that it only has two pieces. Money in and money out. And money is now coming in because of the economic policies that the president has put into place. Money is coming in at a record rate. It's just going out even faster in large part because of the Senate Democrats that I just mentioned. So, it's actually a fairly simple mathematical calculation. We just need to figure out a way to do better on spending. and the president gets that. We will grow the government. We have proven that, we're going to continue to grow the government, we continue to think that this expansion is still on strong fundamentals. But if we're going to see meaningful changes to the deficit we have to focus on the money out, the spending at the same time."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yes. Many would say that you also have to focus on entitlements. Mitch McConnell has spoken about this recently. I mean, you really can't make a significant dent in the spending in this country without touching that so-called third rail. Are you prepared to do that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MULVANEY",
      "utterance": "A couple of different things, because that's actually not true. The social security only accounts for about 85 billion of deficit this year. Medicare, I think is about $300 billion of deficit. So, everything else is everything else. So, when you say entitlements and Mitch McConnell talks about entitlements, social security and Medicare are a challenge to the deficit several years out. Right now, they're actually not what's driving the deficit this year. We had things like hurricane spending, and a bunch of different things, we had a CAPs deal that increased spending last year. So, it's actually the discretionary spending that's having a big impact right now. Keep in mind that the president's budget that we introduced last year, was the largest mandatory of spending reduction proposal in history. But it did not touch social just or Medicare. There is a lot of other entitlement programs that we could fix, that we can reform, without touching core social security and core Medicare. We've already offered that, and we would welcome that discussion. But again, everything on this topic needs 60 votes in the Senate, and that's where we hit a roadblock."

I love it so much and Steve is here, as co- host of Fox and Friends, good friend of mine."

As it turns out it struck a chord because it seems like we have learned that foods are able to -- whether you smell them or you see them or you think about them are able to activate something in the nostalgia department of your brain and they remind of happy times."

      "speaker": "DOOCY",

    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "And there was a bottle of bourbon that had like this much left and there were fingerprints all over it. It's not a good look."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DOOCY",
      "utterance": "It stood open. She loves her Bullet."
    },

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Now you know what, but there's only a little bit, a little bit of Bullet in the bourbon pumpkin cheesecake but it was delicious and the book is just great. It's like all those comfort foods that you grew up with and you have all these different people's favorite recipes in there and thank you so much for including my mom's all-day beef stew and the pumpkin bourbon cheesecake, which is delicious. And I like how comfortable I look in the kitchen in this video. I mean, Martha Stewart--"
