And that whole movement that started as speaking, you know, with men who are in power and using that power over women. It was this movement that had nothing to do with politics. It got politicized during Kavanaugh, and the problem is that we never finished having the national conversation about how do you hear women and believe their stories, but at the same time give the guys the due process they deserve or, you know, turn around it could be either gender. And I think that's a big tragedy of all of this is you either zero-tolerance or you're not. And what is the fair process for giving someone, you know, the benefit of the doubt, of giving them due process? I would say the other reason why this has been just a catastrophe, the way it's been handled in Virginia is because of the top three and there's an election in November. And Republicans hold at least one or two seats in both the House and the Senate majority. It's going to be a contentious election.

What's happened both on the Democrat side and the Republican side is there's always been one woman on stage. And there have been all of these rules about -- and the senatorial race and presidential races is about how do you approach the one woman on the stage. And now that we have four or five on the stage, it will be interesting to see how the Democrats play that out. How they argue with each other.

Minnesota Congressman Ilhan Omar under fire, including from top leaders of her own party over a new round of controversial tweets, Omar accused a prominent group, the American-Israel public affairs committee, of paying members of Congress to support Israel. The freshman lawmaker released a statement saying that she, quote, unequivocally apologizes, but then went on to call a (INAUDIBLE) lobby, quote, \"problematic.\" We have seen a lot happened today, Kennedy. Last night, Chelsea Clinton was the only prominent Democrat to come out today -- today we did see Pelosi issue a statement. Other Democrats issued statement condemning these remarks. And of course, she apologized. My question is she sits on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, is this enough? Should she be on that committee or does the apology and the condemnation is that just put a pretty little bow on it?"

I don't think it's OK in this situation. I don't appreciate people not understanding the racist roots of the thing that they mock and not fully grasping it. So, I don't appreciate her being an anti-Semite. And I think antisemitism is a huge problem right. It's something that is really being, sort of, swept under the carpet by the left and, you know, there are people within the movement who have said pretty atrocious things and, you know, dehumanized Jewish people as a whole. And I think when we start to get into that territory because -- if you take something that a Republican or another person you disagree with out of context and say this is racist, then you have to apply the same metric.

He went through how Booker, Warren, Harris, all tried to block anti-BDS legislation in the Senate, and I thought it was a pretty convincing case. And I know that we've talked about this quite a bit on THE FIVE where you see anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism that has taken root in somewhat mainstream policies on the left.

That's kind of a bigger issue than the Benjamins thing. The bottom line is there's a lot of countries in the Middle East and one isn't Muslim and that's the one she doesn't like. So we have to ask ourselves, is this a form of bigotry? I think she apologizes, so that's a step. But you know who tweeted support for her? David Duke.

And I applaud Gayle King for trying to get to the truth of his motivation. I think Northam looks at Brett Kavanaugh, and even the president, who are much more unapologetic than politicians were -- you know, maybe three years ago, and certainly some in the current climate like Al Franken who must be looking at all this and saying I wish I had just stuck around because if you're the last man standing you get to keep your job. I think he's also looking at Justin Fairfax. And, you know, when you weigh these two cases, the charges against Fairfax are incredibly serious and damning.

It got politicized during Kavanaugh, and the problem is that we never finished having the national conversation about how do you hear women and believe their stories, but at the same time give the guys the due process they deserve or, you know, turn around it could be either gender. And I think that's a big tragedy of all of this is you either zero-tolerance or you're not. And what is the fair process for giving someone, you know, the benefit of the doubt, of giving them due process? I would say the other reason why this has been just a catastrophe, the way it's been handled in Virginia is because of the top three and there's an election in November. And Republicans hold at least one or two seats in both the House and the Senate majority. It's going to be a contentious election.

And that's why it doesn't matter if you're a Republican or if you're a Democrat, or whatever your political philosophy is. There is racism, sexism in America and around the world.

He thinks the Saudi Arabians may have been involved. He thinks according to some of the reporting that the National Security Agency under the Trump may have been involved in securing those.

I don't necessarily like all the things that the President says and tweets, but I don't have a problem with this because just because there are unnamed blocks of time and just because he doesn't follow the exact same protocol as every other President, I don't think that's necessarily harmful, because he's still doing something. So, I'm going to give him the benefit of the doubt there. I think the proof is in the pudding when he reacts to other people in the media when it's sort of needless.
