We expect him to take the stage in a few minutes. It is a crucial Rustbelt state, of course, in Pennsylvania.  One of the ones that sealed the deal for him in 2016. Economy is very strong in Pennsylvania. But keep in mind, it is just 65 miles west of Scranton, the hometown of Joe Biden, who in the latest Quinnipiac poll of the state, leads the president by 11 points there. Good evening, everybody. I'm Martha MacCallum, and this is \"The Story.\"  In moments, Karl Rove, Geraldo Rivera and Donna Brazile, on the state of the 2020 race tonight. But first, breaking tonight, tensions with Iran are escalating with the country's foreign minister slamming President Trump and his quote -- for his quote, \"genocidal thoughts after he tweeted this yesterday.  The president saying, \"If Iran wants to fight, that will be the official end of Iran. Never threatened the United States again.\" Strong words from our president. And a short time ago, on his way to tonight's rally, president said this.",

We took all the exemptions off the table.  So, we're really tightening the screws. What I think and what the intelligence community believes, this is a reaction to those two decisions.

Nearly 14 million votes are cast in those three states, and the president wins all three of them by a combined total of 77,744 votes. That's one half of one percent separated he and Hillary Clinton in these states.  If he had not won these states, he would not be president. Michigan, a quarter of a percent 10,000 votes out of 4.8 million casts. Pennsylvania, 44,000 votes out of 6.2 million casts. Just over -- just about three quarters in one percent. Wisconsin, 22,000 votes out of 3 million votes cast. So, these are three critical states. And Pennsylvania is probably the most critical and most difficult of the three because, as you said, Joe Biden was born in Scranton, and grew up there. And he's represented Delaware in the United States Senate for nearly 30 some odd years. And that's like -- you know an adjunct to Pennsylvania and to Philadelphia Media Market covers the entire state.

We expect him to take the stage in a few minutes. It is a crucial Rustbelt state, of course, in Pennsylvania.  One of the ones that sealed the deal for him in 2016. Economy is very strong in Pennsylvania. But keep in mind, it is just 65 miles west of Scranton, the hometown of Joe Biden, who in the latest Quinnipiac poll of the state, leads the president by 11 points there. Good evening, everybody. I'm Martha MacCallum, and this is \"The Story.\" In moments, Karl Rove, Geraldo Rivera and Donna Brazile, on the state of the 2020 race tonight. But first, breaking tonight, tensions with Iran are escalating with the country's foreign minister slamming President Trump and his quote -- for his quote, \"genocidal thoughts after he tweeted this yesterday. The president saying, \"If Iran wants to fight, that will be the official end of Iran. Never threatened the United States again.\" Strong words from our president.

That's the muscle for the Ayatollah. On May 2nd, we told every country you can no longer buy oil from Iran and avoid sanctions. We took all the exemptions off the table.  So, we're really tightening the screws. What I think and what the intelligence community believes, this is a reaction to those two decisions. And the intelligence is very strong that Iran is behind attacking ships and pipelines. The threat stream against our personnel in Iraq was picked up also by the British. So, we'll be briefed tomorrow in the Senate. And I'm convinced that the threat to American personnel in Iraq is real."

They're going to brief us tomorrow. But you have to be kind of blind, these are the same people Bernie and other and Murphy, who thought it was a good idea to give that I told $150 billion in sanctions relief. And they can't believe he didn't build roads and bridges. These are the people that sold us the Iran Deal. These are the people that told us there is no crisis at the border. So, I've been briefed, but the whole Senate is going to get briefed tomorrow. And these attacks against our allies, shipping, and pipelines are directed by Iran in my view, and the threat streams against American personnel are real, they just shot a rocket into the green zone. So, Trump's doing the right thing, President Trump is by telling the Iranians, you go down this road at your own peril.

      "utterance": "Yes, absolutely. And the president's right to be there. Remember, these are the three closest states of the 2016 race that Donald Trump carried. Think about this. Nearly 14 million votes are cast in those three states, and the president wins all three of them by a combined total of 77,744 votes. That's one half of one percent separated he and Hillary Clinton in these states. If he had not won these states, he would not be president. Michigan, a quarter of a percent 10,000 votes out of 4.8 million casts. Pennsylvania, 44,000 votes out of 6.2 million casts. Just over -- just about three quarters in one percent. Wisconsin, 22,000 votes out of 3 million votes cast. So, these are three critical states. And Pennsylvania is probably the most critical and most difficult of the three because, as you said, Joe Biden was born in Scranton, and grew up there. And he's represented Delaware in the United States Senate for nearly 30 some odd years. And that's like -- you know an adjunct to Pennsylvania and to Philadelphia Media Market covers the entire state. So, people in the southeastern part of the state sort of think of him as the third Senator from Delaware."

He's a fairly successful mayor of South Bend. I say fairly because he's done a poor job of reaching out to the African-Americans in his own community. And that's why I think he's -- he is registering zero among African-American -- the voters who play such a crucial role in the Democratic primary. But in all ways, in terms of the language he uses, the hipness, you know, his vision of a modern digital world. I think that he is a very, very -- you know, compelling candidate. I think he's an extreme long shot. But aside from Joe Biden, I think is the most interesting Democrat in the field."

We know in 2016 that the Clinton campaign took those states for granted. They didn't really compete in the last couple of weeks, Trump was there campaigning, just about every day and every other day. But when you win those states by less than 78,000 votes, you got to go back there, you got to lock it down. Because I do believe Democrats know the -- know the recipe for victory in 2020."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

So, you have to wonder those voters who may be looking at Joe Biden right now, and perhaps, saying things along the lines of you know, he wants to take things back to normal, he wants us to unify, and all those messages which I think have been working well for him in the early going. But they're going to look at the economy and say, a lot of these folks are talking about raising corporate taxes. You know, a lot of this kind of stuff would cool off the kind of growth that we have seen companies feel liberated to do right now."

      "speaker": "ROVE",

Back then, the Republicans won by winning the suburban counties around Southeast Pennsylvania around Philadelphia. And the Democrats would win the state by running up the margins in the West. Today, the coal mining and steel making region of the west is very pro- Trump, and it's the formerly Republican suburbs in Bucks, Montgomery, Delaware, and Chester counties in Southeast Pennsylvania. It's where the Democrats hope to rebuild their margin and take the state back. And it's a -- it's an interesting change. The -- basically, people who either went to high school and didn't go to college or had some college are more predominant in the West. College-educated particularly those with advanced degrees tend to be more in the southeast. And one group is going away from its traditional heritage and going towards Republicans and Trump. The other ones going away from its traditional heritage and going towards the Democrats."

That there was going to be no enticement to those kind of energy companies, nonrenewable, energy companies in America anymore. And now you see the regulations lifted in some of these areas that have allowed those companies to start to expand. That's helped a little bit of the energy jobs in Pennsylvania, Geraldo, manufacturing as I said, coming back. So, you know, that's the equation that President Trump was about to get off the plane is certainly hoping people won't forget about when it comes time to vote."

John Bolton, Benjamin Netanyahu, and Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, it's being driven to conflict and unnecessary conflict. And I'm not sure how that plays. I hope the president, if indeed he is in the thrall of John Bolton, the neoconservative hawk in his -- in his inner circle, I just hope that we don't do something or get pushed into something accidental where we get back into another shotgun oil kind of scenario with massive destruction in the Middle East. The Iranians under attack, lashing out at us. You know, they say they've survived Genghis Khan, they've survived Alexander the Great, they'll survive America. I just think that they -- what the last thing the president's campaign needs right now is a -- is a shooting war, you know, in the -- in the Middle East. I know that he resists.

And clearly, Donna is right. I mean, the women in the suburban areas around Philadelphia which you know, we should also point out is where Joe Biden has placed his headquarters of his campaigns in Philadelphia, the women in those areas I think have -- were turned off by the tweeting. They're turned off by a lot of what they have seen, and some of them may be open to someone like Joe Biden whose biggest I think most successful campaign slogan to date is that he wants to you know, sort of take the country back to normal. But people have to think about what that means exactly and I think that we go through this process you're going to get a better sense of you know, policy and what normal actually looks like because I think some people might --"

This is a -- part of it as tends to be the further north, you get the more Republican it gets. But Scranton and Wilkes-Barre and other Democratic strongholds are in this area. And the energy revolution there is going to make people think twice about voting Democrat because Democrats have taken particularly in this region.  They don't want Pennsylvania gas to be sent to New York to fuel people's heaters and air conditioner. So there's another part of the state that's going to be -- there's another part of the state that it's going to be moving around. It's going to be fun to watch how it moves."

That's why it's such a fun state to watch throughout the course of this.  President Trump is there on a beautiful evening in Montoursville, Pennsylvania. Thank you so much to all three of you. Let's listen to the president. Watch some of this."

And no doubt some of the recent poll numbers have made that motivation that much clearer, Charlie."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HURT",
      "utterance": "Yes, indeed. And you know, this is where the president is in his element and he loves it and I think that's probably a very, very good sign. Usually when politicians are enjoying campaigning as much as President Trump enjoys campaigning. It's easier to get onto a winning train like that and I think it's on full display tonight."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

You have Justin Amash, a Republican who was also saying that he wants to see that very big dichotomy here between the two sides of what we see going on here tonight and back on Capitol Hill."

    {
      "speaker": "HURT",
      "utterance": "But I think that this is another one of those cases where I think the president, that President Trump has better political instincts than any other politician around here, certainly any of the politicians I've ever covered. And I think there is a reason why he likes to bring up the Russia investigation. He calls it a hoax. the reason I think he likes bringing up is as long as Democrats are talking about that and we have gotten to the bottom of it we realized that there was no collusion, we've learned that there was no effort by the Trump campaign and Vladimir Putin to rig the election. There is no evidence of that. And then and as long as Democrats are talking about that and President Trump encourages them to keep talking about that."

It makes them look all the more serious. These Democrats they look like a small kid in a bar fight, you know, like, hold me back, hold me back. They don't want to do impeachment because they know they are going to lose impeachment. And so, they're just coming up with all of these reasons to say, OK, we are going to do impeachment next week. At some point they start to look kind of ridiculous."

    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yes. And now Robert Mueller, you know, maybe sometime in June will testify. And I think you make a great point. Because when you get out in the country and even when you talk to candidates who are running for the Democratic nomination and you ask them, you know, are people talking about this issue? do people care about this issue? Not really. You know, the thing they do care about, though, Charlie, one of the things they care about is the China trade issue and remarkably, you know, I heard a couple of really interesting interviews earlier this week with some manufacturing folks out in the Midwest saying, that it was worrying them. That they were concerned about their bottom line and their business with the tariff situation. However, they said they would still vote for President Trump because they feel that he has done other things right and if they have to give time on it, they think it's going to work out. But China, you know, can go either way for this president. Do you agree?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HURT",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. It is the most amazing thing when you talk to people in the Midwest manufacturers or you talk to farmers across the south or even out west. They are all hurting badly. Badly. And these are all people who supported President Trump."

But the reason I think is because they believed that President Trump is the first person who has sort of stepped forward and is willing to take on this problem."

But you know, the president talking about -- did you -- he was going back and forth. Make America great or keep America great? It sounded like the keep America great crowd won. He's sort of, you know, off-the-cuff polling that he was doing there."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HURT",
      "utterance": "Yes. And it's a great poll. It's the people that love him the best. And it's highly entertaining. And you know, his impeccable sense of timing. The way, you know, what politician, you've never seen a politician who stops, pauses in the middle of a rally for somebody who faints. This is something that happens at rallies with some frequency especially when the weather warms up like his. But everything he just has a way of keeping the audience glued to him and it's a real talent in politics."

It is -- it's a very -- he definitely has a talent for doing this kind of thing. All right. I think we are back. I think we're back in speech time. So, let's watch, Charlie. Listen more. We'll be right back."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Charlie Hurt is still standing by. The president is talking about Joe Biden there, Charlie. Obviously, he seems to be his biggest competition at this point and he is speaking to the home crowd here, not too far from Scranton, talking about the trade deals, talking about the economy. And as we said earlier, Joe Biden's sort of main selling point right now is he's going to bring us back to normal and unify the country. Your thoughts."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HURT",
      "utterance": "And he's going to make Joe Biden where those comments from foreign leaders who said that they want Joe Biden back. He's going to make him wear those comments through this entire -- for as long as Joe Biden is in the race. And it's a very smart strategy because it allows him to pivot to the fact that President Trump is an America first candidate and he is unabashedly so. And it's a --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "But, Charlie, what do you say to \"The Story\" from -- just excuse me for a second -- from Politico about the 17 states' internal polling from the Trump campaign according to this Politico report, it shows that Joe Biden is ahead in Pennsylvania, ahead in Michigan and ahead in Wisconsin."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HURT",
      "utterance": "I think that it's early and I think that those polls are sort of meaningless at this point. I think over the long run people -- you know, I've been -- Joe Biden has run for president what, at least three times --"

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Twice, I believe."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HURT",
      "utterance": "-- literally and many other times beyond that. I think that ultimately his gaffes and his fake folksiness winds up wearing off on people and it only reminds people where we have a guy like Donald Trump, when he says stuff, he doesn't really take gaffes. He says things that you're not supposed -- politicians aren't supposed to say but that juxtaposition I think makes Joe Biden look a whole lot faker."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "But when you look at Pete Buttigieg the town hall over the weekend and a lot of discussion today about how appealing he is as a politician, that he comes across well. He is good on his feet, all of those kinds of things. And you know, clearly, he's in third place I think in some of these polls right now. He's certainly someone to watch in this. But in terms of his ideas, he made reference to four different places where he would raise taxes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HURT",
      "utterance": "Yes. He's very polished, he's a very good politician. But again, I think that juxtaposition sort of helps Trump in a lot of ways and it certainly did in 2016. But again, Martha, and I think this is the most important thing and you just mentioned it, 2016 was more about issues that any presidential election of the past couple of decades. And I think that 2020 followed suit and it's about issues, the way it was in 2016, I think Trump wins that in a walk. Because you're right. This, you know, Buttigieg and all of these other Democrats running, their policy proposals are, they're just -- you are unelectable. They're terrible. People don't want them. They're raising taxes. You've got Democrats actually in office, Democrats talking about abortion up to birth. It's crazy, crazy stuff."
