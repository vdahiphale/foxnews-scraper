It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is \"The Five.\" Hurricane Dorian gets political as Democrats use the storm to push their agenda. More on that coming up. But first, let's track Dorian's path as it churns up the east coast. Chief meteorologist Rick Reichmuth is in the Fox weather center with the latest. Rick?",

      "sentences": "Jesse, as to new advisory just came out from the National Hurricane Center, it's increased its strength a little bit, up to a 110-mile-an-hours sustained winds. It's right below cat 3, so it's cat 2 storm. And on all satellite representation on the radar it looks really well organized. It's not weakening at all. We're not becoming kind of a more disorganize structure. You see this rotation? That's the center of the storm. We've got rain, it's already moving in across parts of North Carolina from the storm.  And it looks like it's kind of moving over the gulf stream here which is some warmer water. That's probably allowed it to get a little bit better organized. You can see that on the satellite picture here. Fortunately, it's just off the coast of Georgia and Florida, but it is going to be moving much closer. In fact, take a look at our tropical models. They're all in really good agreement here that it pulls off towards the northeast, eventually. And everybody, in agreement here, that we've got this running right along the coast, probably just to the northeast of the Charleston area, and then all the way through North Carolina.  So we're probably going to have land interaction either from the center of the storm being right on shore or right off shore right in that space for about, say, maybe 24 hours. Here's a look at what happens overnight tonight. By the morning tomorrow, we've got a storm right off of Charleston, probably hurricane force winds. We'll see some pretty significant storm surge, maybe up to about 7 feet. And we'll start to see the rain spread even to the inland areas just a little bit causing some pretty significant localized flooding. Then the center of the storm tracks the entire area of North Carolina, and I think that's a pretty good bet, because our models are in such good agreement. Also I want to notice, pretty significant rain going to part of Virginia into Maryland and Delaware as well. So, we're not done yet. We will be by Friday afternoon. But we still got to get through this category 2, right on our shores. Guys?",

Something to be very concerned about is going to be high tide again at 1:30 in the morning. Normally, high tide is at eight and a half feet. The roadways that connect the mainland with the Barrier Islands it's only at 10 feet. So, if you're putting four to seven foot storm surge on top of that you're definitely talking about roads that are going to be flooded, and all of the people would likely to ride out this storm on the Barrier Islands they're going to be disconnected and on and on their own. The local emergency forces have been given a directive that if the wind reaches beyond 40- miles-per-hour, they're locked down. You can't go out there and put the first responders at risk.

What's interesting is if you look at the cost breakdown of what a lot of these 2020 hopefuls have put forth, I mean, Bernie Sanders is talking about over $16 trillion over 15 years. They're all in the trillions, 3 trillion, 1.7 trillion, and the way they're going to do that is they're going to repeal the Trump tax cut on who they deem the rich, I would love to see who that is, and also corporations, which would have an impact on workers.  And they just don't realize the stuff -- Dana's right. This stuff takes time. You know, this is not something you can do overnight. You have to retrain all of those workers that work in the fossil fuel industry so that they'll have jobs. You can't have a ton of people losing jobs. A ton of people's energy cost skyrocketing which will impact poor people the most, and a whole economy falling apart to implicate -- to put climate change policy forth.

They're just not going to do it. And then what happens when people don't do it? Is the government going to then take them by force? What's the next step of that? Because that's not what this country is built on. If you look at the way the country is founded part of that was that they wanted people to be entitled to protect their freedoms and defend themselves and their homes.  And wait until people in rural areas hear this, where when you pick up the phone and you go to call the police, it takes them a really long time to get there. These people rely on themselves to protect themselves and their families. So I think that those are two separate conversations.

I think that's a conservative point of view. So I think that they can do whatever they want, actually. That might mean that they'll lose customers, but I have a feeling that they've already factored that into their decision.  The other thing about San Francisco is that it is not a place for a county supervisor to decide that an organization is a national domestic terrorist organization. To me, this was just attention-getting and she got a lot of it. But, really, should get a lot of attention is that a lot of people -- like my friends that live on the outskirts, they don't even want to go into the city anymore, because it breaks their heart because it was a city that they loved, and now it's a place where there's so much crime.

It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is \"The Five.\" Hurricane Dorian gets political as Democrats use the storm to push their agenda. More on that coming up. But first, let's track Dorian's path as it churns up the east coast. Chief meteorologist Rick Reichmuth is in the Fox weather center with the latest. Rick?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RICK REICHMUTH, FOX NEWS CHIEF METEOROLOGIST",
      "utterance": "Jesse, as to new advisory just came out from the National Hurricane Center, it's increased its strength a little bit, up to a 110-mile-an-hours sustained winds. It's right below cat 3, so it's cat 2 storm. And on all satellite representation on the radar it looks really well organized. It's not weakening at all. We're not becoming kind of a more disorganize structure. You see this rotation? That's the center of the storm. We've got rain, it's already moving in across parts of North Carolina from the storm. And it looks like it's kind of moving over the gulf stream here which is some warmer water. That's probably allowed it to get a little bit better organized. You can see that on the satellite picture here. Fortunately, it's just off the coast of Georgia and Florida, but it is going to be moving much closer. In fact, take a look at our tropical models. They're all in really good agreement here that it pulls off towards the northeast, eventually. And everybody, in agreement here, that we've got this running right along the coast, probably just to the northeast of the Charleston area, and then all the way through North Carolina. So we're probably going to have land interaction either from the center of the storm being right on shore or right off shore right in that space for about, say, maybe 24 hours. Here's a look at what happens overnight tonight. By the morning tomorrow, we've got a storm right off of Charleston, probably hurricane force winds. We'll see some pretty significant storm surge, maybe up to about 7 feet. And we'll start to see the rain spread even to the inland areas just a little bit causing some pretty significant localized flooding. Then the center of the storm tracks the entire area of North Carolina, and I think that's a pretty good bet, because our models are in such good agreement. Also I want to notice, pretty significant rain going to part of Virginia into Maryland and Delaware as well. So, we're not done yet. We will be by Friday afternoon. But we still got to get through this category 2, right on our shores. Guys?"

It's difficult, according to Georgia's governor, to predict what the impact will be because we haven't seen a creeper of a hurricane like this before. For 24 to 30 hours it's going to raise the tides. It's going to bring the rain down, increase the rain -- or increase the wind, I should say. And in the morning, he says we'll start to get an idea of what the impact is."

    {
      "speaker": "TOBIN",
      "utterance": "What is really unique about this is the high tide was about 1:30, so here we are three and a half hours later. If you look out of the Savannah River, it's hard to tell that this water has hardly gone down at all in the three and a half hours since that time. Something to be very concerned about is going to be high tide again at 1:30 in the morning. Normally, high tide is at eight and a half feet. The roadways that connect the mainland with the Barrier Islands it's only at 10 feet. So, if you're putting four to seven foot storm surge on top of that you're definitely talking about roads that are going to be flooded, and all of the people would likely to ride out this storm on the Barrier Islands they're going to be disconnected and on and on their own. The local emergency forces have been given a directive that if the wind reaches beyond 40- miles-per-hour, they're locked down. You can't go out there and put the first responders at risk. That means, anyone who gets in trouble, they're on their own. Jesse?"

I can already hear the climate deniers screeching. It's always been this like this. You're dim, etcetera. No. This is about science and leadership. We either decarbonize and cut emissions, or we don't, and we let people die. All right, I've noticed something about AOC's twitter game. I don't think it's very good anymore and I think I know why."

Like, in the green new deal it says that we will replace fossil fuels with solar and renewable in ten years. That is not realistic and I actually think it hurt their cause. Also, I don't need to get into it a million times about weather and climate not being the exact same thing. Now, you could say, well, there was a hurricane -- a stronger hurricane, but they hurt a devastated areas first. That's not necessarily true either. But, you know, it could hurt other areas, fancy areas, but communities that do get hit with any sort of storm, no matter what the cause is, mother nature, do we have an obligation to try to help them get back?

I just don't think -- tell you what concerned me, is the idea that the President of the United States, someone we're supposed to trust to give us accurate information when lives is at stake, is using his sharpie to extend the reach of this storm to Alabama, so that he's not wrong in what he was saying a week ago.

You've said, Juan, that, you know, people don't really -- you don't really think people pay attention to AOC. I think they do pay attention to AOC in large part, especially young people, and I think that's a big problem because a lot of the stuff that she's putting forward makes absolutely no sense. It's not realistic. It's not possible. It's not going to happen. And that's a problem. What's interesting is if you look at the cost breakdown of what a lot of these 2020 hopefuls have put forth, I mean, Bernie Sanders is talking about over $16 trillion over 15 years. They're all in the trillions, 3 trillion, 1.7 trillion, and the way they're going to do that is they're going to repeal the Trump tax cut on who they deem the rich, I would love to see who that is, and also corporations, which would have an impact on workers. And they just don't realize the stuff -- Dana's right. This stuff takes time. You know, this is not something you can do overnight. You have to retrain all of those workers that work in the fossil fuel industry so that they'll have jobs. You can't have a ton of people losing jobs. A ton of people's energy cost skyrocketing which will impact poor people the most, and a whole economy falling apart to implicate -- to put climate change policy forth. You have to be able to look at this step-by-step. And I know it's a great campaign talking point to come out and say, oh, because, you know, this is an important issue among Democrats in the polls. Let me come out and just create plans that really couldn't be effectuated, but they sound really good. But when you really break them down -- if these are their solutions, it's just not going to work. Joe Biden is taking heat for being too moderate on his solutions. Like, oh, he's too gradual.

In fact, NRA members have stopped mass shootings. And the statistics here from the FBI, rifles only account for 403 murders out of the 15,000 murders per year. And not all of them are even AR-15's.

But when you take that step and you go from there to a gun buyback program, which, you know, someone like Beto is saying should be mandatory, other 2020 Democrats are saying should be voluntary, that is a completely different direction. That is something a lot of people aren't going to get behind. I don't see people around the country willingly saying, oh, yeah, I'm going to sell you back my self-defense weapon, which is what the AR-15 that they're talking about all the time, is to a lot of people. They're just not going to do it. And then what happens when people don't do it? Is the government going to then take them by force? What's the next step of that? Because that's not what this country is built on. If you look at the way the country is founded part of that was that they wanted people to be entitled to protect their freedoms and defend themselves and their homes. And wait until people in rural areas hear this, where when you pick up the phone and you go to call the police, it takes them a really long time to get there. These people rely on themselves to protect themselves and their families. So I think that those are two separate conversations. There are some reforms that I think are palatable to many, but that's not where 2020 Democrats are headed."

But I also think that because people are so frustrated with Washington, nothing gets done in Washington, that these private companies are making decisions, and I feel like private companies can make decisions that they want to make. I think that's a conservative point of view. So I think that they can do whatever they want, actually. That might mean that they'll lose customers, but I have a feeling that they've already factored that into their decision. The other thing about San Francisco is that it is not a place for a county supervisor to decide that an organization is a national domestic terrorist organization. To me, this was just attention-getting and she got a lot of it. But, really, should get a lot of attention is that a lot of people -- like my friends that live on the outskirts, they don't even want to go into the city anymore, because it breaks their heart because it was a city that they loved, and now it's a place where there's so much crime.

She didn't want to spend a lot of money into bridesmaid's dress and she wanted - this is the best part, she wanted something that she thought she'd get more use out of. And apparently for her that is a T-Rex costume, I'm not sure, but I just realize this is the second time I've done a T-Rex story on this show, which is fascinating in itself.
