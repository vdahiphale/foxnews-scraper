We are on top of two storms that are gripping the world right now, certainly our part of the world on the right with all the flooding and damage and winds and still more flooding and damage and winds to come from Hurricane Ida, now Tropical Storm Ida. Also following what's going on in Afghanistan right now, with less than 24 hours to go before, well, we go and are gone. Where does that all stand right now? Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto and this is YOUR WORLD on a day of dramatic developments both on the Mother Nature storm and the storm brewing in Afghanistan, as we get ready to call it a day in less than a day after better than 20 years in that country. Let's get the latest from Lucas Tomlinson right at the Pentagon with how Afghanistan and these final hours might look -- sir.",

So we know that the last plane will leave Afghanistan sometime in the next few hours. We're just waiting for that word here at the Pentagon. It could be even more than that. But all eyes are on that last flight. Neil, this comes as U.S. forces have actually come under attack in recent days, five rockets fired at U.S. forces. We heard from Jennifer Griffin's questioning earlier to John Kirby that one of those rockets came through. The C-RAM, that counter-rocket artillery and mortar system, did not shoot- down all the rockets. One did make it through, but it did not cause any damage to any personnel or aircraft. And, of course, on Sunday, a second U.S. Reaper drone flying from Al Dhafra Air Force Base in the UAE launched another mission to destroy a suicide bomber, two of them that were in a vehicle, a van heading for the gate. It was destroyed just two miles from the front gate of the Kabul Airport, where U.S. forces remain. And, of course, Friday night, that first drone strike, the first time the Biden administration had ordered a strike following that deadly suicide attack that killed 13 American service members, that drone on Friday night killing two ISIS planners. It was notable today, Neil, that the Pentagon is still refusing to name those two ISIS fighters who were killed Friday night. They call them just planners. They did not call them leaders. Normally, the word planners here is reserved for lower-level fighters, Neil.",

You might be noticing a pattern that each day that gets to be a progressively smaller figure. We're told anywhere from 1, 300 to 1, 800 were on the tarmac supposedly waiting to depart as well. So those figures, we won't have until tomorrow. And, of course, tomorrow, at this time, it will all be over unless something is miraculously extended.

Still, though, an estimated 80,000 Afghans with Special Immigrant Visas remain in country unable to flee. They join a small handful of Americans, officials estimate less than 250, that were not able to be evacuated. Now, a senior State Department official does believe they have contact with the necessary Americans who want to leave, but were not able to make it to the airport. There were some disturbing reports, though, over the weekend of Afghan American University students being turned away from the airport. The New York Times said a group of students gathered yesterday in a safe house and then took buses to the Kabul Airport. After waiting for seven hours, they were informed they would not be able to fly out. One student received an e-mail from the university, saying -- quote -- \"I regret to inform you that the high command at HKIA and the airport has announced there will be no more rescue flights.\" We have seen an uptick in recent days of people leaving on foot. Neighboring Iran and Pakistan have taken thousands of Afghan refugees, and we continue to hear stories of desperate Afghans fleeing other ways. FOX has learned of a story tonight of a former translator in the U.S. Army taking a bus to Tajikistan. That individual described it as the most difficult ride of his life through Taliban checkpoints. Now, Neil, in the coming hours, we likely will get confirmation from the U.S. government that the war is over in Afghanistan. Today, it is August 31 in Kabul, and it means that, according to the U.S. estimates, they will be wrapping up, heading home and this will all be said and done -- Neil.",

The White House is now saying that 6,000 Americans have been evacuated from Afghanistan. I assume that is since the Taliban took over Afghanistan. So, doing the rough math in my head, of the 115,000, who have been airlifted out of Kabul, 6,000 were Americans and the rest presumably Afghan nationals or friends of the United States. I'm sure they will update us on those figures. I apologize for the confusion. Let's go to Lieutenant General Keith Kellogg, the former national security adviser to Vice President Pence. General, very good to have you on a busy news day. It looks like, when all is said and done, of the 115,000-plus evacuated, 6,000 were Americans and the rest all of these Afghan and Afghan nationals. What do you think of those numbers?",

But it makes sense to me, in the sense that Baradar, the political adviser of the Taliban, probably knew he couldn't control Kabul. And he probably turned to the Americans or -- the way the report goes from The Washington Post. And I don't know the veracity of it. But let's make an assumption that is true. And turn it over to us and said, OK, can you control Kabul? And they probably went to the president of the United States as commander in chief, and he said, no, I don't want to do it, because it would have involved putting more troops on the ground to expand the perimeter. But if your goal is to get every American out of there, and all of your allies out of there, then why not change the date that you made, and nobody else made it, and say, we're going to get our people out? It seems to be we could have negotiated that and worked that. Instead, what they said was, nope, 31 August is a hard date. We're going to get out. And if we leave people behind, we leave people behind. But, I mean, this could be a truly unforced error, where we had the opportunity to expand the perimeter, put more troops in there until we got the people out that we wanted to get out, and then collapse the perimeter and go out. I mean, it's almost like -- I hope we unpack this story more and more, because it really doesn't make sense to me. I don't know if it does to you.

But even in my naive look at the region, if we had gotten that ability to secure Kabul, that would have meant that there would be no Taliban perimeter around the airport or anything that we ultimately saw that was compromised, obviously, by these ISIS-K bombings. So, it's easy to Monday morning quarterback this, if indeed it was that way. But it's just part of a series of fateful decisions that brought us to where we are now. It doesn't look, as you know, General, that we're going to extend the deadline beyond tomorrow, roughly at this time, about 23 hours and 40 minutes from now. What do you think of that?",

And General Donahue, who's the commander of the 82nd, is the guy in charge of it. And he knows how to do that. You leave detachments left and contact. You slowly reduce the size of the airhead, and then you get out. And probably in the middle of the night, you get -- you're out of there, and you're gone. And so, tomorrow morning, when the sun rises in Afghanistan, the United States military will not be there. And that airfield will go back to control of the commercial activities that are currently there. And I think that's what they're doing right now. And that militarily makes sense to me. But, I mean, tomorrow morning, when the sun arises in Afghanistan, I think everybody in America is going to take a deep breath and go, wow, 20 years, and this is how we leave after 9/11? I mean, it was disorderly to get out of there, a lot of unforced errors. And I think there's going to be a really bad aftertaste in this whole thing, Neil, going forward.",

It has been since 327 B.C., when Alexander the Great found out about that and when the British found out about that. And when the Russians went in, they found out about it. It's going to be a really an ungoverned territory going forward. And the problem is, it's going to have the capability and capacity to have a first-grade military because all the kit we left for them. We left attack fighters on the ground. We left Black Hawk helicopters, more than Australia has, all those weapon systems that are out there, and you have got a government that is really not a government. It's basically a terrorist organization that now holds a lot of land. And who knows what the future is going to bring. But I will tell you, it's going to be like the Badlands in the American West and the old days. You're going to have a lot of really bad people in that country.

If you remember, in Iraq, in 2011, when President Obama moved all troops -- I think it was an ill- advised -- moved all troops out of Iraq, within three years, ISIS was able to fester and form in Iraq and Syria. So, in 2014, when ISIS attacked Iraq and took over a third of Iraq's territory and the city of Mosul of over a million people, at that time, five Iraqi divisions were defeated, and the Iraqi security forces were melting. At that time, people thought something very similar is that ISIS would take Baghdad and the Iraqi security forces would be ineffective and the government could fall. A different path was chosen, though, with a small footprint of U.S. soldiers, which I was very, very honored to lead in a different pathway. Instead of evacuating the embassy, we ended up fighting ISIS. I just wonder, as we look at the current situation in Afghanistan, if it had been really thought through by the administration, that, without the backbone of U.S. forces, how long did we think the Afghan security forces would last, unless we knew, in fact that they could handle the fight? So I wish that it had been thought through much more. I wish there hadn't been a treaty -- or not treaty, an agreement made by the previous administration, Trump administration, with the Taliban to get us in this place in the first place. However, President Biden is the president. He could have chose differently, and he could have had a vision of what the region should be looking like.

We heard from Jennifer Griffin's questioning earlier to John Kirby that one of those rockets came through. The C-RAM, that counter-rocket artillery and mortar system, did not shoot- down all the rockets. One did make it through, but it did not cause any damage to any personnel or aircraft. And, of course, on Sunday, a second U.S. Reaper drone flying from Al Dhafra Air Force Base in the UAE launched another mission to destroy a suicide bomber, two of them that were in a vehicle, a van heading for the gate. It was destroyed just two miles from the front gate of the Kabul Airport, where U.S. forces remain. And, of course, Friday night, that first drone strike, the first time the Biden administration had ordered a strike following that deadly suicide attack that killed 13 American service members, that drone on Friday night killing two ISIS planners.

Now, a senior State Department official does believe they have contact with the necessary Americans who want to leave, but were not able to make it to the airport. There were some disturbing reports, though, over the weekend of Afghan American University students being turned away from the airport. The New York Times said a group of students gathered yesterday in a safe house and then took buses to the Kabul Airport. After waiting for seven hours, they were informed they would not be able to fly out. One student received an e-mail from the university, saying -- quote -- \"I regret to inform you that the high command at HKIA and the airport has announced there will be no more rescue flights.\" We have seen an uptick in recent days of people leaving on foot. Neighboring Iran and Pakistan have taken thousands of Afghan refugees, and we continue to hear stories of desperate Afghans fleeing other ways.

I think we're kind of congratulating ourselves for getting a certain number out. And yet it's an unforced error that we're even doing what we're doing right now. And nobody can really tell me or you or your listeners out there how many are actually left behind and what conditions they are going to be left in. So, I mean, I congratulate the tactical units on the ground for getting the people out of there. I know they're collapsing the airhead, meaning getting ready to get out of there. But this is almost surreal. I mean, when you think about, after 20 years, and I was in the Pentagon on 9/11. I'm just watching this go, and it's so much to unpack right now. So did we get people out? Yes. Congratulations for getting those people out. Who did we leave behind? And why did we do that?"

      "utterance": "Yes, Neil, to me, that's an unforced error, I mean, first of all, even that we're talking to the Taliban about that. But it makes sense to me, in the sense that Baradar, the political adviser of the Taliban, probably knew he couldn't control Kabul. And he probably turned to the Americans or -- the way the report goes from The Washington Post. And I don't know the veracity of it. But let's make an assumption that is true. And turn it over to us and said, OK, can you control Kabul? And they probably went to the president of the United States as commander in chief, and he said, no, I don't want to do it, because it would have involved putting more troops on the ground to expand the perimeter. But if your goal is to get every American out of there, and all of your allies out of there, then why not change the date that you made, and nobody else made it, and say, we're going to get our people out? It seems to be we could have negotiated that and worked that. Instead, what they said was, nope, 31 August is a hard date. We're going to get out. And if we leave people behind, we leave people behind. But, I mean, this could be a truly unforced error, where we had the opportunity to expand the perimeter, put more troops in there until we got the people out that we wanted to get out, and then collapse the perimeter and go out. I mean, it's almost like -- I hope we unpack this story more and more, because it really doesn't make sense to me. I don't know if it does to you. But, again, Neil, it doesn't make sense to me at all."

But even in my naive look at the region, if we had gotten that ability to secure Kabul, that would have meant that there would be no Taliban perimeter around the airport or anything that we ultimately saw that was compromised, obviously, by these ISIS-K bombings. So, it's easy to Monday morning quarterback this, if indeed it was that way. But it's just part of a series of fateful decisions that brought us to where we are now. It doesn't look, as you know, General, that we're going to extend the deadline beyond tomorrow, roughly at this time, about 23 hours and 40 minutes from now. What do you think of that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KELLOGG",
      "utterance": "Yes. Well, I know they're out of there. Look, what they're doing militarily is, they're actually collapsing the perimeter right now, the airhead. And General Donahue, who's the commander of the 82nd, is the guy in charge of it. And he knows how to do that. You leave detachments left and contact. You slowly reduce the size of the airhead, and then you get out. And probably in the middle of the night, you get -- you're out of there, and you're gone. And so, tomorrow morning, when the sun rises in Afghanistan, the United States military will not be there. And that airfield will go back to control of the commercial activities that are currently there. And I think that's what they're doing right now. And that militarily makes sense to me. But, I mean, tomorrow morning, when the sun arises in Afghanistan, I think everybody in America is going to take a deep breath and go, wow, 20 years, and this is how we leave after 9/11? I mean, it was disorderly to get out of there, a lot of unforced errors. And I think there's going to be a really bad aftertaste in this whole thing, Neil, going forward."

They're not Jeffersonian democrats there in Afghanistan. And it's going to be a nation in conflict. It has been since 327 B.C., when Alexander the Great found out about that and when the British found out about that. And when the Russians went in, they found out about it. It's going to be a really an ungoverned territory going forward. And the problem is, it's going to have the capability and capacity to have a first-grade military because all the kit we left for them. We left attack fighters on the ground. We left Black Hawk helicopters, more than Australia has, all those weapon systems that are out there, and you have got a government that is really not a government. It's basically a terrorist organization that now holds a lot of land. And who knows what the future is going to bring. But I will tell you, it's going to be like the Badlands in the American West and the old days. You're going to have a lot of really bad people in that country.

For Fort Bliss, Fort Bliss just happens to be the largest post by area in the United States Army. In fact, between Fort Bliss and the adjoining base, White Sands Missile Range, that's 25 percent of the U.S. Army's total land. So there are places at Fort Bliss that are remote, where the refugees can be secured. Places like Donald Ana Range or MacGregor Range.

Trying to secure a city of Kabul, as large as it is, would be extremely difficult if you do not have the troops to do it. Apparently, he chose to secure the Kabul Airport, which was more within the constraints that he was given as far as troops. So maybe that's a possibility. The initial planning, as discussed before, I think was very poor, when the withdraw and, in fact, abandonment of Afghanistan took place. Now, the evacuation itself, with 114,000 citizens, Afghan and American citizens, being taken out was done well, once that took place. The initial planning was terrible."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "PITTARD",
      "utterance": "It's hard to estimate. Kabul, millions of people in Kabul. I think it would have taken at least a division level force of 20,000 to 30,000 to secure all of Kabul. So, General Ken McKenzie chose the smaller footprint of what he thought he could control."

As someone who's written extensively on hunting the caliphate and all that stuff, now trying to make sense of what Afghanistan that looks like in light of warring terrorist groups like this new ISIS-K and the Taliban and others, what is Afghanistan like right now? And from the new Afghanistan, whatever evolves, is it a threat to us? Is what's happening there a potential physical threat to us?"

But the rap is that by not appreciating how quickly the government could fall, we were caught off-guard and in the position we're now in kind of running out of town in the next 23 hours. Do you agree with that, that people should have been more aware of that potential, especially as the Taliban was accelerating its run and takeover the country at a pretty swift pace, as this discussion was going back and forth?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PITTARD",
      "utterance": "I'm just not sure how -- how anybody could really predicted how quickly the Afghan security forces and the Afghan government would have fallen. We have had examples, though, and parallels. If you remember, in Iraq, in 2011, when President Obama moved all troops -- I think it was an ill- advised -- moved all troops out of Iraq, within three years, ISIS was able to fester and form in Iraq and Syria. So, in 2014, when ISIS attacked Iraq and took over a third of Iraq's territory and the city of Mosul of over a million people, at that time, five Iraqi divisions were defeated, and the Iraqi security forces were melting. At that time, people thought something very similar is that ISIS would take Baghdad and the Iraqi security forces would be ineffective and the government could fall. A different path was chosen, though, with a small footprint of U.S. soldiers, which I was very, very honored to lead in a different pathway. Instead of evacuating the embassy, we ended up fighting ISIS. I just wonder, as we look at the current situation in Afghanistan, if it had been really thought through by the administration, that, without the backbone of U.S. forces, how long did we think the Afghan security forces would last, unless we knew, in fact that they could handle the fight? So I wish that it had been thought through much more. I wish there hadn't been a treaty -- or not treaty, an agreement made by the previous administration, Trump administration, with the Taliban to get us in this place in the first place. However, President Biden is the president. He could have chose differently, and he could have had a vision of what the region should be looking like. And I'm not sure that vision is what we're seeing right now, a Taliban-run Afghanistan."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "So your argument, General, just to be clear, is that a presence, even a small presence of 2,000, 2, 500, 2, 600 troops would have been enough to at least avoided what we saw happen?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PITTARD",
      "utterance": "I think so, a small footprint, maybe 2, 500, maybe 3, 500. But they were basically enablers. They were able to help conduct airstrikes. They helped secure the massive airfield at Bagram Air Base. They were able to do intelligence. They were also able to be a good platform against other terrorist groups that are in the region. Now what we find ourselves is in a position where we have a Taliban-run government and we have no assets in the region to be able to protect ourselves from abroad from terrorism that could come here. So, yes, I think it could have been done differently. And if it had been explained that way to the American people, I think the American people might have understood that. But we had not only this administration, but the previous administration, that was focused on domestic politics, and for just getting out of Afghanistan, and not really explaining to the American people the strategic impact of leaving."

But now the Taliban has announced that it's in control of the airport. And there were negotiations taking place with NATO allies, with the Turks, as well as the Qataris, to work with the Taliban to try and reopen that airport at some -- airport at some point to civilian aircraft. But right now, the last U.S. warplanes are nearly out of Afghan airspace. In fact, they may have -- in fact, as of right now, they are out of Afghan airspace. They were -- they were going to cross two minutes ago. So, the last U.S. forces are out of Afghanistan."

      "utterance": "It is over. Our 20-year ordeal in Afghanistan is over. The last plane has flown out of the country. And the reading from the general oversaw the process is that it is now up to the Taliban to make it a new country, giving compliments to the Taliban and their cooperation to make sure this evacuation worked. There were some bumps, to put it mildly, including the death of 13 of our soldiers and close to 200 Afghans.
