I go back to this idea though of what then can we do aside from going in and dealing with the cartels ourselves? But it's not like you can just take out one cartel and then the problem is over. This is a deeply entrenched problem all across Mexico.  You have 90 homicides a day. Imagine that in America, like imagine if you had 90 homicides a day, what would happen in this country. It never happened in this country. So if I were the Mexicans, I would take the president up on his offer of cooperation, it doesn't necessarily have to be made aid in terms of bullets. Maybe it is another way to help them with their governance or something, but to turn a blind eye to the United States being really frustrated on this problem, I think would leads the Mexicans down a really bad path.  I would take action as a Congress and as the president of the United States to designate the cartels as a terrorist organization. I think there is ample proof of that from the violence as well as the activities that they participate in. A $150 billion of illegal drugs coming into the country.   Now whether we legalize drugs, maybe we will do that in the future, but it's not going to happen anytime soon.

Now, the retail quality of pot from the United States is going south and pot seizures is coming north has dropped by 75 percent. So, legalization killed the pot market for Mexico. I don't think you should legalize something to kill a cartel, but there is something in there that saying that cause and effect. That if you make something legal you regulated. You have an industry. You get rid of the criminal element and that's what happens.  Right now, they're just, I think they are basically dealing in Fentanyl and heroin, and probably, cocs so you could do a couple of things. One, you could kill them off like terrorists, but unlike ISIS, they make stuff we want. So, we are killing people who are essentially -- who are essentially providing something for us. With Jesse's point, number two, you could toughen the border, and you should toughen the border and that includes everything including the wall.  You can talk about decriminalization, which I think is important. Watch the drug cartels implode. But here's something that you can't do.

So, last night I had the honor of going to the 35th Annual Strive Anniversary Gala and my friends Dina Powell McCormick and Mitch Landrieu were honored for their dedication to the organization. I was really overwhelmed during the night because they have a 70 percent job placement rate. They basically help people break the cycle of poverty. They help people learn how to interview, how to get along with others, how to tie a tie. And they inspired natural entrepreneurs like Roy Castro. He spent 10 years in jails from 18 to 28 years of age, wanted to change his life. He then went to Strive and the Goldman Sachs 10000 Small Businesses program because of Dina's help and now he has the largest ice cream distributorship in all of New York City. He has moved out to the south, he's got a big beautiful family and he's on the board now. If you know anybody who needs help in this area or you want to volunteer, Strive has 12 programs in cities across the country, we've got a map there for you to check it out. It is amazing.

We don't need your help. We've got a handle on all of this. But clearly, they don't have a handle on the cartels."

I go back to this idea though of what then can we do aside from going in and dealing with the cartels ourselves? But it's not like you can just take out one cartel and then the problem is over. This is a deeply entrenched problem all across Mexico. You have 90 homicides a day. Imagine that in America, like imagine if you had 90 homicides a day, what would happen in this country. It never happened in this country. So if I were the Mexicans, I would take the president up on his offer of cooperation, it doesn't necessarily have to be made aid in terms of bullets. Maybe it is another way to help them with their governance or something, but to turn a blind eye to the United States being really frustrated on this problem, I think would leads the Mexicans down a really bad path. I would take action as a Congress and as the president of the United States to designate the cartels as a terrorist organization. I think there is ample proof of that from the violence as well as the activities that they participate in. A $150 billion of illegal drugs coming into the country. Now whether we legalize drugs, maybe we will do that in the future, but it's not going to happen anytime soon.

It used to be that pot for decades was going in one direction, north from -- north from Mexico to the United States. Now, the retail quality of pot from the United States is going south and pot seizures is coming north has dropped by 75 percent. So, legalization killed the pot market for Mexico. I don't think you should legalize something to kill a cartel, but there is something in there that saying that cause and effect. That if you make something legal you regulated. You have an industry. You get rid of the criminal element and that's what happens. Right now, they're just, I think they are basically dealing in Fentanyl and heroin, and probably, cocs so you could do a couple of things. One, you could kill them off like terrorists, but unlike ISIS, they make stuff we want. So, we are killing people who are essentially -- who are essentially providing something for us. With Jesse's point, number two, you could toughen the border, and you should toughen the border and that includes everything including the wall. You can talk about decriminalization, which I think is important. Watch the drug cartels implode. But here's something that you can't do. You can't stop small religious sects from moving to a violent wasteland. You -- it puts your family and your children into harm's way. OK?

So now all you're going to have are Republicans and Democrats acting like show ponies just trying to out just hands each other, to play got you with the various witnesses.

That's the Ukraine field. Because they got burned on Russia. Russia, they put all their hearts into Russia and it fell apart, they can't do it again with Ukraine. Because they are now beginning to see that this is a fable based on opinions, based on other opinions. It's all about if, right? The concerned angle in which you are concerned about something that might happen but doesn't or hasn't. It's like if Donald Trump -- it goes back to one sense. If Donald Trump shot somebody on Fifth Avenue, would he get away with it? That has never happened. But that question informs the strategy, what I would call the concerned strategy, where they try to avoid the concrete achievements of Trump and replace it with hypothetical hysterics. Like, what if he does this? What if he lied? What if this was this? And also, the media wants the public to think that quid pro quo is like the plague. Actually, it's the engine of life and commerce. Whether it's sales, whether it's a politician, whether you're at, whether you got a hotdog vendor, you give me x, I'll give you y. Put some mustard on the x, please.

Yes, it's good to laugh, but also maybe to move on, isn't there a Wal-Mart that needs to greeters. Maybe this is a new thing for Corden though. Open mic night for losers. He hands the set over to people to work humorously through their humiliations after Hillary invite Jeff Zucker. But I enjoyed it once you ponder the alternative. Four years ago, you were given two choices Trump loses and Hillary's President or Trump wins and Hillary is doing standup. Every time Hillary cracks a joke, it's a reminder which one you got. So, Hillary is welcome to overstay her welcome because it's fun to be reminded that Trump didn't just win. He put an exclamation point finally at the end of the Clinton sentence. She may kill on stage and in prison, but he killed a dynasty. So, enjoy the jokes when it's coming from the Clintons. They write themselves. I love Hillary, Kennedy. I never wanted to leave. She makes me happy."

They help people learn how to interview, how to get along with others, how to tie a tie. And they inspired natural entrepreneurs like Roy Castro. He spent 10 years in jails from 18 to 28 years of age, wanted to change his life. He then went to Strive and the Goldman Sachs 10000 Small Businesses program because of Dina's help and now he has the largest ice cream distributorship in all of New York City. He has moved out to the south, he's got a big beautiful family and he's on the board now.
