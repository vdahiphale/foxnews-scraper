So we had great people from history like Eisenhower, Frederick Douglass and then we had people who just at 18 years of age decided that they were going to declare their own personal independence. And the media is silent now that it's over and their overreactions were not borne out. We are not hearing the celebration of it by the mainstream media and that's a shame because it was a great history lesson. KURTZ: Did get a lot of coverage for the first day or so. By the way, there were tanks at the inaugurations of FDR, Eisenhower, JFK. What may pundits pounce on, Richard Fowler, is that special VIP tickets were given to Trump donors and allies, and the RNC sort of undercutting at least in advance the nonpartisan theme. FOWLER: Right. Listen, I think the president could have had the speech. I mean, the tanks are not my speed but the president's speed. God bless him. But I do have a problem with how the tickets were distributed. Usually when have an event that is a national celebration, the only event at Harkins, what we say there, it was during inauguration. During that particular time, all members of Congress, all 535 of them, are issued tickets. Here, none of them were and they all went to the RNC for the purposes of ginning up political support.

They had some derogatory information on Christine Ford, the book says, but the Trump team understood that any criticism of her would be treated as a smear and victim shaming.

And the magazine mocked everyone from Justin Bieber, Donald Trump from politics to pop culture. You know, Mad recently popped into the news when Trump said that Pete Buttigieg looked like Mad's What Me Worry mascot, Alfred E. Neuman. The candidate was puzzled, he had to Google it. Future generations will never know the twisty humor symbolized by that gap- toothed grinning icon. And you know, I have read Mad Magazine for years. All print magazines are having problems.

This after new poll showed his lead shrinking and Kamala Harris surging. It is way too early for these political obituaries.

So, what you have is customs and border patrol agents pushing back on the stories that the conditions are poor, saying the conditions are OK. President Trump jumps in and says they are actually very good. Journalists are forgetting that their role here is not to focus on those side-bar arguments. The argument here for the media, what matters to the media is not to cover whether Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez thinks that somebody was drinking out of a toilet bowl or whether these are concentration-camp like situations, what matters is reporting on the problem.

Now that we've all heard the speech, was there a media overreaction?

You heard about Clarence Henderson, who at 18 years of age organized one of the first sit-ins at a lunch counter in South Carolina. So we had great people from history like Eisenhower, Frederick Douglass and then we had people who just at 18 years of age decided that they were going to declare their own personal independence. And the media is silent now that it's over and their overreactions were not borne out. We are not hearing the celebration of it by the mainstream media and that's a shame because it was a great history lesson. KURTZ: Did get a lot of coverage for the first day or so. By the way, there were tanks at the inaugurations of FDR, Eisenhower, JFK. What may pundits pounce on, Richard Fowler, is that special VIP tickets were given to Trump donors and allies, and the RNC sort of undercutting at least in advance the nonpartisan theme. FOWLER: Right. Listen, I think the president could have had the speech. I mean, the tanks are not my speed but the president's speed. God bless him. But I do have a problem with how the tickets were distributed. Usually when have an event that is a national celebration, the only event at Harkins, what we say there, it was during inauguration. During that particular time, all members of Congress, all 535 of them, are issued tickets. Here, none of them were and they all went to the RNC for the purposes of ginning up political support.

The authors who interviewed President Trump and several high court justices report that when Christine Blasey Ford alleged that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her at a high school party and there was widespread speculation he might have to withdraw, Trump wanted his team to fight back both on the Hill and in the media. They had some derogatory information on Christine Ford, the book says, but the Trump team understood that any criticism of her would be treated as a smear and victim shaming. The authors are tough on the coverage including accusing the media of intensely personal dislike of Kavanaugh.

She has really struggled to make that distinction. It has gotten some coverage. Why isn't that a bigger story?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SABATO",
      "utterance": "Well, it should be a bigger story because she's come around to essentially his point of view in the 70s. And I think the reason, Howie, is because a lot of younger people that is everybody below 60, you know, the real youngsters, they didn't go through this. They don't understand that it wasn't just Whites strongly opposing busing. A majority of African- Americans consistently opposed busing, too. This was one of the least popular innovations in civil rights ever."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. And you went through or lived through busing battle in Virginia in the 1970s. It was tearing the country apart. And a lot of people felt like, you know, the elite politicians who have sent to kids to private schools were imposing solutions on their kids, sitting on a bus for an hour and a half, maybe go to schools where they weren't welcome. Has coverage in 2019 been simplistic in suggestion, and implying, insinuating that if you weren't for busing then or for any limits on busing, that you're basically a racist?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SABATO",
      "utterance": "Of course. And again, I hate to put it all generationally, but a lot of reporters are very young, they didn't have a clue, maybe they Googled something in Wikipedia about busing."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Yeah."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SABATO",
      "utterance": "But they didn't live through this. They don't get it. And because they don't get it, they tend to apply what you apply correctly, the simplistic labels on people about a controversy that actually cut across lines in ways that we haven't seen since."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Yeah. Let's turn to polls because the media just went absolutely nuts when a CNN poll came out after the debate, registered Dems and Democratic leaners showing Kamala Harris surging into second place and trailing a sinking Joe Biden by just 5 points. And there is the Quinnipiac poll that showed Biden up by 2 over Harris, basically a statistical tie. But then, a Washington Post-ABC survey comes out and gives Biden a 29 to 11 percent lead over Kamala Harris, more than doubling her support. Are pundits overreacting to these varying polls in, you know, some numbers saying Biden is soon to be toast?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SABATO",
      "utterance": "I wish I could get that as a question on Jeopardy sometimes. Obviously, the answer is yes. They always oversimplify. They always react too strongly, too quickly to every new event, to every new poll. Hey, the voting starts in February, you know. I understand there are 25 candidates. They can't report every day that X is ahead because nobody will pay attention. It's not interesting. They have to mix it up, they have to change the leaders, but that doesn't mean it's accurate reporting."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Do you think the polls were influenced by days and days of coverage in which many pundits said, hey, look, there's no question Kamala Harris did herself a lot of good in the debate, and Biden did not look good in that exchange. But all the reporting was like Biden is old, he's slow, he's out of touch, he didn't know how to respond, and she got these glowing profiles, and she was aggressive, and she was a prosecutor, and all of that. When you get bombarded in that kind of environment, does that -- then the next poll is taken, is there a cause and effect there?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SABATO",
      "utterance": "There could be a cause and effect. What's interesting to me is and what ought to be a cautionary tale for pundits is apparently, their punditting had no effect. In fact, Biden is doing much better and we have gone back to not quite the situation we were in prior to the debate, but approximately the same. So maybe people are still and should tune out the pundits, tune out the commentary, it's enough to watch four hours of debate."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Yeah."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "SABATO",
      "utterance": "Well, they're misjudging it from the grassroots level because what Biden said is actually true. The party is still center left. Like most Democrats, like most Americans, can't even define a socialist, they don't know what socialism actually is. But there's -- there's a real danger here. And I think Biden unlike some of the younger ones, who are running for president, he recognizes the danger. If Democrats move too far to the left, the election is over."

      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "It was a brutal attack by left-wing Antifa members on Andy Ngo, a conservative writer in Portland, Oregon. And it sparked a ferocious media debate since he posted this video of his battered and bloody face wondering what happened to the police and everybody got to see it."

      "utterance": "When I realized what was happening, it was too late. A mob of people who were dressed in black and wearing masks started beating me with their fists and some of them used objects to hit me. And all this time, I kept thinking, where are the police."

      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Joining us now from New York, Kat Timpf, a National Review writer and host of Sincerely Kat on Fox Nation. What is it about this Antifa attack on Andy Ngo and the failure of the Portland cops to step in that has turned this into such a national controversy?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KAT TIMPF, SINCERELY KAT HOST",
      "utterance": "Right. Absolutely. I see it as being something where if you imagine, if this had been a guy in a MAGA hat who beat up a New York Times reporter or a CNN reporter, I think that people on the left would have covered it a lot more than they did. Now, the left-wing outlets that did cover it, they did say they never condone violence, but in the same breath, they would say things like well, he's provoked them, et cetera, et cetera. I think when someone is beaten so badly, they go to the hospital. It should be this is not OK, full stop."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Right. Let's put up a little bit of cell phone video of the attack itself. You can't see everything, but it gives you the sense of chaos there. So, you're saying it was a pretty serious charge that if the ideological shoe was on the other foot -- and, wow, just looking at this, it's really something. And if this had been a liberal writer attack, you think the story would have been much bigger by order of magnitude, that's - - that's rough."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "I really do think so. I really do think so. Now, I do think that some conservatives went a little bit too far in painting a larger picture in particular, Donald Trump, Jr., wrote a piece in Daily Caller that said that the media response or the lack of media response proved that people in left-wing media or mainstream media are Defacto Antifa supporters. I wouldn't go that far because like I said, everyone did say they don't condone violence when they discussed it, except for maybe a few outliers who don't represent the mainstream media. But I really do think if this had been a MAGA hat and someone going after a conservative -- excuse me, a liberal reporter, this would have been a way bigger story, where people are blaming the President, people blaming Republicans in general."

The Democratic mayor of the city, Ted Wheeler, owes him apology. He supervises the police force. There hasn't been very much empathy. But let me broaden this out. The Washington Post just wrote an op-ed piece by Stephanie Wilkinson. She owns the Virginia restaurant. She's the one who kicked out Sarah Huckabee-Sanders about a year ago for the sin of being President Trump's Press Secretary. She says in this piece, new rules apply. And in this administration, if you're directly complicit in spreading hate or perpetuating suffering, maybe you should consider dining at home. And the Post runs this and nobody cares. Are we in the new age of intolerance toward conservatives and Trump supporters?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "I really absolutely think that we are. I think that people say it's synonymous to be a Republican and be a bad person, rather than oh, I disagree with you, it's oh, no, you're a bad person. They think that someone's political views make them good or bad. And they don't -- it's not left or right anymore. It's good and bad for a lot of these people. And with this Washington Post piece, the news hook that she sort of hung it on was Eric Trump getting spit on by a server, which we should all just say unequivocally is unacceptable."

      "speaker": "BARNETT",
      "utterance": "Well, I wouldn't be presumptuous enough to tell him what to do. And I think it would be important to be sharp, to be ready, to assume attacks again, and in the perfect world you'll have a couple moments you can deliver that will resonate, go viral, and kind of take back what happened in the first debate."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "The conventional wisdom is that in multicandidate field, the attacker, the person who goes on offense can also suffer a backlash, but Kamala Harris is riding -- is riding a wave of positive press. Why do you think there hasn't been backlash against her?"

      "speaker": "BARNETT",
      "utterance": "I've read some commentary to the effect that it seemed that it was rehearsed and it was going to happen no matter what. I think that there's a skill to being able to deliver an attack to use your words. You have to do it carefully, you have to do it politely, you have to do it intellectually, and you have to do what Kamala Harris did brilliantly afterwards, which was make it very clear that she was not making an accusation about Joe Biden's inclinations with respect to race and that she had in fact, great respect for him."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Right. This is the most liberal Democratic field in decades. There's no question about it. You had 10 candidates raising their hand on the stage saying, you know, let's provide health coverage for undocumented or illegal immigrants. You have Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren among others for Medicare for All in a way that would eliminate private insurance. Even many of the mainstream media now are saying that some of these positions could be lethal in a general election campaign against President Trump."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARNETT",
      "utterance": "And you can't get the nomination unless you got those caucus goers and primary voters voting in your favor. So you have to keep in mind the immediate audience, which is the activists because that's how you're going to get the nomination, but I have memory of spending hours and hours worrying about just what you described, which is the implications of statements made during the primaries with respect to the general election. It's a fine line, it's never done perfectly, and I think it's premature to make judgments about the general election implications quite yet. But what you have described is real."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Making -- making premature judgments is what the media do. It's our middle name. Now, you have been involved in debate preps going back to 1976. You have played George H.W. Bush, you played Dick Cheney, you played both Obama and Bernie in two different Hillary campaigns. Do you try to copy their speaking style at all and do you try to deliver harsher attacks than the real candidates might in an effort to prepare your candidate for the worse?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARNETT",
      "utterance": "I absolutely don't try to imitate or act. I'm not that talented. I simply try to replicate their statements, their rhetoric, their policies. I prepare when I play the role of the Republican candidate. I prepare a briefing with as many as a hundred issues, and what the candidate, the Republican candidate has said about those. I try to internalize them. I watch every day before the practices, every day before the debates to see if they've done any variance on their themes. And I try to do the best I can to replicate what will be said on the stage. My goal is very simple. I don't want my candidate to leave the stage the night of the debate having heard anything on that stage that he or she has not heard during the rehearsals. If I accomplish that, I've done my job."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",

    {
      "speaker": "BARNETT",
      "utterance": "I was pretty harsh on Gerry because it was good to be ready for that, even though George Herbert Walker Bush was a very gentle and professional man. And when I would go too far, she would literally walk over from her podium to mine and punch me in the arm. And I left those rehearsals with a black and blue arm. So physicality does enter this, Howie."

    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Mad Magazine is folding after 67 years except for special occasional issues. And this is stunning news for those who grew up with its biting and sometimes silly satire. Mad had an enormous influence on generations of writers, producers, comedians, who learn today look at the world in a new and cockeyed way. Mad was run by the usual gang of idiots they said. And the magazine mocked everyone from Justin Bieber, Donald Trump from politics to pop culture. You know, Mad recently popped into the news when Trump said that Pete Buttigieg looked like Mad's What Me Worry mascot, Alfred E. Neuman. The candidate was puzzled, he had to Google it. Future generations will never know the twisty humor symbolized by that gap- toothed grinning icon. And you know, I have read Mad Magazine for years. All print magazines are having problems. But there's something that's just -- you know, it was so much part of the culture for so many years. Well, that's it for this edition of \"Media Buzz.\" I'm Howard Kurtz.
