      "sentences": "Martha, good to see you. What a week it has been both for hyped up news stories that are putting President Trump in a negative light that turned out to be bogus on top of a series of stunning developments that suggest maybe people around the president are not getting a fair shake in the Russia investigation. The latest example tonight, the judge overseeing the case involving Retired General Michael Flynn has now recused himself from the matter without explanation.  Court documents showing that Judge Rudolph Contreras has now removed himself from the case, but he only did so after Flynn pleaded guilty -- before Contreras -- in federal court for lying to the FBI, raising questions about why he did not reveal that beforehand. That move follows several other problems for special counsel Robert Mueller this week. That increased concerns about whether the investigation is fair. New tonight, the Wall Street Journal reporting that Mueller's Top Deputy, Andrew Weissmann, attended Hillary Clinton's election night party, yes, at the Javits Center in New York. Remember earlier this week, we learned Weissmann had e-mailed then-Acting Attorney General Sally Yates early this year when she defied President Trump over his travel ban, writing: \"I'm in so proud and in awe. Thank you so much. All my deepest respects.\"  On top of FBI Agent Peter Strzok, having to be pulled from Mueller's probe because he had sent text messages to his girlfriend that was anti-Trump and were cheerleading for Hillary Clinton. After Strzok had served as lead agent in the Clinton e-mail probe and got then FBI Director James Comey to shift his summation from saying Clinton was \"grossly negligent\", which hinted that crimes to the more lenient \"extremely careless.\" Now we learned tonight that despite several media reports earlier this year suggesting Attorney General Jeff Sessions may have been in hot water for not revealing his contacts with the Russian ambassador on an important security clearance form, an FBI e-mail marked March 7th, that date was important, shows that Sessions was under no obligation to reveal those contacts unless he quote developed personal relationships with ambassadors from Russia or anywhere else.  And here's why that's important: just a few days earlier on March 2nd, Jeff Sessions put out a statement saying he was recusing himself from any investigations involving the 2016 campaign, because of his role supporting President Trump. Now, the FBI e-mail basically comes in five days later saying there was no problem with you failing to disclose this contact with the Russian ambassador on this form. Remember, when Sessions recused himself, that led to the appointment, yes, of Robert Mueller. Martha?",

It was also his testimony before Al Franken and other members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and whether he fully answered truthfully. There was a lot of pressure on Jeff Sessions. But if you're President Trump tonight and you're hearing that five days after your attorney general recused himself the FBI said well, that contact with the Russian ambassador really wasn't that big of a deal, the anger that President Trump has had before about the recusal leading to the Mueller appointment is only going to get a little hotter.",

Thanks so much to both of you for being here.   You know, with regard to this CNN report, I just want to put up a statement from CNN's Brian Stelter.

And ironically enough, the media outlet that corrected them both and blew the whistle on this was The Washington Post, which said you got the dates wrong, you're making -- you're conflating this, making it look like it's something that it's not. So, it's a problem in the media culture in which we live where everybody feels like they've got to be the first. And particularly, if it sounds like it's anti-Trump, then some media outlets are quick to rush through it. But it is an irony, CNN made the mistake, CBS quickly followed, and the people who set them straight were The Washington Post.",

Adrienne, you know, when you look at that, and then you look at sort of the larger context of the stories that we've talked so much about this week with regard to the Mueller team and their conflicts, and, you know, being like Weissmann, for example, who was at the Hillary Clinton party, which turned out to not be not much of a party that night. And all of their obvious support for her, do you see that as a problem, as an American who wants to make sure that this is a fair system? ADRIENNE ELDROD, STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR FOR THE 2016 CLINTON PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN: Well, no. Absolutely. I mean, first of all, going back to what happened with CNN, it is critically important, there are so many moving parts in this investigation, it's critically important that every media outlet make sure that they check all of the boxes, dot the I's, cross the T's before they go up with something. There is a lot of competition out there and accuracy is incredibly important. Especially, when we're not even looking at this. At least in my view, it shouldn't always be a Democrat vs. Republican issue. We need to make sure that we as Americans protect ourselves from ever being under the influence of an adversarial government, again, in terms of influencing our electoral process.  But secondly, look, I mean there are a lot of moving parts in the investigation, but you see a lot of Republicans now who praised Mueller when he was initially appointed to oversee this investigation independently. And now, people are saying oh, wait, we don't think he's fair, we think he's too biased when this is just, again, another example of Republicans trying to create chaos in a situation given the fact that Mueller is getting closer and closer to determining the -- getting to the bottom of this investigation.",

But Peter Strzok removed in July; we find out about it in December. Bruce Ohr removed in the Justice Department for having met with Steele, the Brit who was behind the so-called dossier. Andrew Weissmann -- of the 15 attorneys that we know were involved in the Mueller investigation, nine of them are political contributors and all of them are Democrats. So, I thought Kim Strossel had a terrific column today in The Wall Street Journal. And her recommendation was that in order to keep a confidence, to build confidence in this investigation, Mueller needed to have someone whose job it was to respond quickly to congressional requests for information. And make certain that when things like Peter Strzok happened in July, we don't find out about it in November. People in Congress who are involved in these investigations find out about it contemporaneously.  Can I correct one other thing, though, in the reporting that we've been talking about here: the recusal of Jeff Sessions. It is required by law. In response to the appointment of Robert Kennedy by John Kennedy as his Attorney General, and the John Mitchell appointment, the Campaign Chairman for Richard Nixon, the federal statute requires that if a matter comes up involving the presidential campaign, and the attorney general had played a leading role in that campaign as an advisor or participant in the campaign, he must, as a matter of law, recuse himself. And Jeff Sessions as the first Republican senator to endorse Trump and a Senior Adviser to President Trump had no other course of action available to him except to recuse him under the explicit federal statute governing these kinds of situations.",

It is true, in my view, that this accuser has damaged her own credibility to a significant extent because Gloria Allred presented that entire inscription as written by Roy Moore, which we now know was not accurate. To say that now the whole thing is a forgery or to say that the judge has completely vindicated, I think is a vast overstatement especially because there are eight other women who are involved in this. And one other very quick point, Martha, one of the Moore spokesmen there said that, oh, if you believe that the witness lied about one thing, you can believe they lied about everything. If that standard was applied to Roy Moore, I think that that is not something he would want, because a previous accuser came out this week with a note that he wrote her in high school. Now, he claims that he does not know her at all. Now, there's a signature that looks exactly like the one in the yearbook, same exact handwriting that undermines his claim that he never knew any of these women. So, it's more of a mixed bag.",

Doug Jones has been a pretty good candidate. But it's a good race. It's close, but it's tough.  Four things have to happen for Jones to win. One, you need a low Republican turnout. Republicans who can't vote for Moore won't vote for Jones. You need a high turnout amongst women, suburban women, Democratic women, independent women, you need a very high turnout amongst African- Americans in particular. And last, but not least, you need a great GOTV operation. Now, the Democrats haven't had a plus rating in Alabama since 1976.

Republican Richard Shelby switched after he got elected in 1986. So, a long time ago it was a competitive state. But what happens when your state is uncompetitive for long enough is that your voters tune out, they go away. Just like what happened in California: Republicans used to keep it close in California but after enough defeats, you lose your -- you lose your verve, you start to get worse candidates and you fall apart. The question for African-American voters in Alabama is, do you feel like it's worth a try? Do you feel like it's worth a try this year, that you can send a message that you can do this? And there's no guarantee that they will, but I would say that Doug Jones is running a smart campaign in this way. He's focused now very much on talking about Alabama's reputation.

She made a joke at the White House talking about wanting to get away to an island, you know, someplace to relax with her family.

So we're going to stay close on all of this as we watch it play out this evening. No doubt he'll talk about the economy.  No doubt he will make some comments on Roy Moore. That's obviously what everybody is going to be watching for to see sort of how strong those comments are. As Guy Benson pointed out a little while ago, he certainly hasn't been shy in his support in his tweets throughout the course of this week. He says Roy Moore doesn't believe he did anything wrong and that the people of Alabama are the ones that need to make this decision in terms of what they will do on Tuesday night. So the White House, as we said, some good economic news today. This morning we got a look at the November jobs numbers. Almost 230,000 jobs added last month. Expectation was for 200,000. So that was an upside surprise. Unemployment still at 4.1 percent, that's a 17-year low. Markets moved higher on the news proving once again that the one undisputed aspect of the past year under President Trump is that the market clearly likes what it sees. Earlier this evening, I spoke with Mark Short, White House director of legislative affairs.

What a week it has been both for hyped up news stories that are putting President Trump in a negative light that turned out to be bogus on top of a series of stunning developments that suggest maybe people around the president are not getting a fair shake in the Russia investigation. The latest example tonight, the judge overseeing the case involving Retired General Michael Flynn has now recused himself from the matter without explanation. Court documents showing that Judge Rudolph Contreras has now removed himself from the case, but he only did so after Flynn pleaded guilty -- before Contreras -- in federal court for lying to the FBI, raising questions about why he did not reveal that beforehand. That move follows several other problems for special counsel Robert Mueller this week. That increased concerns about whether the investigation is fair."

    {
      "speaker": "New tonight, the Wall Street Journal reporting that Mueller's Top Deputy, Andrew Weissmann, attended Hillary Clinton's election night party, yes, at the Javits Center in New York. Remember earlier this week, we learned Weissmann had e-mailed then-Acting Attorney General Sally Yates early this year when she defied President Trump over his travel ban, writing",
      "utterance": "\"I'm in so proud and in awe. Thank you so much. All my deepest respects.\" On top of FBI Agent Peter Strzok, having to be pulled from Mueller's probe because he had sent text messages to his girlfriend that was anti-Trump and were cheerleading for Hillary Clinton. After Strzok had served as lead agent in the Clinton e-mail probe and got then FBI Director James Comey to shift his summation from saying Clinton was \"grossly negligent\", which hinted that crimes to the more lenient \"extremely careless.\" Now we learned tonight that despite several media reports earlier this year suggesting Attorney General Jeff Sessions may have been in hot water for not revealing his contacts with the Russian ambassador on an important security clearance form, an FBI e-mail marked March 7th, that date was important, shows that Sessions was under no obligation to reveal those contacts unless he quote developed personal relationships with ambassadors from Russia or anywhere else."

Now, the FBI e-mail basically comes in five days later saying there was no problem with you failing to disclose this contact with the Russian ambassador on this form.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "Right. Well, in Jeff Sessions defense and why he recused himself, he would probably argue because he has talked about this before that it wasn't just about that form the FBI was evaluating in terms of his security clearance. It was also his testimony before Al Franken and other members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and whether he fully answered truthfully. There was a lot of pressure on Jeff Sessions. But if you're President Trump tonight and you're hearing that five days after your attorney general recused himself the FBI said well, that contact with the Russian ambassador really wasn't that big of a deal, the anger that President Trump has had before about the recusal leading to the Mueller appointment is only going to get a little hotter."

Bush and a Fox News Contributor; Adrienne Elrod served as Strategic Communications Director for the 2016 Clinton Presidential Campaign, and they both join me now. Lots to chew over tonight. Thanks so much to both of you for being here. You know, with regard to this CNN report, I just want to put up a statement from CNN's Brian Stelter. He said that \"A CNN spokeswoman says there will be no disciplinary action in this case because, unlike Brian Ross, ABC, M.K. Raju followed the editorial standards process. Multiple sources provided him with the incorrect info.\" When you put these stories together this week, though, Karl, you know, what do they say about, perhaps, a propensity to jump to judgment without checking all the numbers and dates which are crucially important to the story?"

And ironically enough, the media outlet that corrected them both and blew the whistle on this was The Washington Post, which said you got the dates wrong, you're making -- you're conflating this, making it look like it's something that it's not. So, it's a problem in the media culture in which we live where everybody feels like they've got to be the first. And particularly, if it sounds like it's anti-Trump, then some media outlets are quick to rush through it. But it is an irony, CNN made the mistake, CBS quickly followed, and the people who set them straight were The Washington Post."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yes. Brian Ross got a four-week suspension without pay for his error. In the CNN case, they are not doing that, they feel that their reporter was -- you know, that they fixed it in time and that's going to be enough. Adrienne, you know, when you look at that, and then you look at sort of the larger context of the stories that we've talked so much about this week with regard to the Mueller team and their conflicts, and, you know, being like Weissmann, for example, who was at the Hillary Clinton party, which turned out to not be not much of a party that night. And all of their obvious support for her, do you see that as a problem, as an American who wants to make sure that this is a fair system? ADRIENNE ELDROD, STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR FOR THE 2016 CLINTON PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN: Well, no. Absolutely. I mean, first of all, going back to what happened with CNN, it is critically important, there are so many moving parts in this investigation, it's critically important that every media outlet make sure that they check all of the boxes, dot the I's, cross the T's before they go up with something. There is a lot of competition out there and accuracy is incredibly important. Especially, when we're not even looking at this. At least in my view, it shouldn't always be a Democrat vs. Republican issue. We need to make sure that we as Americans protect ourselves from ever being under the influence of an adversarial government, again, in terms of influencing our electoral process. But secondly, look, I mean there are a lot of moving parts in the investigation, but you see a lot of Republicans now who praised Mueller when he was initially appointed to oversee this investigation independently. And now, people are saying oh, wait, we don't think he's fair, we think he's too biased when this is just, again, another example of Republicans trying to create chaos in a situation given the fact that Mueller is getting closer and closer to determining the -- getting to the bottom of this investigation."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROVE",
      "utterance": "Yes. Look, I have confidence in Bob Mueller. I'm one of those people who at the beginning complimented the choice. I still have confidence in him. But Peter Strzok removed in July; we find out about it in December. Bruce Ohr removed in the Justice Department for having met with Steele, the Brit who was behind the so-called dossier. Andrew Weissmann -- of the 15 attorneys that we know were involved in the Mueller investigation, nine of them are political contributors and all of them are Democrats. So, I thought Kim Strossel had a terrific column today in The Wall Street Journal. And her recommendation was that in order to keep a confidence, to build confidence in this investigation, Mueller needed to have someone whose job it was to respond quickly to congressional requests for information. And make certain that when things like Peter Strzok happened in July, we don't find out about it in November. People in Congress who are involved in these investigations find out about it contemporaneously."

In response to the appointment of Robert Kennedy by John Kennedy as his Attorney General, and the John Mitchell appointment, the Campaign Chairman for Richard Nixon, the federal statute requires that if a matter comes up involving the presidential campaign, and the attorney general had played a leading role in that campaign as an advisor or participant in the campaign, he must, as a matter of law, recuse himself. And Jeff Sessions as the first Republican senator to endorse Trump and a Senior Adviser to President Trump had no other course of action available to him except to recuse him under the explicit federal statute governing these kinds of situations."

So, there's some information there. We'll tell you what happened. Our power panel Chris Stirewalt, Guy Benson, Mary Anne Marsh, all here on that. And more proof tonight that President Trump is making good on the promise to help the economy in the United States. The top White House official joins us on the just-released jobs report, and what all this means for your bank accounts. The Dow liked it today, that's for sure.

We'll hear a lot about the great huge big, biggest bigly tax cuts, we'll hear about all of this stuff. What I don't know and this is the $64,000 question: will Trump be able to resist going and talking about Moore by name? Will he be able to resist talking about fake news and using this thing about the line she added under Moore's signature and say it's all fake news? And is he going to go into the space or is he going to keep some distance?"

      "utterance": "All caps: VOTE ROY MOORE! So, he -- not subtle at all on that whole front. And I listened very carefully to Peter Doocy's report there, and I think that it's important to try to keep a few things straight. It is true, in my view, that this accuser has damaged her own credibility to a significant extent because Gloria Allred presented that entire inscription as written by Roy Moore, which we now know was not accurate. To say that now the whole thing is a forgery or to say that the judge has completely vindicated, I think is a vast overstatement especially because there are eight other women who are involved in this. And one other very quick point, Martha, one of the Moore spokesmen there said that, oh, if you believe that the witness lied about one thing, you can believe they lied about everything. If that standard was applied to Roy Moore, I think that that is not something he would want, because a previous accuser came out this week with a note that he wrote her in high school. Now, he claims that he does not know her at all. Now, there's a signature that looks exactly like the one in the yearbook, same exact handwriting that undermines his claim that he never knew any of these women. So, it's more of a mixed bag."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yes. I mean, they make a very big leap when they get into, you know, discussions of this whole thing being thrown out on its head because she added a date and she added the place. And when you look at it, you can really see, you know, that it's different -- her handwriting different underneath the rest of it. You know, honestly, I don't even know -- I don't think it matters to Alabama voters. It doesn't appear that it does. So, Mary Anne, let's talk about it in terms of Doug Jones who now has made this a tight race for a Democrat in a place where it hasn't been one in forever."

      "speaker": "MARY ANNE MARSH, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST AND FORMER SENIOR ADVISOR TO FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN KERRY",
      "utterance": "Right. I mean, that's the point, Martha. The fact that this is even a competitive race, tells you everything about this whole situation in Alabama. It has been decades since the Democrat has won anything in Alabama. And certainly, the fact is Moore has made it competitive by his out of mainstream behavior and his beliefs. Doug Jones has been a pretty good candidate. But it's a good race. It's close, but it's tough. Four things have to happen for Jones to win. One, you need a low Republican turnout. Republicans who can't vote for Moore won't vote for Jones. You need a high turnout amongst women, suburban women, Democratic women, independent women, you need a very high turnout amongst African- Americans in particular. And last, but not least, you need a great GOTV operation. Now, the Democrats haven't had a plus rating in Alabama since 1976. So, the fact that they could have any kind of GOTV operation is, I don't know, a little tough. But, in a three to five-point race if that's what this is low single digits."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Very interesting. In terms of the African-American vote, Doug Jones put out this flier this week. It came from his office, right, Chris? And, you know, that could be a concern for him. The way that it depicts this man in the picture, and, you know, here's the new Doug Jones mail you see it below. Ostensibly, it means to, you know, help improve Black turnout. But a lot of people were offended by it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STIREWALT",
      "utterance": "I don't know enough about that one to know how folks in Alabama are feeling about that. But Mary Anne makes a fantastically correct point which is this: in a state like Alabama that used to be competitive, Richard Shelby was elected, by the way, as a Democrat. Republican Richard Shelby switched after he got elected in 1986. So, a long time ago it was a competitive state. But what happens when your state is uncompetitive for long enough is that your voters tune out, they go away. Just like what happened in California: Republicans used to keep it close in California but after enough defeats, you lose your -- you lose your verve, you start to get worse candidates and you fall apart. The question for African-American voters in Alabama is, do you feel like it's worth a try? Do you feel like it's worth a try this year, that you can send a message that you can do this? And there's no guarantee that they will, but I would say that Doug Jones is running a smart campaign in this way. He's focused now very much on talking about Alabama's reputation. And what it will say about Alabama to have one governor removed for a sex scandal, and then have another senator, and then have a senator elected under the cloud of one."

The president likes to work on Friday nights and it's 7:26. He has just landed, so he'll head over to the venue and get ready for this speech tonight. We know that he's going to touch on the economy for sure; very strong numbers. And we're going to talk to Mark Short at the White House about what those jobs numbers mean for people in America. We know the market has taken off like a rocket since the Trump election, that is for sure. So, we're going to keep a close eye on what he has to say as he heads there. Also, this tonight, a little side note as we looked at this story. It seems that the first lady gets heat pretty much whatever she does. She made a joke at the White House talking about wanting to get away to an island, you know, someplace to relax with her family. And that provoked some criticism from some elements of the media, which is interesting. So, Ainsley Earhardt joins us live with her take on that coming up right after this."

And now he's doing what he loves to do, which is to spend some time with the crowd there, shaking hands. Looks like a chilly night. Snow has moved through the southern part of the country, hitting Georgia, and is heading north over the course of tonight and in to tomorrow. But President Trump will speak to the folks on the line there. And then he'll move on through, and go to the rally and begin his speaking. So we're going to stay close on all of this as we watch it play out this evening. No doubt he'll talk about the economy. No doubt he will make some comments on Roy Moore. That's obviously what everybody is going to be watching for to see sort of how strong those comments are. As Guy Benson pointed out a little while ago, he certainly hasn't been shy in his support in his tweets throughout the course of this week. He says Roy Moore doesn't believe he did anything wrong and that the people of Alabama are the ones that need to make this decision in terms of what they will do on Tuesday night. So the White House, as we said, some good economic news today. This morning we got a look at the November jobs numbers. Almost 230,000 jobs added last month. Expectation was for 200,000. So that was an upside surprise. Unemployment still at 4.1 percent, that's a 17-year low. Markets moved higher on the news proving once again that the one undisputed aspect of the past year under President Trump is that the market clearly likes what it sees. Earlier this evening, I spoke with Mark Short, White House director of legislative affairs. Asked him how he responds to critics who say despite the strong jobs numbers, wage growth is a bit sluggish."

And something buried inside those numbers is an all-time low in Hispanic unemployment in this country. As well as the 1.9 million jobs created during the Trump presidency. Equal to the number of private sector created in the entire first term of the Obama years. All four years. So we think that the economy is going the right way as the president continues to unleash it and pull back the regulatory burden. And we think you'll see the wages increase when we actually get tax reform as well to provide tax relief for corporations and for middle income families. That will help drive the wage rise as well."

When you take a look at through the headlines in response to this news, you see things like this, Trump's unpopularity is amazing given the strength of the economy. Despite Trump's ranker for the global system, the world economy is surging. You know, I mean, when you do look at the polls, the numbers do not match up with what we're seeing in the economy.

But, also, I think it's important to note regarding the larger investigation that millions and millions of dollars of taxpayer expense have been spent so far on investigation has proven no collusion whatsoever with the Russians. So, while the White House continues to cooperate fully with the different house and senate investigation as well as the special counsel, there has been no evidence of collusion. We will continue to do our job and cooperate.

He made a strong decision to stay with commitments other president had made and unable to fulfill, as well as what congress has promised to do going back to 1995 when they voted in the senate 93 to 5 to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.

Fordham University sent us a statement that says this in part, there is no university safe space policy, nor one that excludes any member from the Fordham community from any public spaces on the basis of their political views, Fordham is a community that values diverse opinions, and in which student should disagree with one another in a civil fashion. The university is still investigating the incident, and students who may have violated university code of conduct will be met with the appropriate student conduct process. Here now is one of the students in the video, Aaron Spring. Aaron, good to see you tonight. Thank you for being here. That's the hat that you were wearing that she said represented fascist?"

      "utterance": "Well, the make America great again hats are the one she said represented fascism. However, after they said that they did attack this American flag hat which I'm holding up, saying that we were affiliated with the make America great again people, and therefore we had to leave as well. We didn't leave. We stood our ground."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "SPRING",
      "utterance": "Well, yes. Part of what she was talking about was that we violated the safe space and that we represented Nazism and fascism and all this just made up liberal propaganda, really. And we were in there. We're just a group of friends trying to talk, have a cup of coffee and have political conversation. And they just attacked us."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "SPRING",
      "utterance": "No, of course not. We were just a couple friends going to get coffee, having a talk. We walked in and said all are welcome. It says on the sign, all are welcome. But that only pertains to people who have the same thoughts and the same, you know, opinions as the people who ran that cafe."

      "speaker": "SPRING",
      "utterance": "I don't think they're going to do anything about it. I think it's up to patriots such as myself and other people on campus to kind of step up and start fighting for free speech and campus reform, which is a great group at campusreform.org, has really stepped up to this issue and was able to help in organizing this interview here. And we need people like that to continue to push and get free speech to be recognized."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

And we know that he landed in Pensacola about 15 minutes ago, I would say. And we'll go there as soon as the rally begins. Plus, the first lady, Melania Trump, facing some attacks again. Remember they went after her for the decorations at the White House? Now they're going after her for some light hearted comment that she made about wanting to spend Christmas on a deserted island somewhere with her family. Ainsley Earhardt joins us with her take next."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So, as you know, if you have been watching The Story -- well, that guy has a sparkly hat and he's all ready for the president to arrive in Pensacola. Big night. Friday evening of make America great rally. The president loves to do these events. And we watched him shake the hands as he came out off of Air Force One. Crowds gathering, they'll probably play the President Trump sound track to get everybody ready to go. You can't always get what you want, Rolling Stones, all of that generally in there for the campaign and that continued. So we're going to continue to keep eye on that. Roy Moore is on the topic list for the evening, the economy as well. And we'll keep you posted as soon as he arrives. So there is a little bit of cultural controversy that bubbled up today with regard to first lady Melania Trump's recent visit to a children's hospital. It started with a question and with her answer, watch."

    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yeah. So can you see why that's so disturbing, right? The event was meant to bring holiday cheer to sick children, family, hospital staffers. It seems Mrs. Trump's detractors could not miss an opportunity to give her a hard time over this. Vogue magazine suggested the idea that she wants to get away is, quote, another sign that Melania Trump has mentally checked out of the role as first lady, and checked into a spa somewhere far, far away. And then there's this from The View. You know Joy Behar is a huge fan of the first lady."

      "speaker": "EARHARDT",
      "utterance": "She can't. I mean, she is at a children's hospital. You would think everyone -- every woman out there would say this is wonderful. Every mother out there would say how sweet of her. These children are in a hospital and it's Christmas time and she's there to spread some holiday cheer."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "I mean, who doesn't want to go to deserted island with your family if you can do that. You know, but I just think that she's handled herself really beautifully through all of this. She's very gracious and she doesn't step in it and say things she shouldn't say. She's really, I think, being exemplary by most standards."

    {
      "speaker": "EARHARDT",
      "utterance": "If she were a Democrat, how do you think she'd be treated?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "They would love her. Joy Behar would love her. In fact, remember there was similar controversy over Michelle Obama, people saying she was miserable, that she couldn't wait to leave the White House. It's like -- give these people a break. It is not easy to be in these positions. I mean, there are tougher jobs in the world, but they do sacrifice a lot for the country. And I just think that, whether it's Michelle Obama or Melania, just lay off. They didn't run. Their husbands did."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "EARHARDT",
      "utterance": "I would have supported both of them. I believe that you pray for your leaders. You support your leaders. The bible tells you to do that. I think that no matter who is in office you support them. We're one country. We're all Americans. Even if you didn't vote for him. So these people, Lindsey Vons that don't want to go to the White House. If President Obama or if President Trump invited me to the White House, I'm there. I'm going. Because it's the president of the United States. Melania, I think she's graceful. I think you're right, she speaks five languages. She's very, very smart."

I'm not running for office. First and foremost, I'm a mother and my son needs me here in New York City, and I thought, you can't argue with that."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "EARHARDT",
      "utterance": "Well, I wrote my first book based on these little notes that my dad left next to our cereal bowls, was it saying or scriptures or a poem. And so, I was pregnant with my daughter. And then, when that book, by the grace of god and by our wonderful viewers, the book did really well. And so, the publisher came to me and said what are you going through now? When my child was a year old I said I'm learning so much through my daughter's eyes. Every single day as you know as a mother of three, is such a gift. Every day I'm learning something new from her. I mean, Martha, to see her see rain for the first time, or a dog, or eat a lemon for the first time. Or today, we were at church -- tonight, we're at church decorating ginger bread houses. It's the first time she's ever really tasted any of that candy and she loved it. More candy in her mouth than the ginger bread house. All these things -- I waited so long to have children because I focused on my career, and I was so worried about being a mom and I don't know why."
