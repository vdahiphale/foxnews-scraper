He's going to be on tomorrow to talk about his involvement in the new movie \"Only the Brave\" about the wildfire firefighters that died in Arizona. Do you remember that? And he was also in Vegas last week, visiting victims. So he'll be here to talk about that. But now, my second topic, this is really great. We have a new producer on \"The Five\" named Deb Cody. She's actually been at FOX for a long time, but she's new to us at \"The Five,\" and we are so happy to be able to bring you this story. So it is Breast Cancer Awareness Month. And today, we are highlighting her, because she participated in her first breast cancer walk as a survivor over the weekend. She was diagnosed in October of 2015 with stage two invasive breast cancer. She underwent surgery, five months of chemotherapy, six weeks of radiation treatments and a full year of antibody infusions. She finally finished treatment in March of this year, and over the weekend went home to Massachusetts to walk in the Making Strides American Cancer Society Walk with her close family and friends. And of course, I think you just say, that was her dog, Nick. Her Making Strides team raised almost $10,000 for the American Cancer Society, and she hopes that those funds will help others diagnosed with breast cancer also survive. The one thing she asked of all of us women that are watching: Don't pass up on getting your mammogram. So everybody make that pledge to each other. And I will do the same.",

He said he's going to have an economic develop plan that he announces soon. He said they have the votes right now for health care reform, but they're going to wait a little while. He talked about Cuba. He talked about the tax reform piece as Jesse mentioned. But also was able to talk about the fact that he will have an opiate announcement -- wait on the national emergency for opiate addiction.

I mean, Steve Bannon, the president's former top political advisor, said he's got a war on the GOP establishment. What does he mean by that? He's talking about congress. He's saying that the congress is made up of established Republicans who are not backing this president, and he wants their support.

And the president has been tweeting at the senate majority leader, but then he's standing next to the president who saying, no, we're best friends, this is great. And Mitch McConnell has to be very emotional and confused today, trying to figure out who are his friends? Who are his enemies? Who is he fighting against?

Oops, the Democrats have it. So, you don't want to cut your nose off to spite your face. I think that's what he's saying. He wants to stay in the majority.

That was weird. The platoon was very upset by this. Remember they were on Megyn Kelly's show and said that this guy was not a hero. In fact, he converted to Islam. And he was not going out to tell a U.S. commander that the lack of discipline in his platoon was worrisome. That was a lie. They said he wants to try to talk to the Taliban. That was probably a defense tactic for P.R. reasons. But to be honest, I went to Idaho and I investigated some of the neighbors and some of the friends. That guy is a naive kid.

And by the military's own account, he was badly tortured, like the torture that people went through in terms of POW's during Vietnam. Now Bergdahl says he was not deserting. He says he was going off to talk to a commander about the failures, lack of discipline inside his own platoon. That's what would have been interesting to hear at a trial. But kind of presumptive, oh, he's a bad man. He's a traitor. You know what, I would say let the military talk about Bowe Bergdahl.

What's interesting to me about this is you think about he speaks out on health care, and he speaks about it in a very emotive way. And then the critics, especially the conservative critics, say, \"Oh, he's too emotional. He's not anything to do with substance.\" And then he speaks out about the gun-control issue after Las Vegas and said, \"Oh, he's too emotional. He's too emotional. We shouldn't be discussing it.

And this is an NFL franchise that the city has been begging for, and fans are just not engaged, and they're losing interest. And I think that's what the owners are paying attention to. It's not necessarily the president. Because these Trump supporters came out after the president's comments, \"The ownership fire the SOB players,\" and they said, \"No, no, no, no, no.

However, they already had advance notice about this and let him put together in his contract that for any of these allegations would come forward, as long as he indemnified the company and made them whole from a financial perspective in terms of settlements or anything that, that he was able to keep his job and retain it. Now, not being privy to all of their, you know, financial records and contracts and whatnot, and previous incidents that they're aware of that they documented, I think it's kind of fascinating. Maybe he'll be able to work out a settlement with them, something of that nature. But let's be honest. If he were to be involved and at the helm in any way, it's like, you know, financial death spiral for the company.

He's going to be on tomorrow to talk about his involvement in the new movie \"Only the Brave\" about the wildfire firefighters that died in Arizona. Do you remember that? And he was also in Vegas last week, visiting victims. So he'll be here to talk about that. But now, my second topic, this is really great. We have a new producer on \"The Five\" named Deb Cody. She's actually been at FOX for a long time, but she's new to us at \"The Five,\" and we are so happy to be able to bring you this story. So it is Breast Cancer Awareness Month. And today, we are highlighting her, because she participated in her first breast cancer walk as a survivor over the weekend. She was diagnosed in October of 2015 with stage two invasive breast cancer. She underwent surgery, five months of chemotherapy, six weeks of radiation treatments and a full year of antibody infusions. She finally finished treatment in March of this year, and over the weekend went home to Massachusetts to walk in the Making Strides American Cancer Society Walk with her close family and friends. And of course, I think you just say, that was her dog, Nick. Her Making Strides team raised almost $10,000 for the American Cancer Society, and she hopes that those funds will help others diagnosed with breast cancer also survive."

Take a look at this amazing video taken today of the duchess of Cambridge, Kate Middleton, dancing with Paddington Bear, of course, and delighting children on her return to royal duties after, sadly, suffering acute morning sickness. That does happen to her when she gives birth to royalty. She joined her husband, Prince William, and his brother, Prince Harry, at London's Paddington Station, where they met children from charities that they support. How cute is this?"
