Well, maybe because to them it's not good news. It's actually evil. Yesterday, CNN posted a tweet that said Martin Luther King was a \"socialist before it was cool.\" Now think about that: As capitalism roars on, one of our major news outlets dubbed the Soviet Union's economic plan cool. What a perfect distillation of the adolescent mind-set in today's media and in Hollywood. And what a perfect snapshot of the left. The most discredited economic system ever -- just look at Venezuela -- and yet, to CNN's children that doesn't matter. It's all about being cool. As the Dow soars and 401(K)s grow, they laud a system that ruined millions of lives. So, why are we mincing words anymore? It's not just CNN. Check out the Democratic Party which has all but purged its moderates, now leaving the party to Bernie-loving progressives. It is now the American socialist party -- that's what we should be calling them routinely. Take them at their word. So, as long as the economy is doing great, the media is not going to listen because to them capitalism is just an illusion and an uncool one at that. It's just not like socialism, a dreamy, fluffy ideology that's decimating Venezuela and Cuba as we speak. So how is applauding a system that kills so many Latin-Americans not racist? Because it hurts everyone equally. It's misery is color-blind. Only the media can't see it. That was a really stupid tweet, Dana.",

Here's what I was thinking today just from the communication standpoint, believe or not, before the financial crisis of 2008, the Bush administration had a similar problem. Why won't the media cover the good news in the economy? The unemployment rate was low. The stock market at that point was good. Of course, I understand, believe me. I felt that in September 2008 it all changed. So this is what I think the White House should do, they got to make a choice. They could either win by complaining that the White House should get the coverage and credit that it deserve for all the great economic news out there, or they could show, not tell, and make the media covered it. Because if President Trump left town and he goes and he chooses ten cities to go to in the next 30 days, the media has to cover what he's doing. So, just go and show the banks that's making more loans and the business that's hiring more people. And make them follow him wherever he goes. And then, they wouldn't have much to complain about because they actually would get coverage, not only in the national media but in all of those markets as well.",

Well, maybe because to them it's not good news. It's actually evil. Yesterday, CNN posted a tweet that said Martin Luther King was a \"socialist before it was cool.\" Now think about that: As capitalism roars on, one of our major news outlets dubbed the Soviet Union's economic plan cool. What a perfect distillation of the adolescent mind-set in today's media and in Hollywood. And what a perfect snapshot of the left. The most discredited economic system ever -- just look at Venezuela -- and yet, to CNN's children that doesn't matter. It's all about being cool. As the Dow soars and 401(K)s grow, they laud a system that ruined millions of lives. So, why are we mincing words anymore? It's not just CNN. Check out the Democratic Party which has all but purged its moderates, now leaving the party to Bernie-loving progressives. It is now the American socialist party -- that's what we should be calling them routinely. Take them at their word. So, as long as the economy is doing great, the media is not going to listen because to them capitalism is just an illusion and an uncool one at that. It's just not like socialism, a dreamy, fluffy ideology that's decimating Venezuela and Cuba as we speak. So how is applauding a system that kills so many Latin-Americans not racist? Because it hurts everyone equally. It's misery is color-blind. Only the media can't see it. That was a really stupid tweet, Dana."

      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "Yeah, I think so too. Here's what I was thinking today just from the communication standpoint, believe or not, before the financial crisis of 2008, the Bush administration had a similar problem. Why won't the media cover the good news in the economy? The unemployment rate was low. The stock market at that point was good. Of course, I understand, believe me. I felt that in September 2008 it all changed. So this is what I think the White House should do, they got to make a choice. They could either win by complaining that the White House should get the coverage and credit that it deserve for all the great economic news out there, or they could show, not tell, and make the media covered it. Because if President Trump left town and he goes and he chooses ten cities to go to in the next 30 days, the media has to cover what he's doing. So, just go and show the banks that's making more loans and the business that's hiring more people. And make them follow him wherever he goes. And then, they wouldn't have much to complain about because they actually would get coverage, not only in the national media but in all of those markets as well."

The tax cuts are very helpful as well. Thousand dollar bonuses to millions and millions of workers, that wasn't supposed to happen. Remember those big corporations were supposed to shower the executives with big bonuses. It turns out the workers got bonuses too. At the end of the Obama presidency, we lost 19,000 manufacturing jobs. In 2017, under President Trump, we gained almost 200,000 manufacturing jobs. Those are the types of jobs that Americans want to see come back. As long as we get the wages to keep growing at a stronger pace than they already are, I don't see how he loses reelection."

That, like, a woman is assaulted by a man in a power relationship. Right? Well -- and that women are too scared to come out. Well, she did it anonymously, so she didn't have anything blow back on her. So she wasn't as brave as these other women that came out against Weinstein. And it wasn't a power structure relationship. It was a date. They had no relationship. He couldn't help her; she couldn't help him, wasn't anything. And she stuck around, and there was consensual behavior. So I applaud Banfield and I hope there are more women out there that have the guts to do that."

And bad dates is not in the \"#MeToo\" movement. I think that's pretty clear. Half of the stuff was consensual. She could have left at any time. I said yesterday, bring the slap back.

But it's important to understand that, in terms of corporate America, a lot of this is about the deep pockets of the big companies. And they're afraid of lawsuits, and so they act very aggressively when they hear these reports. And in the past, oftentimes they protected the men at the cost of the women. The women weren't heard or dismissed or treated like, \"Oh, well, you know, this guy's a big moneymaker for us, and we're not going to pay attention to some little lady who was a complaint.\" I think those days are gone. Which is why when people say, \"You know what? This was revenge porn or the '#MeToo' movement's finding the guardrails,\" I've got to tell you, I don't think the \"#MeToo\" movement is anywhere near finding the guardrails. I think that it is roaring at the moment. So you have some people -- and I think that these people did a good thing. I think, for example, Caitlin Flanagan in The Atlantic saying this was revenge porn, I think that made it very clear. She's angry at this guy. She's 23 years old. I would caution everybody to remember that. Very young person. I don't know what she thought was going to go on with this celebrity or she thought he was going to make her, you know, who is that, Meghan Markel, who's now getting married to the prince or whatever. Maybe she had some fantasy, some fairy tale in mind, but she clearly now has tried to damage this guy in a way that I think is not fair to him."

Take a look at this picture. This actually happened to me once. This is Jeffrey Wong. He is the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency's current operations officer. This picture was taken by the A.P. back in July. If you look a little closer, you'll see a sticky note with the password for his computer. Anyway, we called the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency official, our Sean O'Rourke did, and they said that password was for an internal computer application and is no longer in use. I don't want to make fun of this guy, because this happened to me, where FOX \"Red Eye\" did a thing on me and filmed in my office. And I had, like, my Social Security number. I had my password. You leave stuff all over your desk. Don't let people take pictures of your desk. Even if it's a friend who's going to Instagram, because you're going to screw yourself."

Most dog owners apparently said that they would rather hang out with their pets than people. A study shows that -- said that more than half of Americans said they flake out on social events to hang out with their pet. The study was done by Link AKC, creators of a smart collar for dogs that tracks the mental, physical and emotional health of dog ownership. And I think I'm a little guilty."
