      "sentences": "Thank you. Welcome to \"Hannity.\" Buckle up. We start with great news tonight. Game, set, match -- the repulsive, disgusting Schiff show circus is almost over. And, finally, we see the light at the end of the tunnel.  At this hour, very good sources are telling me that the Schumer-Schiff sham show is circling the drain. Can't come soon enough.  Nothing is definite but it appears Senate Majority Leader McConnell now has the votes to block for the witnesses and this whole pointless charade could be wrapped up, hopefully, Friday or Saturday of this week.  Earlier today, Colorado Senator Cory Gardner announced that he will vote against new witnesses, saying he didn't need to hear from an 18th witness to render a verdict. John Bolton is now officially out of the equation being needed as a witness. I'll explain in a minute.  Now, Republicans likely to need just one more vote to put an end to the madness once and for all. And to be honest, well, it could come from the other side of the aisle. There is now high anxiety inside the Democratic Party. Tonight, FoxNews.com reporting that any future any witness agreement would be subject to a package deal. In other words, Bolton gets hauled in, we'll tell you why that doesn't -- that's no longer necessary in a minute. So will two key members of, let's say the Biden syndicate -- quid pro quo Joe, zero experience Hunter.  And as we have documented so many times at a bare minimum, it's a serious appearance of impropriety. We went through all the laws that, well, seem to fit in this case with the Bidens, all felonies.   The president, remember, has a sworn constitutional duty to faithfully execute the laws of this land and that's why he was rightly concerned, not only about Ukrainian election interference, separate and apart from Russian interference, which Devin Nunes warned about. But he's also rightly concerned about quid and pro and quo Joe and not say, oh, like Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders, who happens to be leading in both Iowa and New Hampshire. Let me sum it up for you one more time. This thing is over. It's finished. Everything else will be a mere formality. Now, we know how this will end. The president will be acquitted, and thankfully, in 279 days, we will have an election in this country. As a matter of fact, we have now actually heard from what the Democrats thought would be their latest star witness.   Moments ago, the president tweeted out these words, \"game over\". Along with the words, he sent out a video. 2019, John Bolton praising the president's phone call -- yes, the one in question -- with Ukraine. Let's take a look.",

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "sentences": "Sounds almost verbatim the president's description of the call and what we all read with the transcript. Did you hear any quid, or pro or quos like Joe there? Did you hear any dire warnings about misconduct or abuse of power? Did you hear any complaints or consternation at all?  The answer is no.  Now, that brings me to Mitt Romney tonight. As I said last night, I thought hard as many of you did, he would have been the better candidate and I think we were proven right if he won his election in 2012. I defended him against the left's smears. I did it because it was the right thing to do. He was the better candidate.  They called him a racist. They called him a sexist. They called him a misogynist. They accused him of abusing animals even -- lies, smears -- and even cutting some kid's hair.   Mitt Romney said earlier in the week that he would likely want to hear from John Bolton. Well, we have now heard everything, we need to hear from John Bolton in his own words and even if the president privately said that he wanted Ukraine to do A or B or C for the aid, there are four facts Jim Jordan reminds us every time. They will never change. No linkage between aid and investigations during the phone call. Aid was never mentioned during the phone call, but the issue of corruption was brought up. The president was clearly concerned. It was top of mind. We know President Zelensky, repeatedly, and President Trump have both denied ever any pressure in any shape, matter, and form. No one in Ukraine even knew there was a temporary pause on aid at the time of the call or long after the call.  And Ukraine -- here's the important part, did they do anything? Did they take any action to get the aid released? None. Zero. Nothing.  Did they announce they would do something? Nothing. They announced nothing, never, ever, and they still got the money. So, even if the president thought it, even if he said it, may be thinking about it, it doesn't matter. It's what he did.   Senator Romney, I say to you tonight, it is time for you to put aside what is clearly a personal disdain, dislike for the president, and you need to do this for the sake of the country, and, frankly, for your sworn duties of the Constitution of the United States. Now, forget about your opinions about the president. They're irrelevant. You need that document right there. You need to think about your constitutional role and duty as a senator.  Remember, the House and the Constitution has the sole power to impeach the president. They did it. Now, they presented their very pathetically weak case.  OK, now you're asking 16 hours worth of questions. Your duty, the sole Senate -- the sole role of the Senate is to examine the evidence, render a verdict. Now, you just heard from John Bolton. And keep in mind, Senator Romney, I know you represent the great state of Utah. Take a look at this survey put together by -- well, he's one of the few people. I've known Matt Towery since the Gingrich polling years.   And Matt Towery was one of the few people that said, it's on video, I've got a copy, that Donald Trump was going to win. Not many pollsters were saying this, 68 percent. He did a poll of Utah last night.  If your constituents in Utah, they want President Trump acquitted -- 64 percent oppose additional witnesses, 60 percent would be less likely to support you if you voted to keep the charade going and call for witnesses. By the way, think about all those Democrats that are asking you to trust them. Think about who's begging for witnesses. There he is. The compromised, in this particular case, corrupt, and we all know, congenital liar by the name of Adam Schiff.  How could anyone in good conscience ever trust what is really a pretty despicable sociopath?  Now, Schiff's pants had been on fire for three consecutive years. He's lied about Russia, Russia, Russia, collusion, collusion, FISA. He lied about the FISA application and the Ukraine phone call. He lied about the whistle- blower. And he even lied more today. In fact, we just got him red-handed today, lying again about the call transcript between the president, President Trump and President Zelensky.  Take a look.",

Compromising materials. What? Really? What are they? Pictures of Trump. Did Vladimir see them? Can we have them? That would be Adam Schiff.   Now, the president didn't say, by the way, in the transcript, even though, yes, Schiff had to make that up too. He didn't say, do me a favor. He said, do us a favor. He said, in relation to the United States.  And, of course, we have Politico and the Ukrainian court -- well, they both determined that there was election interference by the Ukrainians to help Hillary Clinton. They said it. By the way, interference that we were all worked up about for three long years, foreign interference. Look at Politico, reports right here. It takes 22 minutes to read it, when (ph) it says 22 minutes. But, naturally, that was only one of many lies today from the congenital liar.  Now, this is pretty amazing. One truly bizarre example from earlier today, yes, the congenital liar, Schiff, actually doubled down on a lie that has previously earned him four Pinocchio's from the liberal Washington Post. For a Democrat, that's hard to get. And despite the mountain of evidence that Schiff's staff communicated with the fake whistle-blower from the get-go -- well, the congenital liar still claiming that he had no idea with the person is.

Now, there's nothing legitimate about this charade. There never has been.  The Senate ought never lend any legitimacy to this corrupt process. You've got Schiff, his top investigation, witness audition, that was a farce. Zero due process.  The accusations are untrue. They have been untrue. The articles are ridiculous and unconstitutional.

And, by the way, this is all they've done for three years. They've done not a single thing for we, the people. They're supposed to be public servants. Earlier today, Pelosi's, well, friend in the Senate, Chucky Schumer, he actually admitted the guy that is now indicted by Southern District of New York for taking, for all things, a million dollars from Russia and trying to hide it, another campaign finance violations. He actually invited Lev Parnas as a special guest and Lev Parnas briefly became a far left hero because of his wild allegations against Trump.  And, unfortunately, for Schumer, he is out on bail for the violations of campaign finance and trying to hide the million dollar payment from of all countries, Russia. And he couldn't get in, because he's wearing an electronic ankle bracelet. This is their star witness. This is what Adam Schiff said, believe him, but Joe and Hunter did nothing.

The criteria that have been set out are so loose (ph), they basically paraphrase Congresswoman Maxine Waters who said, there is no law. Anything the House wants to do to impeach is impeachable. That's what's happened today. That places the House of Representatives above the law. We've heard much about no one is above the law. The House of Representatives is not above the law. They may not use the Maxine Waters. Gerald Ford made the same point, but it was about impeaching of a judge. Judges are different. There are many of them. There's only one president. But to use that criteria that it's whatever the House says it is, whatever the Senate says it is, turns those bodies into lawless bodies, in violation of the intent of the Framers. Manager Schiff confused my argument when he talked about intent and motive. You've said I'm not a constitutional law -- you (ph) admitted I'm a criminal lawyer. And I taught criminal law for 50 years at Harvard. And there's an enormous distinction between intent and motive. Somebody shoot somebody, the intent is that when you pull the trigger, you know bullet will leave and will hit somebody and they kill them. That is the intent to kill. Motive can be revenge. It could be money. It almost never is taken under consideration, except in extreme cases. There are cases where motive counts. But let's consider a hypothetical growing out of the situation that we've discussed. Let's assume that President Obama had been told by his advisors that it really is important to send lethal weapons to the Ukraine. But then, he gets a call from his pollster and his political advisor who says, we know it's in the national interest to send lethal weapons to Ukraine, but we're telling you that the left wing of your party is really going to give you a hard time if you start selling lethal weapons and getting into a lethal war, potentially, with Russia. Would anybody here suggest that was impeachable? Or let's assume President Obama said, I promise to bomb Syria if they had chemical weapons, but I'm now told by my pollsters that bombing Syria would hurt my electoral chances. Certainly not impeachable at all. So, let me apply that to the current situation. As you know, I said previously, there are three levels of possible motive. One is the motive is pure. Only interest is in the way -- what's good for the country. In the real world, that rarely happens. The other one is the motive is completely corrupt. I want money, kickback. But then, there's the third one that's so complicated and that's often misunderstood. When you have a mixed motive, a motive in which you think you're doing good for the country but you're also doing good for yourself. You're doing good for me. You're doing good for thee, you're doing good, and you altogether put it into a bundle in which you're satisfied that you're doing absolutely the right thing. Let me give you a perfect example of that from the case. The argument has been made that the president of the United States only became interested in corruption when he learned that Joe Biden was running for president. Let's assume hypothetically that the president was in his second term and he said to himself, you know, Joe Biden is running for president. I really should now be concerned about whether his son is corrupt, because he's not only a candidate, but he's not running against me, I'm finished with my term, but he could be the president of the United States. And if he's the president of the United States and he has a corrupt son, the fact that he's announced his candidacy is a very good reason for upping the interest in his son. If he wasn't running for president, he's a has- been. He's the former vice president of the United States. OK, big deal. But if he's running for president, that's an enormous big deal. So, the difference the House managers would make is whether the president is in his first term or second term. Whether he's running for reelection or not running for reelection. I think they will have to concede that he was not running for reelection. This would not be a corrupt motive, or it would be a mixed motive but leaning on the side of national interest. If he is running for reelection, suddenly, that turns it into an impeachable offense.",

Now, Sidney Powell is stating that there was a conflict of interest with his previous attorneys. She is going to be taking them on as well in this motion. And just breaking hours ago, actually the Department of Justice backtracked once again their request to the court. Just several weeks ago, the Department of Justice actually stated that they wanted to give prison time for Flynn. They requested up to six months. Now, they're backing away from that again, saying that he had served his country honorably and that he should just be getting probation.

      "utterance": "Thank you. Welcome to \"Hannity.\" Buckle up. We start with great news tonight. Game, set, match -- the repulsive, disgusting Schiff show circus is almost over. And, finally, we see the light at the end of the tunnel. At this hour, very good sources are telling me that the Schumer-Schiff sham show is circling the drain. Can't come soon enough. Nothing is definite but it appears Senate Majority Leader McConnell now has the votes to block for the witnesses and this whole pointless charade could be wrapped up, hopefully, Friday or Saturday of this week. Earlier today, Colorado Senator Cory Gardner announced that he will vote against new witnesses, saying he didn't need to hear from an 18th witness to render a verdict. John Bolton is now officially out of the equation being needed as a witness. I'll explain in a minute. Now, Republicans likely to need just one more vote to put an end to the madness once and for all. And to be honest, well, it could come from the other side of the aisle. There is now high anxiety inside the Democratic Party. Tonight, FoxNews.com reporting that any future any witness agreement would be subject to a package deal. In other words, Bolton gets hauled in, we'll tell you why that doesn't -- that's no longer necessary in a minute. So will two key members of, let's say the Biden syndicate -- quid pro quo Joe, zero experience Hunter. And as we have documented so many times at a bare minimum, it's a serious appearance of impropriety. We went through all the laws that, well, seem to fit in this case with the Bidens, all felonies. The president, remember, has a sworn constitutional duty to faithfully execute the laws of this land and that's why he was rightly concerned, not only about Ukrainian election interference, separate and apart from Russian interference, which Devin Nunes warned about. But he's also rightly concerned about quid and pro and quo Joe and not say, oh, like Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders, who happens to be leading in both Iowa and New Hampshire. Let me sum it up for you one more time. This thing is over. It's finished. Everything else will be a mere formality. Now, we know how this will end. The president will be acquitted, and thankfully, in 279 days, we will have an election in this country. As a matter of fact, we have now actually heard from what the Democrats thought would be their latest star witness. Moments ago, the president tweeted out these words, \"game over\". Along with the words, he sent out a video. 2019, John Bolton praising the president's phone call -- yes, the one in question -- with Ukraine. Let's take a look."

      "utterance": "I will be meeting President Zelensky. He and President Trump have already spoken twice. The president called to congratulate President Zelensky on his election and then on his success in the parliamentary election. They were very warm and cordial calls. We're hoping that they'll be able to meet in Warsaw and have a few minutes together because the success of Ukraine, maintaining its freedom, its system of representative government, free market economy free of a corruption and dealing with the problems of the Donbas and the Crimea are high priorities here, obviously, but high priorities for the United States as well."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Sounds almost verbatim the president's description of the call and what we all read with the transcript. Did you hear any quid, or pro or quos like Joe there? Did you hear any dire warnings about misconduct or abuse of power? Did you hear any complaints or consternation at all? The answer is no. Now, that brings me to Mitt Romney tonight. As I said last night, I thought hard as many of you did, he would have been the better candidate and I think we were proven right if he won his election in 2012. I defended him against the left's smears. I did it because it was the right thing to do. He was the better candidate. They called him a racist. They called him a sexist. They called him a misogynist. They accused him of abusing animals even -- lies, smears -- and even cutting some kid's hair. Mitt Romney said earlier in the week that he would likely want to hear from John Bolton. Well, we have now heard everything, we need to hear from John Bolton in his own words and even if the president privately said that he wanted Ukraine to do A or B or C for the aid, there are four facts Jim Jordan reminds us every time. They will never change. No linkage between aid and investigations during the phone call. Aid was never mentioned during the phone call, but the issue of corruption was brought up. The president was clearly concerned. It was top of mind. We know President Zelensky, repeatedly, and President Trump have both denied ever any pressure in any shape, matter, and form. No one in Ukraine even knew there was a temporary pause on aid at the time of the call or long after the call. And Ukraine -- here's the important part, did they do anything? Did they take any action to get the aid released? None. Zero. Nothing. Did they announce they would do something? Nothing. They announced nothing, never, ever, and they still got the money. So, even if the president thought it, even if he said it, may be thinking about it, it doesn't matter. It's what he did. Senator Romney, I say to you tonight, it is time for you to put aside what is clearly a personal disdain, dislike for the president, and you need to do this for the sake of the country, and, frankly, for your sworn duties of the Constitution of the United States. Now, forget about your opinions about the president. They're irrelevant. You need that document right there. You need to think about your constitutional role and duty as a senator. Remember, the House and the Constitution has the sole power to impeach the president. They did it. Now, they presented their very pathetically weak case. OK, now you're asking 16 hours worth of questions. Your duty, the sole Senate -- the sole role of the Senate is to examine the evidence, render a verdict. Now, you just heard from John Bolton. And keep in mind, Senator Romney, I know you represent the great state of Utah. Take a look at this survey put together by -- well, he's one of the few people. I've known Matt Towery since the Gingrich polling years. And Matt Towery was one of the few people that said, it's on video, I've got a copy, that Donald Trump was going to win. Not many pollsters were saying this, 68 percent. He did a poll of Utah last night. If your constituents in Utah, they want President Trump acquitted -- 64 percent oppose additional witnesses, 60 percent would be less likely to support you if you voted to keep the charade going and call for witnesses. By the way, think about all those Democrats that are asking you to trust them. Think about who's begging for witnesses. There he is. The compromised, in this particular case, corrupt, and we all know, congenital liar by the name of Adam Schiff. How could anyone in good conscience ever trust what is really a pretty despicable sociopath? Now, Schiff's pants had been on fire for three consecutive years. He's lied about Russia, Russia, Russia, collusion, collusion, FISA. He lied about the FISA application and the Ukraine phone call. He lied about the whistle- blower. And he even lied more today. In fact, we just got him red-handed today, lying again about the call transcript between the president, President Trump and President Zelensky. Take a look."

      "utterance": "And he lied in his report to the American people. Now, we know, because of the inspector general report, he lied and Congressman Devin Nunes told the truth. The bulk of the information was the dirty, unverifiable dossier from Russia that Hillary paid for. We also he's the only American that we know on tape thinking he's talking to a Russian, colluding to get dirt on Donald Trump to use in an election. You know, remember, what do you have? Compromising materials. What? Really? What are they? Pictures of Trump. Did Vladimir see them? Can we have them? That would be Adam Schiff. Now, the president didn't say, by the way, in the transcript, even though, yes, Schiff had to make that up too. He didn't say, do me a favor. He said, do us a favor. He said, in relation to the United States. And, of course, we have Politico and the Ukrainian court -- well, they both determined that there was election interference by the Ukrainians to help Hillary Clinton. They said it. By the way, interference that we were all worked up about for three long years, foreign interference. Look at Politico, reports right here. It takes 22 minutes to read it, when (ph) it says 22 minutes. But, naturally, that was only one of many lies today from the congenital liar. Now, this is pretty amazing. One truly bizarre example from earlier today, yes, the congenital liar, Schiff, actually doubled down on a lie that has previously earned him four Pinocchio's from the liberal Washington Post. For a Democrat, that's hard to get. And despite the mountain of evidence that Schiff's staff communicated with the fake whistle-blower from the get-go -- well, the congenital liar still claiming that he had no idea with the person is.

Now, if the congenital liar is not going to hide, then why did he refuse to call the hearsay whistle-blower, non-whistle-blower in for testimony, which he originally promised to do? Why did he admit there was contact with his staff with the whistle-blower? Now, this was a witch hunt that has been led totally completely by him, a deranged liar, and all his fellow Democrats that hate Trump every second, every minute, every hour of every day. Now, there's nothing legitimate about this charade. There never has been. The Senate ought never lend any legitimacy to this corrupt process. You've got Schiff, his top investigation, witness audition, that was a farce. Zero due process. The accusations are untrue. They have been untrue. The articles are ridiculous and unconstitutional.

He actually invited Lev Parnas as a special guest and Lev Parnas briefly became a far left hero because of his wild allegations against Trump. And, unfortunately, for Schumer, he is out on bail for the violations of campaign finance and trying to hide the million dollar payment from of all countries, Russia.

So, if they want to drag this out another month or two, they have an opportunity to do it, but it would be pretty stupid. The country is already opposed to dragging it out. The country said it's over. David Axelrod, who was a key person for Barack Obama, had a recent column and said, he sat through a focus group of Democrats in Chicago and it was 80 minutes, 8-0 minutes before any of them mentioned the impeachment, at which point everyone in the group said, that's over, it's not going to happen, I don't want to talk about it. And Axelrod said, Democrats need to understand, this is not working. The Democrats ought to be voting to have no more witnesses. The Democrats, frankly, want to vote to close it down tomorrow. Every day this goes on, the Democrats look smaller, more political, more destructive of America, and I think that there's no reason to have any more witnesses, because there's no case.

Are the allegations rising to the level that you would deprive the American people of the person they elected as president? Now, I don't think a single one of the Republicans believes that Donald Trump is going to be convicted. So I think it is an absolute game (ph) for any of them to vote yes to have more witnesses, because the witnesses aren't going to change anything. This is not an impeachable offense. We have a very good way of solving it. It's called an election, as you pointed out. In 279 days, the real jury, the American people, will get to decide. My hunch is that we're going to reelect Trump by an amazing margin. But what Schiff said the other day was very chilling. He said, we can't let this up to the voters. Because he is such an arrogant elitist, he thinks he is more important than the American people. And that's what's at stake here.

I think that the result has been that they further alienated the Republican senators, and I think they have now weakened their position with a number of other Democrats.

    {
      "speaker": "DERSHOWITZ",
      "utterance": "-- that were good enough for us during the Clinton impeachment that seemed to have changed dramatically in the current situation. The criteria that have been set out are so loose (ph), they basically paraphrase Congresswoman Maxine Waters who said, there is no law. Anything the House wants to do to impeach is impeachable. That's what's happened today. That places the House of Representatives above the law. We've heard much about no one is above the law. The House of Representatives is not above the law. They may not use the Maxine Waters. Gerald Ford made the same point, but it was about impeaching of a judge. Judges are different. There are many of them. There's only one president. But to use that criteria that it's whatever the House says it is, whatever the Senate says it is, turns those bodies into lawless bodies, in violation of the intent of the Framers. Manager Schiff confused my argument when he talked about intent and motive. You've said I'm not a constitutional law -- you (ph) admitted I'm a criminal lawyer. And I taught criminal law for 50 years at Harvard. And there's an enormous distinction between intent and motive. Somebody shoot somebody, the intent is that when you pull the trigger, you know bullet will leave and will hit somebody and they kill them. That is the intent to kill. Motive can be revenge. It could be money. It almost never is taken under consideration, except in extreme cases. There are cases where motive counts. But let's consider a hypothetical growing out of the situation that we've discussed. Let's assume that President Obama had been told by his advisors that it really is important to send lethal weapons to the Ukraine. But then, he gets a call from his pollster and his political advisor who says, we know it's in the national interest to send lethal weapons to Ukraine, but we're telling you that the left wing of your party is really going to give you a hard time if you start selling lethal weapons and getting into a lethal war, potentially, with Russia. Would anybody here suggest that was impeachable? Or let's assume President Obama said, I promise to bomb Syria if they had chemical weapons, but I'm now told by my pollsters that bombing Syria would hurt my electoral chances. Certainly not impeachable at all. So, let me apply that to the current situation. As you know, I said previously, there are three levels of possible motive. One is the motive is pure. Only interest is in the way -- what's good for the country. In the real world, that rarely happens. The other one is the motive is completely corrupt. I want money, kickback. But then, there's the third one that's so complicated and that's often misunderstood. When you have a mixed motive, a motive in which you think you're doing good for the country but you're also doing good for yourself. You're doing good for me. You're doing good for thee, you're doing good, and you altogether put it into a bundle in which you're satisfied that you're doing absolutely the right thing. Let me give you a perfect example of that from the case. The argument has been made that the president of the United States only became interested in corruption when he learned that Joe Biden was running for president. Let's assume hypothetically that the president was in his second term and he said to himself, you know, Joe Biden is running for president. I really should now be concerned about whether his son is corrupt, because he's not only a candidate, but he's not running against me, I'm finished with my term, but he could be the president of the United States. And if he's the president of the United States and he has a corrupt son, the fact that he's announced his candidacy is a very good reason for upping the interest in his son. If he wasn't running for president, he's a has- been. He's the former vice president of the United States. OK, big deal. But if he's running for president, that's an enormous big deal. So, the difference the House managers would make is whether the president is in his first term or second term. Whether he's running for reelection or not running for reelection. I think they will have to concede that he was not running for reelection. This would not be a corrupt motive, or it would be a mixed motive but leaning on the side of national interest. If he is running for reelection, suddenly, that turns it into an impeachable offense."

It's violative -- and it becomes bribery, or extortion or some kind of high crime and misdemeanor. The reality is, and the point that Mr. Dershowitz just made which is so good, is that you can't contextualize it that way. If someone has committed a corrupt act, they're not above the law. And so, you have -- you're entitled to investigate.

And just breaking hours ago, actually the Department of Justice backtracked once again their request to the court. Just several weeks ago, the Department of Justice actually stated that they wanted to give prison time for Flynn. They requested up to six months. Now, they're backing away from that again, saying that he had served his country honorably and that he should just be getting probation. According to sources that I've spoken with, it seems like the Department of Justice prosecutors in this case are a little worried that Flynn's motion to withdraw his guilty plea will actually go through and that there would be a call for a new trial."

Even today, Sean, from the well of the United States Senate, Adam Schiff lied to millions of Americans who were tuning in, saying that there was no coordination with the whistle-blower. We know that there's coordination between Adam Schiff, his staff, and the whistle-blower before the whistle- blower complaint was even issued.

So, that's why we need to have not further witnesses, we need to adhere to the record with some sense of order and justice.

So, Lemon last night -- and, by the way, we don't call for boycotts, firing, as they do us, is -- listen, Don, with all due respect, this is a half-hearted non-apology, and sinking your credibility even further. You've got to own it. You laughed at all of it. You enjoyed all of it. Just a fact. Here with reaction, Tammy Bruce, Jason Chaffetz. Tammy, your reaction, because that didn't seem like an apology to me. And that seemed like laughter -- making fun of we, the people, old people, them lines (ph), and you know - really?"

      "speaker": "TAMMY BRUCE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Yes, this is why as many have said, Donald Trump is president. The American people saw this kind of ridicule and contempt throughout the political elites, throughout the media class, and we've had enough. This is not a one-off dynamic. This is really a bit of a snapshot on what the establishment does think of the average American, not even just Donald Trump voters, but they've convinced themselves that they are so much more superior, and they do it by ridiculing Americans like this. And when we see that -- and already, the GOP has made a commercial of this. It's online. It's pretty powerful. And at the end, it says, they think you're a joke. You know, prove them wrong, right, in November? And so, this is really a \"made for Trump commercial\" it's for anyone who had to be reminded about Hillary's deplorables comment. She wasn't a one- off. This is not a one-off. This is what they think about the American people, and it's why this reformation was necessary. It's why they hate Donald Trump, because he actually likes -- he likes us."

      "speaker": "JASON CHAFFETZ, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "It didn't sound like there was anything wrong there. And if he did think there was something wrong, I think there is a duty and obligation to say so. But we can all read the transcript ourselves. How many times on this program have we highlighted the idea that Donald Trump did the unexpected and he just released the transcript? Everybody can go out and read there. You know what other big question is out there I want the Democrats to answer? Who is the victim in all this? Who -- where is the so-called victim? There is none. They have been working on this impeachment for three years. They've got nothing and they are on the verge of embarrassing themselves, and I think it will be a bipartisan vote to acquit Donald Trump."

      "speaker": "BRUCE",
      "utterance": "Yes, I think that this is what people forget, of course, is that these audiotapes are forever. The Internet makes everything forever. In the old days, the establishment was able to maintain control by making sure we didn't hear things like that, that there wasn't a history. I think that Jason is right, of course, and the good news is that, no longer -- let's just say, it's harder to gaslight the American people. We know what they're doing. The polls show that we don't like what's occurring here and we've got to make our feelings known, of course, in November. But I think it's going to be fun and I think the president's then, obviously, he is being saved by the fact that he's done a great job."
