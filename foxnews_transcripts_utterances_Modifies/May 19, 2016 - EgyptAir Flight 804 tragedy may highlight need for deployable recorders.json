Joining us Former Chairman of the NTSB Jim Hall, who led the NTSB during the investigations of TWA-800 and EgyptAir Flight 990. Jim, I have been looking forward to speaking to you all evening. Tell us right now, if you are heading up this investigation, what steps would you take and what will be the most important evidence to try to recover?",
