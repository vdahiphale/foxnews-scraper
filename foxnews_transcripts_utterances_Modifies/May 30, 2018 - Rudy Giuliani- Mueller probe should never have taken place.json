Coming up later tonight, I have a mini monologue responding directly to Roseanne Barr's comments on Twitter and the ABC decision to cancel her show.  But first, a lot of breaking news tonight. The Attorney General Jeff Sessions tonight in the hot seat and rightfully so.  In a few minutes, we're going to put Sessions' absurd decision that has impacted this country to recuse himself from the Russia investigation under our microscope, also explain why the former senator, he never should have accepted the job as America's top cop in the first place, knowing the next day he was going to recuse himself. We have a lot of analysis to bring you surrounding what the president is calling, rightfully, spygate. That's right. Spies in the Trump campaign, just like real life to real judges and real FISA courts. Now, this is the biggest political scandal in American history.  But today, the House Oversight Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy apparently doesn't get it. He's actually defending the FBI's use of spies in its overall investigation into Russia collusion. We'll tell Trey Gowdy why he's wrong. And we'll also remind everyone watching just why the spygate case, the FISA abuse, the bias, the leaking, the lying, the deception from Comey, Mueller, and his merry band of Democratic donors has weaponized our system of justice against your duly elected president. Now, with Mueller's runaway investigation on day 378, not a single shred of evidence President Trump and even some top Democrats worried that Americans are getting sick of the seemingly endless fishing expedition.  And finally, tonight, we'll bring all the breaking news about Secretary of State Mike Pompeo incredible meeting with a top North Korean official in New York City.   But it's time for our very important, fast-paced breaking news opening monologue.",

He had just been appointed by President Trump and just confirmed by his former peers in the U.S. Senate, he vowed to uphold the law of the land as America's top cop. Without skipping a beat, Sessions stunned President Trump, the entire political world, he decided to recuse himself from the single biggest, most important case facing not only the administration but the entire country -- the ongoing so called Russia collusion investigation. So, we have the country's top lawyer immediately recusing himself from the single most pressing legal case without any prior warning to President Trump or those who confirmed him to the U.S. Senate.

      "sentences": "Yes, career people.  What former senator and Attorney General Sessions did at this point is so harmful, the ramifications so massive, his decision that day, the day after he's confirmed is playing out today and it's hurting the country. And according to Fox News legal analyst, our friend Gregg Jarrett, who will join us soon, the attorney general used a completely illegitimate justification for his refusal. Sessions, remember, he cited that he was required to recuse himself under U.S. Code Federal Regulations 28 CFR 45.2, because of an ongoing criminal investigation. However, at the time of Sessions' recusal, there was no rush of collusion criminal investigation. It was a counterintelligence inquiry. In fact, the criminal investigation only started after Sessions' recusal upon the appointment of the special counsel Robert Mueller, and here we are today.  And now, Robert Mueller is even reportedly investigating now, he's desperate, he's panicking, he knows this is blowing up, a meeting that took place between Trump and Sessions that took place shortly after the president was blindsided by the his own attorney general's decision to recuse himself on day one.  Does anyone really expect a sitting U.S. president not to question his brand-new attorney general's decision to sit on the sidelines recuse himself the day after he is literally confirmed in a case when he has taken the job the next day? And, by the way, the president can order an attorney general as Gregg Jarrett told us last night to indictment, to make an indictment, not make an indictment, to investigate or not investigate something. So, there's frankly nothing unusual or illegal about this meeting. We'll have full analysis and wellborn the Mueller issue in a moment.  But tonight, we have so many other important lingering questions for the Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Why didn't he tell anybody the likelihood that he was going to recuse himself before he was confirmed or before he was appointed? How in good faith can an attorney general act without participating in the single-most pressing legal case facing this country, facing this administration? And now we can all see the damage of Mueller's witch hunt investigation and what it is -- a flawed witch-hunt.   Why he should as we have talked about months and months ago unrecusal himself immediately. This time, he would be following the correct law. Without a doubt when the Attorney General sessions whom I have personally always liked and respected -- what he has done here has now left this administration and country more exposed to the deep state that has been working against the president you elected since the very beginning. This last week, we learned that at least one informant likely more working in coordination with the Obama Justice Department actively infiltrating the Trump campaign, spying on a multitude of people associated with then-candidate Trump's election efforts. And here's what two of the men who were spied on had to say on this program right here last night. Take a look.",

      "sentences": "Lying to FISA judges repeatedly, not telling the FISA judges, not corroborating, not verifying, not telling FISA court judges, getting warrants, spying on Trump campaign associates, all of this happened. And you know something, now we got spies that we're discovering that we're in the Trump campaign and as much as the media says, oh, it's not actually spying, it's an informant. You just heard for the three men that were approached by the so-called informant who's really a spy to tell them and seek out information because of this witch hunt that began as we now know in the spring of 2016. I mean, I've listened to Chairman Gowdy today, who frankly I agree with on a lot of issues. He tried to play down with the president is rightly calling spygate. Let's make this very simple. Here are the basic, thesaurus definitions of the term spy, for all of you people in Congress even those of you that claim to be lawyers. A secret or undercover agent, that's a spy.   So, make no mistake -- this mistake, the Trump campaign was spied on. A secret agent working with Obama's Justice Department monitoring conversation and activities of many Trump campaign associates. He had just heard directly from the individuals who were spied on and actively targeted by the spy.  And Chairman Gowdy praising the FBI's overall handling of the Russian probe? No, Chairman Gowdy, look at McCabe, look at Comey, look at Strzok, look at Page, look at Loretta Lynch, look at all the others that abuse their power. So, we got to get this right. The FBI literally -- under fired FBI director which the president had every right to do, Rod Rosenstein himself recommended, James Comey's direction used Hillary Clinton's bought and paid for dirty dossier, full of Russian lies put together by a foreign agent and illegally convinced FISA judges because they're supposed to verify and corroborate to authorize a wiretap against the Trump campaign associate in the lead up to a campaign, all while the Obama administration is unmasking the names of American citizens caught up in other surveillance at what is a 350 percent increase from any prior year and while the FBI was using spies to monitor at least four people associated with the Trump campaign.  Chairman Gowdy, are you keeping up?  And let's not forget, after James Comey was fired for mishandling the Clinton investigation, Comey illegally leaked documents. He wanted to prompt the appointment of a special prosecutor because his BFF Robert Mueller who then appointed, let's see, the most corrupt, the most dishonest merry band of anti-Trump Democratic donors -- those people who are now doing everything in their power and have been to take this president down. How do you ever trust any special counsel that would hire Andrew \"the pitbull\" Weissmann? How would you ever trust them?  Let's see. He lost tens of thousands of Americans their job and Andersen Accounting, overturned Supreme Court 9-0, put four innocent Merrill executives in jail for a year and that was overturned by the Fifth Circuit. You want him investigating you? Any congressman out there? Give me a call. There are so many brave public servants that are doing important work in the FBI, in the CIA, in our intelligence community. Some very high-ranking.   But we have now discovered abuse of power, bad apples that have a political agenda that are hell-bent on destroying this president, delegitimizing him and literally ruining the vote of the American people. And, by the way, in their eyes, this was the man that was never supposed to be president and they were counting on it.  There are fears that Mueller's ongoing witch-hunt will influence the midterm elections. I believe this is a legitimate concern. Former New York City mayor, current Trump attorney, Rudy Giuliani, who is with us tonight will join us live in a little bit weighed in on this very issue earlier today. Take a look.",

That Judge Ellis was dead on accurate. And according to a new poll from CBS News, a majority of you the American people, you are rightly now already skeptical of Mueller's efforts, believing that the special counsel's investigation is what it is, politically motivated. While this off-the-rails Russia so-called collusion investigation rolls on way past, way beyond any mandate they ever had, while the president of the United States -- well, he actually has real work to get done, including the negotiations with North Korea. Already, the president has secured the release of several hostages once held captive in North Korea. Kim Jong Un, he's no longer firing missiles over Japan and threatening Guam and the entire Korean peninsula or threatening the United States. The nuclear tests have halted. He crossed the DMZ. And hours ago, a top North Korean official landed right here in New York City for a meeting with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. The two men just finished a working dinner. And according to Pompeo, the meeting went great -- a historic meeting between Trump and Kim Jong Un is now still in the works. It may happen on time.

He could have supervised that investigation, stayed in touch with it, been aware of it and even if criminal matters came up, he would not necessarily have had to recuse himself. In fact, we now know that it remains basically a counterintelligence investigation, and the only thing that Mueller wants to do is interview the president of the United States for no good reason in order to get evidence so he can refer to the House of Representatives.

So, as you know by now, over the weekend comedienne Roseanne Barr tweeted out some outrageous, not funny, by her admission, inappropriate over-the-line remarks about former Obama aide Valerie Jarrett. In response, we all now that ABC has cancelled the reboot of Roseanne, the sitcom. Tonight, I'm going to respond to Roseanne Barr's tweet, and I also highlight what is a sad but all too obvious double standard in the country where it appears that only conservatives are held accountable for their words, their reaction, while those on the left never seem to face consequences for outright racism, bigotry or sexism. That's tonight's important mini monologue. We know this week Roseanne Barr, she rightly apologized for her comments, terrible comments about Valerie Jarrett. She on to say that no one should defend her in light of what happened. Roseanne was right to apologize. But, I would argue we all have to look at this moment and do better as a country. In other words, we've got to respect all races, all creeds, all background. Roseanne is a public figure. Her public comments did in fact hurt innocent people and she is facing consequences for her actions. Now, she can say it on her own time, but ABC has their own decision making what they want to do. We also should all feel bad. A lot of innocent people lost their jobs in all of these. They have families, they have mortgages, they have rent payments, they have car payments, they have other expenses, college, kids to worry about. Now, of course, Roseanne is not the first public figure thou to make outrageous comments, and she even admits she's been held rightly accountable. So many despicable comments though and actions from those on the left appeared to go completely unnoticed. There's a huge double standard. In fact, many get a free pass no matter what they say or what they do, including a former writer that's actually on Roseanne's show, comedienne Wanda Sykes, before the show was cancelled. Remember Sykes announced that she was quitting the show to protest Roseanne Barr's tweet? But, Sykes herself has issued outrageous, extremely racial tweets including this one. White people, they don't steal wallets, they steal countries. And, of course, Sykes never faced any career-ending backlash from that tweet. And let's not forget about another ABC employee, our old friend Jimmy Kimmel. Remember, he was on Comedy Central, he often -- he even dressed up in black face. Take a look at this.",

Former Arizona sheriff, Joe Arpaio, quote, you and POTUS can go bleep yourselves, you racist Nazi bleep. Yeah, Iger just hired him to go back to ESPN. Good luck with that. Now, we turn our attention to NBC News. Last night they ran a special entitled, Everyday Racism in America, one of the host that was featured Joy Reid. You might remember Reid recently came under fire for outrageous blog posts. She denied the allegation claiming without proof that the internet had been hacked and the firestorm completely goes away. Everyone on the left they just accepted what was really a bizarre explanation. NBC also frequently features -- there he is, the Reverend Al Sharpton, on issues of race and social justice. The same Al Sharpton, you may remember said all of these things.",

The point is, this is the vice chair of the central committee, Kim Yong Chol, very close to Kim Jong Un.

You can see right there, Kim Yong Chol, vice chair of the central committee, very close to Kim Jong Un. Bottom line is tonight's dinner with the U.S. secretary of state kicks off two days of meetings. They'll be meeting in New York City all day tomorrow, you could see them there.

The Attorney General Jeff Sessions tonight in the hot seat and rightfully so. In a few minutes, we're going to put Sessions' absurd decision that has impacted this country to recuse himself from the Russia investigation under our microscope, also explain why the former senator, he never should have accepted the job as America's top cop in the first place, knowing the next day he was going to recuse himself. We have a lot of analysis to bring you surrounding what the president is calling, rightfully, spygate. That's right. Spies in the Trump campaign, just like real life to real judges and real FISA courts. Now, this is the biggest political scandal in American history. But today, the House Oversight Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy apparently doesn't get it. He's actually defending the FBI's use of spies in its overall investigation into Russia collusion. We'll tell Trey Gowdy why he's wrong. And we'll also remind everyone watching just why the spygate case, the FISA abuse, the bias, the leaking, the lying, the deception from Comey, Mueller, and his merry band of Democratic donors has weaponized our system of justice against your duly elected president. Now, with Mueller's runaway investigation on day 378, not a single shred of evidence President Trump and even some top Democrats worried that Americans are getting sick of the seemingly endless fishing expedition. And finally, tonight, we'll bring all the breaking news about Secretary of State Mike Pompeo incredible meeting with a top North Korean official in New York City. But it's time for our very important, fast-paced breaking news opening monologue."

He had just been appointed by President Trump and just confirmed by his former peers in the U.S. Senate, he vowed to uphold the law of the land as America's top cop. Without skipping a beat, Sessions stunned President Trump, the entire political world, he decided to recuse himself from the single biggest, most important case facing not only the administration but the entire country -- the ongoing so called Russia collusion investigation. So, we have the country's top lawyer immediately recusing himself from the single most pressing legal case without any prior warning to President Trump or those who confirmed him to the U.S. Senate. You probably remember this."

      "utterance": "Yes, career people. What former senator and Attorney General Sessions did at this point is so harmful, the ramifications so massive, his decision that day, the day after he's confirmed is playing out today and it's hurting the country. And according to Fox News legal analyst, our friend Gregg Jarrett, who will join us soon, the attorney general used a completely illegitimate justification for his refusal. Sessions, remember, he cited that he was required to recuse himself under U.S. Code Federal Regulations 28 CFR 45.2, because of an ongoing criminal investigation. However, at the time of Sessions' recusal, there was no rush of collusion criminal investigation. It was a counterintelligence inquiry. In fact, the criminal investigation only started after Sessions' recusal upon the appointment of the special counsel Robert Mueller, and here we are today. And now, Robert Mueller is even reportedly investigating now, he's desperate, he's panicking, he knows this is blowing up, a meeting that took place between Trump and Sessions that took place shortly after the president was blindsided by the his own attorney general's decision to recuse himself on day one. Does anyone really expect a sitting U.S. president not to question his brand-new attorney general's decision to sit on the sidelines recuse himself the day after he is literally confirmed in a case when he has taken the job the next day? And, by the way, the president can order an attorney general as Gregg Jarrett told us last night to indictment, to make an indictment, not make an indictment, to investigate or not investigate something. So, there's frankly nothing unusual or illegal about this meeting. We'll have full analysis and wellborn the Mueller issue in a moment. But tonight, we have so many other important lingering questions for the Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Why didn't he tell anybody the likelihood that he was going to recuse himself before he was confirmed or before he was appointed? How in good faith can an attorney general act without participating in the single-most pressing legal case facing this country, facing this administration? And now we can all see the damage of Mueller's witch hunt investigation and what it is -- a flawed witch-hunt. Why he should as we have talked about months and months ago unrecusal himself immediately. This time, he would be following the correct law. Without a doubt when the Attorney General sessions whom I have personally always liked and respected -- what he has done here has now left this administration and country more exposed to the deep state that has been working against the president you elected since the very beginning. This last week, we learned that at least one informant likely more working in coordination with the Obama Justice Department actively infiltrating the Trump campaign, spying on a multitude of people associated with then-candidate Trump's election efforts. And here's what two of the men who were spied on had to say on this program right here last night. Take a look."

      "utterance": "Lying to FISA judges repeatedly, not telling the FISA judges, not corroborating, not verifying, not telling FISA court judges, getting warrants, spying on Trump campaign associates, all of this happened. And you know something, now we got spies that we're discovering that we're in the Trump campaign and as much as the media says, oh, it's not actually spying, it's an informant. You just heard for the three men that were approached by the so-called informant who's really a spy to tell them and seek out information because of this witch hunt that began as we now know in the spring of 2016. I mean, I've listened to Chairman Gowdy today, who frankly I agree with on a lot of issues. He tried to play down with the president is rightly calling spygate. Let's make this very simple. Here are the basic, thesaurus definitions of the term spy, for all of you people in Congress even those of you that claim to be lawyers. A secret or undercover agent, that's a spy. So, make no mistake -- this mistake, the Trump campaign was spied on. A secret agent working with Obama's Justice Department monitoring conversation and activities of many Trump campaign associates. He had just heard directly from the individuals who were spied on and actively targeted by the spy. And Chairman Gowdy praising the FBI's overall handling of the Russian probe? No, Chairman Gowdy, look at McCabe, look at Comey, look at Strzok, look at Page, look at Loretta Lynch, look at all the others that abuse their power. So, we got to get this right. The FBI literally -- under fired FBI director which the president had every right to do, Rod Rosenstein himself recommended, James Comey's direction used Hillary Clinton's bought and paid for dirty dossier, full of Russian lies put together by a foreign agent and illegally convinced FISA judges because they're supposed to verify and corroborate to authorize a wiretap against the Trump campaign associate in the lead up to a campaign, all while the Obama administration is unmasking the names of American citizens caught up in other surveillance at what is a 350 percent increase from any prior year and while the FBI was using spies to monitor at least four people associated with the Trump campaign. Chairman Gowdy, are you keeping up? And let's not forget, after James Comey was fired for mishandling the Clinton investigation, Comey illegally leaked documents. He wanted to prompt the appointment of a special prosecutor because his BFF Robert Mueller who then appointed, let's see, the most corrupt, the most dishonest merry band of anti-Trump Democratic donors -- those people who are now doing everything in their power and have been to take this president down. How do you ever trust any special counsel that would hire Andrew \"the pitbull\" Weissmann? How would you ever trust them? Let's see. He lost tens of thousands of Americans their job and Andersen Accounting, overturned Supreme Court 9-0, put four innocent Merrill executives in jail for a year and that was overturned by the Fifth Circuit. You want him investigating you? Any congressman out there? Give me a call. There are so many brave public servants that are doing important work in the FBI, in the CIA, in our intelligence community. Some very high-ranking. But we have now discovered abuse of power, bad apples that have a political agenda that are hell-bent on destroying this president, delegitimizing him and literally ruining the vote of the American people. And, by the way, in their eyes, this was the man that was never supposed to be president and they were counting on it. There are fears that Mueller's ongoing witch-hunt will influence the midterm elections. I believe this is a legitimate concern. Former New York City mayor, current Trump attorney, Rudy Giuliani, who is with us tonight will join us live in a little bit weighed in on this very issue earlier today. Take a look."

That Judge Ellis was dead on accurate. And according to a new poll from CBS News, a majority of you the American people, you are rightly now already skeptical of Mueller's efforts, believing that the special counsel's investigation is what it is, politically motivated. While this off-the-rails Russia so-called collusion investigation rolls on way past, way beyond any mandate they ever had, while the president of the United States -- well, he actually has real work to get done, including the negotiations with North Korea. Already, the president has secured the release of several hostages once held captive in North Korea. Kim Jong Un, he's no longer firing missiles over Japan and threatening Guam and the entire Korean peninsula or threatening the United States. The nuclear tests have halted. He crossed the DMZ. And hours ago, a top North Korean official landed right here in New York City for a meeting with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. The two men just finished a working dinner. And according to Pompeo, the meeting went great -- a historic meeting between Trump and Kim Jong Un is now still in the works. It may happen on time.

Let me begin with you, Joe diGenova. Let's talk about the president and Jeff Sessions, in a way as somebody that always personally liked respected Senator Sessions, I cannot at this point defend any longer his inaction in some ways and that decision to recuse himself the day after he's confirmed.

And here's the problem -- the case that was being turned over to Bob Mueller at that time was a counterintelligence investigation. It was not a criminal investigation. Therefore, Jeff Sessions did not have to recuse himself. He could have supervised that investigation, stayed in touch with it, been aware of it and even if criminal matters came up, he would not necessarily have had to recuse himself. In fact, we now know that it remains basically a counterintelligence investigation, and the only thing that Mueller wants to do is interview the president of the United States for no good reason in order to get evidence so he can refer to the House of Representatives. There's never going to be an interview. The president should never agree to an interview."

      "utterance": "All right. So, as you know by now, over the weekend comedienne Roseanne Barr tweeted out some outrageous, not funny, by her admission, inappropriate over-the-line remarks about former Obama aide Valerie Jarrett. In response, we all now that ABC has cancelled the reboot of Roseanne, the sitcom. Tonight, I'm going to respond to Roseanne Barr's tweet, and I also highlight what is a sad but all too obvious double standard in the country where it appears that only conservatives are held accountable for their words, their reaction, while those on the left never seem to face consequences for outright racism, bigotry or sexism. That's tonight's important mini monologue. We know this week Roseanne Barr, she rightly apologized for her comments, terrible comments about Valerie Jarrett. She on to say that no one should defend her in light of what happened. Roseanne was right to apologize. But, I would argue we all have to look at this moment and do better as a country. In other words, we've got to respect all races, all creeds, all background. Roseanne is a public figure. Her public comments did in fact hurt innocent people and she is facing consequences for her actions. Now, she can say it on her own time, but ABC has their own decision making what they want to do. We also should all feel bad. A lot of innocent people lost their jobs in all of these. They have families, they have mortgages, they have rent payments, they have car payments, they have other expenses, college, kids to worry about. Now, of course, Roseanne is not the first public figure thou to make outrageous comments, and she even admits she's been held rightly accountable. So many despicable comments though and actions from those on the left appeared to go completely unnoticed. There's a huge double standard. In fact, many get a free pass no matter what they say or what they do, including a former writer that's actually on Roseanne's show, comedienne Wanda Sykes, before the show was cancelled. Remember Sykes announced that she was quitting the show to protest Roseanne Barr's tweet? But, Sykes herself has issued outrageous, extremely racial tweets including this one. White people, they don't steal wallets, they steal countries. And, of course, Sykes never faced any career-ending backlash from that tweet. And let's not forget about another ABC employee, our old friend Jimmy Kimmel. Remember, he was on Comedy Central, he often -- he even dressed up in black face. Take a look at this."

At one point, against him and his daughter, tweeting, tell your racist, white supremacist, neo-Nazi father to get the bleep out of our society, Olbermann targeting the president. Former Arizona sheriff, Joe Arpaio, quote, you and POTUS can go bleep yourselves, you racist Nazi bleep. Yeah, Iger just hired him to go back to ESPN. Good luck with that. Now, we turn our attention to NBC News. Last night they ran a special entitled, Everyday Racism in America, one of the host that was featured Joy Reid. You might remember Reid recently came under fire for outrageous blog posts. She denied the allegation claiming without proof that the internet had been hacked and the firestorm completely goes away. Everyone on the left they just accepted what was really a bizarre explanation. NBC also frequently features -- there he is, the Reverend Al Sharpton, on issues of race and social justice. The same Al Sharpton, you may remember said all of these things."

Where was the apology for Cathy Griffin going on a profane rant against the president on The View after a photo showed her holding President Trump's decapitated head? And where was the apology for Bob Iger for ESPN hiring Keith Olbermann after his numerous explicit laced tweets attacking the president as a Nazi, and even expanding Olbermann's role after that attack against the president's family.

We need to be one nation, one people. This country is going to succeed or fail together. If we're attacked, it's all of us attacked. We're supposed to be the United States of America.

Disney owned ABC, which obviously had Roseanne on. Also owns ESPN, and they've just hired Olbermann for the sixth time as you said in your monologue. And, look, as you pointed out, he has called out the president dozens of times and his family. I'll read you one alone, this is incredible, this is all in one tweet, quoting, F.U. at real Donald Trump.

Pompeo said it went great. They've served American beef, by the way, to this North Korean official. The point is, this is the vice chair of the central committee, Kim Yong Chol, very close to Kim Jong Un. The fact that he came to the United States, right to the president's backyard, basically, of New York City, shows that while Nancy Pelosi, other Democrats were claiming that Kim was celebrating last week after the president canceled the June 12th summit with that letter that he personally dictated. In fact, ever since North Korea has been practically on bended knee trying to get these talks back going. You can see right there, Kim Yong Chol, vice chair of the central committee, very close to Kim Jong Un. Bottom line is tonight's dinner with the U.S. secretary of state kicks off two days of meetings. They'll be meeting in New York City all day tomorrow, you could see them there. The president is also now planning to meet with the Japanese prime minister on June 7th. That means the June 12th summit could be back, Sean."
