      "sentences": "All right. Thanks, Tucker. Welcome to HANNITY. Big news tonight. President Trump blasting obnoxious, arrogant, obstructionist do-nothing Democrats, Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi for skipping the White House and a meeting on funding your government. Now, Schumer and Pelosi, they are refusing to do their jobs by not coming to the negotiating table. They have done nothing which means they now own the possibility of a government shutdown tonight.  Also North Korea madman Dictator Kim Jong-un continues to endanger the entire world. Now with brand new ICBM capability. Are we now on the brink of a serious conflict? President Trump is responding. He is saying the United States will now take care of the situation. North Korea is now precipitating what is a worldwide crisis. At some point the U.S. and the world will have to stop them. We'll have the details.  Plus, all right, why did the New York Times Magazine, they took hundreds and hundreds of pictures and that's the one they chose of me. Do you think it might have -- all right. Stop laughing. Do you think it might have something to do with liberal bias? Wow. Even that's atrocious.  All right.

Before heading to Capitol Hill earlier today to meet with Republicans about the tax bill, President Trump tweeted, quote, 'Meeting with Chuck and Nancy today about keeping the government open and working. The problem is they want illegal immigrants flooding into our country unchecked. They are weak on crime and want to substantially raise taxes. I don't see a deal.' Then in typical, liberal, predictable cry baby fashion. Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi, they threw a temper tantrum it rivals a three-year-old. Crocodile tears Chuck Schumer attacked President Trump during a press conference he held today.  Watch this.  SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER, SENATE MINORITY LEADER Mr. President, it's time to stop tweeting and start leading. As long as he remains a destructive force, it would be a waste of everyone's time to continue working with someone who clearly has no interest in coming to an agreement. The president doesn't indicate he is serious. We're not going to sit down just for a photo op. This is serious stuff.",

'Will no longer be tolerated. His empty chair photo op showed he is more interested in stunts than in addressing the needs of American people. Poor Ryan and McConnell relegated to props. Sad.\"'   Nancy Pelosi is actually saying tonight that President Trump, what he did was a political stunt. What about the fact that she and Schumer, what they pulled today, they wouldn't show up to have a meeting to fund your government. That is the ultimate political stunt. The president is responding by tweeting back, 'after North Korea and their missile launch, it's more important than ever to fund our government and military. Democrats shouldn't hold troop funding hostage for amnesty and illegal immigration. I ran on stopping illegal immigration and won big. They can't threaten a government shutdown to get their demands.' What's even more hypocritical is Pelosi and Schumer want everyone to feel story for them because President Trump hurt their little feelings. Pelosi and Schumer forgot all the horrible things, we will remind them tonight that their fellow Democrats and the media have been saying about Donald Trump for 10 months and longer.

They called him every name in the book and then some. And Democrats in their irrational hatred for the president is unlike anything we have ever seen in modern political history. And that's not including the liberal mainstream media that has been trying to destroy President Trump since he launched this campaign.  Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, they can try and play the victim all they want and act like petulant little children all they want in this case but, in reality, they are just feigning moral outrage like they always do. When it comes to negotiating a budget, if Democrats who want to play games if you are refusing to even come to the bargaining table, then guess what? You will own the government shutdown. And from what the president said today, it sounds like he is not going to be backing down to accommodate your ridiculous demands and he shouldn't back down. Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi, they are going to try and pressure Republicans to go along with every liberal agenda item from DACA on down. The American people don't want it. They want to blackmail President Trump and the Republicans in to literally breaking their campaign promises. That would be stupid.   Democrats are also going to try and deploy their government shutdown scare tactics like they always do. The GOP for once you shouldn't budge an inch. Let them own it. The government by the way never really ends up shutting down despite the threat, the lies Democrats have been telling over the years. Guess what, if they do have a quote government shut down, Social Security checks, they still go out. The post office still delivers mail. Food stamps, well, that is not impacted. The executive branch, they still operate. The judiciary branch they function. Congress, they pretty much going to on like nothing happened. The only people that are directly impacted are nonessential government employees. And guess what they get. They get a furlough which means they end up getting a paid vacation because historically Congress has always retroactively paid their salaries and they got all the free time off.  Republicans need to show spine and backbone for once, please. And actually start fighting for the President's agenda and for the forgotten men and women in this country, you know, the people that actually voted you into power. And if Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, they want to go out and cry. They want to suck their thumb in a corner, and so be it. The GOP needs to stop folding under pressure. Start actually keeping your promises. Start leading. The budget is a great place to start so get to work. Also tonight, the U.S. and the world are facing an escalating threat from rocket man himself, Kim Jong-un after his rogue regime now carried out what the Pentagon believes to be a new ICBM test. This missile flew over 600 miles, was in the air for almost 50 minutes.  It flew 2,800 miles into space which is higher than any previous launch from North Korea before landing in the ocean near Japan. Japan's prime minister has ordered an emergency Cabinet meeting and says, the missile could have landed in the country's exclusive economic zone. South Korea responding by holding a National Security Council meeting and also conducting a precision strike drill by firing their own missile into the ocean as their show of force. Hawaii tonight, well, they began testing nuclear attack warning sirens. It's the first time that state has done that in nearly 30 years. President Trump also weighed in on what is now a clear and present danger. That is the growing North Korean threat that took place earlier today. Take a look.",

      "sentences": "With North Korea, we are getting to a point I would hope we would never reach. Pyongyang's dangerous nuclear ambitions are now progressing at a very rapid pace. And as you just heard, Secretary Mattis say, the missile fired today, it went higher than any other previous test and now can reach any place in the world. That's means a North Korean ICBM could be capable of hitting the continental United States destroying major American cities like New York and Boston, Los Angeles, Chicago. Tens of millions of American lives now are in danger. Not to mention the hundreds of millions that are being threatened in South Korea and Japan. And Kim Jong Un has created a situation that the United States and the world can no longer ignore. And right now we are getting to the point where force might very well be necessary. Because clearly this little crackpot dictator Kim Jong Un is not interested in stopping his missile test.   The way I see it, America and the world have only a few options going forward. None of them good in order to stop North Korea from reaching full nuclear program capability. We either next have to destroy the next North Korean missile test on the launch-pad shoot it out of the air after it's been fired. And if that doesn't stop North Korea, then we can attack and try and destroy the nuclear sites but that comes with massive risks and huge uncertainties. What if we're not successful?  What we now know is not working. The approach that is taken by Democrats, appeasers like Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. They tried to appease North Korea. It has failed miserably as appeasement always does. And then 1994 the Clinton administration, remember, they tried to bribe Kim Jong Un's farther Kim Jong-il. They gave North Korea $4 billion in energy aid in exchange for a promise that the rouge regime would freeze and eventually end their nuclear weapons program. A lot of good that did. At that time, Clinton went on national TV bragging about how his bribery worked and was such a good deal for the American people. Remember this.",

And they will pay for an alternative power system for North Korea that will allow them to produce electricity while making it much harder for them to produce nuclear weapons. The United States and international inspectors will carefully monitor North Korea to make sure it keeps its commitments. Only as it does so will North Korea fully join the community of nations.",

Bill Clinton completely wrong and it has now led us to where we are tonight, in this situation, we now found ourselves in. Democrats and the Left, I'll never get it. Obsessed with sucking up to murderers, radical, dictators, and despots are more willing to bend over backwards or people like Kim Jong-un, and his father, Kim Jong-il.   But guess what, history has proven over and over again it never works. We saw what happened with Neville Chamberlain and Adolf Hitler, his appeasement policies, well, that clear the way for Germany's invasion of Europe. Bill Clinton throwing billions at North Korea led us to where we are today. And if anything happens, the blame will fall right at the feet of Bill Clinton. His stupidity, and his ignorance, and his belief in a fantasy that despots -- listen to him.  And by the way, this led to the situation in the foundation where we are today. And the same goes with President Obama's disastrous nuclear deal with Iran. This will come back to bite us. Obama giving Tehran and the Mullahs upwards of $150 billion. Obama allowing that rogue regime to keep spinning their nuclear centrifuges and put them on the path towards getting a nuclear weapon? As a result Obama now owns that terrible decision to appease the country that routinely calls for death to America. Wants to wipe Israel off the man. And before we bring in Kellyanne Conway for reaction, two other breaking news stories to tell you about.  One, Catherine Herridge is out with an explosive report. Take a look at the headline. 'Blowback. Clinton campaign planned to fire me over email probe, Obama intel watchdog says.' And the former intelligence community and Inspector General who played a key role in the Clinton email investigation is now saying that Clinton allies literally threatened him, his family, and his staffers. And the Clinton campaign also made it be known that this inspector general would be fired if Hillary, in fact, won in 2016. Also finally tonight, a major development in the Uranium One scandal. The Hill's John Solomon out with a brand new report. Here's that headline. 'Clintons understated support from firm hired by Russian nuclear company.' According to Solomon, he will join us later, the Clinton Foundation may have significantly underreported the donations they got from a company with deep ties to Russia. More later.  But, first, joining us now with reaction, counselor to the president, Kellyanne Conway. If the President of the United States of America invites the opposition party to the White House and wants to avoid a government shutdown. Shouldn't they have the decency to show up for that meeting instead of the stunt that Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer showed today?",

It's a great step forward to making sure that our job creators get a lower rate.  You know, the president just had a five nation Asia trip. And the five nations that President Trump visited, guess which one has the highest corporate tax rate among them all? Us, the United States of America. That is completely unacceptable. And if this president, who is trying to work with both parties and both chambers in Congress, Sean, to make sure that this job creator's tax rate is lowered. Make sure of the middle class gets a tax break they deserve. Repatriate the trillion dollars-worth of wealth and just simplify the code, why are we spending billions of dollars and billions of hours every single year trying to comply with the code. He is making good on promises. I also think he was very respectful to the process today saying to the Senate, listening to their concerns. You had a few of them coming forward and talking about small businesses and what relief they will get. The President has listened very patiently to those concerns. Others are talking about the deficit. And so he went the Senate today to say thank you for working through the process. Encouraging them to come forward. Bring their concerns to reconciliation and get this tax cut on his desk. The Democrats have spent all of 2017 talking about the presidential election in 2016 and the presidential election in 2020.",

They gave us the same one that they gave The Hill. The executive chairwoman of APCO said, quote, \"APCO worldwide's activities involving client work on behalf of Tenex and the Clinton global initiative were totally separate and unconnected in any way, all activities on these two unconnected activities were appropriate and publicly documented from the outset and consisted with regulations and the law. Any assertion otherwise is false, unfounded and a lie.\" Here with more, The Hill's John Solomon, investigative journalist Sara Carter is with us.

They signed that contract in April of 2010. So that was before the CFIUS process went through later that October. So this was very important and the informant made that very clear to his attorney. And John is 100 percent right on that. It is something that he is expected to testify to. So, let's go back now to the money. Look at the money trail, how did they move this money? Where was the money moved to? How did they get into the Clinton foundation? This is the reason why. A special counsel or prosecutor and an investigator need to look into this. Right now we know there are four different committees on the Hill looking into this.

There are no reason that to reject the Uranium One deal, there walls, the FBI had evidence of criminality by the very buyer of uranium one. All of the donations were disclosed. They weren't all disclosed. There was lots of concern inside the FBI about where the money was coming from.

For years I called out the New York Times, fake news and liberal's media outlets, for portraying conservatives in a bad light. Some say a picture is worth a thousand words. Here's what the New York Times Magazine chose as a profile cover of me. How far will Sean Hannity go? Look at that. Could you pick a worst picture? At a very the top of the article’s on-line version, three of the images, they all suck. They took hundreds and hundreds of pictures. This is the best they could take? Not exactly flattering, but I am not the only one who thinks these photos were looking a little unfair. Take a headline look at Mediaite, ‘New York Times angry Hannity photo select confirms host belief of liberal bias.’ There is one good picture. Pan in on that. They put in a baby picture of me. You can see right there. That is me. I was kind of a cute kid, right? Little baby Sean. This is not my first rodeo. It did not surprise me. Let me take you back 26 years ago, 1991, I was a radio host in Alabama. I let the photographer, they photographed me for 3 solid hours. And this is what they came up with. Look take a look at that. They picked the worst picture. My mouth wide open and face contorted. From that point on, when I have a photographer come in studio to take photos, I will give you 5 minutes and here's the photo you want. The media wants this pony caricature of conservatives. We actually care about the forgotten men and women, people in poverty on food stamps, out of the labor force. They push their narrative through photography. A picture is worth a thousand words. I liked the baby picture. I have not seen that in years. Sean Spicer with us tomorrow. Let not your heart be troubled, we will be fair and balanced. We are not the destroy Trump media.

Now, Schumer and Pelosi, they are refusing to do their jobs by not coming to the negotiating table. They have done nothing which means they now own the possibility of a government shutdown tonight. Also North Korea madman Dictator Kim Jong-un continues to endanger the entire world. Now with brand new ICBM capability. Are we now on the brink of a serious conflict? President Trump is responding.

The problem is they want illegal immigrants flooding into our country unchecked. They are weak on crime and want to substantially raise taxes. I don't see a deal.' Then in typical, liberal, predictable cry baby fashion. Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi, they threw a temper tantrum it rivals a three-year-old. Crocodile tears Chuck Schumer attacked President Trump during a press conference he held today. Watch this. SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER, SENATE MINORITY LEADER Mr. President, it's time to stop tweeting and start leading.

They want it for a lot of other things but the military is always secondary to them. And the other thing is they want tax increases and we want major tax decreases, so they decided not to show up.

'Will no longer be tolerated. His empty chair photo op showed he is more interested in stunts than in addressing the needs of American people. Poor Ryan and McConnell relegated to props. Sad.\"' Nancy Pelosi is actually saying tonight that President Trump, what he did was a political stunt. What about the fact that she and Schumer, what they pulled today, they wouldn't show up to have a meeting to fund your government. That is the ultimate political stunt. The president is responding by tweeting back, 'after North Korea and their missile launch, it's more important than ever to fund our government and military. Democrats shouldn't hold troop funding hostage for amnesty and illegal immigration. I ran on stopping illegal immigration and won big. They can't threaten a government shutdown to get their demands.' What's even more hypocritical is Pelosi and Schumer want everyone to feel story for them because President Trump hurt their little feelings. Pelosi and Schumer forgot all the horrible things, we will remind them tonight that their fellow Democrats and the media have been saying about Donald Trump for 10 months and longer.

They called him every name in the book and then some. And Democrats in their irrational hatred for the president is unlike anything we have ever seen in modern political history. And that's not including the liberal mainstream media that has been trying to destroy President Trump since he launched this campaign. Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, they can try and play the victim all they want and act like petulant little children all they want in this case but, in reality, they are just feigning moral outrage like they always do. When it comes to negotiating a budget, if Democrats who want to play games if you are refusing to even come to the bargaining table, then guess what? You will own the government shutdown. And from what the president said today, it sounds like he is not going to be backing down to accommodate your ridiculous demands and he shouldn't back down. Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi, they are going to try and pressure Republicans to go along with every liberal agenda item from DACA on down. The American people don't want it. They want to blackmail President Trump and the Republicans in to literally breaking their campaign promises. That would be stupid. Democrats are also going to try and deploy their government shutdown scare tactics like they always do. The GOP for once you shouldn't budge an inch. Let them own it. The government by the way never really ends up shutting down despite the threat, the lies Democrats have been telling over the years. Guess what, if they do have a quote government shut down, Social Security checks, they still go out. The post office still delivers mail. Food stamps, well, that is not impacted. The executive branch, they still operate. The judiciary branch they function. Congress, they pretty much going to on like nothing happened. The only people that are directly impacted are nonessential government employees. And guess what they get. They get a furlough which means they end up getting a paid vacation because historically Congress has always retroactively paid their salaries and they got all the free time off. Republicans need to show spine and backbone for once, please. And actually start fighting for the President's agenda and for the forgotten men and women in this country, you know, the people that actually voted you into power. And if Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, they want to go out and cry. They want to suck their thumb in a corner, and so be it. The GOP needs to stop folding under pressure. Start actually keeping your promises. Start leading. The budget is a great place to start so get to work. Also tonight, the U.S. and the world are facing an escalating threat from rocket man himself, Kim Jong-un after his rogue regime now carried out what the Pentagon believes to be a new ICBM test. This missile flew over 600 miles, was in the air for almost 50 minutes. It flew 2,800 miles into space which is higher than any previous launch from North Korea before landing in the ocean near Japan. Japan's prime minister has ordered an emergency Cabinet meeting and says, the missile could have landed in the country's exclusive economic zone. South Korea responding by holding a National Security Council meeting and also conducting a precision strike drill by firing their own missile into the ocean as their show of force. Hawaii tonight, well, they began testing nuclear attack warning sirens. It's the first time that state has done that in nearly 30 years. President Trump also weighed in on what is now a clear and present danger. That is the growing North Korean threat that took place earlier today. Take a look."

It's a research and development effort on their part to continue building ballistic missiles that can threaten everywhere in the world basically. But the bottom-line is, it's a continued effort to build a threat, a ballistic missile threat that endangers world peace, regional peace and certainly the United States."

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "With North Korea, we are getting to a point I would hope we would never reach. Pyongyang's dangerous nuclear ambitions are now progressing at a very rapid pace. And as you just heard, Secretary Mattis say, the missile fired today, it went higher than any other previous test and now can reach any place in the world. That's means a North Korean ICBM could be capable of hitting the continental United States destroying major American cities like New York and Boston, Los Angeles, Chicago. Tens of millions of American lives now are in danger. Not to mention the hundreds of millions that are being threatened in South Korea and Japan. And Kim Jong Un has created a situation that the United States and the world can no longer ignore. And right now we are getting to the point where force might very well be necessary. Because clearly this little crackpot dictator Kim Jong Un is not interested in stopping his missile test. The way I see it, America and the world have only a few options going forward. None of them good in order to stop North Korea from reaching full nuclear program capability. We either next have to destroy the next North Korean missile test on the launch-pad shoot it out of the air after it's been fired. And if that doesn't stop North Korea, then we can attack and try and destroy the nuclear sites but that comes with massive risks and huge uncertainties. What if we're not successful? What we now know is not working. The approach that is taken by Democrats, appeasers like Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. They tried to appease North Korea. It has failed miserably as appeasement always does. And then 1994 the Clinton administration, remember, they tried to bribe Kim Jong Un's farther Kim Jong-il. They gave North Korea $4 billion in energy aid in exchange for a promise that the rouge regime would freeze and eventually end their nuclear weapons program. A lot of good that did. At that time, Clinton went on national TV bragging about how his bribery worked and was such a good deal for the American people. Remember this."

The entire world will be safer as we slow the spread of nuclear weapons. South Korea with support from Japan and other nations will bear most of the cost of providing North Korea with fuel to make up for the nuclear energy that it is losing. And they will pay for an alternative power system for North Korea that will allow them to produce electricity while making it much harder for them to produce nuclear weapons. The United States and international inspectors will carefully monitor North Korea to make sure it keeps its commitments. Only as it does so will North Korea fully join the community of nations."

Bill Clinton completely wrong and it has now led us to where we are tonight, in this situation, we now found ourselves in. Democrats and the Left, I'll never get it. Obsessed with sucking up to murderers, radical, dictators, and despots are more willing to bend over backwards or people like Kim Jong-un, and his father, Kim Jong-il. But guess what, history has proven over and over again it never works. We saw what happened with Neville Chamberlain and Adolf Hitler, his appeasement policies, well, that clear the way for Germany's invasion of Europe. Bill Clinton throwing billions at North Korea led us to where we are today. And if anything happens, the blame will fall right at the feet of Bill Clinton. His stupidity, and his ignorance, and his belief in a fantasy that despots -- listen to him. And by the way, this led to the situation in the foundation where we are today. And the same goes with President Obama's disastrous nuclear deal with Iran. This will come back to bite us. Obama giving Tehran and the Mullahs upwards of $150 billion. Obama allowing that rogue regime to keep spinning their nuclear centrifuges and put them on the path towards getting a nuclear weapon? As a result Obama now owns that terrible decision to appease the country that routinely calls for death to America. Wants to wipe Israel off the man. And before we bring in Kellyanne Conway for reaction, two other breaking news stories to tell you about. One, Catherine Herridge is out with an explosive report. Take a look at the headline. 'Blowback. Clinton campaign planned to fire me over email probe, Obama intel watchdog says.' And the former intelligence community and Inspector General who played a key role in the Clinton email investigation is now saying that Clinton allies literally threatened him, his family, and his staffers. And the Clinton campaign also made it be known that this inspector general would be fired if Hillary, in fact, won in 2016. Also finally tonight, a major development in the Uranium One scandal. The Hill's John Solomon out with a brand new report. Here's that headline. 'Clintons understated support from firm hired by Russian nuclear company.' According to Solomon, he will join us later, the Clinton Foundation may have significantly underreported the donations they got from a company with deep ties to Russia. More later. But, first, joining us now with reaction, counselor to the president, Kellyanne Conway. If the President of the United States of America invites the opposition party to the White House and wants to avoid a government shutdown. Shouldn't they have the decency to show up for that meeting instead of the stunt that Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer showed today?"

And it is a major disappointment especially when you see the president's reaction in North Korea firing its highest missile to date, Sean. He is saying, let's not play politics in funding our military and keeping us strong. And let's not leave that on the altar of a liberal agenda. I find it really regrettable that Nancy Pelosi took time out of her Sunday schedule to go and call John Conyers and icon and, yet, name-calling our president."

It's based on ideas and bedrock principles. The President and his party today through the Senate Finance Committee, they forged ahead and they got this tax bill passed out of committee. It's a great step forward to making sure that our job creators get a lower rate. You know, the president just had a five nation Asia trip. And the five nations that President Trump visited, guess which one has the highest corporate tax rate among them all? Us, the United States of America. That is completely unacceptable. And if this president, who is trying to work with both parties and both chambers in Congress, Sean, to make sure that this job creator's tax rate is lowered. Make sure of the middle class gets a tax break they deserve. Repatriate the trillion dollars-worth of wealth and just simplify the code, why are we spending billions of dollars and billions of hours every single year trying to comply with the code. He is making good on promises. I also think he was very respectful to the process today saying to the Senate, listening to their concerns. You had a few of them coming forward and talking about small businesses and what relief they will get. The President has listened very patiently to those concerns. Others are talking about the deficit. And so he went the Senate today to say thank you for working through the process. Encouraging them to come forward. Bring their concerns to reconciliation and get this tax cut on his desk. The Democrats have spent all of 2017 talking about the presidential election in 2016 and the presidential election in 2020."

Donald Trump and Mike Pence prevailed on policy and they are trying to make good on those. But the Democratic Party has been reduced to carrying around a stop sign. Their code word is resistance.

As they threaten Guam and Hawaii. It's going to get to the point where the options are not good. Take it off the pad. Take it out of the sky. And we don't know what this madman will do. Then we take out the nuclear sites. You have to worry about nuclear fallout. You have to worry about, do they have a missile site that we don't know about firing into South Korea or Japan or Guam or Hawaii or the continental United States?

The Clinton Foundation may have significantly under reported donations that it received from a firm with deep connections to Russia and its nuclear energy holdings. Now, this according to a brand new article from The Hill's John Solomon and Alison Spann. Now, this was released earlier tonight. The report details, quote, 'The Clinton Foundation's donor disclosure site vastly understated support that the Clinton global initiative received from APCO worldwide, a global communications firm that lobbied on behalf of Russia's state owned nuclear company.\" Now, we reached out to APCO for a statement. They gave us the same one that they gave The Hill. The executive chairwoman of APCO said, quote, \"APCO worldwide's activities involving client work on behalf of Tenex and the Clinton global initiative were totally separate and unconnected in any way, all activities on these two unconnected activities were appropriate and publicly documented from the outset and consisted with regulations and the law. Any assertion otherwise is false, unfounded and a lie.\" Here with more, The Hill's John Solomon, investigative journalist Sara Carter is with us. John, let's start with, okay, under reported donations received from a firm with deep connections to Russia and the nuclear energy holdings. Did that happen or not?"

The Clinton Global Initiative and the Clinton Foundation only disclosed $50,000 of cash payments that were made by APCO. The other million plus has not been disclosed until we learned about it from our records. We also know that the FBI undercover informant according to his lawyer Victoria Toensing is prepared to tell Congress that the Russians told him, they picked APCO specifically because of the Clinton connections and that they expected APCO's support for the Clinton Foundation."

Now remember, after I was tired to do another part of lobbying, they weren't working on Uranium One, they were working on helping the Russian government when billions of new uranium contracts in the United States. Uranium One was a separate deal part of the same strategy. But they were working very differently on something that turned out to be much more valuable billions of dollars of new utility contracts in the United States that were authorized by Barack Obama."

One is, follow the money. Number two is the timing of the donations. Let's put those two together and couple it with John's new report. Where did all of this money, the 145 million that Peter Schweizer talked about come from and what was the timing bases on the activities as it relates to Uranium One, CFIUS and the Clinton Foundation?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SARA CARTER, INVESTIGATIVE REPORTER",
      "utterance": "Well, we certainly know, Sean, there has been a number of concerns here. I mean, from the 145 million which came from members of the board that were connected to Uranium One, and if I want to go back just really quick because the APCO story is very important. They signed that contract in April of 2010. So that was before the CFIUS process went through later that October. So this was very important and the informant made that very clear to his attorney. And John is 100 percent right on that. It is something that he is expected to testify to. So, let's go back now to the money. Look at the money trail, how did they move this money? Where was the money moved to? How did they get into the Clinton foundation? This is the reason why. A special counsel or prosecutor and an investigator need to look into this. Right now we know there are four different committees on the Hill looking into this. The judiciary committee, the oversight committee, the house intelligence committee and the house foreign affairs committee. So this is a very serious experience investigation and it's going to require somebody with the knowhow and capability to find it."

By the way, we need uranium allowing someone to control it is beyond stupid. But bribery, kickbacks, extortion, money laundering. Is there evidence of any money laundering in other words, the people in Canada, the frank of the world and others, is there any evidence? Where did they get this millions to donate to the Clinton Foundation was there any chance that money was laundered and funneled to the Clinton Foundation?"

Particularly Alpha Bank, there was Latvia, there was the Seychelles. There is a lot of evidence out there. One thing that is very important here, Sean, is that the informant is going to be able to show that he was actually providing evidence to the FBI and the Justice Department long before CFIUS voted on this showing how much Russia wanted to penetrate the U.S. energy market. And John's absolutely right on one point in fact. It was way beyond uranium one. It was $6.5 billion or more of U.S. energy."

You take a look at what the Barack Obama's administration. Hillary Clinton's own State Department helped to prove and get through. It's a much longer give away to the Russian uranium industry. Here's I think the most important to think about today. A large part of the story that Hillary Clinton, her defenders have given the media, have now been proven wrong. Let us go through some of the. There are no reason that to reject the Uranium One deal, there walls, the FBI had evidence of criminality by the very buyer of uranium one. All of the donations were disclosed. They weren't all disclosed. There was lots of concern inside the FBI about where the money was coming from. My favorite one is repeated on a show a couple of weeks ago on Fox, that no uranium left the United States. The uranium one did export American uranium out of the United States after Russia bought it."

We have General Mattis in the room with us. And we have had a long discussion on it. It is a situation that we will handle."

      "speaker": "JAMES MATTIS, DEFENSE SECRETARY GENERAL",
      "utterance": "But the bottom line is it's a continued effort to build threat, ballistic missile threat that endangers world peace, regional peace and certainly the United States."

      "speaker": "ED HENRY, SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Now spoken to the Prime Minister of Japan and the President of South Korea to stay on top of this because, as you noted, missile experts say this is how big it is. This shows North Korea can now launch a missile that puts every single American city in its range. That is because while North Korea had previously fired two intercontinental ballistic missiles, this one went higher than the others. Shot up the west coast of North Korea. Flew 2800 miles into space for a total of 50 minutes. That is 10 times higher than the orbit of NSA's space station before falling just 280 miles off the shores of Japan. That led Vice President Mike Pence just a few moments ago in a speech to warn Pyongyang not to test this American president and this American military."

      "speaker": "MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES",
      "utterance": "The Kim regime in North Korea would do well not to test the resolve of this president. Or the capabilities of the armed forces of the United States of America. As President Trump said today, we will take care of the situation. All options are on the table. And we will continue to marshal the full resources of the United States to bring economic and diplomatic pressure to bear until North Korea abandons its nuclear and ballistic missile programs once and for all."

      "utterance": "All right, Ed Henry live in Washington tonight, thank you. Joining us now with reaction. Fox news national security strategist and former deputy assistant to the President, Sebastian Gorka. We discuss in details, not a lot of good options here. It's going to be taken off the pad next time, take it out of the sky as it launch and then potentially all hell breaks loose and we would have to take out all of their sites, correct? But great danger, great peril?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SEBASTIAN GORKA, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGIST",
      "utterance": "There is great peril, but in fact it is North Korea that has escalated the peril. At some point the President will have to take action. Secretary Mattis has been very clear today. This is a direct threat to the United States, and we cannot wait until the next missile lands on U.S. soil whether it's Guam or the continental U.S. at some point the credibility of the United States is putting in question. The president has shown leadership whether it's in Syria with the missile strike, whether it is the 21,000-pound bomb in Afghanistan we need to maintain that credibility to ensure our allies and our friends like Japan. Secondly, there is the issue of other regime cannot be encouraged to behave the way North Korea is. This is a very, very bad example to set for others and lastly, Sean, there has to be a cause for threatening the United States of America. I'm not an interventionist. I know you are not interventionist and I know because I worked for him, the president is not interventionist. But if you threaten us, if you are a tin pot bully like the regime in North Korea and little Kim, then sooner or later you will pay for your threat. That is where we have reached today, Sean."

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "But I would expect this is not going to be a protracted conflict. This will be massive and overwhelming a use of force. But there are risks. Nuclear fallout. If we hit their nuclear facility. What is Kim Jong Un reactions? Does he fire at Japan? Or Guam or Hawaii or obviously or Seoul."

    {
      "speaker": "GORKA",
      "utterance": "The United States of America is the most powerful nation on god's earth. It's the most powerful nation we have ever seen in American history. By comparison, North Korea may be a nuclear state but it is lily fusion. The president has said it secretary Mattis has said it, we will destroy you. We are not talking about the North Korean people, we're talking about the regime so we can do amazing things if we are push to do so. We do not want to go to war in North Korea. Sooner or later you make threats that are explicit and you must be dealt with it will not be nice. It will be the last resort."

    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Agreed. And not a favorable, but it will happen and they will invite it at this point. Well said, Dr. Gorka. Thank you. When we come back, I will address the o so predictable photos. New York Times Sunday magazine using of me in a profile, straight ahead."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Before we go I want to address a profile of little old me in the New York Times Sunday Magazine. It was released earlier today. For years I called out the New York Times, fake news and liberal's media outlets, for portraying conservatives in a bad light. Some say a picture is worth a thousand words. Here's what the New York Times Magazine chose as a profile cover of me. How far will Sean Hannity go? Look at that. Could you pick a worst picture? At a very the top of the article’s on-line version, three of the images, they all suck. They took hundreds and hundreds of pictures. This is the best they could take? Not exactly flattering, but I am not the only one who thinks these photos were looking a little unfair. Take a headline look at Mediaite, ‘New York Times angry Hannity photo select confirms host belief of liberal bias.’ There is one good picture. Pan in on that. They put in a baby picture of me. You can see right there. That is me. I was kind of a cute kid, right? Little baby Sean. This is not my first rodeo. It did not surprise me. Let me take you back 26 years ago, 1991, I was a radio host in Alabama. I let the photographer, they photographed me for 3 solid hours. And this is what they came up with. Look take a look at that. They picked the worst picture. My mouth wide open and face contorted. From that point on, when I have a photographer come in studio to take photos, I will give you 5 minutes and here's the photo you want. The media wants this pony caricature of conservatives. We actually care about the forgotten men and women, people in poverty on food stamps, out of the labor force. They push their narrative through photography. A picture is worth a thousand words. I liked the baby picture. I have not seen that in years. Sean Spicer with us tomorrow. Let not your heart be troubled, we will be fair and balanced. We are not the destroy Trump media.
