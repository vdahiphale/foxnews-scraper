There was no other issue more important than COVID in getting Biden elected, criticism of how President Trump had handled this global crisis. And there is no issue on which his presidency is going to be judged more first and foremost than getting a handle on the pandemic. And one problem is he declared, I think, victory prematurely.

BYRON YORK, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, \"THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\": Yes, well, the idea of mailing out rapid tests has been around for quite a while. President Biden himself admitted that he was surprised by how many tests were needed. So I think the \"Vanity Fair\" report, which the White House denies, really gets at the idea that Biden was not prepared. Now, what's happening here is reality has intruded again on the Biden presidency. His disastrous handling of the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan revealed that Joe Biden was not the expert in handling foreign affairs that he claimed to be during the campaign. He had been in the Senate a million years and said he knew how to do this stuff. Now this latest turn in the COVID crisis has shown that he was not the expert that he claimed to be during the campaign. This has shown an extraordinary contrast between candidate Biden and President Biden, and for President Biden to say there is no federal solution, that is the kind of thing he would have blasted President Donald Trump for saying, and now he is saying it himself.",

But there's efforts to bring it back, or piece of it, or possibly do it another way. Here are two op-eds, opinion editorials, one from progressive Representative Jayapal in \"The Washington Post,\" \"Broken promises cannot deter the path to Build Back Better. On December 20th, Senator Manchin went back on his commitment of the president, seemingly killed the bill on national television. In a town where your word is everything, this was a stunning rebuke of his own party's president. We're calling out the president to use executive action to immediately improve people's lives. Taking executive action will also make clear to those who hindered Build Back Better that the White House and Democrats will deliver for Americans.\" And then \"The Wall Street Journal\" editorial, \"Joe Manchin and child poverty,\" \"Democrats tried to rush Build Back Better into law without policy debate or compromise. The left thought it could do by beating the living crap out of Mr. Manchin, as he put it in a recent interview. He has no treason to apologize for asking that a bill to transform America be subject to regular congressional order.\" Two different takes. Back with the panel. Byron, what about this executive action push? This is a bill where you are actually spending money, that is the job of Congress. What do progressives think can be done with executive action in that frame?",

A number of progressive thinkers have proposed ways to use executive authority to solve problems that they have not been able to solve legislatively. For example, Elizabeth Warren, Senator Elizabeth Warren and others have suggested that the president could unilaterally with the stroke of his pen forgive a large amount, not all, but a large amount of student debt in this country. So they are fighting for that to relieve student debt or cancel large amounts of student debt. There are other areas in which they believe Joe Biden can stretch the limits of executive authority and do that. That would, of course, be an admission that they have failed to actually pass it through Congress. I'm not sure that Biden, who does have an essential caution in him, would be willing to go along with some of these plans.",

And the question is, will Democrats -- will there be a Venn diagram where the most that Joe Manchin accepts is the same as the least that the progressive will accept, because that's what could get through Congress. The fact is you cannot use executive action to find yourself $1.75 trillion. You need Congress to allocate that money.",

And I think we remember there is anger, denial, bargaining, depression, eventually you get to acceptance. Democrats aren't going to get anywhere until they actually accept the fact that on voting rights, which are not really voting rights but a massive expansion of federal power, and Build Back Better, the ball is in the court of their two Democratic friends, Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, and they should just say them. And I think Susan and Byron would be as hard-pressed as I've been to recall, I've never remembered two senators with this much authority.

And I think one thing they have to worry about, and this connects to what we were talking about the COVID in the earlier segment, is presidential job approval is a major predictor of how a party does in midterm elections. Joe Biden's is going downward. It's probably going to go downward on COVID as well. And if he does not have these legislative achievements to talk about, it will probably go downward further.

He had been in the Senate a million years and said he knew how to do this stuff. Now this latest turn in the COVID crisis has shown that he was not the expert that he claimed to be during the campaign. This has shown an extraordinary contrast between candidate Biden and President Biden, and for President Biden to say there is no federal solution, that is the kind of thing he would have blasted President Donald Trump for saying, and now he is saying it himself."

There was a lot of headlines and repercussions from that, that statement. Meantime, Hugh, there is good news in that the CDC has announced a quarantine time from 10 days to five days if you are asymptomatic, and you have to then wear masks, or it's recommended around folks. But this potentially deals with what we're seeing massive numbers of people leaving work because they have to quarantine."

The problem with overpromising and underdelivering has crippled a lot of employers, crippled a lot of people who want to go back to work. Moving to five days is a recognition of what most of us have heard from friends and family, that these cases are milder, that they go away much more quickly. Now anecdotal evidence is evidence of anecdotes. You can't extrapolate from it. But increasingly the CDC is coming around to the idea that has generally held that this Omicron may be far more virulent, far more contagious, but it's just not as bad. That's good news, and the CDC is recognizing it tonight."

You see that on nothing more seriously than do you on education where you know the initial instinct was to shut down schools. And we have seen the costs that can have to kids and to their families in the way that schools can be opened in a way that it keeps kids safe and doesn't subject them to too much danger with COVID. All of these are things that we are sorting out because, you know what, there is no sign that COVID is going to go away any time soon."

But there's efforts to bring it back, or piece of it, or possibly do it another way. Here are two op-eds, opinion editorials, one from progressive Representative Jayapal in \"The Washington Post,\" \"Broken promises cannot deter the path to Build Back Better. On December 20th, Senator Manchin went back on his commitment of the president, seemingly killed the bill on national television. In a town where your word is everything, this was a stunning rebuke of his own party's president. We're calling out the president to use executive action to immediately improve people's lives. Taking executive action will also make clear to those who hindered Build Back Better that the White House and Democrats will deliver for Americans.\" And then \"The Wall Street Journal\" editorial, \"Joe Manchin and child poverty,\" \"Democrats tried to rush Build Back Better into law without policy debate or compromise. The left thought it could do by beating the living crap out of Mr. Manchin, as he put it in a recent interview. He has no treason to apologize for asking that a bill to transform America be subject to regular congressional order.\" Two different takes. Back with the panel. Byron, what about this executive action push? This is a bill where you are actually spending money, that is the job of Congress. What do progressives think can be done with executive action in that frame?"

      "speaker": "YORK",
      "utterance": "Well, first of all, we are seeing that no magical solution presented itself over Christmas. The problem remains the problem. A number of progressive thinkers have proposed ways to use executive authority to solve problems that they have not been able to solve legislatively. For example, Elizabeth Warren, Senator Elizabeth Warren and others have suggested that the president could unilaterally with the stroke of his pen forgive a large amount, not all, but a large amount of student debt in this country. So they are fighting for that to relieve student debt or cancel large amounts of student debt. There are other areas in which they believe Joe Biden can stretch the limits of executive authority and do that. That would, of course, be an admission that they have failed to actually pass it through Congress. I'm not sure that Biden, who does have an essential caution in him, would be willing to go along with some of these plans."

    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Susan, we saw in President Obama's term the pen and the phone, and that effort. Some of them were challenged in court. Others were erased when another president, President Trump, came along, and that executive chose differently. Most likely, do you think that it's a scaled back versions of Build Back Better that starts anew after the new year?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAGE",
      "utterance": "Yes, maybe after this cooling off period of the holidays, because the one legislation that they could get passed is legislation that fits Joe Biden's parameters and that progressives accept, so that nobody defects, and it gets through. And that could still be a very significant package of $1.75 trillion. That is not $3.5 trillion, but it is still a lot of money that would enable you to do some big programs. And the question is, will Democrats -- will there be a Venn diagram where the most that Joe Manchin accepts is the same as the least that the progressive will accept, because that's what could get through Congress. The fact is you cannot use executive action to find yourself $1.75 trillion. You need Congress to allocate that money."

      "speaker": "HEWITT",
      "utterance": "He is representing what his voters want. I went back and read your transcript of Senator Manchin's interview on December 19th. And he was very clear the filibuster is not on the table. Senator Sinema says it's not on the table. Like the filibuster, as with Build Back Better, there are stages of political grief. And I think we remember there is anger, denial, bargaining, depression, eventually you get to acceptance. Democrats aren't going to get anywhere until they actually accept the fact that on voting rights, which are not really voting rights but a massive expansion of federal power, and Build Back Better, the ball is in the court of their two Democratic friends, Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, and they should just say them. And I think Susan and Byron would be as hard-pressed as I've been to recall, I've never remembered two senators with this much authority. They ought to just ask them what will you do, because you've got the ball. Take a shot. Otherwise, nothing is going to happen, and they will never get to acceptance."

      "speaker": "YORK",
      "utterance": "It is. The basic problem that Hugh is referring to is the fact that Democrats do not control a majority of seats in the U.S. Senate. It's 50- 50. They have to get a perfectly unanimous Democratic Party to get to a tie, which then the vice president can break in their favor. And I think one thing they have to worry about, and this connects to what we were talking about the COVID in the earlier segment, is presidential job approval is a major predictor of how a party does in midterm elections. Joe Biden's is going downward. It's probably going to go downward on COVID as well. And if he does not have these legislative achievements to talk about, it will probably go downward further. So this is something that is a major, major worry for Democrats right now."

So, you can't say they have done nothing. But the problem is there are still some more things to be done."
