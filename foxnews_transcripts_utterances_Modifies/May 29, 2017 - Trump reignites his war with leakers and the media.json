President Trump is wasting little time reigniting his war with leakers and the mainstream media. The latest allegations are now focusing on his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, claiming Kushner proposed opening a communications back channel to the Russian government during the transition. President Trump is swinging back, tweeting, quote, it is my opinion that many of the leaks coming out of the White House are fabricated lies made up by the, quote, fake news media. And officials like Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly are even defending the alleged plan.",

They continue to fuel this thing that happens they are not be able to ignite. Meanwhile, Trump has done everything he promised to do with creating jobs, stock markets are on a tear, the economy is hitting on all cylinders, and he has a phenomenal foreign policy trip over the last nine days, yet they are going to go and say Jared Kushner created back channels.

A very clear explanation as to who Jared Kushner allegedly talk to, the point of it, the why, the secure line was requested and by Russia, not from Jared Kushner himself.

But now it's time to \"Wake Up, America.\" You know, I cringe when I hear \"Happy Memorial Day\" while Americans celebrate the long weekend, firing up the barbecues, serving the burger, hot dogs and lemonade or a beer. But it's clear to me that, culturally, we've lost sight of what today really should mean. It's a day of remembrance. The growing military-civilian disconnect means our servicemen and women come home to disrespect and almost no support by our society. Think about that for a second. Do we respect these heroes? We should hold our service members at a higher level than our celebrities, our musicians and our athletes. Katy Perry never looked down the barrel of an M-16 at the enemy. Sean Penn never entered an abandoned building teaming with enemy fighters. Kanye West never did advanced reconnaissance for a platoon. Yet, they make billions doing what they do because of our military. The saying \"Freedom isn't free\" means so much, but do we understand the magnitude of that statement? Just for a moment now, think to yourself. Put yourself in one of those soldier's bodies. Imagine the guttural fear and anxiety as you prepare to ambush a terror cell in an abandoned building in some faraway country, a place where the people there likely hate you almost as much as the terrorists inside the building. Meanwhile, thousands of miles away, your family waits for you at home, constantly worrying, will you come back or not? You walk into that dark building. Why? Because that's what you do. You're an American soldier. You fight for the flag. So you get it? These men and women deserve our unequivocal respect. So the next time some liberal fool burns a flag or disrespects a service member, remind them that over a million men and women have given their lives for them, including the right to be anti-American and despicable. And finally, after eight years of the apologist in chief, we bid farewell to Obama's America. And now with Donald Trump, we have a new breed of commander-in-chief. There's now bowing to sheikhs, nor pardoning traitors in Trump's America, just respect for the military. \"Make America great again.\" The left hates the slogan. We patriotic Americans take pride in it. And I will start with Carrie, who has here flag.",

You know, but Memorial Day is really for people who sacrificed while in service. And I don't think that that is emphasized enough, exactly what you said. And also, when you look at the elite cultural institutions, as you mentioned, I think Colin Kaepernick is the perfect embodiment of someone who's totally out of touch with sacrifice and, really, what it means to be an American.

      "utterance": "Hello, everyone. I am Kat Timpf along with Eric Bolling and Eboni K. Williams. We are \"The Fox News Specialists\". President Trump is wasting little time reigniting his war with leakers and the mainstream media. The latest allegations are now focusing on his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, claiming Kushner proposed opening a communications back channel to the Russian government during the transition. President Trump is swinging back, tweeting, quote, it is my opinion that many of the leaks coming out of the White House are fabricated lies made up by the, quote, fake news media. And officials like Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly are even defending the alleged plan."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JOHN KELLY, SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY",
      "utterance": "I think any channel of communication back otherwise with a country like Russia is a good thing. I mean, multiple ways to communicate back and forth is a good thing with any country, I think, particularly a country like Russia. So, it doesn't bother me."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "More leaks. We have more leaks. The back channel issue, of course with the way in which he set it up, they are saying he set it up, again just anonymous leaks."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ERIC BOLLING, CO-HOST",
      "utterance": "You know what it feels like? It feels like this is the deep state, the leakers getting together with the swamp, the D.C. establishment that is fearful at losing their status and their position in D.C., and aided and abetted by the mainstream media, very liberal, left-leaning mainstream media to create the illusion that this Russia story has legs and there is some bear there, but really there isn't. They continue to fuel this thing that happens they are not be able to ignite. Meanwhile, Trump has done everything he promised to do with creating jobs, stock markets are on a tear, the economy is hitting on all cylinders, and he has a phenomenal foreign policy trip over the last nine days, yet they are going to go and say Jared Kushner created back channels. I got to tell you something. Creating back channels to Russia is one of the most common things that has been done by administrations from Obama to Clinton to Bush to Reagan."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "I don't think it was the back channels themselves that it was the accusation that he wanted to use, only Russian communications equipment to do so. But again, Eboni, still anonymous. Media is acting as if it's not in many cases."

This sounds like a distraction. It's not helpful at all. If it's not coming from the FBI or DOJ, I'm really not interested."

What do you think about this story? Do you think Eric has got nothing? Is it maybe something or you're still waiting? How do you feel about it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHEFFIELD",
      "utterance": "Yeah, there are a lot of things that Trump said in the campaign that really upset me but I feel like all these criticism against the president has jumped the shark. We are talking about anonymous sources. Basically, sources say as President Trump says, you can make up whatever you want. Sources say that Garth Brooks is my boyfriend. Sources say that I jumped on LeBron James. Sources say whatever you want them to say. These are anonymous, made up things. Look, I believe in the First Amendment. Everyone here at this table, we believe in the First Amendment. But to be American, we also have the Fifth Amendment. You can't take to choose which part of the constitution. What's in the Fifth Amendment? The right to due process. The right to the fact that you are innocent until proven guilty. And the media, the liberal establishment, has jumped the shark and they are throwing Trump under the bus with no evidence."

As we know, what kills most people in a fire is the smoke. And it definitely is suffocating the Trump administration right now. And as Eric pointed out, in his words, it is greatly undermining all of these successes in the mind of Donald Trump."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOLLING",
      "utterance": "Can I read something to you. This is why I think this is absolute hypocrisy by the fake, left-leaning mainstream media. You pointed out Kislyak. We were talking about these back channels. December 31, 2014, Bloomberg magazine, the story \"inside Obama's secret outreach to Russia.\" What is going on behind the scenes? But John Kerry has been the point man, I am quoting the article, \"point man on dealing with Russia because of his close relationship with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. They meet often without any staff members present and talk on the phone regularly.\" This is a back channel. The left media didn't go crazy over this one. It was John Kerry and President Obama's State Department but they are going absolutely crazy when it's Donald Trump and Jared Kushner. Give me a break. By the way, Jared Kushner did this before Donald Trump was even president. There -- the accusations."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "But I think the White House is doing a good job, Eric, responding to it. Let's talk about anonymous sources here. Most of the time, they don't have credit. If you are going to put your reporting based on anonymous sources, then it's all on the reporter's credibility. So we got an update here at the inside team here. From Catherine Herridge (ph), that means something to me. The fact that she is saying it. And basically, her reporting was very detailed. A very clear explanation as to who Jared Kushner allegedly talk to, the point of it, the why, the secure line was requested and by Russia, not from Jared Kushner himself. And so all of that makes some sense to me if it indeed comes out to be that way. Most important part, Jared Kushner's anxiousness to get in front of congress and tell his side of the story. That transparency, I think, will start to go a long way."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "I think some of the stories that don't even mention that saying, or if they do, is at the very bottom. He's saying I'll talk to congress but any of these meetings, he continually set up."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHEFFIELD",
      "utterance": "No, actually, and the comparison I think here is in the Obama White House. You had Valerie Jarrett, a very close personal friend from Chicago, who basically was Barack Obama's tell-all. Very close. Where was the left media there? Nowhere."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "When you look at -- I mean, on this program last week, we talked about the Harvard study. I went to Harvard Kennedy School that produced that study. When Harvard of all places, and I can tell you, there is such bias against conservatives in Harvard. When freaking Harvard says that there is leftist bias in the media, that means something. TIMPF",
      "utterance": "I think there are differences though, these allegations, as I mentioned, allegedly wanting to use solely Russia's communication gear. And the fact that he would have done it without, normally you work with the existing administration and."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHEFFIELD",
      "utterance": "The differences is that Barack Obama did not -- he took the Trump win incredibly personally. And the fact that the entire regime was turned against him, that's the difference here. BOLLING: Let me add something right now. This is very important, Kat. You said this is different. Less than hour ago, General Hayden, who is the former director of the NSA under Barack Obama, was on CNN and was asked, did Jared Kushner, based on what you know, all these allegations, did he do anything illegal? And General Hayden unequivocally said, no, he didn't do anything illegal. I wouldn't have advised him to have done that. But he didn't do."
    },

      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "Right, I didn't say."

      "utterance": "But that's the point here."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOLLING",
      "utterance": "We have the left-leaning media and people who are jumping on that bandwagon saying hey, look at all this stuff. Ben mentioned a lot of smoke. Sometimes there is a lot of smoke and no fire at all."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KISSEL",
      "utterance": "But again, that smoke is filling up the room and it's blinding people from being able to see what Donald Trump is doing right in his mind. I mean, also, we have to keep in mind what's happening now with James Comey. He is going to be testifying in front of the senate very soon. If it does come out to be true that Donald Trump tried to impede the investigation into Michael Flynn, then the Russian scandal is moved, because now."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOLLING",
      "utterance": "Hypothetical. You are doing exactly what the left-leaning media is doing. You know what Comey's said? Sure, I will testify. But do you know what else he said? I'm not bringing that smoking gun note that he allegedly wrote right after the meeting that allegedly Donald Trump leaned on him to look the other way."

But if you want to know what people in Ohio think, they want to know about jobs, they want to know about their children. We are preoccupied with this. It's not that this is not important, but every day Americans are being left behind because it's Russia, Russia, Russia."

      "speaker": "KISSEL",
      "utterance": "I think that's absolutely dead on. People do not care about this stuff, and the Democratic Party does have to be careful to not overreach and do a proverbial witch hunt. They need to start focusing on jobs, they need to get the populism message back. And if they don't do that, we're going to see similar results in 2020."

It hasn't been proven. Again, I go back to the Fifth Amendment, innocent until proven guilty, due process. Where is the ACLU on that? Come on, ACLU, defend the Fifth Amendment for President Trump. Where is it?"

I've been very critical on a lot of this media stuff because if and when there is real wrongdoing, to your point, Ben, how many people are going to believe it's because they have cried wolf on this issue for so long that no one even believes half the things that come out of any mainstream media outlets at this point. KISSEL: Let's say that nothing does come out of it. Regardless of all of that, it is remarkable to watch somebody like Donald Trump who ran on the platform of being a magnificent brander, not be able to get in front of these stories and actually create a media narrative that paints him in a more positive light. Now as we see with the leakers, his inner circle is going to get smaller and smaller and smaller. And I don't really see how he is going to get ahead in any of these."

      "utterance": "President Trump reportedly planning a major shakeup and strategy, taking aim at aggressively combating attacks against his administration. The White House is looking to create a, quote, war room, to rapidly respond to any new allegations around the Russia investigation. Hey may also include a staffing overhaul in the White House communications office. Additionally, there may be more rallies around the country so President Trump can speak directly to his supporters. Eboni, after a week away on a foreign policy trip, he comes back to this. This could be a way that Trump resets the narrative and the debates here in America."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Yeah, I think that's important. Look, if I am advising President Trump, we talked about communication and messaging has been (inaudible) challenging for this administration. it's been less about what been going so wrong and more about the narratives coming out of this bin. You talked about this. I think the rallies are great for President Trump. I think get out there and get back in front of your base, primarily rejuvenate, feel better. I think the international trip went very well for the president. I think capitalize on that. We are going to reset it. And guess what? 2018 is not so far away, so I think it's time to put those political points of the board and re-address that. You know, we improve the economy, put a conservative on the Supreme Court, detailed accomplishments out there."
    },

    },
    {
      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "I prefer the transparency but I would like to see Trump playing a larger role. I think rallies really area a good thing for him. The communication strategy has created a lot of additional problems for Trump. The best example this being after Comey was fired and the press team was saying one thing and then Trump said another thing. They have to get that under control. And if that means talking less right now, I would probably be advising him to do that. I would be advising to make sure that they have a unified message that they absolutely no because that's the reason some people are suspicious, he replied to the accusations rather than the accusations themselves. They really need to be more careful."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHEFFIELD",
      "utterance": "Yes, to go connect to the people who brought him there, the people who actually care about making America great again. That's the purpose about this. I got to say, you know, it's easy to get caught up in the east coast bubble media. That's what's been happening here. We've got to get back to the kitchen table effects here. Like you said, Eboni, the fact that the president nominated and put on a conservative on the Supreme Court. That fact that he has approved (inaudible). The fact that he turned the economy on from a regulatory position. The fact that he's going to dismantle Dodd-Frank, which is a destructive force on our economic driving. And so many other things that he should and can be talking about, but he is not because he is getting distracted by the liberal media."

It might not be the friendly crowd that he remembers because now, his policies are coming to (inaudible) and a lot of middle Americans aren't feeling as if he is supporting."

But going back to health care, pre-existing conditions, things like that, that really matters to people. And the fact that they kept, basically it's a 30 percent tax on young people, they don't get health care. That's exactly what Barack Obama did for the most part. There is a lot of anger when it comes to Trump's policies, the biggest one being Trump care."

But the people he surrounded himself with, it's not just Neil Gorsuch. It is about (inaudible) over at the Federal Communications Commission. He is repealing that neutrality which is a job killer. He is sending a budget that is going to put our generation as millennials on a path to success because right now, we are drowning in debt, and I am so glad that Donald Trump won."

Got to get control of that message."

And what did he do? He cleaned house. Exactly what President Trump said he is going to do. He got a brand new chief of staff. He wiped out the old guard, he had a new guard. They turned the ship around and he was tremendously successful."

We need our allies more than ever before and I do understand that we pay over 3 percent of our GDP, the majority of country pay under 2 percent which was sort of a norm that was set.

But now it's time to \"Wake Up, America.\" You know, I cringe when I hear \"Happy Memorial Day\" while Americans celebrate the long weekend, firing up the barbecues, serving the burger, hot dogs and lemonade or a beer. But it's clear to me that, culturally, we've lost sight of what today really should mean. It's a day of remembrance. The growing military-civilian disconnect means our servicemen and women come home to disrespect and almost no support by our society. Think about that for a second. Do we respect these heroes? We should hold our service members at a higher level than our celebrities, our musicians and our athletes. Katy Perry never looked down the barrel of an M-16 at the enemy. Sean Penn never entered an abandoned building teaming with enemy fighters. Kanye West never did advanced reconnaissance for a platoon. Yet, they make billions doing what they do because of our military. The saying \"Freedom isn't free\" means so much, but do we understand the magnitude of that statement? Just for a moment now, think to yourself. Put yourself in one of those soldier's bodies. Imagine the guttural fear and anxiety as you prepare to ambush a terror cell in an abandoned building in some faraway country, a place where the people there likely hate you almost as much as the terrorists inside the building. Meanwhile, thousands of miles away, your family waits for you at home, constantly worrying, will you come back or not? You walk into that dark building. Why? Because that's what you do. You're an American soldier. You fight for the flag. So you get it? These men and women deserve our unequivocal respect. So the next time some liberal fool burns a flag or disrespects a service member, remind them that over a million men and women have given their lives for them, including the right to be anti-American and despicable. And finally, after eight years of the apologist in chief, we bid farewell to Obama's America. And now with Donald Trump, we have a new breed of commander-in-chief. There's now bowing to sheikhs, nor pardoning traitors in Trump's America, just respect for the military. \"Make America great again.\" The left hates the slogan. We patriotic Americans take pride in it. And I will start with Carrie, who has here flag."
