It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is \"The Five.\" Fox News alert, President Trump and the First Lady are at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh to pay their respects to the victims and families of Saturday's attack. We're following the president's visit to Pittsburgh and we'll have updates. In the meantime, we are just one week away from the high stakes midterm elections as President Trump is pulling out all the stops -- blitz of campaign rallies in the final stretch. This as Politico highlights how fierce the battle for control of congress has become, quote, some Republicans deep in Trump country have regained ground, but the handful of bright spots have been outweighed by a tidal wave of Democratic spending and voter support in the closing week of the midterm elections.  In recent days, house Republicans have rushed to fortify a surprise collection of GOP held districts in a half-dozen states that were never expected to be competitive. So, where do we stand? Let's go to our very favorite, Bill Hemmer, who's at the billboard with the latest of all the key races. How are doing up there, Bill?",

And you're going to see for good reason based on all the information we're trying to gather and tell the stories of television for our viewers all across the country next Tuesday night.  Where do we stand on the senate side? We've crunched the numbers. This is where we believe we have lean in likely Republicans at 50 senate seats, leaning likely Democrats at 45. Five real toss-ups according to our data right here in the middle, that's Florida, Indiana, Missouri, Nevada, and Arizona on the senate side. On the house side now, as we go further in the map here, we believe these are the 27 true toss-up house races. Might be a few more, might be a few less, but a 240 to 195 in the current house. This is where we believe the battle will be played out to figure out who takes control of the house after Tuesday night.  Now, closing times, right? What? We're seven days and two hours away from the polls closing. At 7 o'clock east coast time, what do you look for that night? What do you key on? I think at 7 o'clock, Dana, you think about the senate race in Indiana. Good couple of house races in Virginia. I think you think about the governor's race down there in Georgia. At 7:30 as we move into North Carolina, also Ohio, couple of good house races there, and a governor's race as well in the buckeye state. We'll see whether or not Joe Manchin hangs on in West Virginia. Now we're deep into the 8 o'clock hour and you see how much data is now coming into us here in New York. Florida, Missouri, a senate race there. A lot of questions about how Pennsylvania plays out with the redistricting in the house.  We'll move further west throughout the night, 9 o'clock, 10 o'clock, 11 o'clock, California, if it's real close in the house, you have five to eight toss-up seats in the house in California. I know you've got breaking news, Dana. So I'll kick it back to you.",

There you see the first lady paying her respects there. There's -- there were many people there that said, in fact, including that rabbi right there, Rabbi Myers, who said that the president was definitely welcome to come to the synagogue. And the president has said that he had wanted to go from the moment he heard about it and he wanted to make sure he wasn't going to cause any trouble because the president -- is large when he travel anywhere, so they decided to go today. There were five funerals today that were taking place. And there will be, of course, six more, unfortunately.  We'll take it around the table here for thoughts about the images that we're seeing here. Jesse, I'll go to you first.",

Unfortunately, presidents of both parties have had to do this too many times over the last few years with regards to mass shootings. President's always been a close friend of Israel, the Israeli people. And the president have a very strong bond, his son, Jared Kushner is Jewish. And, as you know, the president being from New York City has long been a friend of the Jewish people and visa-versa for many, many years.  Sadly, this has been politicized by many people, and are linking the president to the shooting. I don't see any linkage there. And he's had to punch back from that. Hopefully, you know, after this we can all lay down our arms and stop attacking each other over senseless killings and pointing fingers and playing the blame game. But, you know, I don't have a lot of hope for that right now. The media is obsessed with blaming the president for all acts of violence in this country regardless of political party and motivation. So, you know, this is something the president is going to have to deal with moving forward. But I just think today is a day where we should all just step back and let him pay respects and let this community heal.",

But when you watch the television every night, all you see is division and hatred and finger pointing. And, unfortunately, politicians watch television and they take their cues. For instance, the mayor of Pittsburgh, and the governor, Democrats, refuse to join the president today at this ceremony because, I guess, they felt pressured or they didn't want to align themselves with him. We saw this happen, you know, the Philadelphia Eagles, my favorite football team, unfortunately, refused to go, many of them, almost all of them to the White House to celebrate their Super Bowl victory because of the kneeling controversy. I just wish everybody could stop for a second in moments like this and say let's just be one country together, one America, and maybe the next day we can start going back to politics.

So, I think, in sense, a question is how much do Republicans still lock in to that moment as a driving force, a sense of grievance that we're leaving. Let me just add in terms of the NBC story that Kate Snow, the reporter stands by her reporting. And I must say, I thought when she interviewed Swetnick, it damaged -- it damaged Swetnick and it damaged Avenatti. So, I know your perspective, Greg. But I'm just saying, hey, wait a second, if you were on the side of saying, hey, there's something new here, something that could be damaging to Kavanaugh, actually, it wasn't.",

And still to this day we have no corroborating witnesses or evidence supporting any of the claims from Christine Ford, Debra Ramirez, or Julie Swetnick. And it's even more nefarious than that because you look at the Washington Post, we don't even know if Emma Brown, the reporter there, ever had Ford's notes. She wrote in her column or her story, rather, that she received portions of them that Christine Ford testified under oath that she wasn't sure she gave them the notes or just the summary of it. And then you go to the New Yorker story, Debra Ramirez, herself, said that she was very drunk that night. She was on the floor. She doesn't remember. Ronan Farrow who is one of the authors said that Democrats went out seeking Debra Ramirez's story. Jane Meyer later would tell Elle that she -- in the Me Too era, it is important to establish a pattern of behavior. That is why they aggressively pursued this story from Debra Ramirez. The New York Times said that they interviewed several dozen people and couldn't find a single eyewitness to corroborate the story of Debra Ramirez. So you have three stories without any evidence, no corroborating witnesses, and yet, the media was happy to run these stories to damage Brett Kavanaugh, and it is wrong.",

I don't know who's told him that. Maybe there's a piece of it that he could do. There is no doubt this has been a debate within legal circles for a long time. John Hugh, who worked at the Bush administration, now teaches at Berkeley, thinks there's no way can you do this without an actual constitutional amendment. There are other people like Lindsey Graham who think actually no, the law would say you can do this. Ultimately, that would end up at the Supreme Court. But from communications standpoint, I think President Trump is doing something that he has done before, which is to say, \"I'm going to introduce this issue.\" And then you have the media immediately say, \"Well, that's not true. There are actually 30 other countries that have birthright citizenship. And that's not true.\" And they're nitpicking him on that, when actually, most people would look at that and say, \"Well, wait, why do we do that again? Oh, the 14th Amendment. Well, why do we have the 14th Amendment. Oh, because of the terrible Dred Scott decision. Who came up with the 14th Amendment? It was actually Republicans.\" All of these things. There's another number that I thought was interesting. In 2014 in the United States, 270,000 births in America were to parents that were not in the country legally. That's 7 percent of all births in America. Some people might say, \"Well, that's not so bad. That's actually good.\" I don't know. I think that it is worth everybody having a discussion about this, especially when you have crime and problems where had you just in Queens here about three weeks ago a terrible situation where they called it a Chinese baby farm. And one of the women that was there to help birth the babies went nuts, and she stabbed the baby. She stabbed a mother. Like, this is happening across the country.

It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is \"The Five.\" Fox News alert, President Trump and the First Lady are at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh to pay their respects to the victims and families of Saturday's attack. We're following the president's visit to Pittsburgh and we'll have updates. In the meantime, we are just one week away from the high stakes midterm elections as President Trump is pulling out all the stops -- blitz of campaign rallies in the final stretch. This as Politico highlights how fierce the battle for control of congress has become, quote, some Republicans deep in Trump country have regained ground, but the handful of bright spots have been outweighed by a tidal wave of Democratic spending and voter support in the closing week of the midterm elections.  In recent days, house Republicans have rushed to fortify a surprise collection of GOP held districts in a half-dozen states that were never expected to be competitive. So, where do we stand? Let's go to our very favorite, Bill Hemmer, who's at the billboard with the latest of all the key races. How are doing up there, Bill?"

And you're going to see for good reason based on all the information we're trying to gather and tell the stories of television for our viewers all across the country next Tuesday night.  Where do we stand on the senate side? We've crunched the numbers. This is where we believe we have lean in likely Republicans at 50 senate seats, leaning likely Democrats at 45. Five real toss-ups according to our data right here in the middle, that's Florida, Indiana, Missouri, Nevada, and Arizona on the senate side. On the house side now, as we go further in the map here, we believe these are the 27 true toss-up house races. Might be a few more, might be a few less, but a 240 to 195 in the current house. This is where we believe the battle will be played out to figure out who takes control of the house after Tuesday night. Now, closing times, right? What? We're seven days and two hours away from the polls closing. At 7 o'clock east coast time, what do you look for that night? What do you key on? I think at 7 o'clock, Dana, you think about the senate race in Indiana. Good couple of house races in Virginia. I think you think about the governor's race down there in Georgia. At 7:30 as we move into North Carolina, also Ohio, couple of good house races there, and a governor's race as well in the buckeye state. We'll see whether or not Joe Manchin hangs on in West Virginia. Now we're deep into the 8 o'clock hour and you see how much data is now coming into us here in New York. Florida, Missouri, a senate race there. A lot of questions about how Pennsylvania plays out with the redistricting in the house.  We'll move further west throughout the night, 9 o'clock, 10 o'clock, 11 o'clock, California, if it's real close in the house, you have five to eight toss-up seats in the house in California. I know you've got breaking news, Dana. So I'll kick it back to you."

They're there to pay their respects to the victims of the synagogue massacre that occurred on Saturday at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. There you see the first lady paying her respects there. There's -- there were many people there that said, in fact, including that rabbi right there, Rabbi Myers, who said that the president was definitely welcome to come to the synagogue. And the president has said that he had wanted to go from the moment he heard about it and he wanted to make sure he wasn't going to cause any trouble because the president -- is large when he travel anywhere, so they decided to go today. There were five funerals today that were taking place. And there will be, of course, six more, unfortunately.  We'll take it around the table here for thoughts about the images that we're seeing here. Jesse, I'll go to you first."

Unfortunately, presidents of both parties have had to do this too many times over the last few years with regards to mass shootings. President's always been a close friend of Israel, the Israeli people. And the president have a very strong bond, his son, Jared Kushner is Jewish. And, as you know, the president being from New York City has long been a friend of the Jewish people and visa-versa for many, many years. Sadly, this has been politicized by many people, and are linking the president to the shooting. I don't see any linkage there. And he's had to punch back from that. Hopefully, you know, after this we can all lay down our arms and stop attacking each other over senseless killings and pointing fingers and playing the blame game. But, you know, I don't have a lot of hope for that right now. The media is obsessed with blaming the president for all acts of violence in this country regardless of political party and motivation. So, you know, this is something the president is going to have to deal with moving forward. But I just think today is a day where we should all just step back and let him pay respects and let this community heal."

I know President Trump, as Jesse pointed out, his daughter is Jewish, his son-in-law is Jewish. His grandchildren are Jewish. I think he has a special place in his heart for the Jewish community.

It's difficult time and it's complicated, obviously, by the politics. The question of whether or not the president should have gone there today. The fact that there are protests. The fact that some people had expressed concern, including, as has been widely circulated, the former rabbi of that synagogue is saying that he is a purveyor of hate speech. So, the question is, you know, responsibility and the like, I mean, let it all go for now.  I mean, right now, it's just about, I think, a sense of common humanity with people who were slaughtered in their place of worship. And it's just -- it's just horrible. You know, it makes you wonder where we are as an American people over the last week, bombs, gunfire of this kind, also gunfire in Kentucky where two black people were killed by a white supremacist. It's just very upsetting time to be an American."

They traveled with the president and the first lady today. As I mentioned, the first lady placing white roses and the president placing stones. Jesse, I did want to ask you about something that I think has been pretty remarkable about this story as you learn more about the neighborhood of Squirrel Hill and just how close knit this community has been over the years of people that we know that grew up there, that they've written about, what a beautiful community it is and how they've come together. A rabbi I interviewed today that -- he leads a congregation about 15 minutes away. He said he doesn't know anyone in his congregation that wasn't affected by this massacre because they are so close."

You see a country that loves its neighbors, that loves its family members and its friends and its community, and they go to church and they go to synagogue and they go to baseball games and they feel a sense of one. But when you watch the television every night, all you see is division and hatred and finger pointing. And, unfortunately, politicians watch television and they take their cues. For instance, the mayor of Pittsburgh, and the governor, Democrats, refuse to join the president today at this ceremony because, I guess, they felt pressured or they didn't want to align themselves with him. We saw this happen, you know, the Philadelphia Eagles, my favorite football team, unfortunately, refused to go, many of them, almost all of them to the White House to celebrate their Super Bowl victory because of the kneeling controversy. I just wish everybody could stop for a second in moments like this and say let's just be one country together, one America, and maybe the next day we can start going back to politics. But these are the days where leaders need to all come together and be united."

No one said his rhetoric contributed to an atmosphere where cops were killed. We were all very prudent and responsible.

Nothing close as ever come from the other side. As women in costume suggested a future where Kavanaugh would enslave and brutalize women. Left wing nuts crashed the hearing. Outside they hounded Republicans and don by Democrats. And those defending due process were branded abuse enablers. An entire party tried to pit gender against gender, remember?"

She also accused of Avenatti of twisting her words, surprise? Yet, this news went nowhere allowing the attacks on the Kavanaugh's to flourish, or what Pelosi like to call collateral damage. And now a day before Halloween, the same blind self-obsessed media who aided one of the ugliest spectacles in recent history are knocking at your door demanding soul searching from you and me.

They also spiked the Ronan Farrow expose on Harvey Weinstein because the parent company had a business relationship with Weinstein Studio. And also, how about the Cory Booker story? You know, Cory Booker was credibly accused of forcing, allegedly, someone to perform oral sex on him in a bathroom just recently. And the alleged victim went to Ronan Farrow, and Ronan Farrow didn't touch the story. So I'm wondering why not? Did it have anything to do with Cory Booker being a Democrat?  And two, maybe we should use the Kavanaugh standard for Booker. I mean, guilty until proven innocent. And the media telling you to tone down the rhetoric? I mean, that's like an alcoholic telling to you stop drinking. It's like, no, you're the drunk. You're the drunk. You guys have been saying the president is mentally-ill, racist, Nazi, Russian traitor who needs to be frog marched out of the White House.

What we've seen, I think, just in the last week is a drop in the president's approval ratings, even before the shooting took place. So, I think, in sense, a question is how much do Republicans still lock in to that moment as a driving force, a sense of grievance that we're leaving. Let me just add in terms of the NBC story that Kate Snow, the reporter stands by her reporting. And I must say, I thought when she interviewed Swetnick, it damaged -- it damaged Swetnick and it damaged Avenatti. So, I know your perspective, Greg.

And still to this day we have no corroborating witnesses or evidence supporting any of the claims from Christine Ford, Debra Ramirez, or Julie Swetnick. And it's even more nefarious than that because you look at the Washington Post, we don't even know if Emma Brown, the reporter there, ever had Ford's notes. She wrote in her column or her story, rather, that she received portions of them that Christine Ford testified under oath that she wasn't sure she gave them the notes or just the summary of it. And then you go to the New Yorker story, Debra Ramirez, herself, said that she was very drunk that night. She was on the floor. She doesn't remember. Ronan Farrow who is one of the authors said that Democrats went out seeking Debra Ramirez's story. Jane Meyer later would tell Elle that she -- in the Me Too era, it is important to establish a pattern of behavior. That is why they aggressively pursued this story from Debra Ramirez. The New York Times said that they interviewed several dozen people and couldn't find a single eyewitness to corroborate the story of Debra Ramirez. So you have three stories without any evidence, no corroborating witnesses, and yet, the media was happy to run these stories to damage Brett Kavanaugh, and it is wrong."

Twelve years of being very liberal. She's to the left of where Missouri is. You should vote for me instead. And I also think that a little bit of this is chickens coming home to roost.

It's an issue that we talked about on the campaign, and we should do something about it. I don't know if he's specifically is saying that -- well, he saying that he could do it by executive order. I don't know who's told him that. Maybe there's a piece of it that he could do. There is no doubt this has been a debate within legal circles for a long time. John Hugh, who worked at the Bush administration, now teaches at Berkeley, thinks there's no way can you do this without an actual constitutional amendment. There are other people like Lindsey Graham who think actually no, the law would say you can do this. Ultimately, that would end up at the Supreme Court. But from communications standpoint, I think President Trump is doing something that he has done before, which is to say, \"I'm going to introduce this issue.\" And then you have the media immediately say, \"Well, that's not true. There are actually 30 other countries that have birthright citizenship. And that's not true.\" And they're nitpicking him on that, when actually, most people would look at that and say, \"Well, wait, why do we do that again? Oh, the 14th Amendment. Well, why do we have the 14th Amendment. Oh, because of the terrible Dred Scott decision. Who came up with the 14th Amendment? It was actually Republicans.\" All of these things. There's another number that I thought was interesting. In 2014 in the United States, 270,000 births in America were to parents that were not in the country legally. That's 7 percent of all births in America. Some people might say, \"Well, that's not so bad. That's actually good.\" I don't know. I think that it is worth everybody having a discussion about this, especially when you have crime and problems where had you just in Queens here about three weeks ago a terrible situation where they called it a Chinese baby farm. And one of the women that was there to help birth the babies went nuts, and she stabbed the baby. She stabbed a mother. Like, this is happening across the country. It's not wrong to have a conversation about it. When the president's opponents immediately go to nitpicking him on little things, they miss the big picture once again."
