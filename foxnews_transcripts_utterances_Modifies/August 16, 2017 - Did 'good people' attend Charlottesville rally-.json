      "sentences": "Hello, everyone. I'm Kat Timpf along with Eboni K. Williams and David Webb. This is The Fox News Specialists. President Trump is disbanding two of his business councils amid the controversy over his Charlottesville response. The decision this afternoon follows an exodus of executive members. The president tweeting, quote, rather than putting pressure on the business people of the manufacturing council and strategy and policy forum, I am ending both. Thank you all. Also today, the memorial service was held for Heather Heyer, the 32-year-old woman killed in Saturday domestic terror attack in Charlottesville, her parents delivering emotional speeches about their daughter's life and legacy.  HEYER’S FATHER: I came here today and I was overwhelmed. I was overwhelmed at the rainbow of colors in this room. That's how Heather was. It didn't matter who you were or where you were from, she loved you. That was it. You were stuck. So, for that, I'm truly proud of my daughter.  HEATHER HAYER’S MOTHER: They tried to kill my child to shut her up. Well, guess what? You just magnified her.  HEYER’S MOTHER: I'd rather have my child, but by golly if I've got to give her up, we're going to make it count.",

Before I speak to Trump, which I know we will get to President Trump much of the hour. I just want to speak to her parents. The courage -- and I don't know their belief system. As a Christian it spoke to me the courage to say they tried to shut her up and she will be magnified. That is certainly how my higher power works, Kat, in the face of opposition when the enemy tries to take you out, whoever that enemy may be for whatever reason, goodness is amplified and it spreads like wildfire. And in this moment, I am so inspired and humbled by that leadership from her parents, and I really hope -- much like with the massacre in Charleston, where those nine parishioners were shot and killed just for their belief system.",

She went out there to do what is her constitutional right and her God-given right in this country to protest under the first amendment in whatever way we don't know why, how, who she belonged to, nor should that be the main focus. But I'm also a little bit shocked at the limits of intellectual cowardice on this issue on the left and the right in this country. The fact is there were many groups that came there, primarily hate. There was the protest, of course, being led by the neo Nazis, all right. Nobody, I mean who in this country wants Nazis or fascists? They were the black lives matter.",

They're not the story. They're not the ones being talked about here. And the intellectual coward is to sit here and pars words rather than looking at the reality of who was in Charlottesville, and I would rather talk as I do on my radio show to people who are there reporting on what happened there, watching the videos, rather than the hyperbolic behavior going on by Republicans, Democrats, on all sides.",

      "utterance": "Hello, everyone. I'm Kat Timpf along with Eboni K. Williams and David Webb. This is The Fox News Specialists. President Trump is disbanding two of his business councils amid the controversy over his Charlottesville response. The decision this afternoon follows an exodus of executive members. The president tweeting, quote, rather than putting pressure on the business people of the manufacturing council and strategy and policy forum, I am ending both. Thank you all. Also today, the memorial service was held for Heather Heyer, the 32-year-old woman killed in Saturday domestic terror attack in Charlottesville, her parents delivering emotional speeches about their daughter's life and legacy. HEYER’S FATHER: I came here today and I was overwhelmed. I was overwhelmed at the rainbow of colors in this room. That's how Heather was. It didn't matter who you were or where you were from, she loved you. That was it. You were stuck. So, for that, I'm truly proud of my daughter. HEATHER HAYER’S MOTHER: They tried to kill my child to shut her up. Well, guess what? You just magnified her. HEYER’S MOTHER: I'd rather have my child, but by golly if I've got to give her up, we're going to make it count."

      "utterance": "Kat, this is hard for everybody. I think we've all -- this has been a heavy difficult day to work in news. Before I speak to Trump, which I know we will get to President Trump much of the hour. I just want to speak to her parents. The courage -- and I don't know their belief system. As a Christian it spoke to me the courage to say they tried to shut her up and she will be magnified. That is certainly how my higher power works, Kat, in the face of opposition when the enemy tries to take you out, whoever that enemy may be for whatever reason, goodness is amplified and it spreads like wildfire. And in this moment, I am so inspired and humbled by that leadership from her parents, and I really hope -- much like with the massacre in Charleston, where those nine parishioners were shot and killed just for their belief system."

      "utterance": "Well, I've got a couple thoughts and some of them aren't very popular, and they won't be with either one of you. One, I want to address her as you all did. She went out there to do what is her constitutional right and her God-given right in this country to protest under the first amendment in whatever way we don't know why, how, who she belonged to, nor should that be the main focus. But I'm also a little bit shocked at the limits of intellectual cowardice on this issue on the left and the right in this country. The fact is there were many groups that came there, primarily hate. There was the protest, of course, being led by the neo Nazis, all right. Nobody, I mean who in this country wants Nazis or fascists? They were the black lives matter."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WEBB",
      "utterance": "Let me finish. There were the Antifa people. And to the president's words, if you don't read Politico, then corrected themselves, if you actually look at it for what it is, there were many faces of hate. There were also people who said do we erase the history, they were protesting peacefully. They're not the story. There were people who said take it down. They were protesting peacefully. They're not the story. They're not the ones being talked about here. And the intellectual coward is to sit here and pars words rather than looking at the reality of who was in Charlottesville, and I would rather talk as I do on my radio show to people who are there reporting on what happened there, watching the videos, rather than the hyperbolic behavior going on by Republicans, Democrats, on all sides."

      "utterance": "To have a conversation about the removal of the monument is fine, and we can have that debate all day long. I'm sure we will get into it. For me, anyways, Kat, and I want your take, this has to be about the loss of her life, why it happened and what we're going to do about it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WEBB",
      "utterance": "So how many news reports are actually about the murderer and her death over the president's words. When you look at the total media coverage, they're covering the president's words and parsing it."

Let's meet today's specialists. She is a Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate from Michigan, the co- owner of Vesco Oil, and the Michigan co-chair for Donald Trump's presidential campaign, so she specializes in all things politics, Lena Epstein is here. And he's a rock and roll legend, selling 40 million albums in his career, he received the prestigious James Fenimore Cooper Award for his accomplishments as a writer, and was named Michigan's conservationist of the year, and he specialized in planting trees, he's been recognized by the national harbor day foundation for mentoring kids in the fine art of tree planting, Ted Nugent is here. A lot of Michigan people. I'm from Michigan. Michigan, Michigan."

And my issue -- the things that David were talking about, people, good people in this rally, you know, just want the monument to say. For me, if you're a good person and you're in a rally and people start marching, Jews will not replace us, and you stay there. You are not a good person. You go home or you shouldn't be there in the first place. There's no good people at a white nationalists rally marching along with people who are saying Jews will not replace us. I've think that's uncomplicated."

And I'm deeply concerned about the state of this country and that's why I'm running for the United States Senate to fight for Michigan residents and the American people. With that said, I also support a president who has come off strongly against racism and bigotry and violence. There is no room for this in our country. And we all agree on that."

      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",

For me, he evocated, for me, he was ambiguous, I obviously said my piece on the docket, but I think that hesitance is an issue for some people."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WEBB",
      "utterance": "But the geography, real quick, matters here, because you say they were there marching, people marching with them. First of all, I don't know how many of you have been to Charlottesville, but I've actually sat down and had a dinner at a restaurant on that street a block away from this happened, and I'm going it tell you the geography of this. You had both sides going at it. The neo Nazis and you had the Antifa, black lives matter group. Those are about a couple hundred people combined. Then away from that were the people that were actually protesting on any side of this peacefully without getting involved. The total number in that area some estimate around a thousand. So you ought to pay attention and not also put the people that were there for whatever reason who were peaceful under the constitution with the people that were there to spread their hate and violent clashes."

All lives matter, and we condemn all violence. Those are bad words. Why are those bad words? What planet are you from? We condemn all violence. That's what President Trump said. And all lives matter.

First, we're discussing, and Ted you addressed the president's words and you talk about it. Then you bring in the charge against the man. They are not mixed. They are part of an event, different facets. So for you to sit here and talk about the driver and insert that into the comment about the president, you need to clearly separate them.

It's Hollywood doing what Hollywood does. Now Michael Moore is a different story. This is a man who glorifies communism.

And with all due respect to David Crosby, if any is due, here is a bloated carcass that has abused his body all his life. He's a repository for every drug and chemical known to man.

We have our agreements, disagreements, our differences of opinion, and our different approaches. That's what makes this country great. And our First Amendment rights matter in this country.
