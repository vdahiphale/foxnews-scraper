In reality, she's the candidate the Democrats haven't teed off on, but they will tee off on her if she's the nominee. She won't be, but if she is, she will face exactly what Donald Trump has faced for the past six years.

So, the idea that the Democrats want him to be the nominee when they're throwing everything against the wall to throw him off the ballot, it's insane, nobody actually believes that. I think broadly speaking, Republican voters recognize not only was Donald Trump a good president in the past, he'll be a good president in the future and he has survived the machine. I've tasted a little bit of this. Most Republican politicians taste some small piece of this. Trump has faced an onslaught of character assassination, hundreds of millions of dollars, maybe billions of dollars of attack ads. Surviving in the face of that is maybe the most important signal of whether you are a winning candidate and I think Trump has survived it better than anybody I've seen in politics.",

He didn't build the wall. He didn't get Mexico to pay for it. He ran up $7.8 trillion of debt. He fumbled the repeal of Obamacare. There's so many mispromises. He gave a commendation and award to Dr. Fauci after he shut down our country and hasn't held anybody at the FDA or the CDC responsible. So you know, let's hold that guy accountable.

The border states have been pushed north in this conversation, too. The chaos around President Trump is not going to go away, not because it's not going to go away from the legal issues, but you have his two chief opponents, DeSantis and Haley raising this over and over again, and that will be used much like some of the things that Dean Phillips may be saying against President Biden will be used against him. The Democrats are banking on two things, that women's health choice and women's health rights continue to be in the forefront, and two, that the economy continues to improve and consumer sentiment improves. If we find ourselves six months from now with a different kind of economic state and a mood on the part of the American voter, President Biden will be in a better position. But Biden has one big challenge. A majority of Democrats wish there might be another person running on top of the ticket. I wish I was six, seven. I'm not. So I don't know if that will come true, and if that will cause them not to vote for Biden. But I think what Brit said is what Democrats on the flip side are hoping for. We're going to be able to attract Independent and Republican voters who may be concerned about the chaos in the women's health issues.

But I guess my response to that voter would be, Nikki does have baggage. She just hasn't faced the onslaught of years of media attacks, of super PAC attacks that Donald Trump has faced. And, frankly, the fact that Trump is still standing and is still leading in the polls against Joe Biden suggests he has real political resilience. I know a lot of people who are choosing Nikki Haley think she's the low baggage candidate. In reality, she's the candidate the Democrats haven't teed off on, but they will tee off on her if she's the nominee. She won't be, but if she is, she will face exactly what Donald Trump has faced for the past six years. And I don't think she'll survive, and I certainly don't think she'll win the presidency through it. That's why we need to elect the guy who's shown some resilience. That's why we need to nominate Donald Trump."

I don't think that's true of anything close to the majority of the polls. But again, I go back to something I said a little bit earlier, Nikki Haley has not faced the Democrat and media machine for six years. And we have to ask ourselves, not what polls will say today, but what do polls say when Democrats run ads saying that Nikki Haley wants to slash your Social Security so that she can send more money to foreign countries? That is exactly what they're going to do because that is, in fact, what Nikki Haley says she wants to do out on the campaign trail. We have to remember negative ads --"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BREAM",
      "utterance": "Well, to be fair, I don't think on the campaign trail, she's telling people that she's going to cut Social Security to send money to other countries, but -- and we pressed her on this, she does talk about potentially raising retirement age for people now in their 20s entering the system. So, definitely talking about changes to entitlements and her foreign policy breaks with the foreign president, as well. We'll talk a little bit more about that. In the meantime, Governor DeSantis is out there saying there's a reason that people want President Trump to win and he thinks it's to benefit the other side. Here's his take."

    {
      "speaker": "GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BREAM",
      "utterance": "So, polls do show that the president would lose some support from folks who say now that he would be their choice if he is convicted, innocent until proven guilty. We've got a long way to go on that road. But with that in mind, do you tell GOP voters this is a gamble that you're going to have to take, how do you convince them it's worth it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "VANCE",
      "utterance": "Well, Shannon, I just -- I'm sorry, I just don't think that Ron's point passes the smell test there. They're trying to do everything that they can to remove him from the ballot. Even moderate Democrats are coming out and saying some of the tricks that they're using against Donald Trump don't even pass constitutional muster. So, the idea that the Democrats want him to be the nominee when they're throwing everything against the wall to throw him off the ballot, it's insane, nobody actually believes that. I think broadly speaking, Republican voters recognize not only was Donald Trump a good president in the past, he'll be a good president in the future and he has survived the machine. I've tasted a little bit of this. Most Republican politicians taste some small piece of this. Trump has faced an onslaught of character assassination, hundreds of millions of dollars, maybe billions of dollars of attack ads. Surviving in the face of that is maybe the most important signal of whether you are a winning candidate and I think Trump has survived it better than anybody I've seen in politics."

But we've just got this CNN poll that has it much closer. Trump at 50 percent, Haley at 39 percent, DeSantis again at 6 percent. You know here the largest group in New Hampshire is undeclared. They can vote in the GOP primary. There are a couple of newspaper editorials today endorsing Nikki Haley, telling people if you're independent, get out, quote, save the country and vote in that GOP primary. I mean, that's a substantial group of people here. How concerned are you about them showing up and not choosing President Trump on Tuesday?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "VANCE",
      "utterance": "Well, Shannon, we have to draw a distinction between independent minded and New Hampshire voters. I think a lot of them are going to vote for Donald Trump, but also liberal -- many of them from Massachusetts who are moving to New Hampshire, they're never going to vote for a Republican nominee, even if it's Nikki Haley. They're just trying to play spoiler to Donald Trump. But I think Republicans really have to ask ourselves, do we want liberal suburbanites from Massachusetts to choose our nominee or do we want to choose our nominee as Republicans and independent-minded conservatives? I think if we choose our nominee, Donald Trump is going to win and he's going to win handily. By the way, Shannon, this campaign strategy of getting liberals to vote for you in a Republican primary, it doesn't work nationally. It won't work in South Carolina. It won't work in Ohio. It won't work in most other states. We actually need to select our nominee with voters who we can actually get, not with voters who are trying to play spoiler because they hate Donald Trump and they hate the Republican Party."

      "utterance": "I think the President certainly agrees. In fact, I come from a party of sort of ancestral Democrats who migrated to the Republican Party in large part because of Donald Trump's message. But it's one thing to get Democrats who are open-minded to vote for you. And it's another thing to get Democrats who are never going to vote for Republicans to vote for you.

And Shannon, she has got the 8 factors. She attracts voters from all different sides because she's -- they like her and they like what she's saying, and her optimism.

But Nikki gives people a reason to vote for her and that's what's so attractive about her and that's why she's -- that's why she's gaining. And, you know, people like what they see.

I'm sorry, when you have a president like the pressures they're going to be facing, when you see what they're going to have to do to attract new talent into Congress and the Senate, you've got to go to work doing that. Nikki will do that. And the other big thing that people need to know, Donald Trump can only give you four years. That's like a football team can only play half of the game. It's going to take eight years to get this country straight. But Nikki's youth and the fact that she can give eight years, and I would also make the argument it's really three years because the last year of a term is political like you're seeing now. And President Trump is going to be tied up in legal fights and we need somebody that can come in and work. And the criticism that he has of her, the only reason he's doing that is because she's gaining in the polls and he knows she is a serious threat and it's a two-person race now."

And the same thing, you know, he got her confused yesterday with Nancy Pelosi on the January 6 with the National Guard. And I would say 25 years ago he wouldn't have made that mistake but he kept saying, Nikki Haley did this, you know, with the National Guard. He was talking about Nancy Pelosi.

You know, we're -- I'll be going to New Hampshire later today, but the real fight I think is in South Carolina, and that's where Nikki Haley, I think, stumbles. She's going to miss expectations and not even win her own state."

You asked me to do something. I have a success rate. Here's my legislative record. And he's contrasted that against both Governor Haley and also President Trump, saying there were a number of things that he promised that he didn't get done. Why do you think that isn't resonating better with voters? Is it a choice of policy versus personality? Why isn't that landing with voters?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MASSIE",
      "utterance": "Well, let me talk about that difference and talk about why it might not be resonating. First of all, you know, the main thing I hear from people back home is they're mad that nobody's held accountable in Washington, D.C. Well, I think we need to hold Trump accountable. He didn't build the wall. He didn't get Mexico to pay for it. He ran up $7.8 trillion of debt. He fumbled the repeal of Obamacare. There's so many mispromises. He gave a commendation and award to Dr. Fauci after he shut down our country and hasn't held anybody at the FDA or the CDC responsible. So you know, let's hold that guy accountable. Contrast that with Ron DeSantis. He reduced the debt in Florida 25%. He fired the Soros DAs. He got all the wokeness out of their schools and their universities and he banned China from buying land there. So he's got a great contrast. They don't want to talk about it. They won't debate him now. Neither Nikki Haley nor the president because his record is so stellar and they don't -- neither of them have much to run on. Why isn't it resonating? I would say people have rallied to Trump's defense because he's been indicted four times. And, you know, I feel compelled to rally to his defense because that's an attack on all of us. But here's the problem. You know, this summer we're going to be lit -- they're going to be litigating these cases in the court and these indictments are going to ripen into convictions. And we're going to be talking about the finer points of whether you can pay a porn star with your campaign money or whether you should write it off as a business expense. I mean, the lawsuit itself is ridiculous, but the underlying facts aren't disputed. And I think people are going to kind of recoil from that when all that stuff starts coming out this summer. And the polls that show him beating Biden, those are going to switch very quickly."

We'll see if that continues as this do progress. You are one of very few people in Congress who's actually campaigning for someone who is not President Trump. You have said, quote, \"It's a political risk.\" How much do you think all of those congressional endorsements in the neighborhood of about 140 at this point are about a fear of President Trump versus love his policies, love him, thinks he's the best candidate? What kind of price do you think you might pay if he wins?"

I said it was going to cause inflation, that it would cause shortages. And oh, by the way, it funded the mail-in ballots and spent $2 trillion. Contrast that with Ron DeSantis. He called me up while everybody was hating on me, including that president, and said, I'm going to open our economy and make sure our kids go to school. Now, Trump came at me and I won my reelection, so I'm not worried about it, but I think there are, a lot of those endorsements aren't wholehearted endorsements. They're either afraid that he will get involved in their primaries, or they're afraid that if he does win, he'll be vindictive. You know, Ron DeSantis can work with anybody. And so there's no vindication expected from him after he wins, so that's -- you know, that's just the way it is. It's sort of bullying tactics from the former president."

Then we go to South Carolina where she's going to lose this. Look, I think what we're seeing is that the only way you can beat Trump is if it's a head-to-head race between two people. And the question is, is that person going to be Nikki Haley or Ron DeSantis? Nikki Haley's ideology is somewhere in the zip code of John McCain, Mitt Romney and Liz Cheney, and she said that Hillary Clinton was her inspiration. She has a ceiling in these primaries that are closed primaries where only Republicans can vote of about 35%. She can't beat Donald Trump. Ron DeSantis can. And as I said, as these indictments matriculate into convictions and we start learning about the details in this stuff, his poll numbers are going to go upside down against Biden.

It's very hard for a governor to endorse somebody when you have, you know, I mean, Henry McMaster was the lieutenant governor under her. And he endorsed me.

He knew who it was and maybe at some later point he'd tell us who it was, that he said there's a 25% chance, but that's a good person who he's thinking about. I think his thought process overall, Shannon, was that he feels like he's in a good place. This rally here was really well attended, was really packed. He likes that thinks it's a poll in and of itself. And at the end of that rally, he brought out all of these South Carolina figures to say the next stop is going to be even bigger."

And Martha, one of the things I asked these Trump voters about these legal fights, you heard the lady there who was like, oh no, it's made me double down even more on supporting him. They see it as -- well, his team has always seen it as a plus, not a minus? MARTHA MACCALLUM, \"THE STORY\" ANCHOR: Well, I think that soundbite's extraordinary and I think it encapsulates a lot of what we hear from these Trump voters. They feel that they have a need to be there for him, right? They're saying, he's being attacked, so more than ever we need to be there for him. And I would also just point out that in early 2023, Ron DeSantis was polling in first place in New Hampshire, OK? And what have you had in the interim? You've had all of these successive indictments and court dates and he went back for court dates he didn't even need to be at over the course of the last week.

First, the border security is the number one issue on Republican voters' minds, and I would even contend independent voters' minds, even if you're not a border state. The border states have been pushed north in this conversation, too. The chaos around President Trump is not going to go away, not because it's not going to go away from the legal issues, but you have his two chief opponents, DeSantis and Haley raising this over and over again, and that will be used much like some of the things that Dean Phillips may be saying against President Biden will be used against him. The Democrats are banking on two things, that women's health choice and women's health rights continue to be in the forefront, and two, that the economy continues to improve and consumer sentiment improves. If we find ourselves six months from now with a different kind of economic state and a mood on the part of the American voter, President Biden will be in a better position. But Biden has one big challenge. A majority of Democrats wish there might be another person running on top of the ticket. I wish I was six, seven. I'm not. So I don't know if that will come true, and if that will cause them not to vote for Biden. But I think what Brit said is what Democrats on the flip side are hoping for. We're going to be able to attract Independent and Republican voters who may be concerned about the chaos in the women's health issues. But if Donald Trump or whomever it is, is able to attract on the border, this is a jump ball come November."

We turn back now to the panel. So, along with what's happening on the campaign trail, there are a lot of shenanigans in Washington as well. They're fighting over this Senate border deal. We don't know the contours. We think we have some idea of it coming together. But we're told it's dead on arrival in the House.

He knows how slim the margin is in terms of what he can get across the - across the finish line. But, you know, the issue that I think has become so compelling in this whole election environment and in Washington is immigration. I mean when you have people in urban centers across the country, heavily blue areas who are very upset about what's going on with immigration, they want more than just a deal that appears to basically throw some more money at the problem and continue to support Ukraine. So, I think it's become very troublesome. I mean I look at the morning show host, Charlamagne tha God, who is saying that working class people are very upset over this migrant crisis.

You've got Congressman Dan Crenshaw talking about how there's this accusation that some Republicans are not going to let this go because they think it's a good issue for them and they don't want to give a win to President Biden. He's quoted as saying, how many hundreds of thousands of illegals would you allow in the country just because it might help your chance of the election.

We haven't even seen the language of the Senate compromise as of yet. It is a powerful issue. I thought it was a powerful issue prior to 2022. Abortion and threat to democracy turned out to be a bigger issue than we thought it would be. I think, to Martha's point, this has bubbled up to the top, not just for border states, but all over the country.

And for President Trump, it confounds me a bit, he's out talking about border - border security and immigration, but is encouraging Republicans to blow up the compromise. Dan Crenshaw had it just right. I don't agree with Dan Crenshaw on a whole bunch of stuff, but he's exactly right, how many more illegals do you want to come in if - if it - if you believe you're going to advantage the other party by passing policy? You're telling me we won't arrest criminals because it's going to help Democratic mayors?

The ones that have happened between the White House and Netanyahu. One of them ending with this conversation is over apparently on - on the part of President Biden. I think, you know, the president has not - and it's not the first time this has happened -- articulated where he stands on this issue in a way that is helping Americans and his voters, Democrat voters, independent voters, understand where he stands on this. The other thing is, that, you know, for - for some kind of solution to happen, you need to have the support of the Arab countries and leadership from the Arab countries to help see that happen. And - and so far, you know, we're - we're not seeing President Biden push for that in a way that people can get behind and see him as a leader on this issue."

      "utterance": "That's right, the current president of the United States is not on his party's primary ballot here in New Hampshire. Democrats have been haggling for more than a year over their primary calendar, forcing early states, Iowa and New Hampshire, to fight for their key spots at the top. New Hampshire state law mandates that it is the first in the nation primary. A position it refused to seed. But the DNC has officially put South Carolina at the front of the line, meaning, New Hampshire Democrats are essentially holding an unsanctioned primary that won't get to award any delegates. Much to the consternation of candidate Marianne Williamson, who is on the ballot."

He went on, of course, to rebound in South Carolina with the help of Congressman Jim Clyburn. That state is now the first recognized Democrat contest of the cycle. And Fox News will have complete coverage of the New Hampshire voting on Tuesday. That is it for us today. We will spread out, keep you informed on what voters here have to say as we had into this final day of getting ready for the first primary sanctioned by Republicans, not by Democrats this time around here in New Hampshire. I'm Shannon Bream. Have a great week. We'll see you next FOX NEWS SUNDAY."
