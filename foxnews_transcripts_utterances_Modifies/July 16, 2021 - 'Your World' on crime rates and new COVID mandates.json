      "sentences": "All right, minutes away at the White House of Joe Biden and Angela Merkel of Germany having their final session  together, if you will.  This is the fourth U.S. president with whom the German leader has had to  deal. She's had some acrimonious relationships in the past. They are divided on a key issue that just might come up that this presser today.  But the fact of the matter is, she has been one of the longest-serving Western leaders, certainly in recent history, 16 years as chancellor of  Germany. She had her contentious back-and-forths with Donald Trump. Wonder   if that will come up today in discussions, but a joint presser between the two of them moments away. We're on it when they get to the microphone.   In the meantime, we are following another big story today also from Washington, the Federal Reserve chairman, Jerome Powell, on the hot seat, this time speaking before the Senate Banking Committee to say, yes, I see  inflation, but I don't see it around very long, once again echoing his   views that all of this is transitory and so far not an issue to change policy right away, or to start hiking interest rates right away, or to do  any of the other things that the markets generally fear when you have to respond to inflation.  But the price threats are real. And the inflation is real too, CEOs almost  universally sounding the alarm on the issue and, according to an Axios report, acknowledging that this president right now doesn't see it the same  way. That's the problem.   You see it in the grocery store. You see it at the gas pump, but what can be done if it sticks around even a little while? We're going to explore that first with Edward Lawrence at the White House  with more.  Hey, Edward.",

You might have noticed that, as Hillary was speaking there, at the bottom right corner of the screen, you were probably asking, then, Neil, why the heck were stocks up? The reason why they have been up throughout all this inflationary talk and fears, spiraling costs at the grocery store.  They see that as a reflection of a strong economy, that the demand is building, and that's all net good. And a lot of them believe, as Jerome Powell has been saying, that this might not last very long. But it is a little weird, because if this does accelerate to the degree it could, it could bring back the 1970s. That's the big fear. A lot of people are too young to remember that. I could tell you, it was not pleasant to inflationary spirals then.  Charlie Gasparino was way too young to remember. But that is the fear. But, Charlie, you wouldn't see it, right, in the markets. Stimulus is stimulus An uptick in inflation is an uptick in economic activity. So they're looking at the half-full glass, I guess, right?",

I don't think the markets are going to react to inflation until Jerome Powell throws in the towel and says we're going to raise rates. And I think that's the whole -- that's the bet here on the markets. If he doesn't raise rates, and still a lot of people betting he's not, the markets are going to be where they are or higher. I will say this, though, he sounded a lot -- he sounded like he was setting the groundwork for raising rates. He was much more adamant that inflation has caught him by surprise. And if it did catch him by surprise, I think there's a good chance he might not last into a second term. I think, particularly if Republicans take over the Senate, they're going to want his scalp for really missing the boat on inflation, because he's -- I mean, Fed policy is one of the main drivers here of inflation. It's one of the main drivers of the various bubbles in the stock market. If you want to talk about meme stocks that have no rationale for going up, the only rationale is that it's very -- people are going out on the risk spectrum because interest rates are so low. So he's under -- he's going to be under a lot of pressure, if he really -- if this thing isn't transitory. And I will tell you this. What was striking to me, I know Edward mentioned Jamie Dimon of J.P. Morgan Chase talking about inflation and that it's probably transitory. But Larry Fink of BlackRock, the biggest money management firm, $9 trillion under management, is talking about it. And the interesting thing about BlackRock, Larry Fink is that many of his deputies are in the Biden administration. I mean, they're -- Brian Deese runs the NEC. And there's a bunch of others.",

I mean, think about the Biden administration's first move to kick us out of the Keystone XL pipeline, to stop drilling on federal lands. All of this increases the price of energy. Every good that we buy has to be moved. Those goods are now inherently more expensive. You look at what's happening to the housing market. Housing prices are up dramatically. You look at people here in my home state of Tennessee, people are feeling this in a very real sense. The goods and the services that they're purchasing have all become incredibly more expensive. And if you look at the move, month over month, from last month to this, and annualize it, we're talking about a 12 percent increase. The Fed has been talking about long term 2 percent goal of inflation, and that they're willing to overshoot slightly, but we're way beyond slight in this most recent number.

This is the fourth U.S. president with whom the German leader has had to deal. She's had some acrimonious relationships in the past. They are divided on a key issue that just might come up that this presser today. But the fact of the matter is, she has been one of the longest-serving Western leaders, certainly in recent history, 16 years as chancellor of Germany. She had her contentious back-and-forths with Donald Trump. Wonder if that will come up today in discussions, but a joint presser between the two of them moments away. We're on it when they get to the microphone. In the meantime, we are following another big story today also from Washington, the Federal Reserve chairman, Jerome Powell, on the hot seat, this time speaking before the Senate Banking Committee to say, yes, I see inflation, but I don't see it around very long, once again echoing his views that all of this is transitory and so far not an issue to change policy right away, or to start hiking interest rates right away, or to do any of the other things that the markets generally fear when you have to respond to inflation. But the price threats are real. And the inflation is real too, CEOs almost universally sounding the alarm on the issue and, according to an Axios report, acknowledging that this president right now doesn't see it the same way. That's the problem. You see it in the grocery store. You see it at the gas pump, but what can be done if it sticks around even a little while?

They see that as a reflection of a strong economy, that the demand is building, and that's all net good.

And I think that's the whole -- that's the bet here on the markets. If he doesn't raise rates, and still a lot of people betting he's not, the markets are going to be where they are or higher. I will say this, though, he sounded a lot -- he sounded like he was setting the groundwork for raising rates. He was much more adamant that inflation has caught him by surprise. And if it did catch him by surprise, I think there's a good chance he might not last into a second term. I think, particularly if Republicans take over the Senate, they're going to want his scalp for really missing the boat on inflation, because he's -- I mean, Fed policy is one of the main drivers here of inflation. It's one of the main drivers of the various bubbles in the stock market. If you want to talk about meme stocks that have no rationale for going up, the only rationale is that it's very -- people are going out on the risk spectrum because interest rates are so low. So he's under -- he's going to be under a lot of pressure, if he really -- if this thing isn't transitory. And I will tell you this. What was striking to me, I know Edward mentioned Jamie Dimon of J.P. Morgan Chase talking about inflation and that it's probably transitory. But Larry Fink of BlackRock, the biggest money management firm, $9 trillion under management, is talking about it. And the interesting thing about BlackRock, Larry Fink is that many of his deputies are in the Biden administration. I mean, they're -- Brian Deese runs the NEC. And there's a bunch of others."

But a lot of the policies that are being put in place by the Biden administration are long-term policies that are inherently inflationary. I mean, think about the Biden administration's first move to kick us out of the Keystone XL pipeline, to stop drilling on federal lands. All of this increases the price of energy. Every good that we buy has to be moved. Those goods are now inherently more expensive. You look at what's happening to the housing market. Housing prices are up dramatically. You look at people here in my home state of Tennessee, people are feeling this in a very real sense. The goods and the services that they're purchasing have all become incredibly more expensive. And if you look at the move, month over month, from last month to this, and annualize it, we're talking about a 12 percent increase. The Fed has been talking about long term 2 percent goal of inflation, and that they're willing to overshoot slightly, but we're way beyond slight in this most recent number. I think there's very -- big reason for concern."

We have already heard a number of Republicans like you are concerned about what's happening right now. Even Elizabeth Warren, for other reasons, say that he's kowtowed too much to the bank. So his reappointment, even if pushed by the president, isn't a sure thing. Do you support him for another four years at the Fed?"

What we're seeing right now, though, I think, is unprecedented territory. What I hope Chairman Powell will do is pay very close attention to the comments and the discussions that we had today, the concerns that we -- that we Republicans expressed on inflation. I hope that that will register with him. He's got the tools to deal with this, he said, and my hope is that he will look very, very strongly at the balance sheet."

That's -- whether you do it in a backhanded way by selling a lot of the Treasury notes and bonds he's been scarfing up or you do it outright and raise interest rates. Would you welcome that? Would you and some of your Republican colleagues, recognizing that that's what you do to deal with inflation, would you support that move?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HAGERTY",
      "utterance": "Well, the most important thing to do to deal with inflation is to stop this incredibly rampant and reckless stimulus spending, and, again, the policies that the Biden administration are putting into place that have I think, long-term effects. And what the Fed does, particularly with their balance sheet expansion, is accommodate this."

This is -- stimulus -- the stimulative spending, the level of this that we have never seen before, we're talking another $6 trillion. This has got to have a massively inflationary effect. This is laid right at President Biden's doorstep. And they need to own it. And we need to stop accommodating this at the Fed and allowing this balance sheet expansion to go on that I think facilitates it significantly."

It just seems to be a bipartisan binge, don't you think?"

      "utterance": "Well, from a personal standpoint, one of the big reasons I came to this position half-a-year ago now was to stand up and push back. We're at a point where we're deficit spending at an unsustainable level. Chairman Powell acknowledged that today. We have got to turn the corner. We have got to be pushing back on this deficit, because we're leaving this to our children and our grandchildren. That's inherently unfair. I think it's immoral to do."

Also keeping an eye on the White House, the president of the United States with the chancellor of Germany, Angela Merkel, 16 years in power.

But we want to alert you to a Reuters story that a senior U.S. administration official, not detailing who that is, says that there are contingency plans being made, a more robust presence in the Florida Straits to manage any possibility of a migration. As you know, there's been concern raised by the administration that a lot of people will try to flee Cuba, and that they're not welcoming you, that it's a dangerous trip, and they highly recommend against it. They have advised the same for Cuban exiles in Florida, not to send boats, either with supplies or anything else to Cuba. Cuba was open to the idea -- that is, the government that's cracking down on these protesters -- to such aid. But, again, the question is whether that would be received peacefully or potentially violently. This senior administration official is just saying that there are contingency plans to deal with that type of migration, I guess, going both ways, if you think about it. We will keep an eye on that. Also keeping an eye on this upcoming presser involving President Biden and Angela Merkel, the 16-year-long, one of the longest-serving Western power leaders, Angela Merkel, moments from now.

There's a real risk that Biden is repeating this there. And our powers are not infinite to help the Cuban people. But we can talk about how we will provide aid if they have a transition from their current government. We can try and cut through Cuban censorship using electronic means. There's an Air Force plane, the C-130, that's brimming with antennas. It's called Commando Solo. In the Bush administration, there was a plan to put that in international airspace off the coast of Cuba to transmit in and get past the censorship if there was a crisis.

Now they're only worried about their own population and how to suppress it. And even though it's extremely unlikely the United States would ever invade Cuba, nor do I think we should, if you put an aircraft carrier, if you put several destroyers off the coast, it concentrates people's attention. And it might give a little bit of extra encouragement to the people of Cuba.

Several times, we have threatened cyber-retaliation against Russia for cyberattacks against us. It started in January with Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser. And then, two times, President Biden had said to Russian President Putin, once in person in Geneva, and the other time on the phone, that we're going to attack if you're the ones who are doing it, and two or three -- we haven't really done that, at least not in any way that's apparent to the outside."

You have my permission, though, to put up a picture of President Kennedy and see if people notice the difference. But we had a very good meeting. I mean, he was very generous with his time. As you know, he's a very, very sharp guy, a very substantive guy, and a very even guy, I think, in the way he approaches his public service. So we had a very -- again, a very detailed discussion. He believes, as I do, that everybody should be in favor of protecting voting rights that were established really in the -- with the 1965 Voting Rights Act. And I think his interest has, I think, and hope -- everyone's is -- is that we don't go back to having the types of discrimination that required that kind of legislation a president from my state, Lyndon Baines Johnson, had to push through Congress.

You're fighting a Republican majority, I get that. But do you fear that some of you look like babies, and you're huffing and puffing, leaving with your marbles and getting out of town, but you have an obligation to do your job back in Texas?

I worked in the United States Senate for four years, Neil, before I got elected. I have been a state representative for 27 years. I represent the most Hispanic state legislative district in the country. I take this very seriously. I have seen people be discriminated against in terms of their voting rights. And so we knew that what was going on in Washington is that they're contemplating passing legislation that would reinforce what the 1965 Voting Rights Act sought to do. And we support that. And we know that, if that passed, that legislation like that being contemplated in Texas would be null and void. And so our interest was to come up here and do what we could do to fight not just for our constituents, but for every citizen. I don't care if you're black, brown, white, Asian, disabled. You should not be discriminated against. And, unfortunately, the proposals that were on the table, as they have been in many states, Neil, seek to do that. It's where we are. And the only way you can stop that from happening is to pass legislation similar to the 1965 Voting Rights Act. So, I understand your show and that kind of stuff that you do, huff and puff and all that. Look, this is serious stuff for me. I'm committed to this."

I am telling you that the read from many on this is that, maybe for all the best intentions, you're coming across as bitter and angry, and that, if you don't get something you want -- it could be voting rights now, it could be other legislation tomorrow -- take your marbles and go home if you don't get your way. It is one way to force maybe a federal issue. And that might happen. But how can voters back in Texas, Democrat or Republican, trust you to do your job if you leave your job?"

      "utterance": "I think you mention a good point, voters. We want people, Neil, to be able to vote. We want people to have the right to vote, to be able to vote. And if you think that following the Constitution, which is what we have done here, is something we shouldn't have done, and if you're telling me that under no circumstances would you ever for any reason, were you would ever be elected, contemplate using what the Constitution allows you to, in the way that Abraham Lincoln at one -- did at one time, in the way that John Adams did at one time, and if you think that you would never do that, maybe you just don't believe strongly enough in something to do what the framers of the Constitution laid out. They established a quorum for a reason, Neil. It was for moments like this."

You got a Republican majority. You don't like that. I get that. But it is what it is, just like Republicans are dealing with it with Washington, with Democrats controlling the full run of the table. But you can't just leave when it doesn't suit your interests, right? I mean, aren't you then going to be in question by a lot of people who might like what you stand for, but they don't know if you will stand by in Texas to deal directly with the issues that matter to them?"

Now, if you're telling me you would stand there and take it, when you know you could stop it, well, that's a difference between you and me. And that's why I signed up. That's why I ran. That's why I got elected, because I will stand up. When it's something that goes too far, Neil, I will do it, just like Abraham Lincoln did."

They probably don't harass you. They probably don't make it difficult for you to go vote. But, you know, Neil, if you live long enough, and you get old enough, or, heaven forbid, if you face some disability at some point in your life or someone that you love faces some disability in your life, and they move to the state of Texas, the legislation that's being complicated -- contemplated, rather, will affect their ability to vote. We heard from so many people, Neil -- and you may -- maybe what you what just belittled, and if you heard their testimony, people who are disabled, a lady with cerebral palsy -- cerebral palsy talking about how this would affect her. And if you think that that is just partisan, or I don't know what you think, respectfully, I'm going to disagree with you."

But, Representative, thank you very much for joining us. Keep us posted. Richard Pena Raymond, the Texas House representative, among those 47 here waiting to see if maybe they could force this issue on voting rights, federal legislation, that would make all the state efforts, including Texas, a moot point.

These are people responding right now to new imposed restrictions and mandates because of a spike in COVID cases, not only in places like France, but we have seen it happening in Greece as well, parts of Italy. And they're cracking down. They're reimposing the very restrictions that some fear happening here if we see a spike in cases, very, very unlikely, because our overall vaccination rate is much higher than all of those countries. Dr. Amesh Adalja joins us right now, the Johns Hopkins University infectious disease specialist. Doctor, these countries are forcing that issue. Should they?"

I think that it's one thing for organizations and schools and businesses to mandate vaccines. But it's very different when government does it. That really only happens in extraordinary circumstances. And I don't think they have met that threshold. I think that these countries have done fairly well in vaccinating their high-risk populations. But they still have their eyes a lot on cases of the Delta variant. And those cases are going to go up. But you have to really tie your public health measures to, are your hospitals in crisis? And I don't think that, in those countries, their hospitals are feeling the stress of COVID-19, because you have to remember that this isn't going anywhere. COVID-19 is going to be with us from years. And we have got to start -- stop looking at cases and really focus on hospital capacity."

      "utterance": "Right. We haven't seen much of hospital capacity concerns for some time. There are some exceptions. Springfield, Missouri, does seem to be getting hit hard because they don't have enough high-risk people vaccinated. But in the United States, we're seeing it more as a regional problem. That systemic risk that COVID-19 posed has largely dissipated because we have decoupled cases from hospitalizations, because our high-risk populations have largely been fully vaccinated; 77 percent-plus of people above the age of 65 are fully vaccinated."

    {
      "speaker": "ADALJA",
      "utterance": "It's going to be very difficult. And it probably will vary from school district to school district. We know that there are going to be cases and probably exposures in that unvaccinated population. And the CDC guidance does say that people have to quarantine. And many schools may say, instead of having a whole classroom quarantine, let's just minimize the exposures by using masks. So that may be something that each school district is going to have to look at. But we know that we can actually use other mitigation measures, separating desks, trying to cohort students, and really being much more meticulous when it comes to extracurricular activities, which is where spread occurred usually with schools, not actually the pedagogical portion of it, sitting in the classroom. So I think this is something you're going to see variations, depending upon what's going on locally. What are the level of cases? What are the level of vaccination? What's the vaccination level at the school? And I think that you need flexibility for these schools to be able to operate."

      "utterance": "Doctor, an interesting development. I just don't like to throw things at you broadside. But you can always handle this stuff. We're just learning that the Red Sox-Yankees game, a kickoff to a four-game series this weekend, was postponed after multiple positive COVID-19 tests within the Yankees organization. What do you think of that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ADALJA",
      "utterance": "Well, first, you want to know a little bit more about this. Were these people who are fully vaccinated? And many of these Major League professional sports teams are still testing people who are fully vaccinated, even when they don't have symptoms, which goes against the CDC criteria. And we saw, for example, those breakthrough infections that occurred with the New York Yankees earlier on, because they were testing asymptomatic individuals. We shouldn't really be doing that. We should be looking at people if they're fully vaccinated as really not at risk for COVID and only testing them if they become symptomatic. So I suspect that this might be an artifact of overtesting that's going on with these professional sports teams. And we got to -- have to move away from that."

But the game, the series kicking off tonight will not. We will see how it affects the other games scheduled for Friday, Saturday and Sunday. We will have a lot more after this, including the spike in New York crime and the group now saying, Mayor Bill de Blasio, you're still in charge of things for the next few months at least.

And Eric Adams, the Democratic winner, who is highly favored to be the ultimate winner -- you never know, though, but in this dominant New York City, that could be the case -- he is really concerned about the spike in crime. In fact, a lot of people say he won the Democratic contest because, as a 20-year police veteran, he faulted the defund the police moving and other crime issues that became near and dear to voters. But it's gotten so bad now that the Times Square Alliance, which looks after businesses and individuals working in that neck of the woods in Midtown, so concerned about repeated violence that the present mayor should do something about it and not wait for his successor to pick up the baton and try to deal with it. The time is now. Darrin Porcher, the retired New York Police Department lieutenant, likely agrees. Lieutenant, always good to have you. The message from the alliance was clear. You're the mayor now. Do something. It's out of control. What did you think?"

So it begs the question of, what is the effectiveness of the public safety mechanism for not just Times Square, but the city of New York as a whole? The pedestrian leadership under Mayor de Blasio has failed the citizens of New York from the perspective of protection. The police are the subject matter experts. Therefore, they, meaning the City Hall, needs to lend deference to the police, because no one knows how to get it done better than the police. And, unfortunately, Mayor de Blasio has turned a blind eye as a result, and we have experienced an extreme increase in crime as a result."

But let's talk about what we see happening in New York City. We see businesses opening constantly. We see jobs coming back. We see outdoor dining booming. We see tourism coming back. It's all happening. It's happening because New Yorkers are fighting back."

      "speaker": "PORCHER",
      "utterance": "Well, in Mayor de Blasio's defense, public safety has never been his skill set. So, as a result, he's turned a blind eye to the violence that's ravaged the city of New York. So when you hear him speak from a defense mechanism, and that's all this is, a deflection, it's a clear representation of his inability or unwillingness to provide the necessary protections for the city of New York. This has been an ongoing saga throughout his incumbency, and it's just manifesting at the end. But we need something done now in the wake of the protection of the 8.5 million residents that reside in the city of New York, because this is troubling. And I see no insight in the wake -- no end in sight in the wake of him being in office."

And all of them, as far as I can understand, Lieutenant, are very concerned about crime. They're not worried about COVID. They don't flip over the commute and the trains and all that, but they're really worried about crime. That was their number one issue."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PORCHER",
      "utterance": "Right. When we look at the recent mayoral election, crime tended to be at the epicenter of what people were voting for. So, as a result, Eric Adams, who was a former NYPD captain, won the Democratic primary. This clearly equates to what the population is experiencing and what their expectation is moving forward. The de Blasio had the ability to impose on a watershed moment in connection with how crime can be reduced. And he could have come out of this as a star. But he chose to hide in his bunker and just let the carnage occur. And, as a result, it manifested to a point where it's uncontrollable at this stage. We need the practitioners, meaning police, to be at the forefront, because, if it doesn't happen, the socioeconomics of a place like New York, more so specific to what we see in the crossroads of the world, that being Times Square, have been denigrated, based on Mayor de Blasio's inability to act."

We have yet to hear back. But hope springs eternal. Contrary to what the prior guest said. We don't huff and puff here. We just want to get to the bottom of what's going on.
