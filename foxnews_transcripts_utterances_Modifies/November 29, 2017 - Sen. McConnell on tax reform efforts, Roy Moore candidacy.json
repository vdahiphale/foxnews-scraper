We have gathered the very best for you tonight. A huge breakthrough in the president's tax plan in the Senate. I talk to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell about what kind of break you might get, at least you hope you are going to get.  We get his take on that wild Senate race in Alabama and what might happen to Roy Moore if he actually gets elect.  I also sit down with Marco Rubio on the possible existence, get this, of a sexual harassment slush fund in the Senate. Stay tuned for that.  And Herman Cain is here as well. We haven't seen him in a while. We're going to ask him if the sexual assault allegations are going too far. I will also deliver a very important message to all of your Melania haters out there in the media. That will be at the end of the hour. You do not want to miss it.  But, first, we start with a question that's on the minds of many Americans.",

Well, we know tonight that we can report, of course, Matt Lauer is no longer the anchor over at the \"Today\" show. fired overnight and reportedly with no warning.   Lauer is the second morning anchor to fall in just a week. They had one of the biggest runs on television ever most profitable franchise in television history. NBC said the firing followed recent accusations from one coworker. Variety magazine did their own two-month investigation published today and found evidence of a lot more wider and abusive conduct. Hours after that the \"New York Times\" reported two more claims. And Lauer's co-worker, Savannah Guthrie, Hoda Kotb, learned of the news, of his firing, just before they reported it at the top of the \"Today Show.\" That's quite an opening. They all and their colleagues at 30 Rock were visibly shaken by this news.   SAVANNAH GUTHRIE, HOST, \"TODAY\": All we can say is that we are heartbroken. I'm heartbroken for Matt. He is my dear, dear friend and my partner, and he is beloved by many, many people here. And I'm heartbroken for the brave colleague that came forward to tell her story and any other women who have their own stories to tell. How do you reconcile your love for someone with the revelation that they have behaved badly? HODA KOTB, GUEST HOST, \"TODAY\": I have known matt for 15 years. It's hard to reconcile what we are hearing with the man who we know who walks in this building every single day.  KATHIE LEE GIFFORD, CO-HOST, \"TODAY WITH KATHIE LEE AND HODA\": I texted him this morning and said, Matt, I adore you, and no person is perfect in this world. Nobody is.   WILLIE GEIST, CO-HOST, \"TODAY\": My thoughts, of course, with Matt. He has been a friend. He has been a mentor. He has been a guy you could watch, a guy who led by his example on the set. UNIDENTIFIED MALE, \"MORNING JOE\": I am stunned by this. I have known Matt for 25 years. I consider him to be a friend. Willie was apt in his description of Matt.",

Hours after that the \"New York Times\" reported two more claims.

He said, \"NBC News doubles down. We can now equivocally say prior to Monday night, current NBC News management was never made any aware of any complaints about Matt Lauer's conduct,\" network said.\" Current NBC management. Jeff Zucker over at CNN was the executive producer of the \"Today\" show for many years.

He was you a liberal guy. He was nothing but nice to me. I had very minimal reaction with him. From the Katie Couric comment to that odd promo. There were a couple other things that have popped up on tape. It's a little strange for a network that prides itself on being so pro- women and we are all for girl power and it's a little odd and Jeff Zucker, he doesn't come out on camera today, one of his old friends, old buddies.

Herman, it's great to see you first of all. Welcome back to the network. This has been a wild time. A lot of icons in the media world. One after the other taken down, a producer from \"State of the Union\" on CNN, it was unceremoniously fired today for inappropriate conduct.

Some of them were based upon accusations, speculation, but no confirmation. Now, I can't talk about all these situations, but I can talk about my situation. There were a lot of accusations and there was a lot of speculation to try to derail my campaign but no confirmation. And the reason was the liberal media didn't want to know the truth. They did not want to know what the facts were about the people that were accusing me. Now what's different about my situation, and let's just say Roy Moore's situation, is that they came after me with repeatedly attacks and accusations but no confirmation. They now believe that if they throw more and more and more mud on the wall, that eventually people are going to believe it, but that has back fired because, as you know, the latest poll shows Roy Moore is now back in the lead in Alabama and the people in Alabama are going to have to decide."

I bowed out primarily because not because I couldn't take the harassment, I couldn't take the firestorm. But because my family, grandchildren especially, start to hear jokes about their Pappa on the music stations and I did not want that to continue. If I had stayed in the race, it was only going to get worse and worse and worse. Why?

I think they have a legitimate case to be made. But I don't think we ought to just do that. A chain migration, doing something about the diversity lottery, there are plenty of changes to the legal immigration system that should be added to any kind of a DACA fix that we do."

      "utterance": "I think clearly immigration, the president made that a front and center issue. The wall, which we are still trying to achieve for him, was only part of it. And I think there is a great interest in changing the legal immigration system. By the way, I'm sure you share my view that legal immigration is important. My wife, the secretary of transportation, came here at age eight not speaking a word of English. And legal immigration has been an important part of America for over 200 years, our entire existence. That doesn't mean you just let anybody in at any point, and it doesn't mean you tolerate illegal entries. So the president has actually given us an opportunity here by saying he wants to fix DACA but he doesn't want it all by itself. He want something with it, and I think the kinds of things you and I are discussing that Cotton and Perdue are pushing are exactly what ought to be part of a solution."

They are the working people in this country that have been ignored and forgotten. They are the people that elected President Trump because they have been not just ignored but disrespected. And all this says is you are going to keep more of your own money. That's what the amendment does. They actually say it's a disincentive to work. It's ridiculous. You can't even get the tax credit if you are not working. This is people making between $20,000 and $50,000 or $60,000 who would benefit greatly. And by the way, if you look at the states would benefit the most, I think it's 18 of the top 20 states voted for the president in the 2016 election. Why? Because working people raising children are the people that voted to elect the president with a very clear message that they sent us here to fight for them, not for the moneyed interests that controls Washington."

      "speaker": "RUBIO",
      "utterance": "On the corporate side, a 22 percent corporate tax rate is 13 points lower than what it is now. The different between 20 and 22 would still make us third among the G-7 nations. It would still put us below the global average. There is no difference in growth between 20 and 22."

There is a difference between DACA and the DREAM act. If what they want to do, and the president has expressed an openness to this, is to do something like DACA but constitutionally that is temporary and acts as a bridge towards something more permanent. That's one thing. If what they want is to make a permanent change to immigration policy, it must be accompanied by permanent changes to security."

We've always said that we need border security, including the wall, and entrance-exit tracking system, e-Verify, these are all things we have long supported.

And I don't think anything he has said or done in the last couple weeks has helped him in that regard. That said, this information is before the voters of Alabama. And if they elect him and then you as a Senate have ethics hearings to remove him from office or something like that, that gets more complicated.

Erin Gloria Ryan writes \"Christmas at the White House will be both sad and hilarious as most of Melania's demonstrative disdain for her job is. Melania's corridor of holiday sadness has given us a nice preview of what the world will look like post nuclear holocaust.\" Do you know what holiday sadness is? Attacking a woman of impeccable taste for decorating the White House with an eye for tradition and class. You know what the left hates? The left hates a traditional, Godly celebration of Christmas. That's what Melania Trump is bringing back to the White House this year. All they can do is snipe and criticize. The double standard with Michelle and their continuing deification of her is obvious."
