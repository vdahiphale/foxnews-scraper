STEVE HAYES, EDITOR, \"THE DISPATCH\": Yes, pretty extraordinary on several different levels. Look, if the White House wants to defend the decision by President Obama to withdrawal troops and effectively surrender Afghanistan, that's well within their rights.

He likes to talk to reporters. A lot of reporters get a lot of information from him. So it's good that he was honest about it. But as Senator Blackburn went on to talk about, he and his colleagues were sitting there really showed what a military bereft of actual accountability for leadership failure looks like. They talked about how one of them said something about how it was logistical success but a strategic failure, the departure from Afghanistan. It was not a logistical success. It was a logistical failure. It is true that it was also a strategic failure, and strategic failure is a way to describe what that war, which really wasn't a war but a nation-building exercise, had become for a very long period of time.  So not only should there be accountability for the disastrous departure, there should also be accountability for the people who mismanaged what that very noble effort to hold -- to make Afghanistan pay for harboring the terrorists that caused so much damage and making sure that was no foothold. That was not managed well, and there has been no accountability.",

AMY WALTER, NATIONAL EDITOR, \"COOK POLITICAL REPORT\": That's right. I think that at the end of the day, partisans are pretty dug in and have been pretty dug in about this, although the challenge really comes at Joe Biden and at a very perilous time for the president that he is already looking at approval ratings now that have been under water since the beginning of September. He's trying to get this legislation through Congress this week, trying to make sure that the debt ceiling doesn't reach -- we don't hit the debt ceiling, we don't default on our debt, that the government doesn't shut down.  All the while, a picture laid out of a president who made a decision to do this despite the advice that he was getting. Polling has showed that not only have Americans soured on the president and his handling of some of these bigger main issues, like COVID, the economy, but on foreign policy his support, even among Democrats, has dropped according to Pew Research.
