My advice for libs, focus on ideas and not people. Demonizing never ends well for anyone. Call someone a Nazi and you end the discussion before it starts. So, my solution is kind of sincere, even naive and it might get me laughed out of here, but I think we need a peace movement and we need the right to started it because to expect one from the left, it's just silly. Right now, they are in a state and everything to them is a helpless calamity. They don't like us much. It's when an outstretched hand must come from us. Now, Trump did it with North Korea. Netanyahu is trying with Iran, couldn't we do it with our fellow Americans? Maybe. Now, your generosity may not be reciprocated, but before we decide to match anger with anger, why not take the high ground. If it still goes bad, at least you know you did your best when they are at their worst. Let's welcome tonight's guests. He is obviously let himself go, his washboard abs are now washboard flabs.

That's similar to where past Presidents had been at this time in their term. And it's Trump's handling of the economy that Americans like best.

So, my solution is kind of sincere, even naive and it might get me laughed out of here, but I think we need a peace movement and we need the right to started it because to expect one from the left, it's just silly. Right now, they are in a state and everything to them is a helpless calamity. They don't like us much. It's when an outstretched hand must come from us. Now, Trump did it with North Korea. Netanyahu is trying with Iran, couldn't we do it with our fellow Americans? Maybe.

My cholesterol is down, it's a win-win for everyone. Like the half eaten pie perched on Alec Baldwin's reclining belly, Trump's poll numbers are on a roll. Despite some recent controversies, Trump's popularity for some reason just keeps rising. The real clear politics average of polls says Trump's approval rating at over 43%. That's similar to where past Presidents had been at this time in their term. And it's Trump's handling of the economy that Americans like best.

If businesses fail, people lose their jobs and they can lose their homes, except of course for the talk show host rooting for this idiocy for a rich liberal like Maher egging on a bad economy, it has no downside. You get rid of the President you hate, and you're not affected by the misery you've accepted as a consequence for others. Bill, I think you hit your head too many times doing this.

We can handle the banter and the fighting back and forth, and the Twitter wars because this doesn't affect our bottom line. My light bill still goes on even though he tweets back and forth with whomever arguing about whatever, that doesn't affect us. But if I can't make my bills paid and I lose my home, then I've got a problem with the President. So, I think that's the - Bill's wishing, is I think he's at the same time, he's also sending a message, that is the only shot. As long as the economy is there and strong, there will be no changes. There will be no blue wave. None of that stuff is going to happen. They have got one shot. They hope that he goes bankrupt and he bankrupts America, that's their hope."
