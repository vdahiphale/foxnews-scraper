But for the most part, he's pretty much stayed away from targeting Kamala Harris. But when she has come up, we looked back. For instance, this February interview with The New York Times. Listen to what he said about the candidate who by all accounts had a big night. \"He said, \"I would say, the best opening so far would be Kamala Harris. I would say in terms of the opening act, would be her. I just think she seemed to have a little better opening act than the others.\"  To which a New York Times reporter responded, \"She's got incredible crowds at her rollout.\" And the president said, \"A better crowd, better enthusiasm.\"  And then, this backhanded compliment coming from a president who admires a biting which.  DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT (via telephone): I think she's got a little bit of a nasty wit, but bet that might be it.",

She is been part of a criminal justice system that her party now deems as systemically racist, she's an attorney general and a prosecutor, she was involved in blocking up a lot of poor people for many cases in nonviolent crimes, and you can make a lot of the same arguments that she's making against Joe Biden against her. Maybe she doesn't have the interests of black families and black fathers being taken from their kids in mind in her track record either.  So, I think that she's going to have two challenges. One is devaluing Joe Biden's position in the minds of black voters. But the -- it's a total other challenge to be able to say, well now you should come and vote for Kamala Harris.",

In the idea that what Kamala Harris did is she sort of laid a blow on Joe Biden and now is going to be can she convince black voters that she is the go-to candidate for them. And she also does have her own record which I'm surprised and not come up in last night's debate as being a prosecutor.

They're talking about black unemployment rates, they're talking about criminal justice reform. They're making an effort.   So, Democrats can't just expect that black voters are going to continue to show up for them. And the challenge, I think, is going to be being able to communicate to the average black Democratic voter, but still, make this very small but very vocal minority of Democratic voters who identify as hardcore progressives happy. Those are not the same thing.  You have among, for example, many of these very progressive Democratic voters a negative attitude toward charter schools. But when you look at black democratic polling, you see that black voters on average are very supportive of charter schools. It's one example, but it's a clear example where I'm not sure Democrats can make everyone happy.",

I would say in terms of the opening act, would be her. I just think she seemed to have a little better opening act than the others.\" To which a New York Times reporter responded, \"She's got incredible crowds at her rollout.\" And the president said, \"A better crowd, better enthusiasm.\" And then, this backhanded compliment coming from a president who admires a biting which."

So, I think this is a very calculated move that's to say to black voters in South Carolina and throughout the country that I'm here, I'm available, and I want your vote. And now, it's going to be up to Vice President Biden to show that the -- show these black voters where he has 60 percent of them currently amongst most people -- most -- what national polls say. That he is still their candidate and he is not doesn't believe in segregation, and he doesn't believe -- he, you know, and he wants to move the country forward."

President Obama, Hillary Clinton, they both won South Carolina in the primary and went on to win the nomination. But take a look right now. Joe Biden is pretty far ahead in South Carolina. You know these polls could change quite a bit at 41 percent based on the fact that we just had the first debate cycle. Then, go forward to the next one which is a black voter poll in South Carolina, I should point out, it was done by a Republican firm. But that one is Biden at 40 percent, not sure 35 percent. That -- that's a pretty big number who are still looking at everybody there, Jamil."

      "speaker": "JAMIL JIVANI, AUTHOR, WHY YOUNG MEN",
      "utterance": "Well, being able to attack Joe Biden isn't the same as convincing voters to vote for Kamala Harris. And that's what she's going to need to be able to do. I find it interesting that her using Joe Biden's record against him could also very well be done to her. She is been part of a criminal justice system that her party now deems as systemically racist, she's an attorney general and a prosecutor, she was involved in blocking up a lot of poor people for many cases in nonviolent crimes, and you can make a lot of the same arguments that she's making against Joe Biden against her. Maybe she doesn't have the interests of black families and black fathers being taken from their kids in mind in her track record either. So, I think that she's going to have two challenges. One is devaluing Joe Biden's position in the minds of black voters. But the -- it's a total other challenge to be able to say, well now you should come and vote for Kamala Harris."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

We are eight -- we have at 16 months left that before we even get to the general election, the -- people don't cast their votes in Iowa until we have about seven or eight months until that happened. So, I think we have a long time. This is going to be a marathon and not a sprint. But Jamil is right. In the idea that what Kamala Harris did is she sort of laid a blow on Joe Biden and now is going to be can she convince black voters that she is the go-to candidate for them. And she also does have her own record which I'm surprised and not come up in last night's debate as being a prosecutor. Joe Biden hinted that and when he says, while you were prosecuting, I was the -- I was working at this, you know, at this -- at the defendant -- at the public defender's office. So, he started that attack line against her. But he didn't land a punch on Kamala Harris last night."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "But you know, obviously, the African-American vote nationally, when it comes to the general election is a huge, huge factor here. And for the first time in 20 years, in 2016, that vote -- the number of voters in the African American community declined. So, how important is it Jamil, you know, just looking at politics for the Democrat to be able to inspire those voters and make sure that they turn out because they could counterbalance I would imagine some of the forgotten voter, the blue-collar voter who came out when they stayed home last time."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JIVANI",
      "utterance": "Well, that's absolutely right. I mean, the Republican Party is taking the needs of black communities more seriously now than I think they have in a very long time. They're talking about black unemployment rates, they're talking about criminal justice reform. They're making an effort. So, Democrats can't just expect that black voters are going to continue to show up for them. And the challenge, I think, is going to be being able to communicate to the average black Democratic voter, but still, make this very small but very vocal minority of Democratic voters who identify as hardcore progressives happy. Those are not the same thing. You have among, for example, many of these very progressive Democratic voters a negative attitude toward charter schools. But when you look at black democratic polling, you see that black voters on average are very supportive of charter schools. It's one example, but it's a clear example where I'm not sure Democrats can make everyone happy."

Everybody raising their hands, for as Ari Fleischer pointed out in a tweet, the decriminalization of the -- of people crossing the border illegally, providing illegals with driver's license, providing illegals with health care. You know, watch -- Richard, watch the numbers of people accelerate as they look at this very attractive enticement to come to the United States of America. The border is open, we -- you're not going to be held in any facility when you cross over. Come on in and we're going to offer you everything from college to a license to free health care. Is that the message of the Democratic Party?"

      "speaker": "FOWLER",
      "utterance": "That's not the message of Democratic Party. Before I gets, let me allow, allow me to pushback on this, on notion on charter schools. I think what you see across the country if you look at any poll of parents, of African-American parents, they're not having a debate or yelling about school choice, they want smaller class size, they want updated books, they want schools that aren't falling apart. And I think they want more funding in their community for high-quality neighborhood public schools. Now, onto immigration, what you saw last night, both Thursday and Wednesday is a clear contrast between Democrats and Republicans."

And now you're saying well not only have we not been able to do that. But we're also going to now deliver health care to people who don't even belonging the country?

Our spider sense has been tingling for days now about what will happen after the President leaves the G20 and goes to South Korea. Would he possibly visit the DMZ? And within just the last few minutes the President tweeting this out. \"After some very important meetings including my meeting with President Xi of China, I will be leaving Japan for South Korea with President Moon. While there, if Chairman Kim of North Korea sees this, I would meet him at the border DMZ just to shake his hand and say hello. It sounds like kind of an open invitation type of thing but I'm getting a precooked sense about this. Now, to what's going to happen today last night. The chief trade negotiators for the United States and China got together to lay the groundwork for today's summit between the president and President Xi Jinping. This meeting could determine whether trade talks with China get back on track in a bilateral meeting with Brazil's president, President Trump building on the anticipation. Listen here."

There's been no detente between us and North Korea. North Korea has continued on its path towards having nuclear weapons, for weaponizing its nuclear weapons, and it's still a major threat with no solution. So the President instead of talking about just dropping by and saying hello to his friend, should be talking about what the plan is to get toward some sort of agreement so that North Korea --"

That attack was illegal, it was offensive, and it was done because Russia hates democracy. And the president is supposed to be there defending democracy instead of delivering a stern message to Putin that you can't interfere in our election, again, he's sitting there joking about it which is sending a message that hey, this is OK.

So the President Obama was very strong in response though a little bit slow. I think he should have reacted much more quickly so I have some criticism of President Obama.

Neighbors tell media that in recent days there were fires in this backyard that created a stench that hit you in the face. And throughout the day in this evening, we've seen investigators going in and out of this property. They even expanded their police line as they interview neighbors. So many neighbors who say that this murder suspect in his 30s was polite and even focused on making improvements to this property. Police say the murder suspect was arrested today and then booked into county jail on charges of aggravated murder, aggravated kidnapping, and desecration of a human body. Police say phone records show Mackenzie Lueck and the murder suspect were communicating and that Mackenzie's rideshare vehicle took her from the Salt Lake City airport to a nearby park. And at about three o'clock a.m. last Monday where she likely met up with a man who police say killed her. Why she did, we do not know.

He lied to law enforcement, claiming that he didn't know what she looked like and there were photos of her that he had in his possession.

We had Rashida Tlaib before the ink was even dry on her election certificate using profanity to talk about how she was going to impeach the president. And so, I guess when a Republican says something that might go a little over line it might be treated a little differently. But at the end of the day, Martha, I'm not worried about it at all. I'm worried about the 5,500 people that show up at our border every day. I worry about the fact that we haven't changed our asylum laws.

But, you know, this did garner bipartisan criticism of you, and it is very specific in terms of the question of whether or not you are threatening a witness the night before he was about to testify. And in fact, in your home state, the bar is also investigating you for the same reason.

So, they're very well may be a coordinated effort to go after people like me, people like Kellyanne Conway who are effective advocates for a transformational president. At the end of the day, Martha, it's really not something that concerns me.

She's not as popular as him. She doesn't have as much access to this much money. And she splits that vote, which is, and I thought -- why is she willing to go in there to split that vote? So, I'm not so sure that we have an answer yet about why she's there. Look, a lot of these individuals like when the Republicans had a primary are looking to bolster their own profile, right? And it could be that situation. I don't know if she actually thinks she's going to be the nominee or looking for --"

I think people also like -- I remember that about the selfie and the inappropriateness of this. But I think with Trump because of who he is and where he came from, like New York City kind of womanizer, playboy guy. It's just, it's a fun narrative to be like, I found the hot one."
