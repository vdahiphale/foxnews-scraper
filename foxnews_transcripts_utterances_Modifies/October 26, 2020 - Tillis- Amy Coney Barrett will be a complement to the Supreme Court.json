Voting is well under way, across this country, 62 million people have already voted and tonight President Trump's support is just about within four points of Joe Biden and that is according to the battleground states average at Real Clear Politics. You've got 55.5 to 49.5 and that's a collection of the six states that are most likely to swing this election; Pennsylvania, Arizona, Wisconsin, Florida along with North Carolina and Michigan so today the incumbent worked Pennsylvania very hard, barnstorming all day long from Allentown this morning, mid-day rally in Lititz, Pennsylvania and then this afternoon a third rally of the day around 4:30 this afternoon, that one in Martinsburg, Pennsylvania. The president with his packed schedule went after Joe Biden's schedule.",

      "sentences": "Well, I think it's important but probably natural thing what is happening here and particularly after the first debate performance for President Trump, there was a little bit of softening among his base but now it's firming up and as we get to the end of the campaign, people tend to return to their corners. Republicans becoming Republicans, Democrats go into the Democratic corner but you're right, I mean think about it. These are the six states that were in the Real Clear Politics study. I know from polls that I'm looking at in Arizona, private polls in Arizona, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin that the numbers are tightening. In fact I just was briefed on a poll in Wisconsin that had a 5000 person sample that showed significant close into low single digits dividing the two candidates. So if that happens, think about it this way, if the president wins every state, let's take the three Great Lake states; Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, put them to the side for a second. If the president wins every one of the rest of the states he won in 2016 and carry's Pennsylvania, he's got 280 electoral votes, 10 more than needed. If he carries Wisconsin out of those three states, only Wisconsin he's got 270. If he carries Michigan out of those three states and loses Pennsylvania, Wisconsin; he's got 276. So the path to victory lies in these states that the president carries all of these, carries Arizona, Florida, North Carolina and then he just needs one more of these states and the most dangerous one is Wisconsin though because if he's at 270, if he loses either Maine two or Nebraska two then we've either got a tie in the electoral college if he loses one or he's down by two if he loses both of them.",

Kamala Harris, Senator Harris is coming to Houston on Friday apparently. Think about this. They have both said on the record and not step back from saying that on the first day in office, the Biden-Harris administration will ban fracking on federal lands and in federal waters and they will - they will stop leasing - oil leasing on federal lands and in federal waters. Houston is the capital city if you will of the Gulf of Mexico exploration and production and you go in and say we're having no more leases in the Gulf of Mexico and we're not going to have fracking in federal lands and federal waters. Well, the Gulf of Mexico is federal waters so you're going to end fracking and a major basin for oil and gas production and devastate the Houston economy. It won't just simply be the people in oil production, it's going to be the people working in the refineries and the people who are working in the chemical plants who depend upon the raw material coming out of the Gulf of Mexico and elsewhere. Second of all let me just make a quick point on this, it's amazing to be. In their plan and they've never get stepped away from it, they're going to end the electricity production that comes from fossil fuels by 2035. 70 percent of our electricity comes from fossil fuels, primarily natural gas so if you're going to take all these brand new natural gas plants that are helping keep the utility prices low and reduce greenhouse gas emissions and literally say within 15 years, we don't care whether those plants are still capable of running for decades more, you're out of business. And incidentally, we're also going to force people to buy electric cars, you're driving up demand for electricity and removing a substantial part of the capacity to generate electricity. That's a recipe for disaster and again natural gas is big in Texas whether it's in the Gulf of Mexico or are in Texas and Texas - land in Texas and--",

By rule on a culture vote as it's called here on Capitol Hill, that's what you vote on to actually end a filibuster, opponents of an issue get 30 extra hours so they closed the vote yesterday at 1.26, that's why we are about to go to this confirmation vote now.

We might have a procedural vote here first just to take attendance. So, they'll roll through that pretty quickly. Usually on a vote of this magnitude senators would vote from their desks.

One of those we would see we expect tonight was Justice Clarence Thomas. And remember she clerked for Justice Scalia. Years ago, Justice Thomas was already on the bench than so they certainly have a relationship and know each other so a former clerk now joining the bench, as often happens in recent years. And so, he is the one chosen to swear her in tonight. There's a second oath, though.

He is a prolific writer, whether he's in the majority or the dissent or concurrence. He has a lot to say. Maybe not verbally, people will know that he doesn't say a lot from the bench but he's had a lot to say on paper recently about things like the second amendment, religious liberty and where that clashes with LGBTQ rights. I mean, he's very vociferous in the things he thinks the court needs to be taking on. And with her vote they are probably going many times going to align with him and Justice Alito that he may become more of the leader of that conservative wing. It seems like it would make sense. Also, her adding to the court will probably take away this idea that the chief justice has been the swing vote. In many key cases recently it much more will be interesting to watch how he decides what to do with his vote. He's not going to want to go with the liberal minority if they are often the minority, those three, he's not going to want to be the fourth. It takes away his ability to write the majority opinion or to really be a swing vote. I would think it's going to mean that he more often will probably line up with five or six on the other side then he will in the minority.

      "sentences": "That's right. It's typical that they give both the minority leader and the majority leader a little bit of time before a confirmation vote. Certainly, something of this magnitude. You know a lot of times they allocate time in the Senate by 10-minute blocks, half hour blocks and things like that. Technically they have overrun the time period as to when they were to start here, but because it's the Senate majority leader and out of deference to him, Mitch McConnell, they're going to give him more time. Now again, just to reset what we are expecting here, once Mitch McConnell concludes his remarks, is we expect to have a procedural vote, probably, we don't know that 100 percent but probably have a procedural vote, take attendance, a quorum call, this is where they actually make sure they actually have a quorum to do business here. That will take probably 10 minutes at the most and then they will go to the actual confirmation vote itself. And again, that would probably take less time because you have most senators in the chamber. Now under conventional circumstances, two things would happen. You would usually have senators vote from their desks. They don't want people milling around the Senate chamber, coming in and out of the cloakroom. They want everybody there because of the solemnity and importance of the moment. The other thing that we are not going to have tonight is Mike Pence, the vice president, and the Constitution as president of the Senate, presiding over the vote. You know, it was thought a few days ago that maybe if they had issues with health or if you had other senators who were going to vote no on the Republican side, you know, they were right down to the margin of error here in terms of confirming the Supreme Court nominee and you might have need Mike Pence to cast a vote to confirm Amy Coney Barrett. You know, there had never been a vote to confirm any executive branch nomination. That was broken by the vice president until Betsy DeVos in early 2017. Mike Pence has broken several other ties regarding executive branch nominees since it had never happened with the Supreme Court nominee, but he is not even going to come just to preside over the vote. His vote was not needed two years ago when they confirmed Brett Kavanaugh. They did bring him in and he sat there over the vote and announced the vote total, but don't forget that he has had several aides test positive for coronavirus and there has been concern expressed certainly by Democrats about the safety protocols. They wrote a letter, Democratic leaders in the Senate, to Mike Pence, discouraging him from coming. Saying look, we are worried about doing this with safety and health protocols anyway and we are really concerned if you are going to come up here so he's not going to come to Capitol Hill. They will vote here soon. So again, we are waiting for Mitch McConnell to wrap up and as I said last time, you know, timing and the Senate, it never works out just the way you think. So, we are thinking now, you know, we are pushing 8 o'clock. They might not actually start this confirmation vote until sometime after 9 o'clock, at 8 o'clock, and at the latest they would probably close to vote before 9. Now keep in mind that we are only expecting one Republican no, Susan Collins of Maine, so probably 52 Republican yes' and when they get across that vote threshold, 51 votes, when they are at 51 ayes, we can say that they have basically -- they have the votes to confirm Amy Coney Barrett as the 115th justice of the Supreme Court, but the vote is never final until they actually close the vote. Also, on hand today, she was not here yesterday, you have Senator Kamala Harris, the Democratic vice-presidential nominee. She was not here for the procedural vote yesterday. She is here and she will cast a vote against Amy Coney Barrett -- Amy Coney Barrett later tonight, Martha.",

Often in alignment on judicial philosophy and on critical decisions, so it's very plausible that she would have had a relationship with Justice Thomas while she was clerking for Justice Scalia. So, for him to be there tonight for her big moment is certainly a statement and a welcome to her from somebody who was exceptionally close to the man she calls a mentor and a guiding force in her judicial philosophy, which was Justice Scalia. So, you look forward to where they will go next. Many of these judges, when they're getting prepared to go to the circuit level or here now to the Supreme Court will have some clerks in place. Usually they dip back into the clerk pool of people that have served with them before as clerks. She's had, you know, two or three years now on the seventh circuit. It's very likely that she has talked with some of those clerks about, listen, if I am confirmed to the court tonight, we are going to have to hit the ground running. So, she probably -- you can have up to four clerks there on the Supreme Court. She probably has made some arrangements, had some conversations, you know, you don't want to get ahead of yourself but she is going to jump right into the workload the minute that she is confirmed and sworn in, so it is very smart. It's not really like measuring the drapes ahead of time. You do have to have your clerks ready because she will jump into a term that started a month ago and there's a lot of work to do. And as I said earlier, a lot of these emergency appeals that are coming in on ballot measures and mail-in ballots and all kinds of things, so they are merely every day for the last few weeks we'd seen some type of emergency filing, so she's going to have that to jump into as well as the cases that they're going to start hearing in their next round of arguments on Monday.",

It's a matter left largely after the justices themselves. They are not subject to the decision, the review of lower court judges, so this is left to their discretion. When they have recused themselves, it is because they've had a personal interest, financial or professional, on a case. Justice Kagan recused herself because she was involved in some of the cases that came before the court. There is no case in the history of the court that would support a demand for recusal from his election cases. Moreover, if we are going to make another decision like Bush v. Gore, we don't want to be based on a tie. We want a full panoply of justices to decide. To suggest that she should recuse herself has got to be some kind of judicial shale, and she's not. She's a very serious intellectual and jurist.",

She's in a tough race. That no vote may actually help her there. And there's a lot of conversation about whether the swiftness of this confirmation may cost the GOP and those Senate races in the fall. So, I got to think there was a deal in place for her to vote no because they felt they have the other boats to go forward.",

Voting is well under way, across this country, 62 million people have already voted and tonight President Trump's support is just about within four points of Joe Biden and that is according to the battleground states average at Real Clear Politics. You've got 55.5 to 49.5 and that's a collection of the six states that are most likely to swing this election; Pennsylvania, Arizona, Wisconsin, Florida along with North Carolina and Michigan so today the incumbent worked Pennsylvania very hard, barnstorming all day long from Allentown this morning, mid-day rally in Lititz, Pennsylvania and then this afternoon a third rally of the day around 4:30 this afternoon, that one in Martinsburg, Pennsylvania. The president with his packed schedule went after Joe Biden's schedule."

That expected confirmation will put conservatives at a 6-3 margin on the Supreme Court, haven't seen that since the 1930 so big big changes afoot. Judge Barrett is an originalist in the tradition of Justice Scalia, doesn't believe on legislating from the bench. She would replace Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. I'm going to take you live there as that gets under way because it is a historic vote this evening that we will watch together as it unfolds. We also expect a ceremony will follow at the White House and controversy over that. We're going to get to new details on how that's going to look and feel at around. That'll be around 9:00 this evening but we begin tonight with Karl Rove, former Deputy Chief of Staff to President George W. Bush and a Fox News Contributor. Karl, great to see you tonight.

      "utterance": "So let's start with that Real Clear Politics average poll that shows the tightening of the race about 4.5 points between the two, the incumbent and former Vice President Joe Biden in those really important states. How indicative is that do you think?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROVE",
      "utterance": "Well, I think it's important but probably natural thing what is happening here and particularly after the first debate performance for President Trump, there was a little bit of softening among his base but now it's firming up and as we get to the end of the campaign, people tend to return to their corners. Republicans becoming Republicans, Democrats go into the Democratic corner but you're right, I mean think about it. These are the six states that were in the Real Clear Politics study. I know from polls that I'm looking at in Arizona, private polls in Arizona, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin that the numbers are tightening. In fact I just was briefed on a poll in Wisconsin that had a 5000 person sample that showed significant close into low single digits dividing the two candidates. So if that happens, think about it this way, if the president wins every state, let's take the three Great Lake states; Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, put them to the side for a second. If the president wins every one of the rest of the states he won in 2016 and carry's Pennsylvania, he's got 280 electoral votes, 10 more than needed. If he carries Wisconsin out of those three states, only Wisconsin he's got 270. If he carries Michigan out of those three states and loses Pennsylvania, Wisconsin; he's got 276. So the path to victory lies in these states that the president carries all of these, carries Arizona, Florida, North Carolina and then he just needs one more of these states and the most dangerous one is Wisconsin though because if he's at 270, if he loses either Maine two or Nebraska two then we've either got a tie in the electoral college if he loses one or he's down by two if he loses both of them."

Here's what he said today."

      "utterance": "Look, first of all, he has said on a number of times that he wants to get rid of fracking, no ifs or buts about it and now he's saying I don't want to get rid of the oil industry but he said that again on the record several times and his policies would be devastating. Kamala Harris, Senator Harris is coming to Houston on Friday apparently. Think about this. They have both said on the record and not step back from saying that on the first day in office, the Biden-Harris administration will ban fracking on federal lands and in federal waters and they will - they will stop leasing - oil leasing on federal lands and in federal waters. Houston is the capital city if you will of the Gulf of Mexico exploration and production and you go in and say we're having no more leases in the Gulf of Mexico and we're not going to have fracking in federal lands and federal waters. Well, the Gulf of Mexico is federal waters so you're going to end fracking and a major basin for oil and gas production and devastate the Houston economy. It won't just simply be the people in oil production, it's going to be the people working in the refineries and the people who are working in the chemical plants who depend upon the raw material coming out of the Gulf of Mexico and elsewhere. Second of all let me just make a quick point on this, it's amazing to be. In their plan and they've never get stepped away from it, they're going to end the electricity production that comes from fossil fuels by 2035. 70 percent of our electricity comes from fossil fuels, primarily natural gas so if you're going to take all these brand new natural gas plants that are helping keep the utility prices low and reduce greenhouse gas emissions and literally say within 15 years, we don't care whether those plants are still capable of running for decades more, you're out of business. And incidentally, we're also going to force people to buy electric cars, you're driving up demand for electricity and removing a substantial part of the capacity to generate electricity. That's a recipe for disaster and again natural gas is big in Texas whether it's in the Gulf of Mexico or are in Texas and Texas - land in Texas and--"

That's a pretty bold move to send the vice presidential candidate to Texas. I don't think it's happened since Lloyd Bentsen went there and he was from Texas. So does it - isn't that a sign of confidence on their side."

All the Biden-Harris team says that they're going to do to hurt oil and gas in Texas. Our principal source of revenue for our universities and for our public schools, one of the biggest if not the biggest source of energy - of revenue for schools and universities is oil and gas revenues from royalty payments on state land."

Remember, the National Journal, a respected nonpartisan publication, ranks her, looked at all of her votes in the Senate and ranked her as the most liberal member of the United States Senate. Look at what you said during her fledgling campaign for president in 2019. This woman is on the far left of American politics and supported for example one of the - one of the co-sponsors of the Green New Deal, endorsed Medicare for all. I mean this woman is on the left of American politics. She doesn't like being asked that question so she dodges best as she could, was one of the weirdest laughs I think I've ever heard of any politician that I've seen in decades."

So clearly a lot of people out voting, a lot of energy for this election but still, there are some problems and some irregularities. Let's go to Boston, Massachusetts where authorities announced the arrest of a man they say, set a ballot box on fire. This was in coordination with local authorities and the FBI, early Sunday morning just after 4:00 AM, Eastern Time. Boston firefighters were called to a scene with smoke coming from that ballot box. To stop the fire, crews had to literally fill up the burning box with water. The ballots inside were charred and wet but 87 of the approximately 122 ballots inside can be processed."

Now this comes as early voting number showed Democrats ahead in several key states. In Florida 2.5 million Democrats to 2.2 million Republicans have already voted. Let's take a look at North Carolina where the Vice President is spending quite a bit of time this week. Almost 1.3 million Americans have voted - Democrats I should say have voted to 952,000 Republicans but look not far behind Martha, 924,000 independents. And finally in Pennsylvania where President Trump made three stops today, former vice president Joe Biden also stopped as well, 1.2 million Democrats have voted early while only 350,000 Republicans have voted early. Of course we still have a week, there is still time. Speaking of Pennsylvania, President Trump is talking about having poll watchers in the city of Philadelphia. Meanwhile state officials have said no, city officials have said no and a state judge said that's not going to happen. The Trump campaign continuing to fight that battle in court, Martha."

The criticism from Democrats were more on process than character and in the end, the process while rushed and some would say impolitic was legislatively and constitutionally sound. We're told the Vice President will not attend having been exposed to staffers with COVID-19, he was asked not to attend by Senator Schumer. It appears that no tie breaking vote will be needed. We do expect the swearing in ceremony to follow tonight at the White House. A senior White House official telling Fox that Justice Clarence Thomas will administer the constitutional oath to Judge Barrett. In moments Republican Senator Thom Tillis joins me but we begin with Democrat Senator Chris Coons of Delaware, both members of the Judiciary Committee. Senator, good to have you with us tonight.

Never in American history has there been a confirmation vote for a Supreme Court justice just eight days before presidential elections where a majority of states are already voting. And I'll remind you and your viewers that four years ago, the Republican majority insisted on not holding a hearing or a vote on a highly qualified nominee by President Obama for 10 months. I don't think we should be having this vote. I think we should be delivering relief to American people."

Obviously, there's a lot of bad feeling over the way that this was carried out but none the less as I mentioned, it is a constitutionally and legislatively sound process in terms of moving forward. The President has the right to nominate and tonight she will ultimately be sworn in if the vote goes as expected. I know that you have a lot of concerns about ACA and you know it struck me that all of the pictures of the faces that we have seen on those photos during this process of people who are taking advantage of the pre-existing condition clause in the ACA, really proves that without disapproves - there's a question for you - does it prove that without the - without the mandatory buy-in that it does still stand. The fact that people are using the program, they're using ACA and there's no mandatory commitment to buy ACA proves that without that, which has been eliminated from the - from the program, it does stand and it does work, correct?"

I'm going to proudly cast my vote for an incredible nominee for the Supreme Court. Brilliant, successful jurist, successful mom of seven children. It was very interesting in the hearings that we sat through, just how her credentials and her capabilities came across. That's why they started - my colleagues on the other side of the aisle started this whole false narrative that you just heard Chris lay out. Now Chris is a good friend of mine but I completely disagree with him. I think that Judge Barrett's going to do a great job. The Supreme Court is going to benefit greatly by having her on it."

So I think that we'll see the hearings as after Judge Barrett gets seated on the Supreme Court but I think the American people need to understand that Republicans have voted five times to protect pre-existing conditions. There is a super majority of members who are going to protect them regardless of what the court does and they need to stop the scare tactics to try and win an election."

I heard Karl Rove talk about destroying the energy industry. We all want renewable energy but in Pennsylvania and Texas, Ohio, that's a serious issue and it's a real threat. You got Senator Harris laughing at the idea of being a socialist but she's more liberal in this Congress than Bernie Sanders who is a self-avowed Democrats socialist. So I think that they'll do anything to shift their attention away from what they really stand for. It's higher taxes more regulations and a lot of jobs lost."

Mitch McConnell, the Senate Majority Leader is talking on the floor right now. You know yesterday we kept saying that we thought that this vote would start sometime around 7:26. Now that's kind of an odd time. The reason is the end of the procedural vote to end the filibuster yesterday afternoon at 1.26 p.m. Eastern Time. By rule on a culture vote as it's called here on Capitol Hill, that's what you vote on to actually end a filibuster, opponents of an issue get 30 extra hours so they closed the vote yesterday at 1.26, that's why we are about to go to this confirmation vote now. Now timing in the United States Senate is not exactly swift and that's why things are drifting a little bit later here and they always give deference to the Senate Majority Leader, Mitch McConnell and also the Minority Leader, Chuck Schumer. We might have a procedural vote here first just to take attendance. So, they'll roll through that pretty quickly. Usually on a vote of this magnitude senators would vote from their desks. That might not be the case this time due to the pandemic. Now, Republican Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski said on the day that Ruth Bader Ginsburg died that she opposed forging ahead with the nomination so close to an election. Ginsburg died a few hours later. Murkowski is splitting the atom here. She voted twice in recent days against ending a filibuster on the nomination but Murkowski says the Senate should confirm Barrett on the merits she is a \"yes.\" One Republican told Fox that Murkowski's maneuvers were, quote, \"too cute by half.\" Listen."

Speaking about polls, Martha, quickly, when Chuck Schumer says thwart the will of the American people, there are some polls in recent days that have said do you approve of the confirmation hearing of Judge Amy Coney Barrett.

Shannon Bream is the anchor of Fox News at Night and our chief legal correspondent of course. Give me your big picture look as we prepare for this, Shannon. SHANNON BREAM, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT & ANCHOR:  Listen, she's going to be able to get to work right away, Martha. There are two oaths that a new justice takes. One of those we would see we expect tonight was Justice Clarence Thomas. And remember she clerked for Justice Scalia. Years ago, Justice Thomas was already on the bench than so they certainly have a relationship and know each other so a former clerk now joining the bench, as often happens in recent years. And so, he is the one chosen to swear her in tonight. There's a second oath, though. So once those are both taken by her, she literally will be an official justice and working. They are getting emergency appeals every day now and many of them have to deal with voting procedures in the states."

You and I remember, all of us who watched, she talked about that Jenga game and how you pull out that piece and try to keep the rest of the law together.

I want to just stay with you for a moment here, Shannon. It's interesting to look at the composition of the court with Justice Barrett as the ninth justice and from everything that I'm looking at, they place her sort of with Thomas and Alito to the right of her and then her and then Gorsuch and Kavanaugh, making him sort of the central person in that nine. Explain to everybody what that means. What's the significance of that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BREAM",
      "utterance": "I think it can mean a couple of big things. There are whispers that this now become the Thomas court, that Justice Clarence Thomas who has been there for some 29 years would be the one who would be sort of the thought leader on the conservative side. He is a prolific writer, whether he's in the majority or the dissent or concurrence. He has a lot to say. Maybe not verbally, people will know that he doesn't say a lot from the bench but he's had a lot to say on paper recently about things like the second amendment, religious liberty and where that clashes with LGBTQ rights. I mean, he's very vociferous in the things he thinks the court needs to be taking on. And with her vote they are probably going many times going to align with him and Justice Alito that he may become more of the leader of that conservative wing. It seems like it would make sense. Also, her adding to the court will probably take away this idea that the chief justice has been the swing vote. In many key cases recently it much more will be interesting to watch how he decides what to do with his vote. He's not going to want to go with the liberal minority if they are often the minority, those three, he's not going to want to be the fourth. It takes away his ability to write the majority opinion or to really be a swing vote. I would think it's going to mean that he more often will probably line up with five or six on the other side then he will in the minority. So, a lot of potential changes with her joining the court and we could see that influence very quickly because of these prominent cases."

      "utterance": "Yes. Bret, when you look at this from a political perspective, it's obviously a win for President Trump.

      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Well, I think it's a big win for Republicans, conservatives are very happy about it. However, I don't see them talking about it a lot on the trail. In part because I think it really fires up the left and it gets the left really fired up to get out the vote and to possibly influence what could be court packing to come. So, I don't think it's a political issue. It's a great thing, but as far as a victory that the president can list, he's delivering on the promises that he started with."

She is the ultimate deliverable for that constituency. She is -- she is incredibly smart, a very good writer, and she is also thought deeply about these issues. In many ways, the person she looks most like is Ruth Bader Ginsburg. I mean, their resumes are very similar. You know, they both started in law school, graduate top of their class, then went into teaching. Then wrote a lot about procreational rights. They just reach different conclusions. But they are both coming to the court -- that is Ruth Bader Ginsburg came to the court and she will come to the court as fully formed intellects when it comes to jurisprudence. They are not a work in progress in that sense."

Standby for a moment, we are going to go back to Chad Pergram, who is standing by, who is going to bring us the latest on how everything is expected to play out here tonight. They are a little bit behind schedule, Chad."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERGRAM",
      "utterance": "That's right. It's typical that they give both the minority leader and the majority leader a little bit of time before a confirmation vote. Certainly, something of this magnitude. You know a lot of times they allocate time in the Senate by 10-minute blocks, half hour blocks and things like that. Technically they have overrun the time period as to when they were to start here, but because it's the Senate majority leader and out of deference to him, Mitch McConnell, they're going to give him more time. Now again, just to reset what we are expecting here, once Mitch McConnell concludes his remarks, is we expect to have a procedural vote, probably, we don't know that 100 percent but probably have a procedural vote, take attendance, a quorum call, this is where they actually make sure they actually have a quorum to do business here. That will take probably 10 minutes at the most and then they will go to the actual confirmation vote itself. And again, that would probably take less time because you have most senators in the chamber. Now under conventional circumstances, two things would happen. You would usually have senators vote from their desks. They don't want people milling around the Senate chamber, coming in and out of the cloakroom. They want everybody there because of the solemnity and importance of the moment. The other thing that we are not going to have tonight is Mike Pence, the vice president, and the Constitution as president of the Senate, presiding over the vote. You know, it was thought a few days ago that maybe if they had issues with health or if you had other senators who were going to vote no on the Republican side, you know, they were right down to the margin of error here in terms of confirming the Supreme Court nominee and you might have need Mike Pence to cast a vote to confirm Amy Coney Barrett. You know, there had never been a vote to confirm any executive branch nomination. That was broken by the vice president until Betsy DeVos in early 2017. Mike Pence has broken several other ties regarding executive branch nominees since it had never happened with the Supreme Court nominee, but he is not even going to come just to preside over the vote. His vote was not needed two years ago when they confirmed Brett Kavanaugh. They did bring him in and he sat there over the vote and announced the vote total, but don't forget that he has had several aides test positive for coronavirus and there has been concern expressed certainly by Democrats about the safety protocols. They wrote a letter, Democratic leaders in the Senate, to Mike Pence, discouraging him from coming. Saying look, we are worried about doing this with safety and health protocols anyway and we are really concerned if you are going to come up here so he's not going to come to Capitol Hill. They will vote here soon. So again, we are waiting for Mitch McConnell to wrap up and as I said last time, you know, timing and the Senate, it never works out just the way you think. So, we are thinking now, you know, we are pushing 8 o'clock. They might not actually start this confirmation vote until sometime after 9 o'clock, at 8 o'clock, and at the latest they would probably close to vote before 9. Now keep in mind that we are only expecting one Republican no, Susan Collins of Maine, so probably 52 Republican yes' and when they get across that vote threshold, 51 votes, when they are at 51 ayes, we can say that they have basically -- they have the votes to confirm Amy Coney Barrett as the 115th justice of the Supreme Court, but the vote is never final until they actually close the vote. Also, on hand today, she was not here yesterday, you have Senator Kamala Harris, the Democratic vice-presidential nominee. She was not here for the procedural vote yesterday. She is here and she will cast a vote against Amy Coney Barrett -- Amy Coney Barrett later tonight, Martha."

      "utterance": "Chad, thank you very much. We know that Kamala Harris has said many times that she thinks this process is illegitimate and I'm sure she wants to be there to cast her no vote. I also would venture a guess that if this was coming down to the wire that the Vice President Mike Pence would find some way to get in there to place that vote. Ron Johnson said he would go in in a moon suit if needed be -- if need be when he had the virus a week or so ago. I don't know, time is -- time just seems to be going so fast. Bret Baier and Shannon Bream back with us now. Bret, you heard Chad speaking by the fact that Susan Collins is expected to be the only no vote on the Republican side. She has distinguished herself in that way throughout these Supreme Court procedures with Brett Kavanaugh, she was the one on the fence. She's in a tough Senate race right now."

    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "-- and trailing in the latest polls there. This is a tough spot for her, but she is doing what was expected that she would do. It's interesting that, you know, the Democrats are there in person. Obviously, they boycotted the Senate judiciary committee hearing with no votes against Judge Barrett, but because there's only one Republican vote against her suggests how well she did in that confirmation hearing. Her, you know, credentials, her ability to answer questions straightforwardly, to talk about what originalism is, to be a qualified judge or justice seemed to convince even those that were on the fence. Mitt Romney talked a lot in his speech today about how qualified she was, as did Lisa Murkowski."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yes. Mitt Romney obviously was one of those the people on the Republican side of the fence were concerned about. He's a yes. Lisa Murkowski also a yes against the process, but for the person essentially. Shannon, Justice Thomas is going to swear her in. Tell us a little bit about the significance of that moment and who is chosen for that moment and also, if I could ask two questions at once here, a little bit about the clerks and how that gets set up during that process for her."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BREAM",
      "utterance": "Yes. Certainly, there are, as I mentioned earlier, there are two different swearing ins. There is a constitutional oath, a judicial oath, so very meaningful for her I'm sure that she has Justice Thomas there. As I mentioned earlier, she clerked for Justice Scalia. They were very close friends. Often in alignment on judicial philosophy and on critical decisions, so it's very plausible that she would have had a relationship with Justice Thomas while she was clerking for Justice Scalia. So, for him to be there tonight for her big moment is certainly a statement and a welcome to her from somebody who was exceptionally close to the man she calls a mentor and a guiding force in her judicial philosophy, which was Justice Scalia. So, you look forward to where they will go next. Many of these judges, when they're getting prepared to go to the circuit level or here now to the Supreme Court will have some clerks in place. Usually they dip back into the clerk pool of people that have served with them before as clerks. She's had, you know, two or three years now on the seventh circuit. It's very likely that she has talked with some of those clerks about, listen, if I am confirmed to the court tonight, we are going to have to hit the ground running. So, she probably -- you can have up to four clerks there on the Supreme Court. She probably has made some arrangements, had some conversations, you know, you don't want to get ahead of yourself but she is going to jump right into the workload the minute that she is confirmed and sworn in, so it is very smart. It's not really like measuring the drapes ahead of time. You do have to have your clerks ready because she will jump into a term that started a month ago and there's a lot of work to do. And as I said earlier, a lot of these emergency appeals that are coming in on ballot measures and mail-in ballots and all kinds of things, so they are merely every day for the last few weeks we'd seen some type of emergency filing, so she's going to have that to jump into as well as the cases that they're going to start hearing in their next round of arguments on Monday."

      "utterance": "Just more -- she's got a busy life and it's going to get even busier. Let's bring in Jonathan Turley. Joining me once again now, George Washington law professor and Fox News contributor. You know, with regard to what Shannon just spoke about, some of these voting issues that are before the court, there has been some discussion about her appointment by President Trump and the election going on and whether or not she should have to recuse herself and I heard you speak about this this afternoon as an insult and I'd love for you to explain to everybody at home why you see it that way."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TURLEY",
      "utterance": "It's utterly absurd, what is being suggested by some of these members. There is no basis why she should recuse herself from voting on these pending cases or on election cases. There is a standard for recusal that is codified. Some justices have recused themselves, relatively few cases. It's a matter left largely after the justices themselves. They are not subject to the decision, the review of lower court judges, so this is left to their discretion. When they have recused themselves, it is because they've had a personal interest, financial or professional, on a case. Justice Kagan recused herself because she was involved in some of the cases that came before the court. There is no case in the history of the court that would support a demand for recusal from his election cases. Moreover, if we are going to make another decision like Bush v. Gore, we don't want to be based on a tie. We want a full panoply of justices to decide. To suggest that she should recuse herself has got to be some kind of judicial shale, and she's not. She's a very serious intellectual and jurist."
