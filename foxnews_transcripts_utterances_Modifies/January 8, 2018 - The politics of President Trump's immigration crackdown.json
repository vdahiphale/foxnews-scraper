El Salvador, almost 200,000 people expiring September of next year, Honduras, 57,000 expires July 5th, 2018, Haiti, 46,000, Nepal, Syria, there you see those are also 2018 expiration for temporary protection, essentially meaning that the immigrants could come here and stay inside the U.S. DHS, Department of Homeland Security saying the original conditions caused by the 2001 earthquakes in El Salvador no longer exist. So it's coming to an end and it's sparking a lot of reaction.  Let's bring in our panel: Steve Hayes, editor in chief of The Weekly Standard; Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at The Federalist, and Charles Lane, opinion writer for The Washington Post. Let's start, Steve, with this TPS, temporary protection status. The administration saying, hey, listen it's over. El Salvador can take the people back. For different lawmakers they're saying wait a second. They've been here almost 20 years and they've established themselves and their families.",

This is a program that was put in as an emergency measure. It's been on the books now for 18 years, as you suggested in the intro. The conditions that caused it in the first place, these dual earthquakes, are no longer in existence. And the justification for it I think has shifted quite obviously, and its proponents are not even really pretending that the justification has shifted. Donald Trump ran for office saying he was going to change immigration laws and change them in a pretty dramatic way to make them more restrictive. That's what he's doing. Nobody should be surprised that he's trying to do this. And I think the objections are pretty tough to justify at this point.",

It's like how we talk about DACA. The d stands for \"delayed action.\" Americans have been told that these are programs that are temporary, that they're not permanent, and then there's a large bait and switch where after decades they say, well, now there's nothing we can do. To me this points to the much larger problem of our immigration policy which is not very coherent, which doesn't think through what the needs of the country are and how they match with the citizens. And unfortunately we are just not having a very good conversation about it. There really are lots of conflicts here. There is the rule of law. There is with the country needs. There are the needs of immigrants and there are the ways that immigrants help countries and the way that they hurt, and nobody is having a good conversation.",

Having said that, I also don't think it's very realistic to talk about returning so many people to El Salvador in effect over the next 18 months. And the reason I say that is it could be a total of about 400,000 -- sorry, 200,000 temporary departure people, but they seem to have at least 100,000 children among them, many of whom are U.S. citizens. That's a big problem in and of itself. And I suspect a lot of them are going to attempt to stay here some other way. They're going to try to get legal status. And a lot of them will just stay illegally if they can't find legal means. So what I hope was going to come out of it is that sort of like he tried to do with DACA, the president has put Congress on notice. They've got 18 months to come up with something permanent that makes sense for these folks, and I would say to Representative Diaz-Balart, that's your job.",
