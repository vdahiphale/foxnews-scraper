You know, these are people who die -- it's like a thunderbolt of violence comes out of the sky. They are not sick. Nobody expects them to be dead. And then all of a sudden they are dead. And what's happening in the society right now is you've got a new mayor and you got governor who is saying to the district attorney on crime saying, look, I can replace you if you don't do what I want you to do. And everybody is starting to feel a little better, maybe there's hope. We've got a governor saying she can replace the D.A. who does not want to really prosecute crime. But then she says to (inaudible) that there is no way she will cave on the fundamental preface of the controversial legislation of bare reform. So she is talking out of both sides of her mouth. She is saying I will not force or work with any of the Democrats to change bail reform, which is the fundamental problem. All the criminals who want a war on cops, who feel emboldened by killing cops are committing crimes because they know that they will walk out the next day. So the criminal justice system today, Geraldo, is not about criminal justice anymore. It's about politics. It's about politics. It's about people taking sides and it's about criminal privilege.",

And state legislator wrote into the books that this is capital murder when you murder a police officer and these are special categories. When you kill a child, when you kidnap someone and kill him, you torture someone to death, terrorism, state legislators reserved that special right to fry or put in prison for life those people. And when it's usually in America, when you see a rash of cop killings like we've seen, dozens of officers shot since the beginning of the year, several dead, the president of the United States comes out and he says something publicly and he meets the moment. He gathers people together. This president hasn't done that. This president put out a tweet, Geraldo. Put out a tweet. He didn't write it. He didn't push send. They put out a tweet, he said sorry for your loss. That's it. So Joe Biden has not done what the American people expect the president to do in a moment like this. He used two support law enforcement.

Some of these injuries are grievous. That makes a total of 13 cops shot across this country in the last week. That happening as an outpouring of grief and support for two of our nation's finest, fallen NYPD Officers Jason Rivera and Wilbert Mora. A wake going on right now for Officer Rivera at St. Patrick's Cathedral. It's just a couple of blocks from here. Hs flag-draped coffin carried in as thousands paid their respects. His funeral will be held tomorrow. And last night hundreds of first responders and residents braving the cold in Harlem, lining the streets outside the 32 precinct to mourn. One officer sharing this heartbreaking remembrance. When I saw the line down on the (inaudible) apartment, I couldn't believe my eyes. He saved my life so many times, but I could not save his. I hope one day we'll see again each other."

You know, these are people who die -- it's like a thunderbolt of violence comes out of the sky. They are not sick. Nobody expects them to be dead. And then all of a sudden they are dead. And what's happening in the society right now is you've got a new mayor and you got governor who is saying to the district attorney on crime saying, look, I can replace you if you don't do what I want you to do. And everybody is starting to feel a little better, maybe there's hope. We've got a governor saying she can replace the D.A. who does not want to really prosecute crime. But then she says to (inaudible) that there is no way she will cave on the fundamental preface of the controversial legislation of bare reform. So she is talking out of both sides of her mouth. She is saying I will not force or work with any of the Democrats to change bail reform, which is the fundamental problem. All the criminals who want a war on cops, who feel emboldened by killing cops are committing crimes because they know that they will walk out the next day. So the criminal justice system today, Geraldo, is not about criminal justice anymore. It's about politics. It's about politics. It's about people taking sides and it's about criminal privilege."

When I was growing up, the two worst people that you could be, child molester and cop killer, and they were in a special category because their behavior was so heinous and despicable that society at large decided they had to die, either in prison, through street justice, or getting fried at the electric chair. And state legislator wrote into the books that this is capital murder when you murder a police officer and these are special categories. When you kill a child, when you kidnap someone and kill him, you torture someone to death, terrorism, state legislators reserved that special right to fry or put in prison for life those people. And when it's usually in America, when you see a rash of cop killings like we've seen, dozens of officers shot since the beginning of the year, several dead, the president of the United States comes out and he says something publicly and he meets the moment. He gathers people together. This president hasn't done that. This president put out a tweet, Geraldo. Put out a tweet. He didn't write it. He didn't push send. They put out a tweet, he said sorry for your loss. That's it. So Joe Biden has not done what the American people expect the president to do in a moment like this. He used two support law enforcement. I mean, we used to see him march with them, hug them, and that was great. But he is AWOL on it now and the American people are really, really hurt by it."

Everything that he's been doing is kneeling before the woke. You cannot embrace law enforcement. And it isn't the public that forgets the cop killings, it's the media. And the media deliberately forgets these cop killings because they have amplified the climate that made it possible. CNN, congratulations, you built this. They have been milking the crime as a hoax narrative for so long, piggybacked on maybe a decade of anti-cop narratives. On Sunday, they said that the crime wave was a hoax. Since then, 13 cops have been shot, some of them killed. Do they look at their coverage now on Thursday, do they look at that coverage on Sunday, do they feel something sick in their stomach or are they on some kind of strong medication that prevents them from feeling anything? Because there's a horrible truth out there that they, CNN and others, contributed to a climate that made it racist to support cops and racist to be vocally anti-crime, because they lumped crime in with social justice and that it was okay to commit these crimes in the name of social justice. And it was the police based on a few isolated cases of brutality that made all cops evil. The media push this. That was close. That was close."
