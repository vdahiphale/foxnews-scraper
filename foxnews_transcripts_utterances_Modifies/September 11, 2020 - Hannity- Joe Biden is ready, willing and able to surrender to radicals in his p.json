      "sentences": "Welcome to \"Hannity\". Breaking this Friday night, President Trump has just brokered yet another historic peace deal in the Middle East, announcing a breakthrough agreement between Bahrain and Israel. We'll have full coverage just ahead.  Also, 19 years ago today, America, suffered the worst attack on U.S. soil in the history of this great nation. A radical group of evil radical Islamic terrorists turned passenger planes into literal weapons of war, murdering 2,977 innocent men women and children, including brave, selfless firemen and cops and first responders. You know the guys that went up when everybody else was racing down to save lives and put their lives in danger, many lost them.  Every year, it's a hard show to do. Think back to that day I remember where I was. I'm sure you remember where you were. I remember every detail.  I -- seeing real human suffering and the tragedy that was occurring right before our eyes, and I'm sure all of you do as well. We must always remember they were at war with us. 9/11 Commission report got that part right. We were not at war with them. There is evil in this world and we've seen it. Last century alone, 100 million dead human beings because of some ism, fascism, communism, Nazism, right? Now, we're dealing with radical Islamism.  We saw it on 9/11/2001, we must never forget. Always be prepared. Earlier today, the vice president was in New York City participating in the ceremony at Ground Zero and even exchanged a few moments with the ever clueless, forgetful Joe Biden as the pair put politics aside to remember the sacrifices of their fellow Americans.  And over in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, that field in Pennsylvania, President Trump spoke of heroism and sacrifice. The passengers of United Flight 93, delivering an address centered around unity and remembrance.   Let's roll, remember, Todd Beamer (ph). Take a look.",

But, first, it is clearer than ever thought tonight that Biden Harris, this is the most radical, this is the most extreme this is the most far left, out of the mainstream ticket of any modern American political party in history. And guess what, it looks like reality is now finally beginning to set in for ever so slow and forgetful Joe as his campaign is devolving into a full-blown panic tonight.   Just yesterday, his campaign press secretary at a complete on-air meltdown and disaster when asked simple questions by our own Bret Baier, simple questions about Biden's position on the China travel ban. Did you support it when Donald Trump implemented it? Which he didn't. Whether Joe needs a teleprompter to get through softball interviews because -- look at this recent interview, Biden gets the question. Move it up, move it up.  Take a look.",

And now, it comes as what barely there forgetful Joe and his campaign continue to spin in a million different directions flipping and flopping and flailing on everything from fracking to the travel ban to policing to violent rioting that he called mostly peaceful, even manufacturing and trade he's lying about. Listen to Biden yesterday, talking about support for the failed NAFTA deal that Trump renegotiated, not him and not Barack. And guess what? They didn't do criminal justice reform, they didn't do police reform, they didn't do opportunity zones, and they didn't shatter every record low unemployment for African-Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian-Americans, women in the workplace, youth unemployment, African-American youth unemployment.   No, their recovery -- let's see -- the worst since the ‘40s, 13 million more Americans on food stamps, eight million more in poverty, Joe. That's after eight years you as vice president.

      "sentences": "Whoops, Trump's better than Biden. Yeah, his plan worked out much better. Ask yourself this. Why is now Biden changing his tune, trying to misdirect voters?  Because, let's see, Biden doesn't actually believe in anything. He is a professional, all talk, no action politician, the total embodiment of all things the Washington swamp and sewer, all talk, all talk, all promises, gets nothing done. He was vice president for eight years. I can't think of a single thing that he did in that time to make Americans lives better.  Donald Trump kept all his promises. And the struggles don't stop there, because the ever slow forgetful Joe is behind on enthusiasm, behind on policy, and his polls are collapsing after embracing, of course, Bolshevik Bernie socialism and the economy killing Green New Deal and his plan goes beyond that, pledging trillions in the New Green Deal.  So he's now being forced to try and erase his past positions, rewrite history daily, and the mob in the media, they just ignore it all, pretending like he never said that he was in favor of redirecting funds away from the police and saying the police become the enemy. And trying to pretend that he never said he'd ban fracking not once, not twice, but numerous times, and trying to pretend like he's actually accomplished something after being in Washington nearly 50 years. And, of course, this show will continue to do the job the mob and the media will never do, actually tell you the truth, vetting the candidate Joe Biden, because guess what? Biden already put down his far left wish list it's on paper, in stated promises he made with the -- with Bolshevik Bernie himself. The Bolshevik Bernie-Biden manifesto released this summer, lays out in all the detail you ever want the new, extreme, radical, socialist, lawless Democratic Party's plans for your future. A hundred and ten pages outlines massive tax increases, trillions of new increases, trillions in new spending for the New Green Deal madness, wide open borders, it's essentially an all-encompassing welfare state where everything basically is free, which means that it'll be funded by you, we the American people, the taxpayers. Now, these are Biden stated promises that he's put in writing. The manifesto makes clear that pretty much everything is a human right. Page 17, no one should have to spend more than percent of their income for housing. Who's going to pay for the rest of that mortgage?  That sounds like it was written by Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez. The document proves that Biden shares a vision similar to Bolshevik Bernie on health care, establishing a heavily subsidized government-run public option. How did Obamacare work out?  Biden also vows to implement a version of this New Green Deal that will go further than Ocasio-Cortez's New Green Deal, and putting Ocasio-Cortez on his climate unity task force and phasing out all fossil fuels in 15 years. That would be the lifeblood of the world's economy. And additionally, Biden wants hundreds of millions of new solar panels. How did Solyndra work out? Which we know will mean higher energy prices for all businesses and every American. And by the way, we'll now be dependent on outside energy again. And while the plan doesn't explicitly call for dismantling the police, Biden and Bernie, they want to, quote, civilian core of unarmed first responders.  OK, we're going to send in a psychiatrist into a potentially violent situation, domestic dispute community policing what exactly does that mean. It sounds an awful lot like defunding the police, like he said he'd do. Ad the Biden-Bernie manifesto also calls for the elimination of cash bail. You know, they did that in New York. OK, get arrested, they get sent out the same night to rejoin the activities, which has been a complete disaster, allowing violent criminals back out on the street with zero consequences. They were having bank robberies go on guy gets robs a bank gets caught licks let out goes out rob's another bank doing it five, six times in New York City. Biden claims to care the most about vulnerable communities, his education plan would take away all choice from poor and working families with the worst school districts. For example, he wants to burden charter schools with more government regulation, he makes it clear that school choice programs don't have much of a future in Joe Biden's America, same guy that didn't want integration of schools because he didn't want his kids going to schools that were, quote, racial jungles.   And get this -- no standardized testing, because Biden and Bernie, they want to eliminate that too. How do we know how the kids are doing? On immigration, Biden doubling down on open borders, amnesty, the united sanctuary states of America. He wants to end construction of the border wall, wants to end the president's \"remain in Mexico\" policy, which has reduced asylum fraud to this country and is perhaps the president's greatest first term policy achievement. In other words, Biden, Kamala Harris, they want us to be the united sanctuary states of America, just like Kamala's state of California, along with implementing a hundred day moratorium on any deportation. What does it all mean? It means that all of this is a preview of coming attractions. He's telling you what his agenda is, is America listening? The destructive agenda that Joe Biden is stating and his supporters have put on paper, they're ready to unleash all of this if they win in 53 days. Biden can try and hide it all, the media is certainly doing the work for him. But it's still out there. They still wrote it down on paper. That's still their stated plan.  Make no mistake: Biden and Harris, they're ready, they're willing, they're able to surrender to the radicals that are them and their now entire party. And, by the way, all of this you decide in 53 days. Here with reaction, FOX News contributors Tammy Bruce, Dan Bongino, one with civil rights attorney Leo Terrell. All right.

All of this is -- you can't trust Joe Biden. He's reading answers on a teleprompter that he doesn't even -- he hasn't even really seen himself ahead of time. So we're looking at in America where it's very clear to Democrats and Republicans and independents, if you want the country to look like Seattle and Portland and Los Angeles and New York, vote Democrat. They have also -- that is where they've shown you what they will do. That is what they've done to really kind of signal and perhaps it's subconscious. But that is what existing Democrat leadership in America's great cities is willing to do to its own people who have voted them in a single party rule and that's what they've gotten away with. So you've got to keep that in mind, in the suburbs, women in particular, that this is a dangerous dynamic, not just philosophically but when it comes to real terms and real violence.",

We have a county health director on tape telling everybody we'll open the schools up after the election. You know what they're trying to do? They're trying to undermine this president, but they don't talk about his policies because he gave us the lowest unemployment, he gave us low taxes, he gave us a booming economy and he's trying to do it right now during the pandemic and he's successful.

Obviously, I support the president because he's the conservative candidate.  And where I think even I failed a little bit is we use the words about Biden, which are accurate by the way, radical, extreme agenda and they're right. Biden may have painted himself as a moderate in the past. He certainly isn't anymore. But I don't think we've put meat on the bone and made it really bleed for people, make them feel it. You have to understand what he's going to do to you if elected, using his words, by the way, not mine. Your taxes will go up.

Biden is in the pocket of the teachers unions, they hate charter schools and he said it. I'll just throw one more at you. You mentioned, Sean, in your opening the public option which he supports. Has anybody really looked what that -- looked at what that is? Oh, it sounds cute, oh, there'll be a government option. That's terrific. Do you understand what the public option is? It's a Trojan horse to destroy your private health care plan using government subsidies to undercut them, meaning you like your health care?

      "utterance": "Welcome to \"Hannity\". Breaking this Friday night, President Trump has just brokered yet another historic peace deal in the Middle East, announcing a breakthrough agreement between Bahrain and Israel. We'll have full coverage just ahead. Also, 19 years ago today, America, suffered the worst attack on U.S. soil in the history of this great nation. A radical group of evil radical Islamic terrorists turned passenger planes into literal weapons of war, murdering 2,977 innocent men women and children, including brave, selfless firemen and cops and first responders. You know the guys that went up when everybody else was racing down to save lives and put their lives in danger, many lost them. Every year, it's a hard show to do. Think back to that day I remember where I was. I'm sure you remember where you were. I remember every detail. I -- seeing real human suffering and the tragedy that was occurring right before our eyes, and I'm sure all of you do as well. We must always remember they were at war with us. 9/11 Commission report got that part right. We were not at war with them. There is evil in this world and we've seen it. Last century alone, 100 million dead human beings because of some ism, fascism, communism, Nazism, right? Now, we're dealing with radical Islamism. We saw it on 9/11/2001, we must never forget. Always be prepared. Earlier today, the vice president was in New York City participating in the ceremony at Ground Zero and even exchanged a few moments with the ever clueless, forgetful Joe Biden as the pair put politics aside to remember the sacrifices of their fellow Americans. And over in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, that field in Pennsylvania, President Trump spoke of heroism and sacrifice. The passengers of United Flight 93, delivering an address centered around unity and remembrance. Let's roll, remember, Todd Beamer (ph). Take a look."

In New York, Arlington and Shanksville, people raced into the suffocating smoke and rubble. At Ground Zero, the world witnessed the miracle of American courage and sacrifice. Today, we honor their extraordinary sacrifice and every first responder who keeps America safe."

But, first, it is clearer than ever thought tonight that Biden Harris, this is the most radical, this is the most extreme this is the most far left, out of the mainstream ticket of any modern American political party in history. And guess what, it looks like reality is now finally beginning to set in for ever so slow and forgetful Joe as his campaign is devolving into a full-blown panic tonight. Just yesterday, his campaign press secretary at a complete on-air meltdown and disaster when asked simple questions by our own Bret Baier, simple questions about Biden's position on the China travel ban. Did you support it when Donald Trump implemented it? Which he didn't. Whether Joe needs a teleprompter to get through softball interviews because -- look at this recent interview, Biden gets the question. Move it up, move it up. Take a look."

Last night, Biden reportedly had another bizarre moment, telling a campaign fundraiser that he hopes the debates don't devolve into an all-out brawl. Really, Joe? If I were you, you might want to focus on figuring out how much coffee you're going to drink the day of the debate and how are you going to answer a question without a teleprompter.

Ask yourself after hearing all this, Democrats sound an awful lot like they're encouraging what we've been witnessing playing out in cities, in the streets all across the country. And, of course, denying the reality. What responsibility to these Democrats and Joe Biden have for refusing to condemn the rioting, denying it for months? And now, it comes as what barely there forgetful Joe and his campaign continue to spin in a million different directions flipping and flopping and flailing on everything from fracking to the travel ban to policing to violent rioting that he called mostly peaceful, even manufacturing and trade he's lying about. Listen to Biden yesterday, talking about support for the failed NAFTA deal that Trump renegotiated, not him and not Barack. And guess what? They didn't do criminal justice reform, they didn't do police reform, they didn't do opportunity zones, and they didn't shatter every record low unemployment for African-Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian-Americans, women in the workplace, youth unemployment, African-American youth unemployment. No, their recovery -- let's see -- the worst since the ‘40s, 13 million more Americans on food stamps, eight million more in poverty, Joe. That's after eight years you as vice president.

    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Whoops, Trump's better than Biden. Yeah, his plan worked out much better. Ask yourself this. Why is now Biden changing his tune, trying to misdirect voters? Because, let's see, Biden doesn't actually believe in anything. He is a professional, all talk, no action politician, the total embodiment of all things the Washington swamp and sewer, all talk, all talk, all promises, gets nothing done. He was vice president for eight years. I can't think of a single thing that he did in that time to make Americans lives better. Donald Trump kept all his promises. And the struggles don't stop there, because the ever slow forgetful Joe is behind on enthusiasm, behind on policy, and his polls are collapsing after embracing, of course, Bolshevik Bernie socialism and the economy killing Green New Deal and his plan goes beyond that, pledging trillions in the New Green Deal. So he's now being forced to try and erase his past positions, rewrite history daily, and the mob in the media, they just ignore it all, pretending like he never said that he was in favor of redirecting funds away from the police and saying the police become the enemy. And trying to pretend that he never said he'd ban fracking not once, not twice, but numerous times, and trying to pretend like he's actually accomplished something after being in Washington nearly 50 years. And, of course, this show will continue to do the job the mob and the media will never do, actually tell you the truth, vetting the candidate Joe Biden, because guess what? Biden already put down his far left wish list it's on paper, in stated promises he made with the -- with Bolshevik Bernie himself. The Bolshevik Bernie-Biden manifesto released this summer, lays out in all the detail you ever want the new, extreme, radical, socialist, lawless Democratic Party's plans for your future. A hundred and ten pages outlines massive tax increases, trillions of new increases, trillions in new spending for the New Green Deal madness, wide open borders, it's essentially an all-encompassing welfare state where everything basically is free, which means that it'll be funded by you, we the American people, the taxpayers. Now, these are Biden stated promises that he's put in writing. The manifesto makes clear that pretty much everything is a human right. Page 17, no one should have to spend more than percent of their income for housing. Who's going to pay for the rest of that mortgage? That sounds like it was written by Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez. The document proves that Biden shares a vision similar to Bolshevik Bernie on health care, establishing a heavily subsidized government-run public option. How did Obamacare work out? Biden also vows to implement a version of this New Green Deal that will go further than Ocasio-Cortez's New Green Deal, and putting Ocasio-Cortez on his climate unity task force and phasing out all fossil fuels in 15 years. That would be the lifeblood of the world's economy. And additionally, Biden wants hundreds of millions of new solar panels. How did Solyndra work out? Which we know will mean higher energy prices for all businesses and every American. And by the way, we'll now be dependent on outside energy again. And while the plan doesn't explicitly call for dismantling the police, Biden and Bernie, they want to, quote, civilian core of unarmed first responders. OK, we're going to send in a psychiatrist into a potentially violent situation, domestic dispute community policing what exactly does that mean. It sounds an awful lot like defunding the police, like he said he'd do. Ad the Biden-Bernie manifesto also calls for the elimination of cash bail. You know, they did that in New York. OK, get arrested, they get sent out the same night to rejoin the activities, which has been a complete disaster, allowing violent criminals back out on the street with zero consequences. They were having bank robberies go on guy gets robs a bank gets caught licks let out goes out rob's another bank doing it five, six times in New York City. Biden claims to care the most about vulnerable communities, his education plan would take away all choice from poor and working families with the worst school districts. For example, he wants to burden charter schools with more government regulation, he makes it clear that school choice programs don't have much of a future in Joe Biden's America, same guy that didn't want integration of schools because he didn't want his kids going to schools that were, quote, racial jungles. And get this -- no standardized testing, because Biden and Bernie, they want to eliminate that too. How do we know how the kids are doing? On immigration, Biden doubling down on open borders, amnesty, the united sanctuary states of America. He wants to end construction of the border wall, wants to end the president's \"remain in Mexico\" policy, which has reduced asylum fraud to this country and is perhaps the president's greatest first term policy achievement. In other words, Biden, Kamala Harris, they want us to be the united sanctuary states of America, just like Kamala's state of California, along with implementing a hundred day moratorium on any deportation. What does it all mean? It means that all of this is a preview of coming attractions. He's telling you what his agenda is, is America listening? The destructive agenda that Joe Biden is stating and his supporters have put on paper, they're ready to unleash all of this if they win in 53 days. Biden can try and hide it all, the media is certainly doing the work for him. But it's still out there. They still wrote it down on paper. That's still their stated plan."

What they're telling you is the least that they think they can get away with, to say nothing of the fact that if they're already trying to gaslight the American public with Joe Biden who's effectively a wax figure, how fake do you think what it is they're telling you is? All of this is -- you can't trust Joe Biden. He's reading answers on a teleprompter that he doesn't even -- he hasn't even really seen himself ahead of time. So we're looking at in America where it's very clear to Democrats and Republicans and independents, if you want the country to look like Seattle and Portland and Los Angeles and New York, vote Democrat. They have also -- that is where they've shown you what they will do. That is what they've done to really kind of signal and perhaps it's subconscious. But that is what existing Democrat leadership in America's great cities is willing to do to its own people who have voted them in a single party rule and that's what they've gotten away with. So you've got to keep that in mind, in the suburbs, women in particular, that this is a dangerous dynamic, not just philosophically but when it comes to real terms and real violence."

The guy is a foreign policy genius and the Democrats won't talk about his foreign policy. This guy has brought us peace on a tremendous important day of 9/11. But let's look at the Democrats. The Democrats right now, Sean, and I think everyone knows, they're trying to keep the economy down. Why? Because, it doesn't look good. We have a county health director on tape telling everybody we'll open the schools up after the election. You know what they're trying to do? They're trying to undermine this president, but they don't talk about his policies because he gave us the lowest unemployment, he gave us low taxes, he gave us a booming economy and he's trying to do it right now during the pandemic and he's successful. And these guys are just trying to make this a personality war. I will assure you of one thing, if the moderators do their job at these debates, the entire nation is going to know that Joe Biden is not strong enough, not fit enough, and more importantly not knowledgeable enough to run this country like Donald Trump. I should have left the Democratic Party four years ago. I wish I had, but I'm glad I left now and I'm glad I'm on the right team."

And this is where I think, Sean, in these closing days of the election. Me, I'm a conservative, I'm -- you know, I'm not a journalist, I'm an opinion maker here on the channel. Obviously, I support the president because he's the conservative candidate. And where I think even I failed a little bit is we use the words about Biden, which are accurate by the way, radical, extreme agenda and they're right. Biden may have painted himself as a moderate in the past. He certainly isn't anymore. But I don't think we've put meat on the bone and made it really bleed for people, make them feel it. You have to understand what he's going to do to you if elected, using his words, by the way, not mine. Your taxes will go up. You got a tax cut under President Trump, between three and four percentage points of your income. He has pledged multiple times to take that away, meaning your take-home pay and your money is going bye-bye make it about character, whatever you want, Joe Biden's infamous character is not going to pay your bills. Secondly, if your kids are in a charter school and you like that charter school, you can kiss that charter school bye-bye too. Biden is in the pocket of the teachers unions, they hate charter schools and he said it. I'll just throw one more at you. You mentioned, Sean, in your opening the public option which he supports. Has anybody really looked what that -- looked at what that is? Oh, it sounds cute, oh, there'll be a government option. That's terrific. Do you understand what the public option is? It's a Trojan horse to destroy your private health care plan using government subsidies to undercut them, meaning you like your health care? Well, you can forget about keeping it just like Obama promised you last time or Biden will promise you again. That's going right in the garbage. This is going to affect you.

The president announcing today that peace deal, this is number two in the Middle East, between Bahrain and Israel, mainstream media didn't even mention that the president was nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize. Huh, wonder why. Also, why is no one on the left outraged over high ranking members on Mueller's team, dozens of phones wiped clean before they send them to the inspector general? What crimes committed. White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany, she'll join us next with reaction. Also, you're going to want to get your DVR set. Moving tribute to those who lost their lives 19 years ago today, 9/11/2001, and America's Mayor Rudy Giuliani, straight ahead."

So, will the mob, the media give this major accomplishment the credit it deserves? Well, they didn't mention the first piece deal with the UAE. I doubt it they'll do it here. Yesterday, by the way, new documents released by the DOJ showing that multiple members of Mueller's team actually wiped their phones clean before turning them over to the inspector general. And tonight, Republicans are rightly demanding answers and suggesting this could amount to anticipatory obstruction of justice. Where's the outrage from the mob and the media? Imagine if Donald Trump did it. Joining us now, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany. OK, well, we had a lot of people get prosecuted by the Mueller mob for process crimes, including obstruction and not handing over emails and lying to Congress. Didn't we, Kayleigh?"

They signed it anyway. When they finally got to the sub source -- in other words, the source behind Steele's dirty Russian dossier that Hillary paid for, well then they found out in January of 2017, the sub source said, no, this is all bar talk. None of this is true. So it was never -- now we know it's debunked. So it was never verifiable which means we never should have had a Mueller investigation, period.

This was a very curious email, not asked about that because they simply don't care and there are two tiers of justice in this country -- one for Mueller's team and Hillary Clinton, and another for Michael Flynn and the Trump administration."

And I think this is an appropriate time to remind people that those police officers that are now getting attacked and firefighters, and they all ran into that building and they weren't asking if anybody was white or black or gay or not gay, or they weren't asking for diversity numbers or percentages.

I didn't tell them how many people -- that night I was asked, how many people died and I said it's too much for you to bear right now. I never told them what was really going on at Ground Zero, how terrible it was, what we were really recovering. I didn't tell them that New York City was in danger of being flooded for three weeks because the slurry wall had been breached. And if we didn't get that fixed and if we had had a hurricane, we had an evacuation plan ready, but I wasn't going to frighten them with that. If you're a leader, you take things on you. You don't just spit everything out to people, and the president did a terrific job. Let's go back to the middle of March and April, when Governor Cuomo said the cooperation with the federal government has been terrific and president Trump should be praised, I wrote an op-ed article saying how unusual it was. Gavin Newsom said, I'm going to get a lot of trouble for saying this but the federal cooperation has been 100 percent. Governor Murphy, Democrat New Jersey, couldn't get more. You couldn't expect more from President Trump than we've gotten. That's before they were all forced to become political hit men. When they were telling the truth, President Trump had about as good a response as any president could possibly have under those circumstances and a lot better than Obama and Biden had Ebola, and a lot better than they had to Benghazi when Obama slept all night while his people were being killed."
