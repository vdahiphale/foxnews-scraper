He says while the country has been sucked into a blinding vortex of gossip and hostility, mostly toward the president, the world is undergoing the most dramatic change since World War II.  From the power struggle in Venezuela, protest in the streets of France, drama over Brexit, and a worldwide sex abuse scandal that hangs over one of the world's largest religions.  And in the Middle East, Israel's prime minister indicted ahead of a pivotal election. Saudi Arabia's crown prince cozying up to China. While nuclear powers, India and Pakistan are on the knife edge of war.  Perhaps, the biggest threat, China, as they push for military and economic world dominance. And now, they are beating the U.S. with the release of A.I. game-changing technology in 5G. My next guest says those are the real bombshells. Moments ago, I spoke with Newt Gingrich, former Speaker of the House, Fox News contributor, and the host of the new podcast, Newt's World.",

So, I think in that sense, he did the right thing. I suspect they're going to come back with much tougher sanctions. And I suspect they're also going to put more pressure on China. I was encouraged with the president's toughness on this issue. But I also think, dealing with China, in the long run, is a thousand times more important than dealing with North Korea.

So it's an enormous breakthrough in capabilities. The danger for us is that the Chinese, in particular, their dominant company, Huawei, have been methodically working this issue. We have frankly been nowhere.   President Trump understands it. He's talked about it. But the objective fact is that our bureaucracies are behind the curve. We just suffered a terrible week in Barcelona at the world of mobile phone conference which is an annual event. And Huawei, I would say today is very substantially ahead of us. We can catch up and we can compete. But if we don't, what you end up with is China not only dominating the technology and the job creation and the innovation but all and only gathering up all that information and data.  I mean, if they put in Chinese cameras, for example, for facial recognition, I suspect we should assume that the Chinese will be gathering all that data and archiving it in China.

And I think, it's a -- I can't quite imagine why the president said, what he said. Does he know -- he knows it's not true. He knows it can't possibly be true. And I think he was trying to be polite. But frankly, it never helps with a dictator to be pleasant to them when they lie to you. It's much better as Reagan would do with Gorbachev to take him head-on and make sure that they understand that you're not stupid and that you're not going to tolerate they're lying to you.

That's not the way it's going to work. I need you to commit to denuclearization, and I need to see it. And if you're not going to do that, I'm leaving.\"   And that's what he did. So, a good thing. And I hope that going forward now, a couple of things happen. One is the sanctions themselves, Russia and China are not in compliance with the three U.N. resolutions. Both of them are providing assistance to North Korea.  Russia has never complied right from the outset. For the life of me, I don't know why. We have satellite photos. Take them, show them, and expose them to the world. Put it in front of the U.N. Security Council. China, delicate situation to be sure because we're also dealing with trade imbalance and tariffs and negotiations coming up in March. But we've got to call them out on him as well.  Let's even stiffen up these sanctions even more. Remember, the reason why Kim Jong-un came to Singapore and came to Vietnam is because of those sanctions. And obviously, it was the one thing he truly wanted the most, was relief from those. So, let's get back onto that. The second thing is if we're going to meet again, let's make certain there's a structure in place before that. In fairness to the administration, they tried to meet with the North Korean envoys many times in the last eight months. And up until the last few weeks, our envoy Steve Biegun was not able to meet with them. That's got to stop or else, we're not heading towards another summit.  Let's put a structure a pathway forward for negotiations and let's put each other's cards on the table and make some progress.

Investigators found his naked body lying on a mattress. In the lawsuit, Miss Nixon alleges that Buck had previously solicited sex from her son and injected him with crystal meth. As evidence, she references Gemmel's journal where he wrote, quote, \"I've become addicted to drugs and the worst one at that. Ed Buck is the one to thank. He gave me my first injection.\"  Going on to write, quote, \"If it didn't hurt so bad, I'd kill myself, but I'll let Ed Buck do it for now.\" After Gemmel Moore's death Ed Buck was considered a suspect but no charges were filed because police couldn't prove Buck furnish the drugs. Then last month, Timothy Dean, another black male was also found dead inside the Buck's Hollywood apartment. Dean's family released a statement that reads in part, quote, \"Ed Buck is heartless but he should know that our family will not rest until justice prevails.\" And because of the Timothy Dean case investigators have now reopened the case of Gemmel Moore.

They've grown up in a world that is been very different than previous generations. They've seen a lot of gun violence. They see how technology has changed, they're worried about climate change and what they're really looking for is not someone who's going to try to spin something to them, but someone who's actually going to start solving some of these problems.

From the power struggle in Venezuela, protest in the streets of France, drama over Brexit, and a worldwide sex abuse scandal that hangs over one of the world's largest religions. And in the Middle East, Israel's prime minister indicted ahead of a pivotal election. Saudi Arabia's crown prince cozying up to China. While nuclear powers, India and Pakistan are on the knife edge of war. Perhaps, the biggest threat, China, as they push for military and economic world dominance. And now, they are beating the U.S. with the release of A.I. game-changing technology in 5G. My next guest says those are the real bombshells.

So, I think in that sense, he did the right thing. I suspect they're going to come back with much tougher sanctions. And I suspect they're also going to put more pressure on China. I was encouraged with the president's toughness on this issue. But I also think, dealing with China, in the long run, is a thousand times more important than dealing with North Korea. And we are only beginning the process of coming to grips with how big a challenge China is going to be."

So it's an enormous breakthrough in capabilities. The danger for us is that the Chinese, in particular, their dominant company, Huawei, have been methodically working this issue. We have frankly been nowhere. President Trump understands it. He's talked about it. But the objective fact is that our bureaucracies are behind the curve. We just suffered a terrible week in Barcelona at the world of mobile phone conference which is an annual event. And Huawei, I would say today is very substantially ahead of us. We can catch up and we can compete. But if we don't, what you end up with is China not only dominating the technology and the job creation and the innovation but all and only gathering up all that information and data. I mean, if they put in Chinese cameras, for example, for facial recognition, I suspect we should assume that the Chinese will be gathering all that data and archiving it in China. So, this is a big, big issue."

Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, and part of what's complicating those equations is -- you know, warmer relationships or business partnerships that they have with China. So, when you take a look, for example, at Saudi Arabia, and you look at the crown prince there, who you know, we've covered the Khashoggi story over the last several months, which is problematic to be sure. But he's also sort -- of you know, waving away his concerns about Chinese -- you know, keeping Muslims and concentration camps. You know, sort of cozying up to China, how problematic is that?"

You have that in Venezuela where the Chinese have an estimated, $60 billion invested. They're in many ways now the number one backer of the Venezuelan dictatorship even more than the Cubans. And I think you're going to find that the Chinese are very methodically going all over the planet being competitive virtually everywhere. And that we do not today have the kind of strategic effort we're going to need, if we're, in fact, to remain capable of dealing with them.

Then I think she's exactly right to take that position. I believe that the president should reconsider what he said. It is impossible for that event to have occurred without Kim Jong-un knowing about it. It was -- it was in the news media everywhere. We were formally protesting at the level of their government. And I think, it's a -- I can't quite imagine why the president said, what he said. Does he know -- he knows it's not true. He knows it can't possibly be true. And I think he was trying to be polite. But frankly, it never helps with a dictator to be pleasant to them when they lie to you. It's much better as Reagan would do with Gorbachev to take him head-on and make sure that they understand that you're not stupid and that you're not going to tolerate they're lying to you. And in this case, Kim Jong-un just flat-out lied to the president of the States."

That's not the way it's going to work. I need you to commit to denuclearization, and I need to see it. And if you're not going to do that, I'm leaving.\" And that's what he did. So, a good thing. And I hope that going forward now, a couple of things happen. One is the sanctions themselves, Russia and China are not in compliance with the three U.N. resolutions. Both of them are providing assistance to North Korea. Russia has never complied right from the outset. For the life of me, I don't know why. We have satellite photos. Take them, show them, and expose them to the world. Put it in front of the U.N. Security Council. China, delicate situation to be sure because we're also dealing with trade imbalance and tariffs and negotiations coming up in March. But we've got to call them out on him as well. Let's even stiffen up these sanctions even more. Remember, the reason why Kim Jong-un came to Singapore and came to Vietnam is because of those sanctions. And obviously, it was the one thing he truly wanted the most, was relief from those. So, let's get back onto that. The second thing is if we're going to meet again, let's make certain there's a structure in place before that. In fairness to the administration, they tried to meet with the North Korean envoys many times in the last eight months. And up until the last few weeks, our envoy Steve Biegun was not able to meet with them. That's got to stop or else, we're not heading towards another summit. Let's put a structure a pathway forward for negotiations and let's put each other's cards on the table and make some progress. And if there's no progress made, then don't get the president involved."

No one has ever stood up to them the way this president is standing up to them. And I think they thought, well, progress is going to be made, we'll make our compromise, and we'll get on with it.

They have -- Martha, they have aside from the public's Liberation Army, they have 700,000 troops that are organized just to control population. And they put them in regions where those soldiers are not from. Because they don't want another Tiananmen Square where they ask the division commander to clear the Square years ago and he refused.

So that's the concern. There are other issues we spell out in the letter. The idea that he didn't register as a lobbyist when you have two companies you're representing, one from Kazakhstan, one from Korea, a whole host of things that we think are important. Remember, when a witness is coming in and saying kind of things that Mr. Cohen is saying, any witness credibility is always an issue.

He wasn't on a retainer and yet he was getting reimbursed for something else, back and forth. He didn't want to work in the White House because he had his dream job, but he wanted to work in the White House.

I didn't want to work in the White House but if I was offered a job in the White House I'd take it 100 percent. I mean, you -- this is the point. This is why he's going to prison for lying to Congress. He comes in front of Congress and says he didn't lie but we have six different instances where he said something that was not accurate.

They're -- Tom Steyer, mega-donor for the Democrats, they are going to do it. That's how radical they have become. So I think this was the step one and this is the best witness they had.

I was happy to do it for you. You just keep killing it. Gaetz was heard telling him. Gaetz told him that he does not discuss his calls with the President of the United States.

Investigators found his naked body lying on a mattress. In the lawsuit, Miss Nixon alleges that Buck had previously solicited sex from her son and injected him with crystal meth. As evidence, she references Gemmel's journal where he wrote, quote, \"I've become addicted to drugs and the worst one at that. Ed Buck is the one to thank. He gave me my first injection.\" Going on to write, quote, \"If it didn't hurt so bad, I'd kill myself, but I'll let Ed Buck do it for now.\" After Gemmel Moore's death Ed Buck was considered a suspect but no charges were filed because police couldn't prove Buck furnish the drugs. Then last month, Timothy Dean, another black male was also found dead inside the Buck's Hollywood apartment. Dean's family released a statement that reads in part, quote, \"Ed Buck is heartless but he should know that our family will not rest until justice prevails.\" And because of the Timothy Dean case investigators have now reopened the case of Gemmel Moore. LaTisha Nixon has also named Los Angeles County District Attorney Jackie Lacey as a codefendant accusing the D.A. of violating civil rights laws saying Ed Buck wasn't prosecuted because he was white and because he donates to prominent Democratic politicians.

      "utterance": "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says that he is innocent after Israel's attorney general says that he will indict him on corruption charges in three separate cases. The bribery charges stem from two years of investigations into Netanyahu's relationship with an Israeli telecommunications tycoon. He will also be charged with fraud and breach of trust and two other cases. This is just two months before Israel's highly anticipated election which happens on April 9. Netanyahu call the allegations part of a politically motivated witch hunt. And under Israeli law, he will not have to step down if the A.G. follows through with the indictment."

      "utterance": "We coddled dictators, chosen the word of dictators and thugs even over our own intelligence communities. The love affair, love letters with Kim Jong-un. Standing before the world and taking the word of Vladimir Putin over the entire intelligence community. Our national reputation is being tarnished."

      "utterance": "That's Joe Biden speaking in Nebraska just a little white ago amid mounting speculation about whether or not the former vice president is going to run in 2020. Tonight, there are reports that he is soliciting potential advisors and advice from social media executives for strategies on how to better appeal to younger voters. Here now someone who could potentially face off against Joe Biden, former Maryland congressman and 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, John Delaney. Good to have you with us tonight, sir. Thank you very much for being here."

    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "What do you think about the fact that he is seeking advice from social media about how to run younger, I guess is one way to say it, because there are lots of younger folks in the race?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DELANEY",
      "utterance": "Well, you know, listen, I don't know what Vice President Biden is actually thinking about in terms of the race and whether he's going to run, so I don't really have an opinion of what he's doing with his campaign. I like a lot of people are big fans of the vice president. I'm focused on my campaign. I think the voters are looking for the candidate who will best bring our country together and actually start solving the problems. And I think young voters are looking for that. I was just on Clemson yesterday speaking to a group of young voters, and when you listen to what young voters are really looking for, they're looking for solutions. They've grown up in a world that is been very different than previous generations. They've seen a lot of gun violence. They see how technology has changed, they're worried about climate change and what they're really looking for is not someone who's going to try to spin something to them, but someone who's actually going to start solving some of these problems. This, to me, is very much solutions-oriented generation, and I think what they're looking for is something very different than what they've seen from our political system over the last several decades."

    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So, I'm wondering about this question. Just because it came up today. Are they interested in nationalizing the legalization of pot because that Cory Booker introduced a bill today that would legalize marijuana nationwide? And the cosponsors included all the Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris, and Kristen Gillibrand all on board with that. Are you on board with that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DELANEY",
      "utterance": "Yes, I do think young people are interested in certainly decriminalizing marijuana. And so many states have made it legal at least within state laws and there's a big movement going on in this country. And I do think the federal government should get out of the way and allow states to do what they want to do with respect to marijuana."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "You're not -- so you're not concerned about the impact on society of legalizing pot?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DELANEY",
      "utterance": "Well, look, again, study after study has indicated that marijuana is actually less addictive than alcohol, right? So, of course, I'm --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "But there's also many studies that show that most people who end up with opioid addiction problems started with pot."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DELANEY",
      "utterance": "Look, again, I think our approach to marijuana historically has failed. Right? And I think if we do take the next step and legalize marijuana, we should regulate it, we should make sure young people aren't getting it. We should make sure there's proper labeling. We should make sure there are resources in the public health system, right? So, I'm very mindful of that as everyone should be, right? But I this we also have to recognize that across this country there's growing adoption for some form of legalization whether it be for medical uses or certainly for to decriminalize it --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yes. I mean, it's definitely the trend. I just wonder if it's going to turn --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DELANEY",
      "utterance": "That's truly the trend. And that's what the American people are looking for."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "-- to be a good idea. You know, it's like gambling all across America. It hasn't always been so great for states."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DELANEY",
      "utterance": "But what we have to do is we also have to regulate it, right? Because right now we all know that it's going on, it's going on in the shadows. There's a lot of crime, a lot of people get imprisoned for a long period of time with possession even though they haven't committed violent crime. We all know what's happening right now isn't working, so I think, yes. I think young people are interested in that. I think they are interested in a lot of issues. I mean, what the younger generation in many ways if you think about it, they grew up at a time when technology has allowed them to go around things they don't like."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "POMPEO",
      "utterance": "Unfortunately, we didn't get it all the way. We didn't get to something that ultimately made sense for the United States of America. We are certainly closer today than we were 36 hours ago, and we were closer than we were a month or two before that. So, real progress was made."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Secretary of State Mike Pompeo today on the progress with North Korea despite the abrupt end to the summit. Pompeo was sworn in as the 70th secretary of state back in April of last year after he served also as the head of the CIA in this administration. He recently sat down with me to talk about his journey from first in his class at West Point to our nation's top diplomat. This is his untold story."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "POMPEO",
      "utterance": "When I was a very lieutenant, I would have been 22, or maybe 23 years old. I conducted my first patrol along the Eastern German border. That was my mission. I was in a Cavalry unit and I had my Cavalry platoon. I remember going out and seeing the border. I had prepared but when you saw, you saw what it looked like on the other side it was the East Germany and a little bit of Czechoslovakia both under the control of the Soviet empire. You could see evil. You could literally see the freedom that was being denied to the people on that side of the border. You could see that these fences and dogs and towers and they would fly Mi-24 Hind helicopters along the border. You could see they were design to destroy the liberty of their people. They weren't aimed at stopping us from attacking. They were aimed at denying the freedom to the people of East Germany and Czechoslovakia. I could see that evil. And that shaped my life. I see that here as secretary of state. I understand that there are people who are intent to un-good and those who are truly aimed at destruction and evil and corruption. We have to call it out when we see it. And America has a responsibility to protect itself by pushing back against those evil nations and those evil leaders who intent to do real harm to the world."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So fast forward to today, who are the most evil actors out there today who have those kinds of visions and designs for their people."

    {
      "speaker": "POMPEO",
      "utterance": "So, you see it most clearly in the Islamic Republic of Iran, that is they are exporting in a way that few other nations are, they're trying to deliver that revolutionary Islamic zeal not only inside of their own country but now exporting it to Lebanon, into Syria, into Iraq, and into Yemen that's true evil. When it's not about to put pressure on your own people and to deny them their freedom and he want to go out and export that and do that to others outside of your own nation, that's true evil."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "POMPEO",
      "utterance": "Martha, I'm always reminded as America's most senior diplomat of the return of four great Americans who were killed in Syria. I'm always reminded that when we have an incident like that it was a diplomatic failure that we didn't do our tasks sufficiently well. If we're good, if our team is out everywhere trying to solve these problems through political resolution and making deals with other countries and sharing American values in a way that will reduce conflict. If we can do that, boy, we'll have to put a lot fewer of America's young men and women in harm's way. I'm very mindful that I remember my days. I was never in combat. I served in Germany and Fort Carson, Colorado but I have lots of colleagues who fought in lots of America's wars. And I'm very mindful of what they go through, what their families go through and it always impresses on to me the enormous responsibility we have at the State Department to make sure that we put fewer Americans at risk."
