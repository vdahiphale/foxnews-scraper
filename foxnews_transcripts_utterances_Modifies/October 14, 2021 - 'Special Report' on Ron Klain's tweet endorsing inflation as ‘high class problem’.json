The tweet in question was really a retweet, he points to this from Jason Furman. \"Most of the economic problems we are facing, inflation, supply chains, et cetera, are high class problems. We wouldn't have had them if the unemployment rate was still 10 percent. We would instead have had a much worse problem.\" Well, if you look at the price jumps on common items here, gas up 42 percent, used cars up 24 percent, TVs 13, furniture 11, meats, poultry, fish, and eggs up 10 percent year-over-year, 2021 to 2022, high class or not. Let's bring in our panel, Bill McGurn, columnist for \"The Wall Street Journal,\" Mara Liasson, national political correspondent of National Public Radio, and Steve Hayes, editor of \"The Dispatch.\" Steve, what you think of this? STEVE HAYES, EDITOR, \"THE DISPATCH\": Well, look, I think it's one thing if you have a respected economist like Jason Furman tweeting this. I think he is widely respected among the Republicans and Democrats alike, and I think he was making a defensible point. It's another thing if you have the White House chief of staff seeming to endorse this. And I think it does, despite Jen Psaki's unwillingness to talk about it, Ron Klain's Twitter account does get a lot of scrutiny. People do follow it. People try to understand the signals he's sending when he likes a tweet and when he retweets something. I think in this case what Republicans have jumped on is this idea that these are high class problems dominantly affecting upper-class, when, as you say, if you look at inflation and the effects, it's widely across the U.S. economy.",
