This was the first time, I think, that he referred to his presidency as a show.

And it makes you think, what's going to -- what's the second term Trump look like? You're going to have, it's going to be more theatrical, more set locations, more guest stars and road trips?  Because that's what happens when a TV series gets renewed, it's not a reelection, it's the renewal of a TV show and there're going to be more stuff after the debate. You saw a sense of the Democrats realization that this wasn't locked, impulsiveness, or Russian bots that elected him. That this is a unique skill set that only he possesses and that they can't be.

This was the first time, I think, that he referred to his presidency as a show. And for people who are used to being critical of Trump who are no longer critical, are the people that can discern the difference between the job and the show. The things that he is doing, which are incredibly positive and effective with the economy and jobs and prosperity and peace, the separate -- to separate the craziness of this gives you a healthy peace of mind that never-Trumpers can't do. And it makes you think, what's going to -- what's the second term Trump look like? You're going to have, it's going to be more theatrical, more set locations, more guest stars and road trips? Because that's what happens when a TV series gets renewed, it's not a reelection, it's the renewal of a TV show and there're going to be more stuff after the debate. You saw a sense of the Democrats realization that this wasn't locked, impulsiveness, or Russian bots that elected him. That this is a unique skill set that only he possesses and that they can't be.

On Saturday night, 8:00 p.m. Eastern, you have \"WATTERS WORLD.\" We're going to react live to the Nevada caucus results, and we have Blago, and he's dishing on what he knows about Barack Obama and what he knew about the selling of the Senate seat. Very interesting. Dagen McDowell."

They were in places like Willowbrook. This group home was awful, but that does not represent the group homes that we have advocated and helped to develop in this city and around the country. The group homes are wonderful. And we run 40 -- more than 40 of them in the New York area, an organization called Life's Work. We raise funds, you know, and you should do it for you know, the Autism Speaks. A lot of these organizations have these group homes. I think you have a picture of me and Sean Hannity. We do the golf tournament every year with these. These are the kids in the group home. One of them, Bauer. Many group homes. There's Sean and I. We play golf together. 35 years I've had that tournament. We did charity boxing matches. It's just a great, great cause. Support -- and Medicaid is drying up. These folks are desperate for help, so be charitable."
