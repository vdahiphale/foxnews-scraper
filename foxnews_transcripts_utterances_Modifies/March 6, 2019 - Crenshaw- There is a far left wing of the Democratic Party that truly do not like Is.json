So, it's a matter of how we have to be careful, how we use words.  If she or anybody else wants to support the Palestinians, that's perfectly appropriate. If she thinks that Palestinians are getting a bad deal, she should say so. But she should say it in a way that is -- that does not cause people to think her language is anti-Semitic or gives cover to those who are clearly anti-Semitic.

As an anchor and reporter who has moderated many debates and done so fairly and professionally, we ask tough but fair questions. As you would imagine, this is very disappointing news. Several Democrats have commented today, among them Congressman Garamendi, who was on earlier, made off camera comments on this saying he thinks this is a mistake. All viewers, especially everyone out there with a large audience as we have here at Fox News, should have the opportunity to watch these debates, to participate in them because there are viewers of all stripes across the channel watching Fox News every night. Our senior vice president Bill Sammon issued this response today. \"We hope the DNC will reconsider its decision to bar Chris Wallace, Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum, all of whom embody the ultimate journalistic integrity and professionalism, from moderating a Democratic presidential debate. They are the best debate team in the business and they offer candidates an important opportunity to make their case to the largest TV news audience in America which includes many persuadable voters.

And so, all of us need to watch our language, and I'll say that to myself, I say it to my other colleagues because it can be used as a weapon against people. People of color, people of one faith or another.

I don't know anybody who have -- any American that has an allegiance in the sense that, that was used here. We certainly do support Israel. And we have, and we should continue to do so. At the same time, all of us recognize that there's a very serious problem with the Palestinians and Israelis that needs to be resolved. All of us have worked on this issue for years, if not decades. There's work to be done. The problem still persists. But it's not a matter of allegiance, it's a matter of support for one of our principal allies, both long and short term. And hopefully, long into the future. That's where I'm coming from. I know that's where many people --"

      "speaker": "GARAMENDI",

But that's certainly the way it's been construed, and certainly the way it's being used by many people on whatever side of this issue want to talk about. So, it's a matter of how we have to be careful, how we use words. If she or anybody else wants to support the Palestinians, that's perfectly appropriate. If she thinks that Palestinians are getting a bad deal, she should say so. But she should say it in a way that is -- that does not cause people to think her language is anti-Semitic or gives cover to those who are clearly anti-Semitic. And there is more than enough of that far too much in America. And that's where the real harm comes that somebody might construe that today, there's an anti-Semitic movement in Congress."

Just like we have the right to criticize it and to condemn it. Now, it is something different when we're talking about what committee she's on, because the real problem here is that she has a platform on the Foreign Affairs Committee to condemn Israel. OK, so that tells us that the Democratic leadership also supports that. Because here is the thing. This is how we are assigned to committees here in Congress.

And she's sort of making the bridge between what Omar is talking about and people who are concerned about -- you know, these anti- Semitic tropes that said they're sometimes called. She says, \"If we're so concerned about implied tropes, why aren't we concerned about this one? Where was the concern last week when 26 Democrats voted for a GOP amendment to expand ICE powers rooted in the racist and false trope that Latino immigrants are more dangerous than U.S. born citizens?\""
    },
    {

OK, even if she believes this craziness. But, the reality is, is that enforcing the law is not racist. OK? Asking ICE to report when an illegal immigrant is trying to buy a weapon is not racist. That's enforcing our laws. And I think most Americans want. Want us to enforce our laws. We want to feel like our rule of law is working out.

What we don't want to do is allow them to be used as tokens to get across our border. And that's what our laws incentivize right now. So, the young lady who came into my office, she was kidnapped years ago of around 2013. They tried to cross the border with her twice. Both times, they were refuted, but the third time they made it across. Nothing to stop them, no wall, no agents, plenty of open territory. She was brought to New York and she was raped for five years. About 30 times a day. This was a heartbreaking story I've ever heard. All right? And she told me the story, she was -- she was almost emotionless about it. I mean, it was -- it was really something to see. This is what our laws incentivize. Because they incentivize children to be brought across. That is your ticket. To come across as an adult, our system still works, we can send you right back. But adults with children - -"

Well, how about what's going on North Africa? There's 193 nations in the world, but they always fixate on one. And they have a problem because the Democratic leadership as you point out, as Representative Garamendi confirmed, they have to have a blanket generic meaningless statement. Because if they were actually going to be exact and focused, and really oppose anti-Semitism about a third of this new Democratic progressive party would walk.

It represents your constituents. It represents the new wing of the Democratic Party. There is benefits to be accrued. Go to it.

They all did things that were pretty radically an obscene and yet that was a network for all the criticism of Trump that they work with, the Republicans did. They have a long history of this. Remember that Anita Dunn the communications director said that your organization wasn't a legitimate news organization. They monitored James Rosen, they went after the -- they meaning the Associated Press, they monitored reporters. And so in their view -- and they quote in New York or the and in the New York Times, you're the only conservative. There's a lot of cable networks that are liberal and there's mainstream networks I think are more liberal than not. And so they know what they're doing and their attitude is they're going to punish Fox by trying to show the world that their support for conservatives and liberals, but more conservative is beyond the pale.

Meanwhile, the Jackson's estate is suing HBO, calling the film a public lynching. Also developing tonight, R. Kelly has been taken into custody just a short time ago. Here are the images from him earlier today. They are holding him because they say that he owns a $160,000 in child support, this as we hear from the R&B singer on a separate case for the first time.

Kelly is accused of sexually abusing four females, three of whom were underage at the time. Prosecutors say there is ample evidence to support the charges including from the alleged victims, Kelly's former business associates, and they mentioned a reported video tape that allegedly shows Kelly having sex with a girl who repeatedly states that she is only 14.

He has said so many things that are so out of step with the mainstream or the party now. That would really hurt him. I would use his identity against him.

Democrats always do better when they run young, inspiring, fresh new candidates like the young Bill Clinton of the 90s, Barack Obama. When they try the nostalgia thing with Perry (ph), Gore (ph), Hillary, it doesn't add up."

      "utterance": "So, before we go tonight, as we did mention earlier and many of you have been responding online to this news, the Democratic National Committee made a decision today that Fox News will not host any of their planned 22 primary debates during the 2019-2020 election cycle. As an anchor and reporter who has moderated many debates and done so fairly and professionally, we ask tough but fair questions. As you would imagine, this is very disappointing news. Several Democrats have commented today, among them Congressman Garamendi, who was on earlier, made off camera comments on this saying he thinks this is a mistake. All viewers, especially everyone out there with a large audience as we have here at Fox News, should have the opportunity to watch these debates, to participate in them because there are viewers of all stripes across the channel watching Fox News every night. Our senior vice president Bill Sammon issued this response today. \"We hope the DNC will reconsider its decision to bar Chris Wallace, Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum, all of whom embody the ultimate journalistic integrity and professionalism, from moderating a Democratic presidential debate. They are the best debate team in the business and they offer candidates an important opportunity to make their case to the largest TV news audience in America which includes many persuadable voters. We hope they will consider that. This is “The Story”. Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2019 ASC Services II Media, LLC.
