      "sentences": "All right. So, I'm going to go through this slowly. What I'm going to reveal to you, doesn't matter where you stand in the political spectrum. It should shock every American to their core.  Let's start at the beginning. On January 24th, 2017, that's the first week of Donald Trump's presidency. Then-deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe called then national security adviser Michael Flynn to discuss some upcoming training. The conversation quickly turned into a casual request from McCabe to Flynn that he speak with FBI agents over -- about his overseas communications, which we now know were surveilled by federal officials. Remember, Flynn was the incoming national security advisor. It would not be unusual for him to have discussions with foreign leaders and soon-to-be counterparts.   What is unusual is this. We know Flynn's surveillance, the unmasking, the lack of minimization of his name, and the leaking of raw intelligence by the outgoing administration, the Obama administration, is beyond rare, likely elicited in terms of its actions, in other words, a crime. But having done nothing wrong himself, Flynn agreed to capping the nothing wrong himself, he agreed to the meeting the various time day at the White House. He also agreed not to have any attorneys present per Andrew McCabe, the deputy FBI director's request. McCabe literally told General Flynn, a lawyer was not necessary. McCabe who would soon be fired himself for lying told him this. Now, during the meeting, Flynn was casually questioned by two FBI agents, including, there he is, Peter Strzok, you know, the guy that loathed Donald Trump, the man that said Hillary Clinton should win 100 million to zero, the man with the insurance policy and the media leak strategy against the new president should he happen to win, the guy that was ultimately fired because of extreme anti-Trumped bias. Well, according to the FBI's report of the meeting, that's known as a 302, where they discussed the meeting with someone they talk to. It's called the 302.   Agents did not come on purpose, warned General Flynn about any potential crimes. And they didn't ask him to explain or clarify any inconsistencies in his answers, and because they wanted him to be, quote, relaxed. This is, by its very definition, a perjury trap. You don't tell somebody you really are investigating, let's put them in a relaxed position, let them talk to us and then, by the way, you don't need a lawyer. Now, as we speak, Lieutenant General Michael Flynn's life, it has been on hold for a long time. He's awaiting sentencing for allegedly lying to investigators during that meeting. A meeting so unusual that even fired FBI Director James Comey himself has now admitted was not standard operating procedure. And he actually -- this is the sickest part of it -- bragged that he ordered it anyway because he thought he could get away with it. This is what we have been telling you. Abuse of power, corruption, not rank and file FBI, the highest levels of the FBI and the DOJ, it shows you this, week one of the Trump administration, the fix was in from day one.  Watch this.",

Bush of administration, for example, or the Obama administration. The protocol, two men that all of us have increased appreciation for over the last two years.  In both of those administrations, there was process. And so, if the FBI wanted to send agents into the White House itself, to interview a senior official, you would work through the White House counsel and there'd be discussions and approvals and who would be there. And I thought, it's early enough, let's just send a couple guys over.",

      "sentences": "I wouldn't have tried, I wouldn't have gotten away with this in a prior administration. Really?  This is week one of the Trump presidency. Isn't the name of Jim Comey's book “A Higher Loyalty”? Wouldn't that be to the United States Constitution, the rule of law, equal justice under the law? Does not sound like a virtuous public servant to you, or someone trying to trap Lieutenant General Michael Flynn from day one?   This is how these corrupt officials, again, not rank and file, treated a duly elected president, his first week in office. A 33-year three star veteran hero, five years in combat. And here we have James Comey, fired for mishandling the Clinton investigation, he, too, wanted Hillary to win. Andrew McCabe, he set up the meeting on the phone and said, you don't need a lawyer, fired by the FBI for lying. One of the agents, meeting with Flynn, Peter Strzok, of course, know, fired for his rampant anti-Trump bias. In other words, the three main people initially involved in the Flynn have been fired. Think about that. One day after learning about the shady interrogation tactics from the FBI -- well, there is a judge, U.S. district judge named Emmet Sullivan. He has now ordered to the special counsel to turn over all of the governments documents related to this questioning of General Flynn, by the way, by tomorrow, a rare move from a federal judge, which brings us to a shocking new development. The Federalist pointed out something brilliant, what could be in my mind a major bombshell inside the Flynn sentencing memo. They pointed out footnote 23. Footnote 23 references the 302 memo of August 22nd, 2017. Flynn's interview was in January 24th, four days into the presidency. Flynn's interview happened way back when.  Now, here's the problem. Flynn's interview with the FBI on January 24th, 2017, the 302s written seven months later? A text message messages for Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, they seem to reference Flynn's interview, his 302 being completed on February 14th.  And meanwhile, James Comey, he references reading this 302 before he was fired in May. So the question remains, why was a new 302 drafted in August by the special counsel? What information had changed? Can it be trusted? Was there an earlier 302 memo? Where there were revisions in the memo? And is there a smoking gun here? Either way, we deserve answers. Now, tomorrow, by 3:00 p.m., U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan could have the answers to all of these questions. That is how long he has given to turn over these documents related to the questioning of Lieutenant General Michael Flynn. This is the same judge who dismissed the corruption conviction, eight convictions, of Republican Senator Ted Stevens after discovering rampant misconduct from federal prosecutors in that case, including what he called a blatant attempt to withhold exculpatory evidence.   Now, we have been pointing out, it's important to know, the lead prosecutor in the special counsel investigation, Mueller's pit bull, Andrew Weissmann. We talked a lot about him, and Jeannie Rhee, who worked for the Clinton Foundation. But Weissmann in particular, he's a pit bull, has quite a track record with exculpatory evidence. In the case of Andersen Accounting, they overturned Weissmann's prosecution 9-0, does not happen that often. In the case of four Merrill Lynch executives who went to jail for a year, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals overturned those convictions, whole year of their life gone, after Weissmann was rebuked for what? Withholding exculpatory evidence.  Why would Mueller hire that guy?  Now, tonight, whatever happens in the case of Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, the damage is done. Legal bills have caused this man his home, wrecked his finances, destroyed his impeccable reputation, 33 years in the military, five years of combat duty, tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. Here's our question tonight. Is this how we are going to treat American servicemen and women, war heroes? Because if it is, nobody is safe. This is not how a fair justice system is supposed to operate in a constitutional republic. Instead -- this is the sad part to me -- everything we have been telling you about, for nearly two years, we are facing a two tiered justice system where anybody apparently associated with Trump is going to be targeted. Democrats, they seem to always get off scot-free. That, of course, includes Hillary Clinton.   But breaking today, we learn to some new information about her bought and paid for dirty dossier. You know the law firm that hired Christopher Steele -- well, the law firm actually funneled money to the Fusion GPS, the oppo research group, to put the seedy document together. That was Perkins Coie.  Well, they considered using -- he considered using, Christopher Steele, the findings to challenge a 2016 election results in court. That is why he was doing it, which makes yet another way Hillary Clinton was planning to use the dirty dossier to rig the election after the election should she lose. And, of course, this was all done with her money funneled through the law firm as a legal expense, not a political expense. Sounds like campaign finance issues. A lot of people in the media are interested in that topic, but not with Hillary. Yet no investigation into that campaign finance violation.  The question we all have to ask ourselves is why. Now, it should be obvious. Her last name is not Trump. She is not anyone who supports Trump. So, she has a whole different justice system, one that Trump supporters don't have. We'll have a lot more in this later.  But also, tonight, once again, Democrats continuing to play politics with our nation security. President Trump is standing strong, calling out the far left border hypocrisy. Watch this.",

We can do it almost perfect job if we have the wall and proper border security, and that is what we're going to do for the American people.",

      "sentences": "It's really stunning. Democrats say they want border security, sounded like Donald Trump in the Obama years, when it comes to making it happen, they stone wall, they deflect, they distract, they reveal their true open borders agenda. Now, despite overwhelming evidence that walls actually work. Just this week, the Department of Homeland Security released new details on the progress that we have made since President Trump got to office on the border barriers in California, Texas, explaining that as of November 21st, 2018, Customs and Border Protection have constructed more than 31 of the 30 miles that were authorized by Congress. Last year, the remaining miles scheduled for completion soon, adding that, quote, the bottom line walls work. When it comes to stopping drugs, illegal aliens to cross our borders, border walls are proving extremely effective. Take a look at the before-and-after photos from the DHS of the El Centro border in, well, you can see, Southern California. And while those are encouraging results, there's a lot more to do, which is why the president is forging ahead with his demand for $5 billion to fully secure our country's national security issues, make people safe on both sides of the border. We learned about the horrible tragedy tonight, a 7-year-old girl from Guatemala died of dehydration and shock after crossing into the U.S. illegally with her father and the remote New Mexico desert.   It's like I have been saying over and over again. A wall can prevent these types of heartbreaking stories once people know they can't get in. They are not going to come. It's a treacherous journey. Dangerous. They ran out of food and water apparently four days before she crossed into this country, the tragedy that can be avoided. It's also an issue of national security. We are also learning a suspected terrorist is the one leading the group of Central American migrants demanding 50 grand in reparations from the U.S., each, to return home. His name is Alfonso Guerrero Ulloa, expected of the 1987 bombing in Honduras that wounded six American soldiers.   And, of course, as I have said many times, look, most people I'm sure come here because they want more opportunity for themselves and their family, but the wall with a big door is the way to do it, we'll do it legally for everybody. Now, they want a better life.  But even if illegal immigrants with the best of intentions, comes at a major cost to you, the taxpayer. Look at this recent study, for each illegal immigrant that does successfully cross the border, it costs you, the American people, 70 grand per year. The fact is, we must have the ability to, A, vet anyone that comes into our country for our security, and now more than ever, we need a border wall. Common sense strategy actually works. The safety and security of the American people should always be a top priority for any U.S. president.  Don't let the media, by the way, scare you about a government shutdown. Most of the government stays open. They don't shutdown, including health, safety, and the postal service will stay open and yes, grandma and grandpa will get their Social Security checks. And I will tell you one other thing. I will support anyone that is furloughed. They should get their full back pay. They should not be victims of what is a serious, important battle over our national security.  This holiday season, so many servicemen and women away from their families, protecting our freedoms every day, keeping us safe -- remember, First Lady Melania Trump took some time to visit those soldiers. I was lucky enough to catch up with her aboard the USS George H.W. Bush. We'll give you a preview of part two of that interview.",

Seven months, it suggests, that exculpatory evidence was redacted or excluded.  In other words, they falsified information and concealed other information. And if you doctor or phony up a 302 and presented to a court, I mean, that's a violation of the due process of Michael Flynn. It's also arguably obstruction of justice. It looks like Judge Sullivan, who initially ordered ten months ago to hand over this stuff, is now ordering them again, give me those 302s by 3:00 tomorrow. This is on the eve of the sentencing.

That is only in extenuating circumstances when an FBI agent is out of the field, maybe interviewing someone any region where they can't have access to a computer. In a case such as this, with such high-profile, I spoke to multiple -- I don't want to say who -- but multiple former senior FBI officials that said it has to be within five days. Within five days per recollection. That way, they can go back to their notes, they have a full recall of what happened during that interview. So, what Judge Sullivan needs to ask for is the workflow chart. That workflow chart will show everything. Not just the 302s but the workflow chart, because that will show who approved it, who it was sent to, and the data that the notes were put into the system, into the FBI system.

In May of 2017, there was a document identified to a small number of people in the United States government, it's the possession of the Defense Intelligence Agency. For 18 months, there has been an effort to resist declassifying that document. I know that document contains extraordinary exculpatory information about General Flynn. I don't believe the president has been told about the existence of this document. One lawmaker discovered it but he was thwarted by the Defense Intelligence Agency, and his ability disclose it.

They were so focused on getting President Trump that they were g willing to set up a lieutenant general, a guy who served our country, as you said, 33 years. So, that's the most -- that's the most egregious part of this, what they did to General Flynn. The other thing I think it's important to understand is, Mike Flynn ran the defense intelligence agency. He had to know his conversations with Kislyak were being listened to, were being monitored. He had to know that. There's no reason for him to come in there and say something that wasn't true. He just got caught because he didn't know they were setting him up like they did. And so, Judge Sullivan demanded these documents is exactly what needs to happen.",

Welcome to “Hannity.” What we're about to tell l you is almost beyond comprehension as it relates to living in this country, because using deception, underhanded tactics, flat out lies, we now know high-ranking officials inside of your FBI targeted an American military hero, Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, tried to destroy his life, all because he was connected to Donald Trump. Now, we have tape tonight, James Comey bragging about how he got away with it all on camera. We'll play it for you. Plus, I've got to break down the latest bombshell in the Lieutenant General Flynn sentencing. A judge is now demanding answers over some extraordinarily sketchy evidence for Robert Mueller's office. We also have new evidence of Hillary Clinton's bought and paid for dossier. And the Clinton Foundation, we can report tonight, is being investigated by the FBI. Tonight, we'll update you on the battle over the border wall and funding. Why a government shutdown is not something you have to fear.

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "All right. So, I'm going to go through this slowly. What I'm going to reveal to you, doesn't matter where you stand in the political spectrum. It should shock every American to their core. Let's start at the beginning. On January 24th, 2017, that's the first week of Donald Trump's presidency. Then-deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe called then national security adviser Michael Flynn to discuss some upcoming training. The conversation quickly turned into a casual request from McCabe to Flynn that he speak with FBI agents over -- about his overseas communications, which we now know were surveilled by federal officials. Remember, Flynn was the incoming national security advisor. It would not be unusual for him to have discussions with foreign leaders and soon-to-be counterparts. What is unusual is this. We know Flynn's surveillance, the unmasking, the lack of minimization of his name, and the leaking of raw intelligence by the outgoing administration, the Obama administration, is beyond rare, likely elicited in terms of its actions, in other words, a crime. But having done nothing wrong himself, Flynn agreed to capping the nothing wrong himself, he agreed to the meeting the various time day at the White House. He also agreed not to have any attorneys present per Andrew McCabe, the deputy FBI director's request. McCabe literally told General Flynn, a lawyer was not necessary. McCabe who would soon be fired himself for lying told him this. Now, during the meeting, Flynn was casually questioned by two FBI agents, including, there he is, Peter Strzok, you know, the guy that loathed Donald Trump, the man that said Hillary Clinton should win 100 million to zero, the man with the insurance policy and the media leak strategy against the new president should he happen to win, the guy that was ultimately fired because of extreme anti-Trumped bias. Well, according to the FBI's report of the meeting, that's known as a 302, where they discussed the meeting with someone they talk to. It's called the 302. Agents did not come on purpose, warned General Flynn about any potential crimes. And they didn't ask him to explain or clarify any inconsistencies in his answers, and because they wanted him to be, quote, relaxed. This is, by its very definition, a perjury trap. You don't tell somebody you really are investigating, let's put them in a relaxed position, let them talk to us and then, by the way, you don't need a lawyer. Now, as we speak, Lieutenant General Michael Flynn's life, it has been on hold for a long time. He's awaiting sentencing for allegedly lying to investigators during that meeting. A meeting so unusual that even fired FBI Director James Comey himself has now admitted was not standard operating procedure. And he actually -- this is the sickest part of it -- bragged that he ordered it anyway because he thought he could get away with it. This is what we have been telling you. Abuse of power, corruption, not rank and file FBI, the highest levels of the FBI and the DOJ, it shows you this, week one of the Trump administration, the fix was in from day one. Watch this."

    {
      "speaker": "JAMES COMEY, FORMER FBI DIRECTOR",
      "utterance": "I sent them. Something I probably wouldn't have done or may be gotten away with in a more organized investigation, more organized administration, and the George W. Bush of administration, for example, or the Obama administration. The protocol, two men that all of us have increased appreciation for over the last two years. In both of those administrations, there was process. And so, if the FBI wanted to send agents into the White House itself, to interview a senior official, you would work through the White House counsel and there'd be discussions and approvals and who would be there. And I thought, it's early enough, let's just send a couple guys over."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "I wouldn't have tried, I wouldn't have gotten away with this in a prior administration. Really? This is week one of the Trump presidency. Isn't the name of Jim Comey's book “A Higher Loyalty”? Wouldn't that be to the United States Constitution, the rule of law, equal justice under the law? Does not sound like a virtuous public servant to you, or someone trying to trap Lieutenant General Michael Flynn from day one? This is how these corrupt officials, again, not rank and file, treated a duly elected president, his first week in office. A 33-year three star veteran hero, five years in combat. And here we have James Comey, fired for mishandling the Clinton investigation, he, too, wanted Hillary to win. Andrew McCabe, he set up the meeting on the phone and said, you don't need a lawyer, fired by the FBI for lying. One of the agents, meeting with Flynn, Peter Strzok, of course, know, fired for his rampant anti-Trump bias. In other words, the three main people initially involved in the Flynn have been fired. Think about that. One day after learning about the shady interrogation tactics from the FBI -- well, there is a judge, U.S. district judge named Emmet Sullivan. He has now ordered to the special counsel to turn over all of the governments documents related to this questioning of General Flynn, by the way, by tomorrow, a rare move from a federal judge, which brings us to a shocking new development. The Federalist pointed out something brilliant, what could be in my mind a major bombshell inside the Flynn sentencing memo. They pointed out footnote 23. Footnote 23 references the 302 memo of August 22nd, 2017. Flynn's interview was in January 24th, four days into the presidency. Flynn's interview happened way back when. Now, here's the problem. Flynn's interview with the FBI on January 24th, 2017, the 302s written seven months later? A text message messages for Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, they seem to reference Flynn's interview, his 302 being completed on February 14th. And meanwhile, James Comey, he references reading this 302 before he was fired in May. So the question remains, why was a new 302 drafted in August by the special counsel? What information had changed? Can it be trusted? Was there an earlier 302 memo? Where there were revisions in the memo? And is there a smoking gun here? Either way, we deserve answers. Now, tomorrow, by 3:00 p.m., U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan could have the answers to all of these questions. That is how long he has given to turn over these documents related to the questioning of Lieutenant General Michael Flynn. This is the same judge who dismissed the corruption conviction, eight convictions, of Republican Senator Ted Stevens after discovering rampant misconduct from federal prosecutors in that case, including what he called a blatant attempt to withhold exculpatory evidence. Now, we have been pointing out, it's important to know, the lead prosecutor in the special counsel investigation, Mueller's pit bull, Andrew Weissmann. We talked a lot about him, and Jeannie Rhee, who worked for the Clinton Foundation. But Weissmann in particular, he's a pit bull, has quite a track record with exculpatory evidence. In the case of Andersen Accounting, they overturned Weissmann's prosecution 9-0, does not happen that often. In the case of four Merrill Lynch executives who went to jail for a year, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals overturned those convictions, whole year of their life gone, after Weissmann was rebuked for what? Withholding exculpatory evidence. Why would Mueller hire that guy? Now, tonight, whatever happens in the case of Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, the damage is done. Legal bills have caused this man his home, wrecked his finances, destroyed his impeccable reputation, 33 years in the military, five years of combat duty, tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. Here's our question tonight. Is this how we are going to treat American servicemen and women, war heroes? Because if it is, nobody is safe. This is not how a fair justice system is supposed to operate in a constitutional republic. Instead -- this is the sad part to me -- everything we have been telling you about, for nearly two years, we are facing a two tiered justice system where anybody apparently associated with Trump is going to be targeted. Democrats, they seem to always get off scot-free. That, of course, includes Hillary Clinton. But breaking today, we learn to some new information about her bought and paid for dirty dossier. You know the law firm that hired Christopher Steele -- well, the law firm actually funneled money to the Fusion GPS, the oppo research group, to put the seedy document together. That was Perkins Coie. Well, they considered using -- he considered using, Christopher Steele, the findings to challenge a 2016 election results in court. That is why he was doing it, which makes yet another way Hillary Clinton was planning to use the dirty dossier to rig the election after the election should she lose. And, of course, this was all done with her money funneled through the law firm as a legal expense, not a political expense. Sounds like campaign finance issues. A lot of people in the media are interested in that topic, but not with Hillary. Yet no investigation into that campaign finance violation. The question we all have to ask ourselves is why. Now, it should be obvious. Her last name is not Trump. She is not anyone who supports Trump. So, she has a whole different justice system, one that Trump supporters don't have. We'll have a lot more in this later. But also, tonight, once again, Democrats continuing to play politics with our nation security. President Trump is standing strong, calling out the far left border hypocrisy. Watch this."

We need border security. Whatever it takes to get border security, I will do it. We've done a really fantastic job with what we have. We can do it almost perfect job if we have the wall and proper border security, and that is what we're going to do for the American people."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "It's really stunning. Democrats say they want border security, sounded like Donald Trump in the Obama years, when it comes to making it happen, they stone wall, they deflect, they distract, they reveal their true open borders agenda. Now, despite overwhelming evidence that walls actually work. Just this week, the Department of Homeland Security released new details on the progress that we have made since President Trump got to office on the border barriers in California, Texas, explaining that as of November 21st, 2018, Customs and Border Protection have constructed more than 31 of the 30 miles that were authorized by Congress. Last year, the remaining miles scheduled for completion soon, adding that, quote, the bottom line walls work. When it comes to stopping drugs, illegal aliens to cross our borders, border walls are proving extremely effective. Take a look at the before-and-after photos from the DHS of the El Centro border in, well, you can see, Southern California. And while those are encouraging results, there's a lot more to do, which is why the president is forging ahead with his demand for $5 billion to fully secure our country's national security issues, make people safe on both sides of the border. We learned about the horrible tragedy tonight, a 7-year-old girl from Guatemala died of dehydration and shock after crossing into the U.S. illegally with her father and the remote New Mexico desert. It's like I have been saying over and over again. A wall can prevent these types of heartbreaking stories once people know they can't get in. They are not going to come. It's a treacherous journey. Dangerous. They ran out of food and water apparently four days before she crossed into this country, the tragedy that can be avoided. It's also an issue of national security. We are also learning a suspected terrorist is the one leading the group of Central American migrants demanding 50 grand in reparations from the U.S., each, to return home. His name is Alfonso Guerrero Ulloa, expected of the 1987 bombing in Honduras that wounded six American soldiers. And, of course, as I have said many times, look, most people I'm sure come here because they want more opportunity for themselves and their family, but the wall with a big door is the way to do it, we'll do it legally for everybody. Now, they want a better life. But even if illegal immigrants with the best of intentions, comes at a major cost to you, the taxpayer. Look at this recent study, for each illegal immigrant that does successfully cross the border, it costs you, the American people, 70 grand per year. The fact is, we must have the ability to, A, vet anyone that comes into our country for our security, and now more than ever, we need a border wall. Common sense strategy actually works. The safety and security of the American people should always be a top priority for any U.S. president. Don't let the media, by the way, scare you about a government shutdown. Most of the government stays open. They don't shutdown, including health, safety, and the postal service will stay open and yes, grandma and grandpa will get their Social Security checks. And I will tell you one other thing. I will support anyone that is furloughed. They should get their full back pay. They should not be victims of what is a serious, important battle over our national security. This holiday season, so many servicemen and women away from their families, protecting our freedoms every day, keeping us safe -- remember, First Lady Melania Trump took some time to visit those soldiers. I was lucky enough to catch up with her aboard the USS George H.W. Bush. We'll give you a preview of part two of that interview."

Normally, there are three dates on 302, the date of the interview, date of the draft of the 302, date of the supervisor's signature. No more than three oh four weeks should there be a gap. Seven months, it suggests, that exculpatory evidence was redacted or excluded. In other words, they falsified information and concealed other information. And if you doctor or phony up a 302 and presented to a court, I mean, that's a violation of the due process of Michael Flynn. It's also arguably obstruction of justice. It looks like Judge Sullivan, who initially ordered ten months ago to hand over this stuff, is now ordering them again, give me those 302s by 3:00 tomorrow. This is on the eve of the sentencing. If he finds that they falsified evidence, he can throw out the guilty plea of Flynn and set him free."

Sara, you know, the interesting thing about this judge, Judge Sullivan, he was so angry at the abuse of power back then in the Ted Stevens case, he overturned that case. Ted Stevens' career was ruined by that point, but putting that aside, he ordered a special investigation into the investigators. He was so (EXPLETIVE) off. You know, a 14-minute rant, as described by \"The New York Times\", as brutalizing the people that prosecuted Ted Stevens."

You know, one of the things that Gregg s said is really important is that gap, the timeline, the seven months, it shouldn't be three or four weeks. That is only in extenuating circumstances when an FBI agent is out of the field, maybe interviewing someone any region where they can't have access to a computer. In a case such as this, with such high-profile, I spoke to multiple -- I don't want to say who -- but multiple former senior FBI officials that said it has to be within five days. Within five days per recollection. That way, they can go back to their notes, they have a full recall of what happened during that interview. So, what Judge Sullivan needs to ask for is the workflow chart. That workflow chart will show everything. Not just the 302s but the workflow chart, because that will show who approved it, who it was sent to, and the data that the notes were put into the system, into the FBI system. Once they have that, I think they'll have the answers."

It's not the language that FBI and law enforcement use. But let me say something else tonight about Michael Flynn. In May of 2017, there was a document identified to a small number of people in the United States government, it's the possession of the Defense Intelligence Agency. For 18 months, there has been an effort to resist declassifying that document. I know that document contains extraordinary exculpatory information about General Flynn. I don't believe the president has been told about the existence of this document. One lawmaker discovered it but he was thwarted by the Defense Intelligence Agency, and his ability disclose it. I think we all should ask for that declassification. Get that out. It may enlighten the judge. It will certainly enlighten the American public."

And under some pretty brutal questioning, one of the investigators, a financial expert -- by the way, they were very straightforward with the fact that they paid for their own investigation into this. They did this with other charitable foundations in order to seek the truth and, yes, to make money because once they expose this and give it to the IRS, the IRS does pay them for their investigations.

The FBI pressuring General Flynn to be interviewed without an attorney present. That has now got the attention of U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan. He's ordered Mueller to hand over all documents related to the Flynn interview by 3:00 p.m. tomorrow, and on top of that, you have James Comey tape boasting, oh, we totally took advantage of the fact this is a new administration. We would not have done nice and the Obama or Bush years. Really? Here to discuss it more, Ohio Congressman Jim Jordan and a host of Sinclair's \"Full Measure,\" Sharyl Attkisson is with us. This is how we treat American heroes that we now brag -- oh, this is something that I wouldn't have done or gotten away with in a more organized administration like the Obama administration and the Bush administration. So, I took full advantage. On top of the deputy FBI director telling Flynn he doesn't need a lawyer or that they wanted him relaxed. Meanwhile, because of the unmasking, and leaking ever on intelligence, something by the way Sharyl Attkisson knows pretty much about personally, they had his direct transcript that they should not have had, Congressman."

When you say I got away with something, that just tells you, you didn't do with the right way. You didn't do it -- you didn't follow the rules, you didn't do it the way you were supposed to. They were so focused on getting President Trump that they were g willing to set up a lieutenant general, a guy who served our country, as you said, 33 years. So, that's the most -- that's the most egregious part of this, what they did to General Flynn. The other thing I think it's important to understand is, Mike Flynn ran the defense intelligence agency. He had to know his conversations with Kislyak were being listened to, were being monitored. He had to know that. There's no reason for him to come in there and say something that wasn't true. He just got caught because he didn't know they were setting him up like they did. And so, Judge Sullivan demanded these documents is exactly what needs to happen."

Because those accused as in the government computer intrusions to me or are the things that we've talked about are the ones who have the prosecutorial authority.

And for the head of the FBI to say that he didn't know that they technically have a legal duty to do that is scary. The other thing I come back to, Sean, is never forget the bias that exists with these key people. McCabe, Comey, Strzok, Page, Baker, these key people. Remember the name they gave to Clinton investigation \"mid-year exam,\" something they had to get through, they knew the fix was in. They were going to get it and taken care of. Kind of get it through the \"mid- year exam.\" But what was the name that they gave the Trump investigation? Crossfire hurricane.

But in light of what he said, Comey said in his testimony that Loretta Lynch, the attorney general, should have recused herself and didn't. And was either compromised or appeared to be not just from the tarmac meeting but about some other unnamed material that we don't know about.

      "utterance": "OK. I was going to say, I saw in the Washington post, that they had a headline about your interview with Melania. And it was about how her poll numbers are so low. They refuse to look at what she's doing and what she's saying. By the way, I'm surprised her poll numbers and her husband's poll numbers are holding in the 40s with how much negative and unrelenting press they get. Those numbers are built on results. And what Melania was talking with you in the interview was absolutely right. She's frustrated. They refuse to report on the results of the administration and all they want to do is go negative, negative, negative."

      "utterance": "You know, I was there. I saw all of these events yesterday, Joe. It's like the military lit up. I can't even tell -- it was such, it was great for them. They deserve this. And still, you know what? It's so petty. They attack everybody in that family. And you know, if they can't get Russia collusion, now it's campaign finance. They never ever report on the other side of it, which is all the Clinton crimes that we can prove and collusion with Russia, we can prove."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CONCHA",
      "utterance": "And Sean, I tend to trust local media. I still think that's quite strong. If you read those media accounts of Melania Trump's visits to Joint Langley yesterday, for instance, she was met with cheers and applause when she met with service men and women."

      "speaker": "CONCHA",
      "utterance": "And I don't know how you could come away from your interview and say, she's whining about the job. I don't see that at all. Because I'm the type of guy who bases people on their actions. And the bottom line is, that this is the kind of gutter speculation that we see with the president as well where we have mind readers or people playing doctor on TV in terms of trying to get in the president's head. But the first lady is obviously clearly enjoying her job. And she's going to places like Alaska like she did last month to visit with troops. So, look, she's getting horrible coverage compared to other first ladies. Her accent has been mocked. We remember Jimmy Kimmel. And look, English is her fifth language. Less than 1 percent of the world's population which is 7.7 billion people can speak--"

      "speaker": "CONCHA",
      "utterance": "-- five languages. So, it's kind of ironic that a late-night host just mocking an immigrant. No irony there. But look, first ladies are sympathetic figures over all, t doesn't matter who you are. And when you have children in the White House, whether that is Melania Trump, Michelle Obama, Laura Bush or the Clintons, go ahead criticize and mock, but there is no upside to it, Sean."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",

      "utterance": "And think about all the fawning press, Sean. I mean, that the Obamas had. And they had horrible results for the country. It's absolutely shocking. I just want to say this. I don't think -- we've talked a lot about how Michelle Obama has gotten all of these magazine covers. Melania a super model, former super model who has received none. I don't believe for a second that every single editor of those fashion magazines don't want Melania on the cover. What they're afraid of is the backlash that will happen from the gatekeepers of the left and of Hollywood."

Jimmy Kimmel treated Donald Trump fairly on his show during the campaign and he was shamed and ostracized for it because the left has said you are not allowed to normalize this first lady, you are not allowed to normalize this president or this presidency. And that's what this is about."

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Wi will tell you this though. And I spent the time and I saw the troops reaction to her. And I asked her about it. She has the resolve that she's going to -- she's going to stay true to herself. That was a part of the interview that we aired yesterday."

Serving other people, making their Christmas, acknowledging their sacrifice for others is a noble thing to do. Leaving kids alone, would also a noble thing to do but the media can't even control themselves there. Guys, we appreciate it. Good to see you both. When we come back, major programming announcement. I did another big interview today. We'll tell you who I was with. You can take bets now on Twitter when we get back."

Ambassador Nikki Haley covering a wide range of topics. North Korea, Russia, China, Iran, peace in the Middle East, Saudi Arabia. We hope you will set your DVR so you won't miss it. Now, I do say one thing. I'm going to be paying very close attention tomorrow. General -- Lieutenant General Michael Flynn to see the Comey's bragging about he wouldn't have done this in the George W. Bush administration or the Obama administration, bragging that he would take advantage and his deputy, telling General Flynn, don't get a lawyer. This is how we treat veterans? Thirty-three years of service to us. That's all the time we have left. Thank you for being with us. Let not your heart be troubled. Laura Ingraham, I can't run into the studio tonight.
