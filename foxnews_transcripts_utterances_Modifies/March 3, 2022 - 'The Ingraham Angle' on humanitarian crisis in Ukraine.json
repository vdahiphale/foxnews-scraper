      "sentences": "Welcome to THE INGRAHAM ANGLE. I'm Laura Ingraham, Ukrainians are waking up to the ninth day of Russia's ongoing invasion. Now one major city has already fallen to Russian forces. And right now, Europe's largest nuclear power plant located in Southeastern Ukraine is on fire after reportedly being struck by Russian artillery. Now the plant has six nuclear reactors, but sources are telling Fox tonight that there's no sign of elevated radiation levels at this point that is surrounding the site. Now the strike does lay bare, however, the current stakes. While the White House says there are no plans for President Biden to speak with Vladimir Putin in the near future. The Russian President phoned his French counterpart earlier today, and Emmanuel Macron's takeaway, Russian forces won't stop until the entire country of Ukraine is conquered. And he warns that the worst is yet to come. Are we starting now to get some sense of what that might look like? As Russia makes gains in the south of Ukraine, including an attempt to suffocate the port city of Mariupol. They've also started raising towns on the outskirts of Ukraine's capital. The shelling reducing many buildings, including residential ones to rubble. Now, we start in Kyiv, where Fox's Trey Yingst is standing-by Trey, this has been very hard to watch today, the refugee situation unfolding, the civilian casualties mounting. How dangerous right now are people, are they worried, obviously about this attack on the power plant, given the stakes there?",

      "sentences": "Yes, Laura, it's extremely dangerous right now. Tonight, there was a battle at a nuclear power plant in the southern part of Ukraine. Just north of that area, you talked about that Russian forces now control this plant has six reactors. And while three of them were off the grid today, three of them were on the grid and they were connected to power. So, it's significant because although there was no fire, we now have learned at the actual reactor, the fact there was a gun battle and shelling at a nuclear facility, the largest nuclear power plant in Europe that supplies 25 percent of power to Ukraine is significant. And it really just shows how much the collateral damage can affect a civilian population. It has the chance to unravel into something so dangerous for the people here in Ukraine. And it comes as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy today is calling for talks with Russian President Putin. Today, we were part of a small group of journalists invited to meet with the president here in the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv. He talked about a variety of issues, including the desire to implement a no fly zone over his country, and also the need for more weapons. I asked him about his conversation on Tuesday with U.S. President Biden, he had this to say.",

Now, when they do that, it's a city of nearly 3 million people so they can't immediately move in because they are going to face some fierce resistance, not only from soldiers here, but also civilians who have taken up arms. But it's significant, because when you talk about what that's going to look like, we're talking about days away, really, within the next week is the expected timeline for all of this to happen. Now, today at that meeting in Kyiv, we asked the president, whether or not he felt Ukrainian forces could ultimately push back this Russian offensive, how much more time could they hold out? And he simply said he doesn't know because there is a real understanding despite the support from the international community, if we see such a heavy bombardment from Russian forces, not only from the air, but also these artillery units on the ground, it could be extremely difficult to hold this city, Laura.",

Do we think Putin is going to wake up and say, next week and he's going to get up there and he's going to say, you know that chalet (ph) and (inaudible) was so important to me? I think I'll call Zelenskyy and send the troops home. No, more importantly, we have to ask, is there a possibility that this could all backfire, and make things even worse for Ukraine? Is anyone in the Biden administration even gaming any of this out, you wonder. So, let's be real as satisfying as it may be to see these 400 foot luxury liners padlocked, chasing down oligarchs is like swatting away mosquitoes when a cobra is about to strike your leg. As the angle has been telling you, this has been from day one, the biggest threat facing free people everywhere is China. Russia would not be able to do what it's doing now without China providing a financial cushion, buying its energy, buying its wheat, and so on. China's decision yesterday to abstain from a UN measure demanding the immediate withdrawal of Russian forces from Ukraine, that sent a clear message that President Xi is fine with Putin's campaign of terror. This begs the question, if they really want to get Putin's funding source, why is Biden not clamping down on Chinese Corporation and Xi's inner circle about 340,000 Chinese students studying in the United States right now, by the way. Biden's team brags about plans to put the squeeze on Putin and his pals, as the Biden administration gives hugs to Xi and his. Remember, they're going to help us on climate change, though. Isn't that John Kerry's point? So, we can't get them upset at us? Yes, right. Well, the fact is, without Xi support and tacit approval, Putin couldn't have pulled this off. In the years leading up to this moment, NATO missed an opportunity. And so, did the U.S., maybe could have avoided this nightmare unfolding before our eyes. And we gave up our energy independence and oil and gas and then Biden and Germany and powered Russia with Nord Stream 2. Meanwhile, the globalist propped up China by letting him into the WTO and offshoring our manufacturing millions and millions of American jobs. And we also failed to strike a deal with Russia over NATO expansion. Maybe that was possible. We'll never know. And speaking of trade, right now, even with this humanitarian catastrophe that we've been and documenting on Fox News all day long for several days now aided and abetted by China, both Russia and China tonight still enjoy the same trading privileges with us, as the UK. Even Canada has the good sense to revoke Russia's most favored nation status. They did that today. My question is, what are we waiting for? I can tell you who's not waiting, China. They formed an alliance of convenience with Russia, and we let it happen. But at least we might get some cool yachts out of it. And that's the angle. Joining me now is Chris Swecker, former FBI Assistant Director. Chris, what did I get wrong on this issue of the oligarchs and their assets and the big new task force and all the showboating about how they were going to get the boats?",

The U.S. would be engaging Russian MiGs and shooting them down to impose a no-fly zone? We shouldn't be playing chicken with a nuclear power, and we certainly shouldn't be shooting down jets that they have. It also expands the U.S. a commitment to Belarus. It condemns the leader Belarus and implies that we should overthrow him. Can we get through the situation in Ukraine before we expand the conflict to Belarus? I would hope so. And then finally, it calls for crippling sanctions on Russia. Look, the sections we have now, I agree with your previous guests on this, they are really not going to affect Russia that much.

What if our own foreign policy establishment and not Vladimir Putin is partly responsible for what's happening in Ukraine right now? That's what the University of Chicago political scientist John Mearsheimer thinks, and for years he warned that peeling Ukraine away from Russia with promises of NATO and E.U. membership would end in disaster. He reiterated that view in a recent \"New Yorker\" interview, saying \"If Russia thinks that Ukraine presents an existential threat to Russia because it is aligning with the United States and its western European allies, this is going to cause an enormous amount of damage to Ukraine. That of course is exactly what's happening. The strategically wise strategy for Ukraine is to break off its close relations with the rest. If there had been no decision to move NATO eastward to include Ukraine, there would be no war in Ukraine.\" Joining me now, Dinesh D'Souza, host of \"The Dinesh D'Souza Podcast\" and conservative commentator and filmmaker. Dinesh, it looks like he was -- it seems like there was a lot of wisdom in what he said, but of course the foreign policy establishment is trying to gloss over all of that and, basically, expiate itself from any culpability in how this all on unfolded.

With China, you have a communist party, you have a Marxist-Leninist ideology that's transmitted through the party and through the schools. In Russia you have something more of a gangster regime. And what that means is that these are guys who respect the language of power. And that's what really the realist analysis is all about. You have a large country, Russia, sort of a grizzly bear, and then you have got this small little puppy dog, the Ukraine, right next to it. And essentially what Mearsheimer is saying that imposes certain limitations on the Ukraine. It's going to have to learn to sort of get along, if even nervously, with this big grizzly bear. And what he's saying is that the neoliberals in the west have now for 20 years been sort of urging the Ukraine to poke the bear. Poke the grizzly. We are on your side. You join the west. We are going to form an invincible alliance. Putin is on his way out. And so Ukraine goes yes, yes, OK, well, bite, bite, snap, snap. And then the grizzly turns around. And so what Mearsheimer is saying is that there is a kind of lack of respect for the normal facts of geography, power politics. And in a sense, I don't agree with him that the United States or the west are to blame for what's happening in the Ukraine, but what he is saying is he's made -- is that we have made the conflict more likely by pursuing a policy of illusion rather than realism.",

And this is the CCP's war, and it's time they were made to pay for it. Joining me now, Mike Pillsbury, director of the Center on Chinese Strategy at Hudson, author of \"The Hundred-Year Marathon.\" Mike, you've learned some new information about how China is currently aiding and abetting Russia. What is it? MIKE PILLSBURY, \"THE HUNDRED-YEAR MARATHON\" AUTHOR: There's several things, Laura. I think the most important is you remember all the talk about the SWIFT system and kicking Russia out of the SWIFT system so they wouldn't be able to do transfers to 11,000 banks. That was going to really hurt Russia. It turns out China over the last six years has developed its own worldwide SWIFT system. It's called the Cross-BORDER Interbank System. They are offering that to the Russians. So it softens one of the major sanctions on Russia. The second thing that's been going on is you find this amazing voting by the Chinese that they are not condemning the invasion of a sovereign nation. This goes back to Xi Jinping meeting with Putin more than 30 times. It was Xi Jinping's first visit when he took over China was to go to Russia. And we have this wonderful comment from \"The Wall Street Journal\" that Putin said to Xi Jinping at their first meeting, your personality is a lot like my personality.",

I teach mandarin all the time Laura. There is a phrase call \"Houtai-Laoban\" (ph). A Houtai-Laoban (ph) means a backstage boss. That's kind of how the Chinese see their role with Putin.

      "utterance": "Welcome to THE INGRAHAM ANGLE. I'm Laura Ingraham, Ukrainians are waking up to the ninth day of Russia's ongoing invasion. Now one major city has already fallen to Russian forces. And right now, Europe's largest nuclear power plant located in Southeastern Ukraine is on fire after reportedly being struck by Russian artillery. Now the plant has six nuclear reactors, but sources are telling Fox tonight that there's no sign of elevated radiation levels at this point that is surrounding the site. Now the strike does lay bare, however, the current stakes. While the White House says there are no plans for President Biden to speak with Vladimir Putin in the near future. The Russian President phoned his French counterpart earlier today, and Emmanuel Macron's takeaway, Russian forces won't stop until the entire country of Ukraine is conquered. And he warns that the worst is yet to come. Are we starting now to get some sense of what that might look like? As Russia makes gains in the south of Ukraine, including an attempt to suffocate the port city of Mariupol. They've also started raising towns on the outskirts of Ukraine's capital. The shelling reducing many buildings, including residential ones to rubble. Now, we start in Kyiv, where Fox's Trey Yingst is standing-by Trey, this has been very hard to watch today, the refugee situation unfolding, the civilian casualties mounting. How dangerous right now are people, are they worried, obviously about this attack on the power plant, given the stakes there?"

Just north of that area, you talked about that Russian forces now control this plant has six reactors. And while three of them were off the grid today, three of them were on the grid and they were connected to power. So, it's significant because although there was no fire, we now have learned at the actual reactor, the fact there was a gun battle and shelling at a nuclear facility, the largest nuclear power plant in Europe that supplies 25 percent of power to Ukraine is significant. And it really just shows how much the collateral damage can affect a civilian population. It has the chance to unravel into something so dangerous for the people here in Ukraine. And it comes as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy today is calling for talks with Russian President Putin. Today, we were part of a small group of journalists invited to meet with the president here in the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv. He talked about a variety of issues, including the desire to implement a no fly zone over his country, and also the need for more weapons.

The Russians say they are not targeting civilian areas. But these images tell a different story. Now throughout the capital of Kyiv, there are roadblocks set up every single block. Forces are in the streets even tonight tried to do everything they can to slow what is expected to be a bloody urban offensive by Russian forces in the coming days. Laura."

But the concern according to U.S. officials is that, it would be used to ultimate encircle this city. Now, when they do that, it's a city of nearly 3 million people so they can't immediately move in because they are going to face some fierce resistance, not only from soldiers here, but also civilians who have taken up arms. But it's significant, because when you talk about what that's going to look like, we're talking about days away, really, within the next week is the expected timeline for all of this to happen. Now, today at that meeting in Kyiv, we asked the president, whether or not he felt Ukrainian forces could ultimately push back this Russian offensive, how much more time could they hold out? And he simply said he doesn't know because there is a real understanding despite the support from the international community, if we see such a heavy bombardment from Russian forces, not only from the air, but also these artillery units on the ground, it could be extremely difficult to hold this city, Laura."

I must have missed that one in law school, but perhaps their new Supreme Court nominee can explain to me how such an arbitrary and vague classification is actually constitutional. Asset freezing requires credible allegations of criminal action or civil fraud, maybe that's here, maybe it's not. It also means that you have to find the assets, which are often hidden in shell corporations, partnerships, or things like LLCs. Now, what does this require? Well, this requires time, manpower, forensic work, and significant resources."

    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "OK, these significant steps also take international cooperation and time. And we know time is not on the Ukrainian side, you just heard Olena speak out. Even if we could expeditiously freeze every oligarchs, luxury assets, would that really stop the suffering of the Ukrainian people that's happening right now? Do we think Putin is going to wake up and say, next week and he's going to get up there and he's going to say, you know that chalet (ph) and (inaudible) was so important to me? I think I'll call Zelenskyy and send the troops home. No, more importantly, we have to ask, is there a possibility that this could all backfire, and make things even worse for Ukraine? Is anyone in the Biden administration even gaming any of this out, you wonder. So, let's be real as satisfying as it may be to see these 400 foot luxury liners padlocked, chasing down oligarchs is like swatting away mosquitoes when a cobra is about to strike your leg. As the angle has been telling you, this has been from day one, the biggest threat facing free people everywhere is China. Russia would not be able to do what it's doing now without China providing a financial cushion, buying its energy, buying its wheat, and so on. China's decision yesterday to abstain from a UN measure demanding the immediate withdrawal of Russian forces from Ukraine, that sent a clear message that President Xi is fine with Putin's campaign of terror. This begs the question, if they really want to get Putin's funding source, why is Biden not clamping down on Chinese Corporation and Xi's inner circle about 340,000 Chinese students studying in the United States right now, by the way. Biden's team brags about plans to put the squeeze on Putin and his pals, as the Biden administration gives hugs to Xi and his. Remember, they're going to help us on climate change, though. Isn't that John Kerry's point? So, we can't get them upset at us? Yes, right. Well, the fact is, without Xi support and tacit approval, Putin couldn't have pulled this off. In the years leading up to this moment, NATO missed an opportunity. And so, did the U.S., maybe could have avoided this nightmare unfolding before our eyes. And we gave up our energy independence and oil and gas and then Biden and Germany and powered Russia with Nord Stream 2. Meanwhile, the globalist propped up China by letting him into the WTO and offshoring our manufacturing millions and millions of American jobs. And we also failed to strike a deal with Russia over NATO expansion. Maybe that was possible. We'll never know. And speaking of trade, right now, even with this humanitarian catastrophe that we've been and documenting on Fox News all day long for several days now aided and abetted by China, both Russia and China tonight still enjoy the same trading privileges with us, as the UK. Even Canada has the good sense to revoke Russia's most favored nation status. They did that today. My question is, what are we waiting for? I can tell you who's not waiting, China. They formed an alliance of convenience with Russia, and we let it happen. But at least we might get some cool yachts out of it. And that's the angle. Joining me now is Chris Swecker, former FBI Assistant Director. Chris, what did I get wrong on this issue of the oligarchs and their assets and the big new task force and all the showboating about how they were going to get the boats?"

I believe they're over promising something that they can't deliver, without the due process that you're talking about. I mean, these oligarchs are unquestionably part of Putin's power base. They are cronies, they skim, they bust out, they buy companies and bust out and they do all kinds of things that generate illicit proceeds, which they park in the United States in real estate, in New York, in Miami and Los Angeles and Cleveland, in North Carolina, where I am. But they've been doing it for decades. And my question is, what took you so long? Why haven't we been going after them before now, and really all things Russian, because there is nothing that Vladimir Putin's government is doing that isn't to the detriment of the United States. And these oligarchs are just a way to project that here."

OK, you can do that anyway, if it's fraud, or criminal activity, or the ill begotten gains from some enterprise, that's already on the table, they could already do that. So, it's kind of a fraud that the government is perpetrating on the people to make it look like they're doing something, anything to kind of even out the situation. That's my problem with it.

Yet she wouldn't replace it with American oil and gas, which would of course, just mean higher prices at the pump for Americans. Or you have Pete Buttigieg's proposal, which is to ban Russian oil and gas and replace it with Iranian oil and gas, so send billions of dollars to the ayatollahs who chant Death to America. That's just how ideologically opposed they are to American energy.

It would be very simple to do what I proposed yesterday in the Senate, which is just to start producing more oil and gas again here in America. You heard at the State of the Union the other night, a lot of talk about make it in America, well, we can make our own oil and gas in America, Joe Biden just refuses to."

They all came up together in the KGB in the late Soviet era. So, I'm not aware of any such information.

Meanwhile, the Russians and the Chinese are pulling in tens of billions of dollars every month because they have the same trade status, most favored nation status, as the U.K. has with us.

But the fact is, after watching the disaster in Afghanistan, I wasn't convinced that it was possible for the American government to be even dumber, more destructive, and more dishonest. This is now worse than Afghanistan. If you want to help people of Ukraine, get them weapons. Get them weapons tonight. Get them weapons through the CIA. Get them weapons through covert means. Get them weapons by contracting with private contractors. But what the Biden administration is doing is an absurdity. If they were going out of their way to weaken the United States, they could hardly do a better job. Punish the American oil and gas industry, try to buy oil and gas from Russia and Iran, our mortal enemies at the present time, and at the same time, ask the Russians to take the lead in Vienna in cutting a deal with the Iranians. If you were Putin and you are sitting there watching all this, and you know the Americans are trying -- the American government wants to buy your oil, and you know that the $1 billion a day you're making out of oil finances your entire worse, so who cares about sanctions, this whole thing is an absurdity. It is dishonest. It is intellectually corrupt. And frankly, it's embarrassing to have the Defense Department that is incapable of getting aid to the people of Ukraine. With reasonable amounts of the equipment, and with things like targeting information, the Ukrainians could dramatically raise the cost on the Russians. And you're going to have to do that because, I will tell you flatly, the Russian doctrine is to win. They are going to escalate as much as they have to. They are going to do whatever they have to. If that means taking out a nuclear reactor, they're going to take it out. If that means using barbaric weapons against innocent civilians, they're going to use barbaric weapons.

There are a lot of things we could do to help them win tonight. None of this nonsense about six months from now or a year from now or five years from now. And my point is the Russians deliberately sustain tactical nuclear capability that we gave up deliberately. We have a doctrine that says you never go nuclear unless it's literally in defense of the homeland. They have a doctrine that says you use whatever system works. And there is no threshold of Russian doctrine. And I think the bigger point is there going to use whatever level of power they have to use, and they are going to kill whoever they have to kill to win. That's the point of Putin talking to Macron today. He ain't backing off. So we are either going to defeat him, or he's going to win. And I think we need to understand that. And frankly, he doesn't care about yachts. When he gets done, he'll take that $1 billion a day that we are sending him and he can buy yachts for all of his oligarch friends, and he doesn't care.

What is concerning is there were ongoing hostilities earlier tonight between Russian and Ukrainian forces, small arms fire and even some tank rounds. But we know now none of the six reactors have been affected. This nuclear power plant, Laura, is not just the largest in Ukraine. It's the largest in Europe, it's one of the top ten largest in the world and supplies about a quarter of the energy to the Ukrainian people. There was a fire that broke out earlier at this nuclear power plant, but again, not at the reactor. It was at an administration away from the reactors. And of course, these reactors are very robust.

We fully support the people of Ukraine for their right to self- determination. And that was basically the title of this resolution. But this resolution ended up to be seven pages. And I think it runs the risk of escalating the conflict in Ukraine and drawing the United States into it. For instance, it guarantees that we will have defensive security assistance to the Ukrainians. What does that term mean? It's so broad that it could mean boots on the ground, or what some of my colleagues in the House and the Senate have already called for, a no-fly zone. Can you imagine that? The U.S. would be engaging Russian MiGs and shooting them down to impose a no-fly zone? We shouldn't be playing chicken with a nuclear power, and we certainly shouldn't be shooting down jets that they have. It also expands the U.S. a commitment to Belarus. It condemns the leader Belarus and implies that we should overthrow him. Can we get through the situation in Ukraine before we expand the conflict to Belarus? I would hope so. And then finally, it calls for crippling sanctions on Russia. Look, the sections we have now, I agree with your previous guests on this, they are really not going to affect Russia that much. But if we have crippling sanctions on Russia, number one, you run the risk of alienating those protesters who are pushing against Putin if we end up starving them out.

What if our own foreign policy establishment and not Vladimir Putin is partly responsible for what's happening in Ukraine right now? That's what the University of Chicago political scientist John Mearsheimer thinks, and for years he warned that peeling Ukraine away from Russia with promises of NATO and E.U. membership would end in disaster. He reiterated that view in a recent \"New Yorker\" interview, saying \"If Russia thinks that Ukraine presents an existential threat to Russia because it is aligning with the United States and its western European allies, this is going to cause an enormous amount of damage to Ukraine. That of course is exactly what's happening. The strategically wise strategy for Ukraine is to break off its close relations with the rest. If there had been no decision to move NATO eastward to include Ukraine, there would be no war in Ukraine.\" Joining me now, Dinesh D'Souza, host of \"The Dinesh D'Souza Podcast\" and conservative commentator and filmmaker. Dinesh, it looks like he was -- it seems like there was a lot of wisdom in what he said, but of course the foreign policy establishment is trying to gloss over all of that and, basically, expiate itself from any culpability in how this all on unfolded. Was this inevitable in Ukraine, as some would say?"

      "speaker": "DINESH D'SOUZA, CONSERVATIVE COMMENTATOR",
      "utterance": "Not at all. I think Mearsheimer represents the realist school of thinking about foreign policy. And the realist school is, I think, a very important voice to listen to, because Russia is not quite in the same boat as, say, China. With China, you have a communist party, you have a Marxist-Leninist ideology that's transmitted through the party and through the schools. In Russia you have something more of a gangster regime. And what that means is that these are guys who respect the language of power. And that's what really the realist analysis is all about. You have a large country, Russia, sort of a grizzly bear, and then you have got this small little puppy dog, the Ukraine, right next to it. And essentially what Mearsheimer is saying that imposes certain limitations on the Ukraine. It's going to have to learn to sort of get along, if even nervously, with this big grizzly bear. And what he's saying is that the neoliberals in the west have now for 20 years been sort of urging the Ukraine to poke the bear. Poke the grizzly. We are on your side. You join the west. We are going to form an invincible alliance. Putin is on his way out. And so Ukraine goes yes, yes, OK, well, bite, bite, snap, snap. And then the grizzly turns around. And so what Mearsheimer is saying is that there is a kind of lack of respect for the normal facts of geography, power politics. And in a sense, I don't agree with him that the United States or the west are to blame for what's happening in the Ukraine, but what he is saying is he's made -- is that we have made the conflict more likely by pursuing a policy of illusion rather than realism."

Nor are we willing to make that kind of commitment. So to lead on the Ukrainians into thinking, listen, be tough guys. We'll be behind you. And then when the fighting starts, we suddenly start resorting to all kinds of symbolic nonsense like pouring out Russian vodka and preventing a Russian singer from performing in the Met, and telling them we'll give them lessons in fighting by Zoom calls and Skype, this reveals the unseriousness of the western approach to a very serious situation."

      "utterance": "We are encouraging the Ukrainians to think that they will ultimately become part of the west, because will ultimately defeat Putin. The Ukrainians are almost completely unwilling to compromise with the Russians. They do that, the end result is that their country is going to be wrecked. And what we are doing is in effect encouraging that outcome."

We're getting a kind of trumpeted ideology, and if you fall outside of what the party line is, you're supposed to be pro-Putin or you are off the reservation. And so I think that the kind of discussion that Mearsheimer is trying to have is not occurring right now."

Now it's a very, very odd dynamic. It's a switcheroo. Dinesh, thank you. Who is really running the war now? The answer when we return."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "That's despicable, but that's exactly what China is doing. They hope the world leaders and all of you just ignore the fact that they are propping up Putin's murderous march through Ukraine. The sad thing, though, it's working. The Biden administration has zero interest in holding China accountable for what's happening in Ukraine. Wall Street certainly doesn't want to do it. Can't upset the markets. And this is the CCP's war, and it's time they were made to pay for it. Joining me now, Mike Pillsbury, director of the Center on Chinese Strategy at Hudson, author of \"The Hundred-Year Marathon.\" Mike, you've learned some new information about how China is currently aiding and abetting Russia. What is it? MIKE PILLSBURY, \"THE HUNDRED-YEAR MARATHON\" AUTHOR: There's several things, Laura. I think the most important is you remember all the talk about the SWIFT system and kicking Russia out of the SWIFT system so they wouldn't be able to do transfers to 11,000 banks. That was going to really hurt Russia. It turns out China over the last six years has developed its own worldwide SWIFT system. It's called the Cross-BORDER Interbank System. They are offering that to the Russians. So it softens one of the major sanctions on Russia. The second thing that's been going on is you find this amazing voting by the Chinese that they are not condemning the invasion of a sovereign nation. This goes back to Xi Jinping meeting with Putin more than 30 times. It was Xi Jinping's first visit when he took over China was to go to Russia. And we have this wonderful comment from \"The Wall Street Journal\" that Putin said to Xi Jinping at their first meeting, your personality is a lot like my personality."

      "utterance": "So is it friendship that has no bounds, as they said at the Olympics. Now there's this new leak just yesterday from a European official that Putin actually had to surrender to a request from Xi Jinping, please don't do the invasion of Ukraine until after the Olympics is over. This has made it tougher on the Russian military in Ukraine because they were relying on the cold, hard ground to get their tanks across. By Putin delaying two or three weeks before his friend Xi Jinping, or you might say his backstage boss Xi Jinping, has complicated matters for the Russian troops on the ground. I teach mandarin all the time Laura. There is a phrase call \"Houtai-Laoban\" (ph). A Houtai-Laoban (ph) means a backstage boss. That's kind of how the Chinese see their role with Putin. They essentially control him, and they can stop the war."
