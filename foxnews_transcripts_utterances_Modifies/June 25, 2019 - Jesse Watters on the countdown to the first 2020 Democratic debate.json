It's about fame, battling the orange Godzilla, boosted by a press that hates him, guarantees more slobbering coverage that a convention of basset hounds, especially if you keep saying dumb stuff about concentration camps. And that turns them into political versions of snail darters, insignificant and annoying but protected. They and their type -- I'll include AOC and Omar, garner immediate media mob protection. You can't attack a darter without feeling the wrath of social vigilantes because no one wants to be accused of dangering the tiny fish. And running for president or anything is a great gig for a tiny fish.  It's a movie in which the plot simply develops around you. You puff yourself up, you sucker some dumb saps into supporting roles, boost your public speaking, and cram your journal with enough direct for your next book called rolling up my sleeves. So, here's a tip for watching the debates. Don't. It will be like watching snail darters school when the tide comes in. They'll just be gone.",

But I would like to see them challenge Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, although they're on different stages on different nights on their math.  But what it really comes down to is they have to play it like survivor because, of course, everyone wants to be the ultimate winner. They want to outwit, outplay, and outlast each other, but you can do that unless you take out the favorites. And right now Joe Biden is the guy who's winning all the challenges and he's good at puzzles, but the secret is he's really not.  So he doesn't just have an Achilles' heel.

Bob Barnett, who's my lawyer, I think everybody knows Bob Barnett. He's been involved in every presidential election since 1976. He's so smart when it comes to all of this.

It's about fame, battling the orange Godzilla, boosted by a press that hates him, guarantees more slobbering coverage that a convention of basset hounds, especially if you keep saying dumb stuff about concentration camps. And that turns them into political versions of snail darters, insignificant and annoying but protected. They and their type -- I'll include AOC and Omar, garner immediate media mob protection. You can't attack a darter without feeling the wrath of social vigilantes because no one wants to be accused of dangering the tiny fish. And running for president or anything is a great gig for a tiny fish. It's a movie in which the plot simply develops around you. You puff yourself up, you sucker some dumb saps into supporting roles, boost your public speaking, and cram your journal with enough direct for your next book called rolling up my sleeves.

But I would like to see them challenge Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, although they're on different stages on different nights on their math. But what it really comes down to is they have to play it like survivor because, of course, everyone wants to be the ultimate winner. They want to outwit, outplay, and outlast each other, but you can do that unless you take out the favorites. And right now Joe Biden is the guy who's winning all the challenges and he's good at puzzles, but the secret is he's really not. So he doesn't just have an Achilles' heel. It's as though his mom latched on to his entire thigh. He's got an Achilles femur. So there's a lot of vulnerable real estate on Joe Biden's political body that they have to go after."

Bob Barnett, who's my lawyer, I think everybody knows Bob Barnett. He's been involved in every presidential election since 1976. He's so smart when it comes to all of this.

But other cities, I believe, should try to fight homelessness, and that's very expensive. And you need to almost have health care units that kind of surgeon to these precincts, help people with their drug addictions, their mental illnesses, and trying to clean them up, trying to get them back up on their feet. I know there's a civil liberties debate there about how much the government can do to kind of move you around and kind of curtail your freedom. But at the same time if you have 99 percent of the city being affected by kind of an out-of-control while 1 percent of homeless, what kind of decisions does the leadership have to make?

That was the goofiest social media post - and everyone especially, Democrats, even David Axelrod saw right through it. So what he's trying to do is, create this mystique that they are still together. They're thick as thieves and that the President Obama is only withholding out of respect and that is not true. He chose Hillary early on.

So the President, like he does, because he understands the soap opera aspect. He's driving a wedge in the relationship. He's just asking questions. He's just raising issues. He seems different. Not the same, we don't know. Everybody else sees it, though. And I think it's really smart, because, Biden right now, as you agreed, because \"The New York Times\" report it, not me - \"The New York Times\".

As you can see, the lion is wandering around before the zoo staff simulating a different capture scenario, including use of a net and shooting the lion - Mr. Lion with a tranquilizer dart. And while this charade was going on, take a look at the real zoo lions. They're like, \"Huh, this is pretty funny. Look at these foolish humans\". All I know is I can't wait to see what the Japanese aquariums are doing for Shark Week."
