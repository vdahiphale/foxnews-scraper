It's already been eight investigations, most of them by Republicans in the Congress. The House Intelligence Committee, the House Armed Services Committee, and what did they conclude? That there were problems that night, but they were ones that we should look at, not from the perspective of placing blame or pointing fingers, but...   You can't point fingers. But look, she's not wrong. The Republicans are making it an issue because it is supposed to be an issue. She falsely pushed the video and lied to the grieving families. And now she wants everyone to move on. That's the cry of a criminal or spouse caught in the act. But complaining that the Republicans want to keep the story of Benghazi alive, that's pathetic. Would she complain if it wasn't Benghazi, but the story was about Sandy Hook or Charleston? She's complaining about people doing the right thing. Who cares if it's political? Shut up. And what exactly should we focus instead? Her good points, i.e., her treatment of Bill's women, her casual disdain for national security, her wonderful laugh?   But any criticism can be recast as an attack on her. She's the victim, a woman, no less, which affords her immunity. So say feminists denying their own hypocrisy. Sure, the Benghazi dead spent 13 hours in hell, but she was questioned almost as long.",
