      "sentences": "I'm Laura Ingraham, this is the \"Ingraham Angle\" from Washington tonight. It's a heinous assault of a female soldier by Afghan refugees on a New Mexico base. And the reaction from the media has been essentially crickets. Tonight in Ingraham investigation with the Congresswoman demanding answers. Plus, Broadway's biggest night turns into a BLM and vaccine promo adequate. And Harry and Megan release more hot air at a climate conference. Of course, it's Raymond Arroyo. It's all in seen and unseen.  But first, the great American sell-out. That's the focus of tonight's \"Angle\".  Now, they've worked overtime to deny, obscure and deflect the truth. But Democrats are conspiring with an array of activists and business leaders on plans that are already well underway. Now, more significant than that obscene $3.5 trillion grab bag, these two unofficial policies will weaken and change America forever. Simply stated, this stealth agenda includes maintaining open borders and surrendering to China.  The activists think America is evil, that we're living on stolen land, and they want to get as many New Democrat voters in here as quickly as possible. And then there's the donor class who always loved cheap labor, never fans of immigration enforcement, they prefer the free flow of goods and services. And they don't care how it affects any of the little people they never have. And as for China, the Biden administration's concern for human rights, totally out the window. They're happy to ignore cruel deprivations of basic rights to dissent, worship, a fair trial, et cetera. So long as the CCP makes some, I don't know, unenforceable pledge on climate change, save the planet, but let those Uyghurs die.  And with these dupes in the White House, there isn't a top investment bank or multinational in the world, that would think of staring money away from China. Why bother? The sad fact is, by the end of Biden's two years - first two years in office, America will be home to several million more migrants and hundreds of thousands of refugees. And as we obsess over our diversity and newfound multiculturalism, China will have likely grown a lot more powerful than America, both economically and militarily. Now, don't get deceived when every now and then for political expediency's sake, the Biden team will take action that seems to run counter to their agenda, like deporting some Haitians. New York Times will even write about it. But that's all for show.",

And then you add in that our cheap point man on COVID is somebody who helped fund probably gain of engineering at the locus classicus of the pandemic in Wuhan. And then he told us from the very beginning along with people like Bill Gates, that China was a very constructive partner. So when they look at all this, they think, wow, aren't these people going to defend their own interest? And that's the only thing we have going for them. They're so bewildered by this administration that they never see anything like it, but they're going to act on it.  I don't think Joe Biden even - I don't think the left, Laura, cares anymore about winning public support. They're down 18 points a day in the Rasmussen daily poll. And I - every one of these issues that you articulated, the border, Afghanistan, inflation, energy, nobody has any - there's no public support for. I think they just want to rush through, like you said, get $2 million a year. That's what's predicted across the borders illegally. And maybe in two years before they lose the midterms, or maybe in four, by executive order, they'll have 6, 8 million new people. They're just one vote short from the filibuster, getting rid of the filibuster or the Electoral College, or getting rid of the nine persons Supreme Court. So change the system, change the demography. And how that manifests itself, you've noticed that they don't even care anymore that Joe Biden doesn't answer questions, or he says, there's trillionaires in existence, or just get your passport and saunter down to the Kabul, or jump on a plane.

But nobody is explaining how the attack was allowed to happen, or how much oversight these 10,000 Afghan refugees have on Fort Bliss. The attack happened at the basis DiAna housing complex in New Mexico back on September 19. The unnamed female service member was reporting for the start of her shift around midnight when three to four Afghan refugees attacked her and physically injured her, were told the attack was not sexual and that the woman was able to eventually break free and that her injuries are not considered serious. The base says, the buddy system was in play at the time, but the attack happened before the service member was able to connect with her partner. The FBI is handling the case and the Afghan suspects have not yet been identified. Remember, because of the chaotic and haphazard circumstances surrounding the Afghan pull up, most of the evacuees were never fully vetted. Some were never vetted at all. So while we work to resettle some 60,000 or 70,000 refugees in the United States, we still do not know how many criminals or bad actors are among them. Several GOP lawmakers have sent a letter to the Biden administration asking in part, quoting here, \"How many Afghan nationals are waiting on background checks at a transit site? How many Afghan nationals have been paroled into the United States?\" This comes as two Afghan refugees have been indicted with federal crimes at Fort McCoy in Wisconsin. One of the refugees is facing three counts of raping a minor and one count of attempted rape on a minor. Another refugee is accused of trying to strangle and suffocate his wife. And she claims, he threatened to send her back to the Taliban, so they could deal with her. Laura.",

And the reaction from the media has been essentially crickets. Tonight in Ingraham investigation with the Congresswoman demanding answers. Plus, Broadway's biggest night turns into a BLM and vaccine promo adequate. And Harry and Megan release more hot air at a climate conference. Of course, it's Raymond Arroyo. It's all in seen and unseen. But first, the great American sell-out. That's the focus of tonight's \"Angle\". Now, they've worked overtime to deny, obscure and deflect the truth. But Democrats are conspiring with an array of activists and business leaders on plans that are already well underway. Now, more significant than that obscene $3.5 trillion grab bag, these two unofficial policies will weaken and change America forever. Simply stated, this stealth agenda includes maintaining open borders and surrendering to China. The activists think America is evil, that we're living on stolen land, and they want to get as many New Democrat voters in here as quickly as possible. And then there's the donor class who always loved cheap labor, never fans of immigration enforcement, they prefer the free flow of goods and services. And they don't care how it affects any of the little people they never have. And as for China, the Biden administration's concern for human rights, totally out the window. They're happy to ignore cruel deprivations of basic rights to dissent, worship, a fair trial, et cetera. So long as the CCP makes some, I don't know, unenforceable pledge on climate change, save the planet, but let those Uyghurs die. And with these dupes in the White House, there isn't a top investment bank or multinational in the world, that would think of staring money away from China. Why bother? The sad fact is, by the end of Biden's two years - first two years in office, America will be home to several million more migrants and hundreds of thousands of refugees. And as we obsess over our diversity and newfound multiculturalism, China will have likely grown a lot more powerful than America, both economically and militarily. Now, don't get deceived when every now and then for political expediency's sake, the Biden team will take action that seems to run counter to their agenda, like deporting some Haitians. New York Times will even write about it. But that's all for show."

I don't think Joe Biden even - I don't think the left, Laura, cares anymore about winning public support. They're down 18 points a day in the Rasmussen daily poll. And I - every one of these issues that you articulated, the border, Afghanistan, inflation, energy, nobody has any - there's no public support for. I think they just want to rush through, like you said, get $2 million a year. That's what's predicted across the borders illegally. And maybe in two years before they lose the midterms, or maybe in four, by executive order, they'll have 6, 8 million new people. They're just one vote short from the filibuster, getting rid of the filibuster or the Electoral College, or getting rid of the nine persons Supreme Court. So change the system, change the demography. And how that manifests itself, you've noticed that they don't even care anymore that Joe Biden doesn't answer questions, or he says, there's trillionaires in existence, or just get your passport and saunter down to the Kabul, or jump on a plane. There are no vaccinations until he became President. (inaudible) just outright--"

And now we've learned the FBI is investigating more alleged crimes by male Afghan refugees. This time against a female U.S. service member at Fort Bliss, New Mexico. Fox's chief breaking news correspondent Trace Gallagher has this story. Trace?"

      "utterance": "Laura, we are getting more precise information on the attack itself. But nobody is explaining how the attack was allowed to happen, or how much oversight these 10,000 Afghan refugees have on Fort Bliss. The attack happened at the basis DiAna housing complex in New Mexico back on September 19. The unnamed female service member was reporting for the start of her shift around midnight when three to four Afghan refugees attacked her and physically injured her, were told the attack was not sexual and that the woman was able to eventually break free and that her injuries are not considered serious. The base says, the buddy system was in play at the time, but the attack happened before the service member was able to connect with her partner. The FBI is handling the case and the Afghan suspects have not yet been identified. Remember, because of the chaotic and haphazard circumstances surrounding the Afghan pull up, most of the evacuees were never fully vetted. Some were never vetted at all. So while we work to resettle some 60,000 or 70,000 refugees in the United States, we still do not know how many criminals or bad actors are among them. Several GOP lawmakers have sent a letter to the Biden administration asking in part, quoting here, \"How many Afghan nationals are waiting on background checks at a transit site? How many Afghan nationals have been paroled into the United States?\" This comes as two Afghan refugees have been indicted with federal crimes at Fort McCoy in Wisconsin. One of the refugees is facing three counts of raping a minor and one count of attempted rape on a minor. Another refugee is accused of trying to strangle and suffocate his wife. And she claims, he threatened to send her back to the Taliban, so they could deal with her. Laura."

So far in this investigation, no one has been arrested, no one has been charged, and no one has had their parole provoked - revoked by ICE. This simply cannot be happening. If we cannot guarantee the safety of our service members on American military installations, then how do we ensure the safety of the American people once this resettlement starts, and this is anywhere in the United States of America?"

And these were going to - these were our allies, and we made them promises. And apparently they're assaulting our service members, and now we need a buddy system to walk on our own base? How can that be right?"

If these are really the people that came to America, got on the planes, came for a better life to actually keep their families and themselves safe, and then they're going to commit a heinous crime against a service member on a military installation? It makes no sense. And this is why we have been pushing and asking the tough questions, who is coming into our country? How many are SIV holders? How many actually helped the coalition and U.S. forces? But we're not getting any answers from this administration."

The administration, by their own admission, said that these background checks, this vetting, was not working but they would try to catch up on the backend. Well, you only have to go as far as the service member, a female, who was attacked on a U.S. military installation to see how that backend process is going to work. It's not going to work, and it's putting the American people in harm's way."

I have been watching video after video. That is just one thing, but I have seen others that are even much worse than that, as bad as that is. RITA PANAHI, \"AUSTRALIAN HERALD-SUN\" COLUMNIST: Yes. It is not isolated. We have seen this over the past 18 months throughout the pandemic. The police overreach has been fairly consistent, unfortunately. We're seen instances of pregnant women arrested in their kitchens because they put up a Facebook post wanting to have a protest. We have had elderly women on park benches being harassed. We've had a young woman being choked because she didn't have her mask even though she had an exception. She didn't need to be wearing a mask. And the incidents you showed there, someone who is just a few hundred meters from their house, but they were told that you don't have a right to be there. Why aren't you wearing a mask? Even though he explained in that video, I had my mask in my pocket because I was having a cigarette. And the girl there, too, is brandishing her -- she's showing that she had gone to get lunch, which you should be allowed to do even under our strict lockdown conditions. But the police overreach, unfortunately, has been a feature of what we have been experienced in Australia, particularly here in Victoria."

And there was this fervor for COVID zero in this country for so long, because our international borders have been closed since March of 2020. And we thought, some premieres thought we could eliminate coronavirus. We could just if we were harsh enough and hard enough, we could eliminate the virus. But of course, this is a virus that is going to become endemic, and you can't be isolated forever. At some point you need to interact with the rest of the world. And with the Delta outbreak in Sydney and Melbourne, we are seeing you can't eradicate this virus no matter how much suffering you inflict on people."
