      "speaker": "Charles Payne, guest host",
      "utterance": "Well, forget about the presents under the tree, it's the gift of green Americans have been celebrating and not just over the holidays. Hello, everyone. I'm Charles Payne, filling in for Neal Cavuto. Merry Christmas. And this is a special edition of Your World, and it's been a special year for your stocks, on pace for the best run since 2013. Part of a decades long bull market. So as we approach the new year, will we be looking at new highs in the new decade? Let's ask our market pros, Gary B. Smith, Kathryn Rooney Vera, and Scott Martin. Scott, I want to get your thoughts on this market as we head into the final days of the year."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Scott Martin",
      "utterance": "Yeah, it looks really good, Charles. Now, that's obviously a time when you should probably be a little bit cautious because that's when things tend to say swim up and then it's out of nowhere. But the reality is this, we're seeing a Fed that's accommodative, we're seeing central banks around the world that are very accommodative, and a U.S. economy that's finally responding. So to me, the market will likely continue a lot of its momentum and any pullbacks should be bought."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Charles Payne",
      "utterance": "Here's the thing, though, Kathryn, it's one thing for the market to do what it's been doing, but the underlying economy actually seems to be gaining momentum. Certain areas in this economy, for instance, housing, the housing data we've seen recently, there are signs that business investment outside of these big old factories could also start to pick up despite how long and astute this rally has been."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Kathryn Vera",
      "utterance": "Yeah. Charles. And actually last year on this very program, I came on saying, \"You needed to buy the market. It was down 20 percent,\" precisely on the fear of U.S. recession. I said then recession was not in actuality, it wouldn't happen. It didn't happen. It's not going to happen. My concerns, though, and I'll take them more -- not bearish, but I'll take a more cautious route. We're not a market that has extreme levels of greed and complacency. So what I'm telling my clients, Charles, is protect your positions. Either sell some that are up big or buy options. You can buy put options which protect your downside. Because I don't think, Charles, that the market is pricing in any type of political surprise in what will inevitably be a volatile year in 2020."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Charles Payne",
      "utterance": "Inevitably, but also, Gary B., you know, you're a market historian. You know, markets typically do well during election years. And then, again, you know, you look at some of the data that we have -- the headwinds of 2019 could actually be tailwinds of 2020."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Gary Smith",
      "utterance": "Well, they could. I tell you what, you know, Charles, you and I talked, in fact, a couple weeks ago about this parabolic move the market's making, and I think Kathryn and Scott both alluded to it. It just seems a little thin right now. I mean, we're going up. We had all these things that we had to worry about, Brexit, the impeachment, the trade tariff with China, and yet it keeps going up. And I'm scratching -- look, I love it. Don't get me wrong. But I scratch my head thinking, \"Am I missing something? Is there nothing to worry [LAUGHS] about out there?”"
    },

      "speaker": "Kathryn Vera",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "Gary Smith",
      "utterance": "I can't find anything. Don't get me wrong, but I'm worried that there's got to be a black swan out there that I'm missing. It just can't keep going straight up in spite of everything. That's my --"

      "speaker": "Charles Payne",
      "utterance": "Kathryn says she going to tell you what you should be worried about."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Kathryn Vera",
      "utterance": "Well, Charles, a third of all debt now is negative yielding. I mean, no one is talking about this right now because the markets are all at record high euphoria stage. But we have negative interest rate policy on a global scale -- except the Fed, thank God. Hopefully we never get there -- but that has been fostering too much risk appetite, an assumption of risk. If we get even the specter of inflation in 2020, then I think the markets are going to retrace in a meaningful way. One more point that I'll say that is not priced in right now. If we get a Sanders or a Warren nominee, guys, let's face it, this is -- these are the facts. The markets completely ignoring it, 50 percent of the S&P 500 is attached to banks --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Charles Payne",
      "utterance": "You're right. You're right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Kathryn Vera",
      "utterance": "-- tech, and healthcare. These are people that want to do those in."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Charles Payne",
      "utterance": "You make a good point. When the Elizabeth Warren was ahead in the polls, health care stocks in particular took it on the nose there for a moment. But, Scott, you know, we hear this a lot, though, that there's too much euphoria out there. Right now, individual investor optimism is too high. But it was a professional investor and their pessimism all year long that I thought was remarkable, despite the fact that the actual data we were seeing was great data and all the negative stuff was all on the speculative side."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Scott Martin",
      "utterance": "Yeah, it wasn't bad. And I'll tell you, the market tried to forecast at times certain slowdowns, which it may have, but it obviously recovered. And I'll take the opposite to Kathryn's point, though, because a little inflation could go a long way for stocks here, Charles. And we've seen inflation absolutely nowhere in the last several years. The Fed has made comments to the fact that they'd like to see some inflation, so I think that actually could be good for stocks. And don't forget, too, the fact, guys, that earnings could expand really nicely next year off of a pretty easy comp year this year. So if we get some earnings expansion, valuations in the market could expand as well. That could take the S&P even higher."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Charles Payne",
      "utterance": "You know, Gary B., consumer sentiment, individuals saying they look at inflation over the next five years like a 2 percent, little over 2 percent, the lowest on record. We know the Fed kind of pivots toward that. I mean, if inflation is a concern for the experts for Main Street, people are expecting higher wages next year and low inflation. Is that too much of a Goldilocks situation?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Gary Smith",
      "utterance": "No, I don't think so. You know, I think most of the people looking at inflation are thinking still back to the Arthur Burns-Paul Volcker area of inflation. There's just so much competition out there. You know, back then when they were fighting inflation, when Paul Volcker was -- had 10 percent inflation, there was no Internet. You couldn't go around and shop easily for prices. Who has pricing power anymore? There, you know -- we -- I talked to -- last week that there's basically one, duopoly out there, Boeing and Airbus. That's it. Those are the only people that have pricing power. As far as wages to other point, they've grown the fastest, even faster than they have under Obama, which people don't point out. And finally, the final point I want to make is, last night -- look, there's like five trillion dollars on the sidelines of people that were afraid to get into this market. That's -- so that's the flip side of my fear argument. That's the rocket fuel."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Charles Payne",
      "utterance": "And last week, 16 billion of it came in. Maybe the rest will pour in as well. Folks, we got to leave it there. Merry Christmas. Thank you all very much. Appreciate it."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "Charles Payne",
      "utterance": "So with stocks way are President Trump's chances in 2020 way up? That's coming up."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Charles Payne",
      "utterance": "Maybe it is the economy that matters most to voters. President Trump's poll numbers are rising right along with the stock market and the economy, so is this what will win the day next November? Let's get the read from Independent Women's Forum in Inez Stepman, Democratic strategist Nathan Rubin, and the National Review's Mairead McArdle. Mairead, let me start with you. I guess someone once coined the term, “Is the economy stupid?” Certainly, if that's the case, it looks like President Trump to be cruising to reelection."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Mairead McArdle",
      "utterance": "I think it is the economy, partly, and another big topic is health care. But I think one interesting thing is that the Democrats, as far as impeachment is concerned -- the backdrop to impeachment is this booming economy. We had this great jobs report earlier this month, and I think you'll see that's an important thing going forward."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Charles Payne",
      "utterance": "There's no doubt about that Nathan, I mean, listen, I remember back when the Democrats were pushing through Obamacare under President Obama --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Nathan Rubin",
      "utterance": "Yep."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Charles Payne",
      "utterance": "-- quite a few of them fell on their political swords."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Nathan Rubin",
      "utterance": "Yep."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Charles Payne",
      "utterance": "And it feels like there's maybe some already have done that in the House, and you wonder how many people in the Senate have the appetite for that. Certainly, it doesn't look like the Doug Jones does."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Nathan Rubin",
      "utterance": "Well, I think what's interesting -- and a little bit to the points earlier made, the economy is in good shape. The stock market is up. Unemployment is down. I would say that the president is probably a modest favorite to win reelection, despite all of those macroeconomic factors going in his favor. We still see polls from Fox News even showing 50 percent, 54 percent in favor of impeachment, 15 percent in favor of removal. So I think that we're seeing, you know, really different views on, “Yeah, the economy is great, but I'm not so sure I want to send this president back into office.”"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Charles Payne",
      "utterance": "You know, Inez, I don't -- I prefer economic models. There are three real good economic models that all show President Trump winning big time. One said that he would steamroll his Democratic opponents, and they looked at the economy in every state, and they took -- they factored in the Electoral College. It's just hard for me to imagine that those blue collar workers that voted twice for President Obama then gave their vote to President Trump, leaving him at this point if this holds up -- I can't imagine them leaving."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Inez Stepman",
      "utterance": "Well -- and especially since those jobs numbers and economic numbers aren't actually just focused, for example, on Wall Street, on the stock market. We're seeing really, really great jobs numbers for lower income Americans. Right? So I definitely think the economy is the strongest feather in his cap, but I don't actually think it's the only issue in this election, and I actually disagree with the analysis. We're at each other's throats, even though this is a fantastic economy. Right? We're so culturally divided as Americans that even this great booming economy isn't papering over those divides. So I still see this as a big, tough election, a fight, but I do agree. I think President Trump, looking right now -- and anything could happen in the next year but looking right now it seems like he's sitting pretty."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Nathan Rubin",
      "utterance": "Well then, Charles, if I could jump in there as well, just because the stock market is up and unemployment is down, we still have tens of millions of Americans that can't afford a 400 dollar emergency. So even though these macroeconomic indicators are great and the microlevel --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Charles Payne",
      "utterance": "And the micro is going well, too but to your point, out of 300 million people. Yeah, they’re going to be millions -- in fact, you know, when Obama left office, it was twenty six million without health insurance. And yet, you've got Democrats who are saying that should be the thing we run on. So the numbers are always going to be in the millions, but enough to win the election -- and again, I think you bring up a great point about the tribalism, and we're at each other's throats. I don't think that next year is going to be that election where some sort of uniter comes out of the Democratic Party, and that's what this will be all about."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Inez Stepman",
      "utterance": "Well, as I was saying before, health care is another."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Charles Payne",
      "utterance": "It was big in the midterms; do you think it will be just as big next year?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Inez Stepman",
      "utterance": "I think it's a close second to the economy. But one thing I'm seeing from Democrats is that they have slightly different plans, and some of them, such as Warren, tend to waffle on some of their specifics. So it'll be interesting to see where voters end up falling as far as whether they know."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Charles Payne",
      "utterance": "That's a great point. I mean, Nathan, that is what's really at the heart of the fight on the Democratic side right now. Right? Is it -- do we give away every single thing or just 90 percent of it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Nathan Rubin",
      "utterance": "Well, to your point."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Charles Payne",
      "utterance": "You know, listen here, you see what's happening with Warren's numbers, when she had to actually put out the numbers."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Nathan Rubin",
      "utterance": "I fear that we are going through a primary process where, to your point, it will be hard to bring that coalition back together on the other side. We have people that are all for Bernie Sanders, Medicare for all. You have people who are for Joe Biden improving the Affordable Care Act. Elizabeth Warren and Mayor Pete are in this in-between of, “Let's start with a public option and glide into Medicare for all.” And the people who support Bernie Sanders, I don't necessarily see them coalescing behind someone like Joe Biden if he does become the nominee."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Charles Payne",
      "utterance": "Right. Last time, President Trump peeled off a lot of those Bernie Bro's, if you will. You know, you brought -- you bring up tribalism, and that sort of gets to the soft underbelly of America right now. Classism, the issues of race, and things like that, you know, will that play a role in deciding this election in a sense that many people feel like Russia took advantage of that last time out?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Mairead McArdle",
      "utterance": "Well, the KGB has a long history, and now, of course, not the KGB anymore, the FSB, but a long history of pushing on exactly the points, the fault lines in American society that are real fault lines. Right. And I don't think that their interference in terms of Facebook ads and such did much at all of anything. But the fact is that we do have these really deep cultural divides, and I think it goes to the fact the president consistently has his 40, 40 to 45 percent support, basically no matter what he does, because people feel pushed against the wall. They feel like they're playing for all the political marbles because of where the left is. Because of where the Democratic Party has gone, people are willing to overlook things that in the past -- even 10, 20 years ago -- they wouldn't overlook in a candidate, but that's going to be our politics. I don't see a way out, at least in the immediate future. I hope that in the long-term future, Americans will find a way to come together, but I don't see a way of that going on now."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Charles Payne",
      "utterance": "The fact of the matter is President Trump has become the actual proxy for those voters, those disenfranchise voters who voted for him the first time around, and they really solidified. You all -- thank you very much. Appreciate you coming in. Hey, forget about getting gifts. Now, more people are asking loved ones to help them get out of debt instead. And speaking of gifts, the House putting some call on the White House stocking, but is the Senate set to give the president a present when it comes to impeachment?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Nancy Pelosi",
      "utterance": "On this vote, the Yeas are 230, the Nays are 197. Present is one. Article one is adopted. [gavel] On this vote, the Yeas are two 229, the Nays are 198. Present is one. Article two [gavel] is adopted."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Charles Payne",
      "utterance": "The House voted to impeach President Trump. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi still holding back on the articles, which means a Senate trial is still in limbo. So what happens now? Former federal prosecutor Katie Cherkasky joins me now. Katie, you know, on one hand, we were told throughout this process it was a political process. But now that it's supposed to shift to the Senate, it's the Democrats feel like they're treating it more like a criminal trial. And what are the dynamics of this? Why are they different?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Katie Cherkasky",
      "utterance": "Sure. With the impeachment trial, the procedure is everything. The outcome is destined. So for the sake of deciding how to run this, and for the future of all presidents, these senators really need to agree upon the procedure. And that's not an easy task because there's nothing that's prescribed in the Constitution."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Charles Payne",
      "utterance": "One would assume, however, that the majority would be the one setting the rules, just like Nancy Pelosi set the rules for the -- for everything that went on in the House."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Katie Cherkasky",
      "utterance": "That's true to a great extent, and they do have a lot of power to do that. The question is, how do you make the decisions that will make it a fair process to both sides and also make it a legitimate process? And when you have a trial, really, I think just on its face, the bare minimum that should be required, at least to some extent, is witnesses and the presentation of evidence to make a valid decision."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Charles Payne",
      "utterance": "Yeah. That process is muddled, though, on the House side. You know, you say whether it's fair, you know, it's -- very few Republicans think that the entire thing on the House side was fair. And then, of course, you had on Monday with Chuck Schumer saying, \"Hey, we want four key witnesses making witness demands.\" By the same token, I'm not sure if they would like to see Hunter Biden come up and testify. Should the whistleblower then be required to come up? Should even Representative Schiff be required to come up? I mean, it's got to be balanced if indeed that's the route they want to go down."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Katie Cherkasky",
      "utterance": "Yeah, absolutely. I think that the Democrats better pick their poison with it because there are going to be concessions on both sides. But for the sake of the procedure, I think there does need to be some semblance of what we know a trial to be, even though the Constitution doesn't require any sort of witnesses to be presented or any sort of evidence really at all. I think it would be a mistake to not require at least some of that procedure."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Charles Payne",
      "utterance": "How much should they borrow against history? Mitch McConnell saying, \"Hey, we've gone through this before. We know what the rules were in the past.\" He's willing to walk along those same -- to use those parameters and guidelines this time around. And still, I think he's got a fair amount of pushback from Republicans -- from Democrats, rather."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Katie Cherkasky",
      "utterance": "I think that it's -- it would be a lot easier if there were specific rules prescribed. When you have so many people making decisions, there's going to be debate about what should or shouldn't happen. And even at the trial itself, there's still people making decisions about what evidence comes in and what doesn't."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Charles Payne",
      "utterance": "Are there specific rules --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Katie Cherkasky",
      "utterance": "But there's got to be --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Charles Payne",
      "utterance": "-- Katie, that you're alluding to? You brought this point up several times. What do you think should -- give us the parameters that you think would be ideal and fair."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Katie Cherkasky",
      "utterance": "At the bare minimum, I think that there needs to be an allowance for it to present some amount of witnesses on each side, to present some amount of argument on each side, maybe even the limit by a certain number of hours, and to leave that to a vote. I think that would be a semblance of a trial. This is a trial, and there should be some allowance for the presentation of evidence, and I think that would be fair to both sides."

Although the forecast says that things are probably going to be about flat this year, but the good news is that people are going in stores. You said it, 68 percent of Americans are planning to head into the stores on December 26 and afterwards.

I'm going to return this shirt, but I might need a pair of pants.\" And the day after Christmas is actually one of the biggest days where people are shopping for themselves, so I wouldn't be surprised that more people are making purchases than returns tomorrow and the days after."

So you can buy a gift card that is valued at 100 dollars, but you can buy it at 15 percent off or 10 percent off, so it costs you 90 dollars.

You know, we know that we went from credit cards and now student loans and people are worried about subprime auto loans. But also, Americans want to get out there. They want to live, and you could drive a new car for 180 bucks a month. It's hard to resist that."

We watch Living with the Kardashians, and we think that's our right to live just like they do, not understanding they got a whole lot more money than all of us do. The problem is we've got to have discipline, commitment, and I believe what people need to remember about debt moving forward is that debt is a moral commitment, in my opinion. It's about integrity. You charged it. They advance you the money. You owe it to them. It's their money."

They thought that was morally okay."

      "speaker": "Larry Winget",
      "utterance": "Yeah, and that's why I think my last book was all about core values, and that's why I think you have to bring up the moral side of this about honesty, integrity, and respect for other people's money because debt is other people's money that you've pretty much already enjoyed. So we need the moral obligation around taking care of the people who advanced us that money and understand they did us a favor."

      "speaker": "Charles Payne",
      "utterance": "You know, with just a minute to go, some of the economic data I look at show that our savings rate is still relatively high compared to life before the onset of the Great Recession.

And the Trump campaign has internal polling showing that in some of these battleground states and districts that the Democrats won in 2018, but the president won in 2016, there is a 11 percentage point -- people in favor of getting rid of the Democratic congressman or woman that voted in."

I mean, it's very clear. And the president's defenders will say that the decision not to transmit the actual articles of impeachment and allow the process to play out in the Senate, what else could it be but the fact that they felt like they hadn't built up enough of a case that would convince a consensus, a national consensus of people, to remove the president from office?"

And I mean, when you think about it, when she gave that speech that really propelled her to the national stage, the \"You didn't build that\" speech.

You have a couple of -- you're a couple of drinks in and then, you know, you let the guard down, and everybody gets loose on it. But it's funny because, you know, just a couple of weeks ago, we already got into the fights over Thanksgiving and you're like, \"Oh, I'm out. I in the clear.\" But no, once again, your mom's going to be like, \"Oh, you're still single?\" And you're like, \"Yeah, mom, it's been three weeks, and I'm still single.\" So obviously, the fights are going to happen.

So let's talk to one of our favorite guests here in your world, Father Robert Sirico of the Acton Institute. Father, thanks for joining us."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "Father Robert Sirico",
      "utterance": "You know, if you look at the manger scene, this is the big image of what Christmas is. We think of it is this idealistic, pleasant, peaceful place, but in reality, it was a stable. Think for a moment what a stable's like. It stunk. There were animals that were defecating in the stable. It was cold. It was not even planned. They weren't supposed to be there. They were looking for a hotel room. And that is precisely the mess into which the son of God came. So if we reduce the idealism of Christmas and emphasize its incarnation, which is what the feast is about, I think we can have a more realistic and holistic understanding of the meaning of Christmas."

    {
      "speaker": "Charles Payne",

      "speaker": "Father Robert Sirico",
      "utterance": "No, I think it's -- the hope comes from the reality, the sanctification of the present. This is a young woman who is caught in a calling from God that literally could have put her life at stake. They're being chased by hostile forces, and it's damp and cold and, you know, so precarious, and yet she becomes the most profound woman in human history. She's -- the scripture says that she -- her name is blessed in all generations. There's the hope in exactly the circumstance that she confronts with her son. He becomes the king of kings, the Lord of Lords. In a derivative way, we can understand that the contingencies of our life, the limitations of our life, the precariousness of our life can become the occasion of greatness if we turn to the one who is the prince of peace. Even as people are now in their homes with families and, you know, all kinds of discussions and tensions and baggage, I wonder if we could just sit back and look and say, \"You know, there is the possibility, the potential, for peace, there's potential for holiness in the midst of this very contentious circumstance."

      "speaker": "Charles Payne",
      "utterance": "It would seem that that would be the case, just even considering history in general and all of the things that we've overcome as human beings, in general. And but, we lose sight of it. I mean, it fades away fairly quickly. And for some people, it could be a parking ticket or, you know, a bad day at the office. And so many of the great things that have propelled us to this point we forget about."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Robert Sirico",
      "utterance": "It's very easy to forget about it because we can get so caught up with the details that we lose the big picture of what the meaning of life is. I've often thought that the greatest consolation I have in times of distress is thinking of history, thinking of the movement of history, that things are never quite as bad as I think they are, that they can be improved. Even tomorrow, they can be improved, that things can take a turn."

      "speaker": "Robert Sirico",
      "utterance": "That's true. I think we need a little more corniness. I think we've become far too cynical. We doubt our own selves. And I think if Christmas points us to anything, it's that star that leads us to the one who gives us the meaning of our own existence."
