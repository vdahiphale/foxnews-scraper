On the constitutional issue, there will be an Electoral College vote at some point, and that's what will determine the president. The media can assert or say that they, in their estimation, they believe that Joe Biden is unquestionably going to be that person. But they've also lost so much of their credibility in recent years that, you know, they said that this wouldn't be a close election. They said this was going to be a massive blue wave. They have spent many years lying about Donald Trump, his presidency, his supporters. And so half the country no longer acknowledges their legitimacy to assert what the situation is.

On what planet is that appropriate for a White House correspondent? SUSAN FERRECHIO, WASHINGTON EXAMINER CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  It's not, and it's part of what Mollie was talking about, how the larger story about this election is the media, and that they announced Biden the winner, and he may well be the winner. But the media lost credibility through its coverage of the president over the last four years.  Jim Acosta was kind of leading a way with that with his combative attitude in these press conferences. He sort of started it all. And CNN, which was supposed to be the neutral network where you could watch the news and really find out what's happening objectively. That's all gone by the wayside. And you combine that with the way this election was conducted, all new mail-in balloting where all the states had different rules, and the outcomes came -- it creates all this doubt. I don't think the doubt should be laughed at. I don't think Trump should be treated like he's a toddler questioning this. There are a lot of questions about this, and the Jim Acosta comment is part of why the public really doesn't trust what's going on.",

There is the issue though that the media should have curiosity about what was just referenced, this massive move to mail-in balloting, which has much less scrutiny than normal voting in person. And it should have, in fact, much more. So you have a certain level of fraud in every election. And the media just seemed to have no concern or curiosity about it at all. If they cover it, they downplay it. And this was after four years of completely amplifying Democratic claims that the 2016 election was stolen by Donald Trump.  They spent many years no matter how ludicrous the claim was, amplifying it and devoting all of their media coverage to it. And here you have a totally normal thing, which is a certain amount of election fraud in every election. But this year with that massive move to mail-in balloting, no signature checks, kicking observers out while they counted those mail-in ballots.  This is something that a media, if the election had exactly the opposite in terms of where the numbers were right now, they would be digging into every last little last thing here. And we know that.

Howie, the problem here, when Susan speaks of casting doubt, well, there's some doubt on my side of the aisle.   Democrats say how come you don't question North Carolina? North Carolina was just called around the same time Arizona was by most of the networks, yet Trump won that state. And that's part of a problem. They're only questioning the legitimacy of the votes counted in states that he lost, which doesn't smell right to a lot of voters.

I think it's worth noting as we reflect on how completely fraudulent and erroneous and intentionally so many media polls were with how they covered whether or not it this was a close election between Joe Biden and Donald Trump. It's also interesting to think about how those polls drove that false or drove coverage about Coronavirus and what people's actual feelings are about whether they should lose their civil liberties or be shut down or have schools -- children banned from schools and other issues.

For example, at the campaign, we've put out a list of number of dead voters who voted two weeks ago both in Pennsylvania and in Georgia. I think we're going to put out our list for Nevada, maybe even Michigan today. And the frequent refrain that I would hear from reporters is, well, this is just a small list of dead voters.

I honestly think that if he just cut off the tweeting and behaved himself like a decent person, you know, 20 percent more of the time, he probably would have won.

Donald Trump loves that stuff. He played right to type for that and there was this weird codependent relationship between the mainstream media, which loved to be attacked and sort of celebrate their own courage for speaking truth to power, like some people at CNN do, while at the same time Donald Trump loved the vitriol because it proved to his fan base again, which is all he really cared about, that he was fighting for them.

Mollie, President Trump just tweeted of Biden, he won because the election was rigged. With a swipe at the fake and silent media, there's been an explosion of news stories on this, some liberals are touting this as a kind of grudging concession.

One is the constitutional process by which we determine who has won the presidency, and the second are all the issues surrounding how credible this election has been, this move to widespread mail-in balloting, and whether the appropriate measures were taken to make sure that this was a safe and secure election. On the constitutional issue, there will be an Electoral College vote at some point, and that's what will determine the president. The media can assert or say that they, in their estimation, they believe that Joe Biden is unquestionably going to be that person. But they've also lost so much of their credibility in recent years that, you know, they said that this wouldn't be a close election. They said this was going to be a massive blue wave. They have spent many years lying about Donald Trump, his presidency, his supporters. And so half the country no longer acknowledges their legitimacy to assert what the situation is. And, in fact, if the media say something, they're more likely to doubt it because of that horrible track record."

And let me turn to Leslie on this, than it is about the actual vote counting. Now, moments or some short time after the tweet I just read, President Trump reacting to the freak out on Twitter had this follow-up tweet. Speaking of Biden, he only won in the eyes of the fake news media. I concede nothing. Now, Trump is a master messenger on Twitter. Do you think he was trying to send a signal with the first tweet?

      "speaker": "SUSAN FERRECHIO, WASHINGTON EXAMINER CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": " It's not, and it's part of what Mollie was talking about, how the larger story about this election is the media, and that they announced Biden the winner, and he may well be the winner. But the media lost credibility through its coverage of the president over the last four years. Jim Acosta was kind of leading a way with that with his combative attitude in these press conferences. He sort of started it all. And CNN, which was supposed to be the neutral network where you could watch the news and really find out what's happening objectively. That's all gone by the wayside. And you combine that with the way this election was conducted, all new mail-in balloting where all the states had different rules, and the outcomes came -- it creates all this doubt. I don't think the doubt should be laughed at. I don't think Trump should be treated like he's a toddler questioning this. There are a lot of questions about this, and the Jim Acosta comment is part of why the public really doesn't trust what's going on."

On Friday, however, just on Friday, they lost rulings or, you know, had legal setbacks in Michigan, Arizona, and Pennsylvania. Arizona's Republican governor says he believes Biden will win the state. There's not enough fraud to overturn. So my question is just as a straight news story covering the legal developments, it doesn't seem to be looking good for the Trump team. Would you disagree?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "I'm not sure. Legal developments will be what they are, and we have to wait and see how they conclude. And there will also be new filings, and they should be covered honestly and accurately. There is the issue though that the media should have curiosity about what was just referenced, this massive move to mail-in balloting, which has much less scrutiny than normal voting in person. And it should have, in fact, much more. So you have a certain level of fraud in every election. And the media just seemed to have no concern or curiosity about it at all. If they cover it, they downplay it. And this was after four years of completely amplifying Democratic claims that the 2016 election was stolen by Donald Trump. They spent many years no matter how ludicrous the claim was, amplifying it and devoting all of their media coverage to it. And here you have a totally normal thing, which is a certain amount of election fraud in every election. But this year with that massive move to mail-in balloting, no signature checks, kicking observers out while they counted those mail-in ballots. This is something that a media, if the election had exactly the opposite in terms of where the numbers were right now, they would be digging into every last little last thing here. And we know that. And they're not doing it in this case because they are -- they want to just support their candidate, Joe Biden."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "All right. I want to briefly touch on a couple of these allegations. Susan, the president re-tweeted a report being promoted by OAN network, that dominion, which makes these voting machines, deleted nearly a million of his votes, which were more than 200,000, Pennsylvania votes from Trump to Biden. There was some problems with the human error on the software. But his own Department of Homeland Security says no evidence of any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes or was in any way compromised."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FERRECHIO",
      "utterance": "Democratic political connections to the dominion system, so it's one of those things that's going to create doubt. And it's also electronic. With the push of a button, things can disappear. I think it helps to undermine the trust in this particular election amongst millions of people who voted for Trump who now question whether this thing was completely rigged. And whether or not the media -- that's still tens of millions of voters who have doubts in this election. And that's why I think it's important to look at all aspects of this, especially the ones where there are political connections like the dominion system."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "There are widespread doubts. There's no question about that. And that is part of the story. Leslie, another allegation touted by Trump lawyers and the campaign, a Pennsylvania postal worker alleged backdating of ballots received after election day. He he later recanted his charge to inspector general investigators. So, you know, we should as journalists look at all these things, but also if it turns out to crumble, then we have to report that too."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MARSHALL",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. We want the facts here. Look, you know, I don't want to win, and I don't want my candidate to win by cheating. And I would hope the other side doesn't either. Howie, the problem here, when Susan speaks of casting doubt, well, there's some doubt on my side of the aisle. Democrats say how come you don't question North Carolina? North Carolina was just called around the same time Arizona was by most of the networks, yet Trump won that state. And that's part of a problem. They're only questioning the legitimacy of the votes counted in states that he lost, which doesn't smell right to a lot of voters. And there are people I know here in California that are Republicans that voted for the president. But that have accepted what looks like is certainly going to be the outcome of this election, which is that Joe Biden is president-elect and will be the next president of the United States."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "Well, he just is, whether or not they give him whatever they give him. He just had a re-election campaign where he gained 10 million new voters. He is clearly going to have a lot of power in terms of deciding whether he wants to run again if he is not determined to be the winner of this election. He can easily run again. And he is the most popular. He's simultaneously the most hated and the most popular politician in this country. And we pay so much attention to the people who are just consumed by fear and hatred of him. But he has 73 million people who love him. And love him after what they just been put through by the media for the last four years. That's a lot of power. And the Republican Party knows that. The media know that, and it's just going to be what we're going to deal with."

And yet, he's being totally overshadowed in this transition so far, kind of like what happened during the campaign. Let me get a break here. Ahead, Jason Miller of the Trump campaign joins the program. But when we come back, the surge in Coronavirus becomes a major media issue, and that's fueling some press criticism of the president."

That's actually not true. The Washington Post did report that erroneously, but he released audio of exactly what he said to post office investigators. And you can listen to that yourself. It's like a two hour audio interview. And he says he did not recant in contradiction to what the Washington Post claimed."

There does seem to be the media continuing their push for lockdowns. And the media have really been chearleading that. And one of the things that I think is interesting is that they did that in part using polls, saying that people were broadly supportive of this approach to how to handle a global pandemic. I think it's worth noting as we reflect on how completely fraudulent and erroneous and intentionally so many media polls were with how they covered whether or not it this was a close election between Joe Biden and Donald Trump. It's also interesting to think about how those polls drove that false or drove coverage about Coronavirus and what people's actual feelings are about whether they should lose their civil liberties or be shut down or have schools -- children banned from schools and other issues. And so this polling, I think, is an issue not just with politics but also with how they handle the Coronavirus coverage."

My husband is in the medical community, and I'm privy to some of these conversations. The doctors are very concerned. You know, it's not that we're having a little bit of a spike. What we are having is we've broken our own record. We have winter coming. And in nearly all 50 states, we're going to be indoors a lot more. That is a huge concern to the medical community that they don't have the capacity with health care workers and with beds in these hospitals to care for these individuals. All we want is to get this COVID-19 virus behind us. What can they do in the interim until the vaccine is available, especially when you have a third of Americans saying they're not even going to take any vaccine that's out there, Pfizer or otherwise. What can be done? Lockdown is one of the things they look at. But Howie, lockdown has negative ramifications also, not just to the economy, but to people's mental health as well."

He helped secure the contract with Pfizer for 100 million doses of the vaccine as supposed to be 90 percent effective. The country is producing enough ventilators to send them overseas. There's been enough protective gear. And there has been enough capacity in hospitals. Now, we're entering flu season. There are spikes in some parts of the country. Some areas are topping off now. And I think we're probably going to see a reduction in some of those cases. It's also flu season. You know, it's been months now we've been in lockdown. Our kids have been out of school since March. There are people missing doctors' appointments and screenings. They're still staying away from check-ups. You have to weigh the risks here of lockdown versus -- it's something more modified.

One of them which warned of the dangers of pulling out of Afghanistan too quickly. That may have triggered it. Now, the acting secretary of defense, Chris Miller, sent a message to the troops, and it's a little bit of a mixed message. Because he says the war isn't other, but at the same time he says it's time to bring the troops home.

The fact of the matter is states have not yet certified who actually has won their respective contests. We still have a number of very specific legal challenges that are going. We do believe that the state of Pennsylvania was systemically compromised, and that election is going to go through the courts as they review that. We do believe there are instances of systemic fraud in the state of Michigan, especially as we go through Wayne County and get into the particulars there of ballots being run through multiple times, officials putting up cardboard, not allowing our observers to watch ballots be counted. A lot of very specific issues we're concerned about. And we haven't even gotten into the ballot harvesting in Georgia. We need to make sure that we go through because, Howie, this isn't just about this election, this is about the Senate runoff elections coming up in the January and the future of elections in America."

But what we're talking about here, again, as we talk about ballot harvesting in Georgia where we haven't had the opportunity to match up signatures, as we look at the unconstitutional nature in which the election in Pennsylvania was conducted, the fact that almost 700,000 ballots in Allegheny and Philadelphia counties were counted without the ability for observers to be in place, the fact that cared (ph) ballots and uncared (ph) ballots were all comingled and mixed together, raises some serious questions about the legitimacy of those elections. And when the president talks about rigging an election, what he's talking about is how Democrats have used the guise of COVID as an excuse. The chaos surrounding COVID is some kind of guise to go and change our election laws, to go and rig it for the Democrats. And I think that's a very serious thing --"

Just on Friday, as I mentioned earlier, rulings in Arizona, Michigan, and Pennsylvania went against the Trump team.

As we think back to the contested elections of whether it would be 2000 or even 2016, many in the media encouraged the candidate who was behind coming out on election night to go and challenge and ask for recounts and to go through all their legal remedies. And so that ability should be granted to President Trump here. And I would say one other key point here, Howie. How much fraud is OK? For example, at the campaign, we've put out a list of number of dead voters who voted two weeks ago both in Pennsylvania and in Georgia. I think we're going to put out our list for Nevada, maybe even Michigan today. And the frequent refrain that I would hear from reporters is, well, this is just a small list of dead voters. Well, if we can find these dead voters voting in such a short period of time, isn't it incumbent upon secretaries of state and on these state legislatures to make sure the voter rolls are accurate? If we can find it this easy, how much more is there out there? This is, I think, our responsibility to do this, to make sure that the election, that everyone can have confidence in it."

Some of the videos, Howie, that we saw last night were absolutely horrific. And this is what said during the campaign. You won't be safe in Joe Biden's America. These aren't Trump supporters that are showing up and committing the violence. I think the media really needs to go and cover this, and I do think that whether it be the D.C. police or the DOJ, there have to be immediate crackdowns on these groups like Antifa because this isn't how society is supposed to wok."

So, what's the answer? Why?"
    },

      "speaker": "GOLDBERG",
      "utterance": "I think the huge amount of it, which is a point I've made for a very long time, is that Donald Trump never even pretended, and the key word there is pretended, never pretended to be the president of the whole country. Every other president in living memory at least makes an effort to expand their coalition, to seem like they are more than president of their own base, and Donald Trump didn't do that. He spent four years doing fan service for his biggest fans both in media and as voters, and that turned off more people than it attracted, which is why his approval ratings were so low for his entire presidency. I honestly think that if he just cut off the tweeting and behaved himself like a decent person, you know, 20 percent more of the time, he probably would have won. But he was too self-involved and all that, and I think that one of the consequences of that has been a real corruption of what it means to be a conservative and a real -- and some real damage to what even it means to be a Republican, which is a less important thing to me."

I think you could make the case that media coverage hurt Donald Trump. I can also make the case that his attacks on media and the unfairness of mainstream media sometimes to him helped to turn out those voters. I mean, you just have to listen to most Trump supporters who come on, say, Fox News, a huge part of their argument is all about, you know, sticking it today the media and fighting back against the media. Donald Trump loves that stuff. He played right to type for that and there was this weird codependent relationship between the mainstream media, which loved to be attacked and sort of celebrate their own courage for speaking truth to power, like some people at CNN do, while at the same time Donald Trump loved the vitriol because it proved to his fan base again, which is all he really cared about, that he was fighting for them.

      "utterance": "I am not the historian you are, and I certainly don't have the Pulitzer on my shelf that you do. Do you concur that that is the way we are used to hearing from our presidents?"

      "speaker": "MEACHAM",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. Tonight marks the entire election results, marked a renewal of an American conversation where we're struggling imperfectly to realize the full implications of the Jeffersonian promise of equality."

      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Meacham did not disclose his role in helping with the speech, and NBC and MSNBC have now dropped him as a paid contributor. MSNBC and Meacham did not respond to my request for comment, and most of the media except for the Times have ignored this deception. He didn't level with the audience. Now, Meacham is a very smart guy, it would be better if he would address what he did, and whether he has any regrets. Well, Trump derangement syndrome isn't subsiding. CNN anchor Christiane Amanpour has actually compared Donald Trump's tenure to the Nazis' murderous reign of terror known as Kristallnacht."

      "speaker": "CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR",
      "utterance": "It was the Nazi's warning shot across the bow of our human civilization that led to genocide against a whole identity. After four years of a modern day assault on those same values by Donald Trump, the Biden/Harris team pledges a return to norms, including the truth."

      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "I'm sorry, if you have to invoke Hitler to slam a president who just won 48 percent of the vote, that's beyond the pale. And Milwaukee Fox affiliate WITI has suspended top anchor Ted Perry for posting this on Facebook. 2020 takes Alex Trebek but leaves Mitch McConnell? Just end already. Well, we all love the late Jeopardy host, but how biased does a journalist have to be to suggest a Republican senator should have died? That's insane. Well, that's it for this edition of MEDIA BUZZ. I'm Howard Kurtz. We hope you'll like my Facebook page. We post my daily columns there. Let us continue the conversation on Twitter at Howard Kurtz. Check out my podcast, \"MEDIA BUZZmeter.\" You can subscribe at Apple iTunes, Google podcast, or get it on your Amazon device. So much is going on in the aftermath of this election. We'll be back here next Sunday, 11:00 Eastern. See you then with the latest buzz. Content and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
