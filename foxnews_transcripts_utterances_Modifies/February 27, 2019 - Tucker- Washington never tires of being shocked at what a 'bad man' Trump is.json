      "sentences": "Good evening and welcome to \"Tucker Carlson Tonight.\" You're looking at live pictures from Hanoi, Vietnam in the northern part of the country. The president is there tonight. He is about to meet with the North Korean dictator, Kim Jong-un. We will monitor that live. We expect a lot of movement in this hour. We will play it to you as it happens. But first, a lot going on Capitol Hill today. The circus came to town. The President's former lawyer, Michael Cohen testified for most of the daylight hours and everybody carried it. You probably heard snippets in the Uber on the way to work, you've got a real job, so we watched every moment because we are paid to do that.  And most of the day was devoted to the question of Trump's personal character. Now, people in Washington never tire of being shocked by what an incredibly bad man Donald Trump is. They are incredibly good people and they can just hardly believe his flaws.  They sat open mouth in the Congress today as Michael Cohen described his former boss -- brace yourselves now -- as a bit of a conman who has at times overstated his personal wealth. In private, Trump apparently has said offensive things.  At one point, Michael Cohen claims Trump used a straw buyer to bid up a portrait of himself at a charity auction. He wanted his picture to go for the highest price. Whoa. Are you shocked yet? Can you believe it? Of course you can. This is exactly we knew back in 2015 when he descended the famous escalator and yet millions of people voted for him anyway. His character was not the point. The point of today's hearings not his character either, it was supposed to be Russian collusion and obstruction of justice. Those are the topics that have completely derailed the American government for the past two years. And on those subjects, we actually did learn quite a bit today.  Here is one example. About a month ago, the cat blog, BuzzFeed ran an article that claimed Trump had ordered Michael Cohen to lie to the Congress. That is a big deal. It is a crime. And so immediately, the hysterics in the Congress and on cable news went bonkers -- impeachment, indictment, life in prison -- but did that actually happen? Well, since Cohen was there, in person, he was able to conclusively answer that question today and he did. Watch.",

You have been hearing about that for years. Trump they have told you again and again has somehow been compromised by the Russians. And that is why he has been spying for them. Putin has something horrible and incriminating on Donald Trump, he must. A picture of the President in a \"Batman\" costume maybe, or a video tape with hookers doing something weird.

Cohen showed up in Washington two years ago anticipating that he would be the kind of guy, the kind of mover and shaker who would welcome at any restaurant in town. Part the seas for Michael Cohen. Now, he is going to be eating sloppy joes off of a metal tray with a thousand other creeps in identical polyester uniform in the lock up. So take the politics out of it for a minute if you can. Let's be honest. This is a sad story. Michael Cohen is a broken and desperate man, but nobody cares. Democrats cheered for his conviction on ludicrous, absurd campaign finance charges, as if paying off somebody's girlfriend is a campaign finance violation. It is laughable, but they don't care.  Now, they are squeezing whatever use they can out of Michael Cohen as he shuffles off to his cell. What do the rest of us get out of this? We learn that Trump is vain and vulgar, okay. What do we do with information? Is it supposed to make us support open borders? Late-term abortion? The war in Syria? The Green New Deal? Will it make the drug epidemic go away? Will it make the suicide rate drop? Will it make housing affordable in the cities? What does that have to do with anything?  Well, it doesn't have anything to do with anything and that is the exactly the point of it. That is why this is going on forever. The more time they waste yelping about Trump's charity auction scam and his naughty language in private, the last time they have to explain why they have run this country into the ground and gotten rich doing it.

The Democrats in Hollywood want us to believe Michael Cohen, but I saw two or three times in this hearing where Michael Cohen couldn't resist lying again. I mean, for example, when he talked about how it was his idea that President Trump ran for President in 2011 for the 2012 cycle, that couldn't be further from the truth. There was a whole team put together by Roger Stone that was already in motion trying to get the President into the game when Michael Cohen came along and joined up with the team and started a group called, something like, \"Should Trump run?\" And the reason he was given leadership of the group is because he promised President Trump that he would raise $2 million to $3 million at the end of that whole flirtation with the campaign, Michael Cohen had raised $16,000.00.  So the idea that it was idea for the President to run in 2012 is a lie. He lied right to the committee's face again, and of course, we had that whole thing with his foreign contracts and they are going to refer that for an investigation, and I think they should refer for an investigation his whole claim, this prideful claim it was his idea that the President run in 2012.

And there is no independent evidence for that whatsoever. Mueller as you know, just indicted Roger Stone last month on charges that relate to his claimed communications with WikiLeaks and Mueller who has access to all the pertinent phone records and every other record under the sun made no mention of this supposed phone call that transpired on this date, I think, Cohen said it was either July 18th or 19th, 2016.

It has an authoritarian dictator who has plunged the country into complete desperation and that's creating a very negative humanitarian situation. It is creating refugees who are fanning out all over South America, Latin America, and some of them are going to come here to the U.S. More refugees have applied for asylum in the U.S. than from any other country this year. It is a problem for America and it's a problem for this hemisphere. It's also a humanitarian -- it's also a human rights problem. Several people have been killed at the border just because other countries are trying to bring in food and aid. So this is something the U.S. has to be concerned about.

You know that's about $1.5 million for the President of the United States limo because of all the security concerns. The tires -- everything is special, especially done by GM and Cadillac. But we did some digging. Kim Jong-un's limo, you've seen the pictures of the synchronized swimmers almost, the security cordon around him. It's a Mercedes Maybach that costs $1.6 million. Why is that significant? They manufacture cars in North Korea, a small number and you see that Mercedes Maybach there with the synchronized swimmers running around essentially. They manufacture cars in North Korea that are only worth about $10,000.00, okay? And the average annual income in North Korea is $1,300.00. It gives you some perspective, A, about why Kim Jong-un, as he enters these talks with President Trump may be a little nervous. He sleeps with one eye open about a not so tight grip on power because he has got people making $1,300.00 a year as an average annual income in his country. He's riding around in $1.6 million Mercedes Maybach and the other point is, that he a taste for capitalism. And you mentioned this a few moments ago with Bret. He wants the finer things in life. He wants to perhaps see some market reforms in North Korea and get a taste of what it is like for the wealthier folks here in Vietnam which once had an economy that was in the pits as well like North Korea now and would like to see it all open up.

You are right. That sort of raises some eyebrows when you have the human rights record of Kim Jong-un. The hundred thousand people in North Korea, we should remember who are in the gulag system as we speak. On the other hand, if you are going to make peace, you've got to deal with some really bad actors on the world stage and that is the bargain this President is dealing with. And I want to point out something, Nicholas Kristof in \"The New York Times,\" one of the guys we were supposed to be told is so smart on foreign policy. In my research for this trip, April 20th, 2017, headlined, \"The North Korea-Trump Nightmare,\" and the lead says, \"President Trump is scary in many ways, but perhaps the most frightening nightmare is of him blundering us into a new Korean War.\" Tucker, that was April 2017. So my point is, all the \"smart people\" quote- unquote, on foreign policy have been wrong again and again about President Trump particularly his approach to North Korea. So to your point, it is not great when you have got to jump into bed with someone like Kim Jong-un, but if he comes out of this with some kind of measure of peace, I think a lot of quote-unquote \" smart people\" are going to be proven wrong.",

He actually went to a fancy boarding school in Switzerland before when he was young. He has seen parts of the world. He knows his system doesn't deliver for his people. He doesn't actually care about that. I mean, he is at the end of the day, a dictator. Similarly, you are seeing expectations. People who are saying that Donald Trump has already lost. He has given up on total denuclearization and that he is going to just accept some peace deal for the appearance of it. Consider that as some big victory. I don't think that is realistic either. I think Donald Trump wants to win not in sort of a PR photo up sense, but in a real way. So I think some of the expectations are wrong, what they really they are going to probably do is try and work for incremental steps at disarmament including things like boring things -- inspections, discussions about plutonium 239 and uranium 235 and things like that.",

And did he harm -- did he change our opinion of Donald Trump's method of operation? He didn't either. He has already lied about Russian collusion and the only other aspect was did he go to Prague or not and he obviously didn't. He had no reason to lie about that. So I think it is a 36-hour phenomenon and more importantly as you've heard from your guest, it was staged to take away attention from Korea in the short term and the long term, it's part of the Emolument Clause, the 25th Amendment, the suing of the voting machines, the in-palace McCabe coup designed to take Donald Trump's positives down to below 40%. I just say about the Korea, if I could. Why these talks have failed under Bush and Clinton and Obama were, we didn't think there was an existential threat yet; now, we know there is with the ability to hit a western city, so Trump is much more urgent and serious; and second, we have this crazy appeasing idea of China that they were on the trajectory to the family of nations. The more we appease them and the more rich they got, the more reasonable they are. Trump does not buy into that. So he is pressing China with tariffs and then finally, we always gave up on sanctions. We said, \"God, they are eating grass.\" Or we have to be careful about the innocent North Korean people. But they don't rate when you're considering losing Seattle or Portland. So I think Trump brilliantly put it in Vietnam and he is basically saying with that backdrop, this was an archenemy of the United States. It is communist. And it is doing much better than you are, and it's not very close with China and you don't have to be close with China and we are not going to invade it. And so the carrot is that we probably won't invade you and you can become a Vietnam and the stick is, do you really want to live in a neighborhood with a nuclear Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea because they may well go nuclear if you do. And then China is not the ascendant sun, it's a setting sun. And we are the ascendant power. And we are doing pretty well in missile defense, so even if you did weaponize these weapons in a way -- these ballistic missiles to hit us, we could knock them down. So it is a good carrot for you and it's a bad stick for you, and you can decide and we suggest you look at what is going on in Vietnam and that might be a model you'd like to consider. So I think it has done pretty well and I think Michael Cohen in comparison to all of that, it is just more of the cycle dramas that we hear every 48 hours about Donald Trump from the left.",

Remember these two leaders with a large group of aides and advisers had a dinner last night that the President said was going to be relatively quick. Instead, it went about two hours or so. So that suggests maybe they were getting to know each other a little more and may be even getting some business done. The real key is that roughly in the middle of the night where you are, about 2:00 a.m. or so Eastern Time, we anticipate there could be some sort of a ceremony where they sign a document like they did in Singapore. The question of course is going to be, what will be on that document? Is it just -- you can see the President now and Chairman Kim meeting again, the key is going to be, do they sign an agreement that officially ends the Korean War? Do they do something deeper that does moves towards denuclearization with some specificity? Bottom line is, we are going to be alive all night, Tucker, starting 1:00 a.m. Eastern taking you through for a couple of hours through that signing ceremony and then of course, the President is doing an interview with Fox's Sean Hannity and we anticipate, depending on how it all goes, the President may also do a news conference with the International Press Corps.

He is about to meet with the North Korean dictator, Kim Jong-un. We will monitor that live. We expect a lot of movement in this hour. We will play it to you as it happens. But first, a lot going on Capitol Hill today. The circus came to town. The President's former lawyer, Michael Cohen testified for most of the daylight hours and everybody carried it. You probably heard snippets in the Uber on the way to work, you've got a real job, so we watched every moment because we are paid to do that. And most of the day was devoted to the question of Trump's personal character. Now, people in Washington never tire of being shocked by what an incredibly bad man Donald Trump is. They are incredibly good people and they can just hardly believe his flaws. They sat open mouth in the Congress today as Michael Cohen described his former boss -- brace yourselves now -- as a bit of a conman who has at times overstated his personal wealth. In private, Trump apparently has said offensive things. At one point, Michael Cohen claims Trump used a straw buyer to bid up a portrait of himself at a charity auction. He wanted his picture to go for the highest price. Whoa. Are you shocked yet? Can you believe it? Of course you can. This is exactly we knew back in 2015 when he descended the famous escalator and yet millions of people voted for him anyway. His character was not the point. The point of today's hearings not his character either, it was supposed to be Russian collusion and obstruction of justice. Those are the topics that have completely derailed the American government for the past two years. And on those subjects, we actually did learn quite a bit today. Here is one example. About a month ago, the cat blog, BuzzFeed ran an article that claimed Trump had ordered Michael Cohen to lie to the Congress. That is a big deal. It is a crime. And so immediately, the hysterics in the Congress and on cable news went bonkers -- impeachment, indictment, life in prison -- but did that actually happen? Well, since Cohen was there, in person, he was able to conclusively answer that question today and he did. Watch."

He now hates Donald Trump and would like to destroy him. He has said that again and again. If Michael Cohen had the dime, he would drop it. But he doesn't. There is nothing there. It was all a lie.

Anyone who knows him will affirm that. He is in his 50s now and he is headed to prison, and that is a long way from where he expected to be. Cohen showed up in Washington two years ago anticipating that he would be the kind of guy, the kind of mover and shaker who would welcome at any restaurant in town. Part the seas for Michael Cohen. Now, he is going to be eating sloppy joes off of a metal tray with a thousand other creeps in identical polyester uniform in the lock up. So take the politics out of it for a minute if you can. Let's be honest. This is a sad story. Michael Cohen is a broken and desperate man, but nobody cares. Democrats cheered for his conviction on ludicrous, absurd campaign finance charges, as if paying off somebody's girlfriend is a campaign finance violation. It is laughable, but they don't care. Now, they are squeezing whatever use they can out of Michael Cohen as he shuffles off to his cell. What do the rest of us get out of this? We learn that Trump is vain and vulgar, okay. What do we do with information? Is it supposed to make us support open borders? Late-term abortion? The war in Syria? The Green New Deal? Will it make the drug epidemic go away? Will it make the suicide rate drop? Will it make housing affordable in the cities? What does that have to do with anything? Well, it doesn't have anything to do with anything and that is the exactly the point of it. That is why this is going on forever. The more time they waste yelping about Trump's charity auction scam and his naughty language in private, the last time they have to explain why they have run this country into the ground and gotten rich doing it.

It seems like he would have every incentive since he dislikes Trump so much, he would admit if he knew that Trump had a love child, a drug addition, paid for an abortion, was colluding with the Russians, and that the tape that was real -- all of this stuff, and he said it wasn't.

I think, if America were to get what we deserve, we'd see John Lovett as Michael Cohen on \"Saturday Night Live.\" The President of the Pathological Liars Association of America, but of course, we are not going to get that. The Democrats in Hollywood want us to believe Michael Cohen, but I saw two or three times in this hearing where Michael Cohen couldn't resist lying again. I mean, for example, when he talked about how it was his idea that President Trump ran for President in 2011 for the 2012 cycle, that couldn't be further from the truth. There was a whole team put together by Roger Stone that was already in motion trying to get the President into the game when Michael Cohen came along and joined up with the team and started a group called, something like, \"Should Trump run?\" And the reason he was given leadership of the group is because he promised President Trump that he would raise $2 million to $3 million at the end of that whole flirtation with the campaign, Michael Cohen had raised $16,000.00. So the idea that it was idea for the President to run in 2012 is a lie. He lied right to the committee's face again, and of course, we had that whole thing with his foreign contracts and they are going to refer that for an investigation, and I think they should refer for an investigation his whole claim, this prideful claim it was his idea that the President run in 2012. It is preposterous."

And I think peppering your lies with the little dollop of truth is one of the best strategies of a pathological liar, right? So I think the Congress is going to have a tough time to figure out what Michael Cohen is -- what he is saying whether it is a lie or whether it is truthful, and the idea that he is their star witness is really hilarious. It's just John Lovett, and by the way, Tucker, John Lovett like him. He sounds like him. They have got to do it on Saturday night."

So that for example, the U.S. Attorney -- oh, I am sorry, the Special Counsel's office can get Roger Stone for being on speakerphone when anybody who knows Donald Trump and knows Roger Stone knows that would never happen.

Those were his words, you know, stemming from this hush money payment that Michael Cohen supposedly gave Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election and the way that Trump and his associates repaid that payment to Cohen may have constituted some financial fraud. I don't know if that is true, but at least that's a rational motive inquiry and it's sensible."

I don't know if you have been following the coverage on the other networks and in the other media outlets, but they have been so excited that they have been trembling with glee about this revelation from Cohen that he apparently overheard a conversation between Donald Trump and Roger Stone sometime in late July 2016, where Stone apparently confided that he had a phone conversation with Julian Assange. And there is no independent evidence for that whatsoever. Mueller as you know, just indicted Roger Stone last month on charges that relate to his claimed communications with WikiLeaks and Mueller who has access to all the pertinent phone records and every other record under the sun made no mention of this supposed phone call that transpired on this date, I think, Cohen said it was either July 18th or 19th, 2016. So either Mueller is a total failure in terms of his investigative prowess or there is something else going on. I don't have to tell you, Tucker, but I think Roger Stone has developed a reputation rightfully so as a bit of a fabulist and he has not always characterized his communications with WikiLeaks totally accurately, and I think that may have been the case here."

Our best inclination about the President's view of all of this was a statement from Senator Lindsey Graham in which he said he had a phone call with President Trump and he said he was kind of angry that there was this split screen of the Hanoi, you know North Korea-U.S. Summit and Michael Cohen's testimony. As you are getting ready to see the motorcade leave here, we are at the JW Marriott as well. The President will head down to the Metropole Hotel and have a one-on-one summit meeting bilateral with the North Korean leader and then there's a full day of events including a working lunch.

This is different than other summits where teams of diplomats go in and kind of iron out all of the details and minutia and then the principals come in and just sign the paper. This has to do with the one-on-one personalities of President Trump and Kim Jong-un about what Kim is going to agree to or not, and whether the U.S. is going to hold the line on denuclearization. Everything I'm hearing is, they want to define success as getting Kim to give up his nuclear weapons, to see the economic success of a place like here in Vietnam or Singapore, the site of the first summit."

As you see, the motorcade rolling here from the JW Marriott, \"The Beast\" there with the President inside and it's about a 15-minute drive across town. Security is really tight, but not for these guys. And then, failure looks like it just falls apart and the maximum pressure of sanctions comes back in play and neither party wants that. And I can tell you this, the people in Vietnam who I have talked to, the people in South Korea who we have been talking to, Greg Palkot out there, really want this to work. They want this piece to happen. It's just for the region."

And I think that is still a big point. But what the President has been doing in sort of foreshadowing on Twitter and all of his statements, he is talking about peace. And we have to think about this, how do we incent Kim Jong-un to give up his nuclear weapons? I think there's only one way to do that. It is to end the Korean War. I think what you are going to see today is both parties signing an end-of-war declaration that formally ends this. And I think what that will do is that will allow Donald Trump to say, \"Kim Jong-un, we are no longer enemies anymore. I'm not a threat. I am not going to invoke regime change on you. Now, you are able to release your nuclear weapons.\" At least, we will know at that point if Kim is actually serious about doing this, and I think that is what we are going to see.

I feel like we have a relationship. It changes the whole dynamic of this relationship. If there's not a war, Kim can actually go to his people and say, \"You know what?

So the Chinese are very worried that someday that there will be reunification. Let me tell you something, a reunified South Korea would have trillions of dollars of minerals. Seoul would actually have a very cheap and entrepreneurial labor force to actually rebuild. Seoul would be a power. They would be a powerhouse and China does not want that.

That is what the neoconservative say and I think that is garbage to be honest with you. Think about it, if we had a Cuban missile crisis and we were not able to talk to the Soviets and walked our way through that and have Ambassadors, we need to be able to talk to our adversaries. So I think that is important. I think what you're also going to see is the closure - full closure of the Yongbyon nuclear facility which is actually the flagship facility of North Korea's nuclear program. Some people have said it is older, it is breaking down, but it actually helps the North Korean build hydrogen bombs. So I think that is a key component and we are probably going to see a big announcement in terms of U.S. and North Korean teams actually going on the ground to battlefields where the Korean War happened and doing excavation work and working together. Those people to people ties, they are important."

There is no way that the United States or Donald Trump is going to be able to go back to the American public with all of this great news if the North Koreans aren't willing to change at least a little.

It is pushing for regime change, and I think that is appropriate. The problem in Venezuela is a completely failed state. It has an authoritarian dictator who has plunged the country into complete desperation and that's creating a very negative humanitarian situation. It is creating refugees who are fanning out all over South America, Latin America, and some of them are going to come here to the U.S. More refugees have applied for asylum in the U.S. than from any other country this year. It is a problem for America and it's a problem for this hemisphere. It's also a humanitarian -- it's also a human rights problem. Several people have been killed at the border just because other countries are trying to bring in food and aid. So this is something the U.S. has to be concerned about. Anytime a country completely becomes a failed state, it's a place where drugs can come through, it's a place that can support terrorism."

It's very famous here in Hanoi. They had talks there Day One, yesterday. Day Two now, we're expecting maybe even a poolside chat between these two leaders. Here is what is interesting - that nugget - the President's motorcade known as \"The Beast\" just arrived. You know that's about $1.5 million for the President of the United States limo because of all the security concerns. The tires -- everything is special, especially done by GM and Cadillac. But we did some digging. Kim Jong-un's limo, you've seen the pictures of the synchronized swimmers almost, the security cordon around him. It's a Mercedes Maybach that costs $1.6 million. Why is that significant? They manufacture cars in North Korea, a small number and you see that Mercedes Maybach there with the synchronized swimmers running around essentially. They manufacture cars in North Korea that are only worth about $10,000.00, okay? And the average annual income in North Korea is $1,300.00. It gives you some perspective, A, about why Kim Jong-un, as he enters these talks with President Trump may be a little nervous. He sleeps with one eye open about a not so tight grip on power because he has got people making $1,300.00 a year as an average annual income in his country. He's riding around in $1.6 million Mercedes Maybach and the other point is, that he a taste for capitalism. And you mentioned this a few moments ago with Bret. He wants the finer things in life. He wants to perhaps see some market reforms in North Korea and get a taste of what it is like for the wealthier folks here in Vietnam which once had an economy that was in the pits as well like North Korea now and would like to see it all open up. So this is the person that President Trump is sitting down with to try and forge peace, Tucker."

We are prepared to start a new history and we are ready to write a new chapter between our nations. As history has proven over and over again, adversaries can indeed become friends.

      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. A few hours ago when they first sat down and had some handshakes here in what was Day One, basically, President Trump was saying, we have got such a warm relationship. I think we've surprised the world with that, of course they have written lovey-dovey letters. At one point, President Trump, said on the campaign trail before the midterms that they fell in love. You are right. That sort of raises some eyebrows when you have the human rights record of Kim Jong-un. The hundred thousand people in North Korea, we should remember who are in the gulag system as we speak. On the other hand, if you are going to make peace, you've got to deal with some really bad actors on the world stage and that is the bargain this President is dealing with. And I want to point out something, Nicholas Kristof in \"The New York Times,\" one of the guys we were supposed to be told is so smart on foreign policy. In my research for this trip, April 20th, 2017, headlined, \"The North Korea-Trump Nightmare,\" and the lead says, \"President Trump is scary in many ways, but perhaps the most frightening nightmare is of him blundering us into a new Korean War.\" Tucker, that was April 2017. So my point is, all the \"smart people\" quote- unquote, on foreign policy have been wrong again and again about President Trump particularly his approach to North Korea. So to your point, it is not great when you have got to jump into bed with someone like Kim Jong-un, but if he comes out of this with some kind of measure of peace, I think a lot of quote-unquote \" smart people\" are going to be proven wrong."

They are a lot a lot of sort of weird expectations out there, a lot of people who have said and they said this when Kim went to Singapore, too, like, \"Oh, my God, he is going to see almost capitalism in Hanoi, and he is going to want this for his people.\" I really don't think that. He actually went to a fancy boarding school in Switzerland before when he was young. He has seen parts of the world. He knows his system doesn't deliver for his people. He doesn't actually care about that. I mean, he is at the end of the day, a dictator. Similarly, you are seeing expectations. People who are saying that Donald Trump has already lost. He has given up on total denuclearization and that he is going to just accept some peace deal for the appearance of it. Consider that as some big victory. I don't think that is realistic either. I think Donald Trump wants to win not in sort of a PR photo up sense, but in a real way. So I think some of the expectations are wrong, what they really they are going to probably do is try and work for incremental steps at disarmament including things like boring things -- inspections, discussions about plutonium 239 and uranium 235 and things like that."

Here is all of the nuclear waste,\" which is actually fuel that can be processed into warhead material and you can have all of that and send that to Oakridge, that is unlikely, but I think something that is a significant timeline. I mean, if Singapore was a meeting of the minds between Trump and Kim on the end-state, if this is the sequencing. They want goodies. They want sanctions relief and economic assistance which could come from South Korea. We want the nuclear material. It is the sequencing and the sort of those things can happen in parallel. And also, some process so that this can be decided below the leader level. If you talk to people on the U.S. team, they actually are in communication with the North Koreans. The North Koreans have been afraid to make decisions for good reason because if they make a mistake they, they could be executed."

I mean, these are young men who are like on the brink of starvation often. They have to pay for their own uniforms. This is not an army to march that is going to march into South Korea or that could actually defend North Korea from a conventional war. They have seen what our weapons can do in other places and I'm not trying to defend what they have done or the way they run the country, but yes, what is the difference between North Korea and another sort of poor dumpy dictatorship like Belarus? Well, it's their nuclear weapons. That's their one ship in the game and they are not going to give it away flippantly."

They know those nukes are never going to be used on China. You know, it's sort of like their eccentric little cousin that causes problems for their enemy, which is us. You know, a buffer. I think the Chinese know we are not going to invade Asia with the 28,000 guys we have in South Korea. You would have to add two zeros to that number to be a significant force to invade the Asian mainland. So I don't believe that they need North Korea as a buffer. I think they like it as a distraction. It distracts the world. It makes sort of North Korea enemy number one instead of China. Sometimes that backfires. If we move more capabilities to the Pacific because of North Korea, for example with the missile defense system we gave to South Korea last year. That pisses of China, but other than that, I think they sort of appreciate North Korea."

      "utterance": "Well, he was only of value for two reasons and could he have anything to say about Russia and collusion? And did he harm -- did he change our opinion of Donald Trump's method of operation? He didn't either. He has already lied about Russian collusion and the only other aspect was did he go to Prague or not and he obviously didn't. He had no reason to lie about that. So I think it is a 36-hour phenomenon and more importantly as you've heard from your guest, it was staged to take away attention from Korea in the short term and the long term, it's part of the Emolument Clause, the 25th Amendment, the suing of the voting machines, the in-palace McCabe coup designed to take Donald Trump's positives down to below 40%. I just say about the Korea, if I could. Why these talks have failed under Bush and Clinton and Obama were, we didn't think there was an existential threat yet; now, we know there is with the ability to hit a western city, so Trump is much more urgent and serious; and second, we have this crazy appeasing idea of China that they were on the trajectory to the family of nations. The more we appease them and the more rich they got, the more reasonable they are. Trump does not buy into that. So he is pressing China with tariffs and then finally, we always gave up on sanctions. We said, \"God, they are eating grass.\" Or we have to be careful about the innocent North Korean people. But they don't rate when you're considering losing Seattle or Portland. So I think Trump brilliantly put it in Vietnam and he is basically saying with that backdrop, this was an archenemy of the United States. It is communist. And it is doing much better than you are, and it's not very close with China and you don't have to be close with China and we are not going to invade it. And so the carrot is that we probably won't invade you and you can become a Vietnam and the stick is, do you really want to live in a neighborhood with a nuclear Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea because they may well go nuclear if you do. And then China is not the ascendant sun, it's a setting sun. And we are the ascendant power. And we are doing pretty well in missile defense, so even if you did weaponize these weapons in a way -- these ballistic missiles to hit us, we could knock them down. So it is a good carrot for you and it's a bad stick for you, and you can decide and we suggest you look at what is going on in Vietnam and that might be a model you'd like to consider. So I think it has done pretty well and I think Michael Cohen in comparison to all of that, it is just more of the cycle dramas that we hear every 48 hours about Donald Trump from the left."

      "utterance": "If Trump comes back from Hanoi with some sort of framework, some kind of deal that de-escalates for the near future of the relationship with North Korea, he will be the first President to have done that in 65 years. Will that, do you think be counted as a win for him? And I'm not whining about how they are being unfair to Trump, but it's a sincere question. I mean, do you think people will say, \"You know, I don't like the guy, but that's kind of impressive.\""

      "utterance": "I think it is. That's cumulative, Tucker. I think people admired him for getting out of the Paris Climate Accord, when you look back at it; moving the embassy to Jerusalem, defeating ISIS and almost annihilating ISIS. The Iran deal, I think even its sponsors realized it was flawed. I think even people realize now that NATO needed to pay more in their pledge to $100 million and so I think cumulative, people are saying, \"You know what, if you look at the entire Trump record especially under Secretary of State Pompeo, it is getting better and it's already good.\" So he will get credit for it. And in contrast, all the other stuff has failed. All of these melodramas whether it is McCabe or whether it is the 25th Amendment, they have gone nowhere. And they look smaller and smaller and Trump is looking bigger and bigger."

      "utterance": "Well, Tucker, both leaders now at the Metropole Hotel here in Hanoi and the bottom line is, in about five minutes, we expect them to sit down behind closed doors and then let reporters come in and take pictures. This will be another handshake as we saw in Day One. About 45 minutes after that, they are going to add more people like Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo. I think the key is at about 11:55 p.m. tonight, Eastern Time so about noon here local in Vietnam, we are expecting some sort of a working lunch. Another meal. Remember these two leaders with a large group of aides and advisers had a dinner last night that the President said was going to be relatively quick. Instead, it went about two hours or so. So that suggests maybe they were getting to know each other a little more and may be even getting some business done. The real key is that roughly in the middle of the night where you are, about 2:00 a.m. or so Eastern Time, we anticipate there could be some sort of a ceremony where they sign a document like they did in Singapore. The question of course is going to be, what will be on that document? Is it just -- you can see the President now and Chairman Kim meeting again, the key is going to be, do they sign an agreement that officially ends the Korean War? Do they do something deeper that does moves towards denuclearization with some specificity? Bottom line is, we are going to be alive all night, Tucker, starting 1:00 a.m. Eastern taking you through for a couple of hours through that signing ceremony and then of course, the President is doing an interview with Fox's Sean Hannity and we anticipate, depending on how it all goes, the President may also do a news conference with the International Press Corps. All of that live on the Fox News Channel all night long, Tucker."

So I can't speak necessarily for today, but I can tell you that this -- a little bit longer term and over a period of time, I know we are going to have fantastic success with respect to Chairman Kim and North Korea. They are going to have an economic powerhouse. I've been writing about it. I've been talking about it. I think it's going to be an economic powerhouse. And it is something I very much look forward to, helping with because with a little bit of help in the right location and the right place, I think it is going to be something very special. Please?"

I very much appreciate it. And Chairman Kim and I had a treat talk about that last night. I've let him say what he said if he would like to, and if doesn't, he doesn't have to. But we had a very good talk about that last night, and again, I am in no rush. We don't want the testing and we've developed something very special with respect to that, but I just want to say I have great respect for Chairman Kim and I have great respect for his country, and I believe that it will be something economically that will be almost hard to compete with for many countries, it has such potential.
