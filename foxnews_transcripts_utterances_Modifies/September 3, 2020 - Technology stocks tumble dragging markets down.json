The president getting ready to get off there. The President heading to Pennsylvania for a campaign event in Latrobe.  President Trump taking heat tonight though over a suggestion that voters who use mail-in ballots show up the polls on Election Day as well to make sure their vote is counted. Critics saying he was asking voters to vote twice in North Carolina. The White House is saying that wasn't the point at all.  The president also in another verbal war with New York Governor Andrew Cuomo over defunding violent cities. Cuomo in a very pointed interview is suggesting the president would not be safe in New York City.  Joe Biden left his home in Delaware today to travel to the current center of racial strife in the country Kenosha, Wisconsin on what the Biden campaign called a listening event. We have Fox team coverage tonight. Peter Doocy is in Wisconsin where Biden met with members of the community after meeting and talking to Jacob Blake and members of his family. We begin though with Chief White House correspondent John Roberts. Good evening, John.",

So I don't think that lands too hard. But where I think Kim is right is that the law and order message has some purpose. And not as much as the Trump campaign thinks it does, but the simple fact is that it was -- that Joe Biden was a little slow in anticipating that this was something that he would have to respond to. And I actually think his statements have been pretty good on this stuff. He's condemning violence. He is not using the language that the Trump campaign wants him to use, nor is Donald Trump using the language that the Biden campaign says he should use. And so I think ultimately where we are is this has been one of the most stable races in modern memory.

Then there's Tesla which a lot of people have been following stock went up about a thousand percent over the past year from one August to another. Those gains had only been accelerating in recent weeks but not today. Tesla down on the day by about nine percent. So, now, the hard part for investors, what comes next? Is this just a one day event or maybe the start of some sort of a rotation in the market away from those highflying technology stocks? Tomorrow morning, we do get a new report that's expected to show 1.4 million jobs were added around the country last month as the economy recovered from the virus lockdowns. The unemployment rate forecast to fall back in to the single digits at 9.8 percent. So that'll be one of the indicators investors will watch trying to determine the market's next move, Bret."

The report says, campaign materials from a candidate sat unprocessed for nearly a week before management discovered it. Fox 40 in Jackson, Mississippi, as the state commission selects the final design proposal to replace Mississippi's current flag. The legislature voted to retire the current flag earlier this summer because of its inclusion of the confederate battle emblem. Voters will decide in November whether to approve the new flag which features a magnolia blossoms surrounded by stars and the phrase, \"In God We Trust.\" And this is a live look at Indianapolis from Fox 59, our affiliate there.

So when you change strategy it means that you are worried in some way. Despite Joe Biden saying that he doesn't think that the president is making inroads on the law and order thing, the fact that he's out there doing it suggests that Democrats are worried. And we'll see where that goes, but I think it's something that he's going to have to address, because people keep watching TV, and there's no longer any more denying that this is becoming a huge problem in cities and suburban communities across the country."

What changed was political science as he knows he is in a serious decline in the polls. To top it off, people participating in his church meeting in Kenosha were handed scripts to read from during the public comment period, proving again that Biden's handlers don't trust him in uncontrolled situations. Nevertheless, Americans didn't hear any denunciation of Antifa or any other leftwing agitators who have rioted in American cities from coast to coast. He said nothing about Wisconsin Governor Evers' acceptance of federal assistance from President Trump to quell the riots, and did not explain that he opposed calling in the National Guard to protect Americans from violence leftwing rioters. Joe Biden made this aboveground excursion from his basement for purely political reasons and it shows.\" We thought we'd read both statements. Chuck, your thoughts. CHARLES LANE, OPINION WRITER, \"WASHINGTON POST\": That was certainly a political statement. The president -- not been emphatic in denouncing right-wing people as a way to kind of - extenuate -- But look, this is I think an effort by Joe Biden to get back -- which was as a peacemaker. Remember, the image he -- that time, Charlottesville, the terrible violence, he thought that was the worst it could be. It wasn't. That terrible conflict between right and left, where ultimately some of the people on the liberal side, one of them was killed by a rightwing person driving a car. And so, I think this is, in his view, the strength of his campaign. He is viewed as somebody who is more peaceful, more unifying, more stabilizing, at least that's how he got into this thing. I think this is him taking an opportunity to get back to the way he started it."

He's running for president in the United States. He is not going to travel anywhere that isn't for a political purpose right now. And neither, frankly, is Donald Trump. So I don't think that lands too hard. But where I think Kim is right is that the law and order message has some purpose. And not as much as the Trump campaign thinks it does, but the simple fact is that it was -- that Joe Biden was a little slow in anticipating that this was something that he would have to respond to. And I actually think his statements have been pretty good on this stuff. He's condemning violence. He is not using the language that the Trump campaign wants him to use, nor is Donald Trump using the language that the Biden campaign says he should use. And so I think ultimately where we are is this has been one of the most stable races in modern memory. Joe Biden's lead has been remarkably stable, Donald Trump's base has been remarkably stable, and I really think at this point the only thing that we can plan on really shaking the numbers in a significant way are the debates, because the conventions didn't do it."

That doesn't take into account the realities of the fact that the vaccines have already been through safety trials. You're looking at questions of efficacy at this point and how good they are. And is there political pressure to get this out? Yes, mostly because they are still dealing with a pandemic and it's having a terrible consequence on the economic and personal lives of millions of Americans. Would it be politically good for the White House to also have it out sooner rather than later? Yes.

      "utterance": "It's no coincidence this is coming up at a hair salon, which actually have been, of all the small businesses in America, the hardest hit by this. If you remember there was a big controversy over this in Texas not long ago, a woman who insisted on opening her salon and was, I believe, prosecuted or fined for that. It's a sensitive issue. And I think that Nancy Pelosi should probably take a slightly different tone. She is being extremely indignant and defiant. Maybe she ought to show a little love to the hair salons and express some concern about their predicament. I don't think she was set up. On the other hand, I also don't think she went in there knowing that she was doing something wrong. It's just one of those incredible things."

      "utterance": "His name was Tom Seaver, but he was known as Tom Terrific. Seaver personified the nickname, winning three Cy Young awards, amassing 3,600 strike outs, and 311 wins. When Seaver pitched, he famously dragged his right knee across the mound. Opposing teams know dirt on Seaver's knee meant trouble. Catcher Johnny Bench said that Seaver could outthink headers."

      "speaker": "PERGRAM",
      "utterance": "The Mets fell short that year. Seaver soon feuded with Mets management, and New York sports writer Dick Young, over pay. The Mets unloaded Seaver in 1977 to the Big Red Machine, the reigning world Champions. Seaver entered the Hall of Fame in 1992 with a near unanimous vote, outpacing legends like Ty Cobb and Hank Aaron. In retirement, Seaver ran a vineyard in Napa, an emblem of a stitched baseball emblazoned on the bottle corks. He left public life last year suffering from dementia. A fierce competitor, Seaver once said there are two places in this league, first place and no place. Tom Seaver was 75."
