In reality, nothing could be further from the truth.  Now just take a look at his handling of COVID-19. On the campaign trail, Joe promised to, quote, shut down the virus, not the country. Really? But tonight, more Americans -- we can report -- sadly have died from COVID-19 under Joe Biden's watch in 2021 than under Donald Trump in 2020. And by the way, another variant is on the way. Now, this despite Joe inheriting not one, not two, but three vaccines. Therapeutics like monoclonal antibody treatments that he's only mentioned one time. He got that from the Trump administration, Operation Warp Speed.  And now, more than 350,000 Americans have died from the virus since Joe's Inauguration Day.   Now, according to Biden himself Circa 2020, he based on his own definition should now resign in a complete disgrace. This is what Joe said.",

And by the way, per usual, he was lying for political gain. Of course, he spent most of the campaign hiding in his basement bunker in the candidate protection program. And just like his racially charged lies about President Trump's travel ban, well, get this, he called Trump's initial travel ban 10 days after the first identified case of coronavirus in America, it was hysteria, xenophobia, fear-mongering. He tweeted that banning travel from any other part of the world will not stop COVID-19.  And in response to the former president's temporary ban on certain African countries, Biden released this statement. He said Trump further diminished the U.S. in the eyes of the world by expanding his travel ban, this new African ban is designed to make it harder for black and brown people to immigrate to the United States. It's a disgrace we cannot let him succeed.   Well, guess who just implemented a brand new African ban? Joe Biden. That's right, Joe just banned travel from multiple African countries over fears surrounding what is the new Omicron variant. So, is Joe Biden lying and playing the race card for political gain, or is he a hysterical, xenophobic, fear-mongering racist disgrace of a human being? It's either one or the other, Joe.  Now, tonight, Biden's dishonesty, his hypocrisy, it doesn't end there. Frankly, Joe and Fauci's face masquerade is hard to track. First, it was -- masks don't work, maybe it'll stop one little droplet. Then it was one mask, then two masks, then it was masks indoors but not outdoors. Then it was vax or mask. Then it was vax and mask. Now, it's vax mask and booster and probably booster, booster, booster after. First, we will never ever mandate, no. Now, the mandates.  And breaking earlier, a federal judge blocked Biden's vaccine mandates in the first 10 states to sue his administration. That's another loss in the courts for Joe Biden.  Today, more mixed messages from Biden implored all Americans to wear a mask indoors and then he sauntered right back into the West Wing mask-free. You can't make this up. Take a look.",

Now, tonight, maybe we should cut Joe a break. After all, he's really struggling with his memory. By all accounts, Joe Biden is a complete cognitive mess.

Now, following that disastrous presser, the administration abruptly canceled Biden's supply chain speech that was scheduled for later in the day. Now, it was more than I guess Joe could handle. He obviously needed nappy time. Now, tonight, Americans are struggling with so many major crises all preventable and all created by that guy, Joe Biden.   Now, we have a new COVID variant. It's likely on the way. According to top health officials though in South Africa, those infected with the Omicron variant at this time -- I hope it stays this way -- they're reporting that they are experiencing mild symptoms, but we will see what happens.  Remember, this is the latest of many variants thus far, the lambda variant, the Mu variant, the R.1 variant. As always, I encourage all of you to take this virus seriously. Consult with your doctor, do your own research. Some research you agree with and disagree with. And while we don't know exactly how the Omicron variant will play out in the U.S., we do know that Joe Biden is not fit to serve. He will only make things worse, not better, and the American people -- they are speaking out loudly. They agree.   According to a new Rasmussen poll, Donald Trump has a massive double-digit lead over Joe Biden in a 2024 head-to-head matchup. Thankfully, the 2022 midterm elections are just around the corner, because the Democrats one party rule in D.C. is literally a wrecking ball to this country. No other way to describe it.

And their policies are so bad that it's almost inconceivable that they can turn this around right now.  I mean, the fact is that big government socialism doesn't work. You see it every day on the border. You see it every day and inflation. You see it every day in energy policy.  As you pointed out earlier, Afghanistan remains I think one of the most embarrassing moments in American international history. I never thought I'd see an American government abandon American citizens the way the Biden administration has.  So I think this is going to continue to get worse. The most amazing thing to me as a former speaker of the House is that Nancy Pelosi, with a very tiny majority, is getting his people to walk off the cliff week after week. Rasmussen just reported that almost every single item you test inside this Build Back Better bill, with multitrillion dollar bill, that the Wharton School says is about a $4.7 trillion bill if you were honest about it. The American public, when they learn the details, on almost every front, they're opposed to it. And yet she gets these Democrats to walk straight off the cliff.  It's an amazing performance. It's bad for the country. It will be extraordinarily disastrous for the Democrats. And I think you're going to have the next speaker of the House on in just a few minutes in Kevin McCarthy, partly because he's doing a great job and partly because he is faced with a catastrophe on the other side. I will say, by the way, I prefer Biden sleeping in an international conference to Kamala Harris laughing.

He flat-out lied about the origins of COVID-19. We have the evidence of proof, his involvement and gain-of-function research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology is now well-chronicled.

I don't think anyone has hurt science, has hurt the credibility of the CDC, has hurt the credibility of doctors more than Dr. Fauci because throughout this pandemic, he's been dishonest, he's been political, he's been partisan. And the American people know it. Why is it that the Biden administration decreed that masks have to be worn in schools by kids? Well, because teachers unions bosses wanted it. And that's not a scientific reason, that is a data reason. And, you know, this weekend he did this long interview where he gave the answer. He said, I represent science. I am science. I got to admit, Sean, I was laughing. It's like Louis XIV, the son king in France saying, \"L'Etat c'est a moi\", I am the state. It is this delusion of grandeur that you cannot criticize him. And it was very striking. You know, in the course of that interview, he was asked about I asked the Attorney General Merrick Garland if he's going to investigate and prosecute Dr. Fauci for lying to Congress, and Margaret Brennan asked him about that.  And what did Fauci do? He didn't discuss any of the substance. Instead, he just attacked and engaged in ad hominem attacks. He basically did the Beavis and Butthead defense, he just screamed liars at everything. But you know, facts are stubborn things, Sean. And so here are the simple facts that Fauci needs to explain and the Department of Justice should investigate. So, on May 11th, Fauci testified before a Senate committee that, quote, the NIH has not ever and does not now fund gain of function research in the Wuhan Institute of Virology. That's a clear categorical statement. But then on October 20th, the NIH wrote that they funded an experiment at the Wuhan lab testing, quote, if spike proteins from naturally occurring bat coronaviruses circulating in China were capable of binding to the human ACE2 receptor in a mouse model. That is gain of function research. That is taking an existing virus and modifying it to make it more dangerous to humans. And listen, at the end of the day, 18 USC Section 1001 makes it a felony, punishable by up to five years in prison for lying to Congress. The statements from Dr. Fauci and the NIH are directly contradictory. And I got to say, I think Margaret Brennan is a talented journalist, but she dropped the ball and not following up letting him just respond with insults instead of asking the simple question. You stated that we don't fund gain of function research. The NIH stated we do fund gain of function research. They can't both be true and if you lied to Congress, it's a felony. She didn't press him on that. And the reason this matters is, is there is a lot of circumstantial evidence to suggest that the U.S. government participated in funding research, modifying coronaviruses that could well have led to COVID-19. And if that's true, that is stunning and indefensible. We know the Chinese government has enormous culpability, but there's a real possibility the American government under Dr. Fauci does as well, and that's what he doesn't want to address.",

As recounted by former Hunter Biden business partner Tony Bobulinski, Biden was deeply aware of his son's dealings. He met twice with Tony on this specific deal. For example, a May 2017 text message from a business associate reads, quote, 10 held by H for the big guy. The big guy, according to Miranda's explosive reporting in \"The Laptop from Hell,\" that would be Joe Biden. And that's not all. The book reveals that the Chinese titan CEFC lavished Hunter with a three-carat gem and a lucrative eight-figure joint venture offer despite Hunter once again with no experience or qualifications that we can find at all. And as per usual, it makes portraits of a crack addict sale seem like pennies on the dollar. Of course, the Hunter Biden laptop scandal is also a media scandal. As the mob in the media teamed up with big tech, they censored \"The New York Post's\" incredible reporting. \"The New York Post\" was right, now proven right, and by the way spew lies about Russian disinformation. They all protected Biden. And now, we reached out to the White House and Hunter Biden's attorney for comment, they have yet to get back to us. Here to explain, author of what is destined to be a number one \"New York Times\" bestseller, \"Laptop from Hell\" -- finally, Miranda, it is out -- FOX News contributor, \"New York Post\" columnist Miranda Devine. Let's talk about this Chinese energy conglomerate, CEFC, it's a lot of money, and Joe Biden met twice with Tony Bobulinski. And that money specifically was earmarked for him.",

It was an arm of the Chinese government. And so this -- during the two years, last two years that Joe Biden was vice president, Hunter Biden and his partners were doing work for CEFC as part of this joint venture and Hunter expected them to pay him $20 million for the work that his family had done while Joe Biden was vice president. And then after Joe Biden stepped down as vice president, he was going into formally business with CEFC in America, Hunter Biden had the office all set up with the nameplate for Joe Biden and Jill Biden and him to share this office with their Chinese partner. And you know, Joe Biden has said repeatedly that he knew nothing about Hunter Biden's business. You just played some of those quotes from him. And this was something he maintained as the gospel truth. And yet there is so much evidence on the laptop which is as much about Joe Biden and his being implied and implicated very deeply in the Biden family influence peddling operations, Joe Biden met with Hunter's business partners from Mexico, from Ukraine, from Russia, from China, from Kazakhstan. He met them in Beijing. He met them at his home, at the vice presidential home. He met them at Cafe Milano in a private room in Washington, D.C. while he was vice president.

I mean, he was right in there, in Moscow, meeting with the very inner sanctum of Vladimir Putin. He was in China, in Shanghai, in Beijing, meeting with the upper echelons of the Chinese communist party. He was doing business with them. These people were his partners. They were lavishing him with money. They were supplying him with prostitutes and he was off his head most of the time. Now, a lot of these trips he had secret service protection. But at one point, he did wave it away and he was getting protection from bodyguards from the corrupt Ukrainian energy company, Burisma, for instance when he was in Monte Carlo at one point, at a Burisma meeting, and he met with Tony Bobulinski. He told Bobulinski that he would jump out the window of his luxury apartment there in Monte Carlo and meet him because he wanted to shake off the bodyguards. So -- but I also think that -- you know, when things went wrong, suddenly miraculously out of the woodwork would appear former Secret Service agents. And there are times that he recounts -- for instance, he almost drowned in a bathtub in a luxury penthouse, in Vegas one time. He sort of came to face down in the swimming pool, and there were some Russian drug dealers who were stealing his property and he lost a laptop at that time. But he always seemed to come through the very close calls with flying colors. And again we see that even though there are various, you know, I guess police investigation or criminal investigation, into his text affairs and other issues.

And by the way, per usual, he was lying for political gain. Of course, he spent most of the campaign hiding in his basement bunker in the candidate protection program. And just like his racially charged lies about President Trump's travel ban, well, get this, he called Trump's initial travel ban 10 days after the first identified case of coronavirus in America, it was hysteria, xenophobia, fear-mongering. He tweeted that banning travel from any other part of the world will not stop COVID-19. And in response to the former president's temporary ban on certain African countries, Biden released this statement. He said Trump further diminished the U.S. in the eyes of the world by expanding his travel ban, this new African ban is designed to make it harder for black and brown people to immigrate to the United States. It's a disgrace we cannot let him succeed. Well, guess who just implemented a brand new African ban? Joe Biden. That's right, Joe just banned travel from multiple African countries over fears surrounding what is the new Omicron variant. So, is Joe Biden lying and playing the race card for political gain, or is he a hysterical, xenophobic, fear-mongering racist disgrace of a human being? It's either one or the other, Joe. Now, tonight, Biden's dishonesty, his hypocrisy, it doesn't end there. Frankly, Joe and Fauci's face masquerade is hard to track. First, it was -- masks don't work, maybe it'll stop one little droplet. Then it was one mask, then two masks, then it was masks indoors but not outdoors. Then it was vax or mask. Then it was vax and mask. Now, it's vax mask and booster and probably booster, booster, booster after. First, we will never ever mandate, no. Now, the mandates. And breaking earlier, a federal judge blocked Biden's vaccine mandates in the first 10 states to sue his administration. That's another loss in the courts for Joe Biden. Today, more mixed messages from Biden implored all Americans to wear a mask indoors and then he sauntered right back into the West Wing mask-free. You can't make this up. Take a look."

So I wonder if Joe is going to be cited for breaking Nantucket's masked mandate or, of course, he's a Democrat. The rules shouldn't apply to him, right? Now, tonight, maybe we should cut Joe a break. After all, he's really struggling with his memory. By all accounts, Joe Biden is a complete cognitive mess. There's no more ambiguity, there's no more debate.

It is humiliating for the entire country, and frankly, it is also now extremely dangerous as every one of our enemies, every hostile regime on this planet earth, they see this as well. Now, following that disastrous presser, the administration abruptly canceled Biden's supply chain speech that was scheduled for later in the day. Now, it was more than I guess Joe could handle. He obviously needed nappy time. Now, tonight, Americans are struggling with so many major crises all preventable and all created by that guy, Joe Biden. Now, we have a new COVID variant. It's likely on the way. According to top health officials though in South Africa, those infected with the Omicron variant at this time -- I hope it stays this way -- they're reporting that they are experiencing mild symptoms, but we will see what happens. Remember, this is the latest of many variants thus far, the lambda variant, the Mu variant, the R.1 variant. As always, I encourage all of you to take this virus seriously. Consult with your doctor, do your own research. Some research you agree with and disagree with. And while we don't know exactly how the Omicron variant will play out in the U.S., we do know that Joe Biden is not fit to serve. He will only make things worse, not better, and the American people -- they are speaking out loudly. They agree. According to a new Rasmussen poll, Donald Trump has a massive double-digit lead over Joe Biden in a 2024 head-to-head matchup. Thankfully, the 2022 midterm elections are just around the corner, because the Democrats one party rule in D.C. is literally a wrecking ball to this country. No other way to describe it.

You see it every day on the border. You see it every day and inflation. You see it every day in energy policy. As you pointed out earlier, Afghanistan remains I think one of the most embarrassing moments in American international history. I never thought I'd see an American government abandon American citizens the way the Biden administration has. So I think this is going to continue to get worse. The most amazing thing to me as a former speaker of the House is that Nancy Pelosi, with a very tiny majority, is getting his people to walk off the cliff week after week. Rasmussen just reported that almost every single item you test inside this Build Back Better bill, with multitrillion dollar bill, that the Wharton School says is about a $4.7 trillion bill if you were honest about it. The American public, when they learn the details, on almost every front, they're opposed to it. And yet she gets these Democrats to walk straight off the cliff. It's an amazing performance. It's bad for the country. It will be extraordinarily disastrous for the Democrats. And I think you're going to have the next speaker of the House on in just a few minutes in Kevin McCarthy, partly because he's doing a great job and partly because he is faced with a catastrophe on the other side. I will say, by the way, I prefer Biden sleeping in an international conference to Kamala Harris laughing.

One reason for the Adam Schiff show as I call it, Joe Biden does whatever Dr. Anthony Fauci tells him to do. Sadly, Fauci, we now know is dishonest, corrupt, self-interested, a government doctor, god complex, cares more about his own personal fame and celebrity status in Democratic circles than he does in protecting the country. In order to get airtime on TV, he frequently just makes things up. He guesses, he jumps to conclusions, he has been wrong on almost every single major issue in this pandemic from day one. He flat-out lied about the origins of COVID-19. We have the evidence of proof, his involvement and gain-of-function research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology is now well-chronicled.

      "utterance": "Well, I've got to say -- you know, Dr. Fauci, I think, is the most dangerous bureaucrat in the history of the country. You know, he talks a moment ago, you just played about hurting science. I don't think anyone has hurt science, has hurt the credibility of the CDC, has hurt the credibility of doctors more than Dr. Fauci because throughout this pandemic, he's been dishonest, he's been political, he's been partisan. And the American people know it. Why is it that the Biden administration decreed that masks have to be worn in schools by kids? Well, because teachers unions bosses wanted it. And that's not a scientific reason, that is a data reason. And, you know, this weekend he did this long interview where he gave the answer. He said, I represent science. I am science. I got to admit, Sean, I was laughing. It's like Louis XIV, the son king in France saying, \"L'Etat c'est a moi\", I am the state. It is this delusion of grandeur that you cannot criticize him. And it was very striking. You know, in the course of that interview, he was asked about I asked the Attorney General Merrick Garland if he's going to investigate and prosecute Dr. Fauci for lying to Congress, and Margaret Brennan asked him about that. And what did Fauci do? He didn't discuss any of the substance. Instead, he just attacked and engaged in ad hominem attacks. He basically did the Beavis and Butthead defense, he just screamed liars at everything. But you know, facts are stubborn things, Sean. And so here are the simple facts that Fauci needs to explain and the Department of Justice should investigate. So, on May 11th, Fauci testified before a Senate committee that, quote, the NIH has not ever and does not now fund gain of function research in the Wuhan Institute of Virology. That's a clear categorical statement. But then on October 20th, the NIH wrote that they funded an experiment at the Wuhan lab testing, quote, if spike proteins from naturally occurring bat coronaviruses circulating in China were capable of binding to the human ACE2 receptor in a mouse model. That is gain of function research. That is taking an existing virus and modifying it to make it more dangerous to humans. And listen, at the end of the day, 18 USC Section 1001 makes it a felony, punishable by up to five years in prison for lying to Congress. The statements from Dr. Fauci and the NIH are directly contradictory. And I got to say, I think Margaret Brennan is a talented journalist, but she dropped the ball and not following up letting him just respond with insults instead of asking the simple question. You stated that we don't fund gain of function research. The NIH stated we do fund gain of function research. They can't both be true and if you lied to Congress, it's a felony. She didn't press him on that. And the reason this matters is, is there is a lot of circumstantial evidence to suggest that the U.S. government participated in funding research, modifying coronaviruses that could well have led to COVID-19. And if that's true, that is stunning and indefensible. We know the Chinese government has enormous culpability, but there's a real possibility the American government under Dr. Fauci does as well, and that's what he doesn't want to address."

The big guy, according to Miranda's explosive reporting in \"The Laptop from Hell,\" that would be Joe Biden. And that's not all.

They all protected Biden. And now, we reached out to the White House and Hunter Biden's attorney for comment, they have yet to get back to us. Here to explain, author of what is destined to be a number one \"New York Times\" bestseller, \"Laptop from Hell\" -- finally, Miranda, it is out -- FOX News contributor, \"New York Post\" columnist Miranda Devine. Let's talk about this Chinese energy conglomerate, CEFC, it's a lot of money, and Joe Biden met twice with Tony Bobulinski. And that money specifically was earmarked for him."

      "utterance": "That's right. And not only that, after meeting with Tony Bobulinski, Hunter Biden then met with the sort of director of CEFC, which was not just a giant Chinese energy conglomerate, it was the capitalist arm of President Xi Jinping's Belt and Road Initiative. It was an arm of the Chinese government. And so this -- during the two years, last two years that Joe Biden was vice president, Hunter Biden and his partners were doing work for CEFC as part of this joint venture and Hunter expected them to pay him $20 million for the work that his family had done while Joe Biden was vice president. And then after Joe Biden stepped down as vice president, he was going into formally business with CEFC in America, Hunter Biden had the office all set up with the nameplate for Joe Biden and Jill Biden and him to share this office with their Chinese partner. And you know, Joe Biden has said repeatedly that he knew nothing about Hunter Biden's business. You just played some of those quotes from him. And this was something he maintained as the gospel truth. And yet there is so much evidence on the laptop which is as much about Joe Biden and his being implied and implicated very deeply in the Biden family influence peddling operations, Joe Biden met with Hunter's business partners from Mexico, from Ukraine, from Russia, from China, from Kazakhstan. He met them in Beijing. He met them at his home, at the vice presidential home. He met them at Cafe Milano in a private room in Washington, D.C. while he was vice president. So the idea that he didn't know anything about under Biden's business dealings is just so farcical when you know what's on the laptop."

      "utterance": "Let's talk more about what specifically is on the laptop. We know how the Libyans knew about his personal life, his drug use, frequently using prostitutes -- we know they knew. We know that they characterized as such as he was working out a deal -- trying to work out a deal at the time. So, I've got to assume that Russia, China, Kazakhstan, Ukraine -- they all have a dossier, if you will, on Hunter Biden. We have talked long before the release of this book about things that are on this laptop that are devastating to Hunter Biden. What can you tell us specifically and why has he been so far able to prevent being arrested?"

      "speaker": "DEVINE",
      "utterance": "Look, I think that when you look at the totality of his life as I've charted it through the nine use laptop covers, he had so many close calls. He even mentions this in his own memoir. You know, he was a crack addict. He surrounded himself with pretty dangerous people. He was swimming in the oligarchy. I mean, he was right in there, in Moscow, meeting with the very inner sanctum of Vladimir Putin. He was in China, in Shanghai, in Beijing, meeting with the upper echelons of the Chinese communist party. He was doing business with them. These people were his partners. They were lavishing him with money. They were supplying him with prostitutes and he was off his head most of the time. Now, a lot of these trips he had secret service protection. But at one point, he did wave it away and he was getting protection from bodyguards from the corrupt Ukrainian energy company, Burisma, for instance when he was in Monte Carlo at one point, at a Burisma meeting, and he met with Tony Bobulinski. He told Bobulinski that he would jump out the window of his luxury apartment there in Monte Carlo and meet him because he wanted to shake off the bodyguards. So -- but I also think that -- you know, when things went wrong, suddenly miraculously out of the woodwork would appear former Secret Service agents. And there are times that he recounts -- for instance, he almost drowned in a bathtub in a luxury penthouse, in Vegas one time. He sort of came to face down in the swimming pool, and there were some Russian drug dealers who were stealing his property and he lost a laptop at that time. But he always seemed to come through the very close calls with flying colors. And again we see that even though there are various, you know, I guess police investigation or criminal investigation, into his text affairs and other issues. You know, whether or not anything will come from that, who knows? Because Hunter Biden seems to have nine lives."

      "utterance": "Let's talk about hostile regimes. You know, if somebody with the last name Trump would use crack cocaine, you know, hired all these hookers, dumped a gun in a dumpster, had some of the images that are on that laptop, can you talk about those? I would imagine these hostile regimes, Joe Biden doesn't seem to mind that Vladimir Putin is building up an army on the Ukraine border, says nothing, or that Taiwan and reunification talk with China, or flying fighter jets over Taiwan airspace. Do you believe he's compromised and what else is on there that the American people need to know in terms of Hunter?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DEVINE",
      "utterance": "Look, Joe Biden definitely is compromised because of his family. I mean, it wasn't just Hunter Biden but it was Joe Biden who was involved in these deals with CEFC, as I say again, you can't say it too many times. This is the capitalist arm of President Xi's Belt and Road Initiative. So, you know, this was the Biden family was involved in this. And as for the images on the laptop, they are very disturbing. There is a lot of pornography, most of it sort of homemade porn by Hunter Biden. He had an obsession with his own naked body and would take lots of photographs of himself, and also he photographs of himself having sex with various women and he would upload that on to PornHub and so on. It is very disturbing. I'm not sure that that really though is the criminal element that we're talking about. I think there are there are elements on the laptop that are very damaging to America's national security, and that's really where I think the focus should stay."

And, Sean, you were such an instrumental force in making that happen. And so, I'm so glad that in this book, we'll be able to tell that story, and also the story of how you stood with us, all of us at the EIB staff during this last year when Rush was with us and how much that meant to all of us, Sean."

And we all have to up our game because that's what he would want. Actually, to give all credit, it was Matt Drudge's idea. I just passed it up the chain and it was immediately received with a yes. And like you, I'm grateful that he got that award. But I'm also, you know, appreciated that he forged this path for all of us, James. I mean -- every single one of us that that are conservatives and have a voice, he helped forge that path."

      "speaker": "GOLDEN",
      "utterance": "Yes, he did. His footprint was so much larger than radio, Sea, and the footprint and radio would be enough for some people to say they've had the most incredible career ever. But his footprint was larger than that. Rush transformed American media. And at the same time, his generosity and what he did, what your audience did, what our audience did in raising money for leukemia, what he and Catherine did for the first the families of fallen first responders -- those are the kind of things that live on and they're not political. They affect every American life for the better. And so, the legacy that Russia has is just so huge, the story can only be told a little bit because, there's always going to be more coming out about the incredible career and the incredible man that this Rush Limbaugh was."
