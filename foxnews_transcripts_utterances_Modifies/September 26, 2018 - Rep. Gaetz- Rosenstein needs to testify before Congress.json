So, what will happen tomorrow with the president? Does he fire him? Does maybe Rod Rosenstein quit? We simply have no way of gauging this.  Let's get the read from House Judiciary Committee member Matt Gaetz, who says that the guy should resign, but for other reasons.  You have a host of reasons, right, Congressman? Explain.",

You don't make jokes about destabilizing the presidency in front of your colleagues and your subordinates and in an administration where there seems to be a culture in some places to resist the president, resist the commander in chief.  It seems as though that this is the type of contribution to that ecosystem that is very unhelpful.
