Breaking tonight, a bombshell new report raising concerns that the Obama administration \"miscalculated the Russia threat\", allowing Putin to launch years of attacks against the United States tampering with everything from our economy to our election. And ultimately, leaving Americans vulnerable even at this very moment. Good evening, I'm Trish Regan in for Martha MacCallum. The explosive report from The Washington Post best summed up by its title: \"Kremlin trolls burned across the internet as Washington debated option.\" It describes Obama administration failing to take action until it was \"too late\". That makes sense when you look back at what President Obama said during a 2012 debate. Watch.  BARACK OBAMA, 44TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: When you were asked what's the biggest geopolitical threat facing America, you said Russia. Not Al Qaeda. You said Russia. And the 1980s are now calling to ask for their foreign policy back.",

The old narrative about Russia, Russia, Russia has centered on the assumption that President Trump and his advisers had been too supplicant to Russian President Vladimir Putin and his government dating back to the last campaign. This Washington Post report is suggesting that during the administration of President Barack Obama, Russian aggression and provocations went unchecked for years. All of it spilled out in an FBI counterintelligence probe dubbed northern night. The documents examples of those provocations by Moscow that were ignored by Washington.  The paper declaring: \"U.S. Intelligence and law enforcement agencies saw some warning signs of Russian meddling in Europe and later in the U.S., but never fully grasped the breadth of the Kremlin's ambitions. Top policymakers did not appreciate the dangers, then scrambled to draw up options to fight back.\" Who can forget early in the Obama years, new Secretary of State Hillary Clinton literally pushing the reset button, hoping for warmer relations with Russia? And much later in the second term, National Security Adviser Susan Rice actually tried to justify why the Obama team was trying to walk a fine line with Vladimir Putin by not pushing back too hard.",

And most notably, the White House just approved a plan to provide lethal weapons to Ukraine to help them deal with Russian-backed separatist -- something the Obama administration never did despite desperate pleas from the Ukrainians.

Bush, could maybe open up warmer relations with Putin. And a lot of people said that might be a good idea. The Obama administration, and I said with the reset button, they tried to do that too. What's different now, is the Trump administration has talked about look, we can have warmer relations with Russia that can help with us Syria and North Korea. And people have said no, this is about collusion; you shouldn't have warmer relations with them.

But what troubles me is that during the Obama administration, while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state, decisions about Russia, including Uranium One and the passage of that deal, they were made despite, I think what were very real concerns about Putin's territorial ambitions and the reality that Ukraine was going to be facing sooner or later.

It was always going to be in the cards. And somehow or another, the Obama administration took their eye off the ball.

So, I'm quite sure that Ambassador McFall, you know, sent up flairs time and again, and, of course, our national security apparatus was aware that they were tinkering and poking in a lot of our computer systems. And we all have known for many years that some of the best or worst in this case -- you know, Internet scammers in the world are in Russia, especially hackers and the like. So, the signs have always been there. I think it's quite true that Obama and his administration didn't follow through, perhaps, on a lot of this online activity, these online active measures of the Kremlin. And the commentary in 2012 about we saw it on the tape earlier, about how Romney was insulted about saying Russia went on the top of his list of national security concerns, it really came back into play again just after the Ukrainian invasion. And unfortunately, it doesn't appear that we really kept up -- in July of 2016, when the hack of the DNC e-mails came out, I set off the alarm then that this was most likely Russia.

Investment gets taxed at a lower rate and it should, absolutely should. I don't begrudge anyone that and I don't begrudge the industry that. But income is income and you can't, or at least you shouldn't be treating it otherwise. Steve Schwartzman, CEO of the world's largest private equity firm has given more than $3 million to a Mitch McConnell linked super PAC.

Now, the good news is we have found a way for the president to still fix this and to save American taxpayers $180 billion enough to -- hey, pay for the wall, maybe a couple of walls. Maybe reduce our deficit. And the president, he will not need the swamp to do it, to heck with congress. In a new op-ed for the hill, my next guest argues, quote, Mr. President, close the carried interest loophole. Ned Ryun, CEO of American majority joins me now. Ned, it's good to see you. You've been talking about this a lot lately, often with me on the Fox Business Network. But, let's back up for a second because I want people to understand what they're actually doing.

Well, I'll tell you what the American people care about, they care about fairness. This is fundamentally unfair. And I would argue the carried interest loophole is immoral. This guys -- this carve out has given the private equity and even real estate investors billions a year, and as you said, maybe up to 18 billion a year. And what they've been able to do is essentially by the silence of congress, you look at the open secrets from 2016 election cycle, they gave 21 million to 381 members of congress.

You think about Condoleezza Rice, for example, and her background in Russian studies. And Russia was certainly front and center on everyone's mind and people seemed, at least to me at that time, to be a little bit more aware of Vladimir Putin and the threat he might have represented."

      "utterance": "You're right. They were weary then at the end of the Bush administration, weary at the beginning of the Obama administration. But I think what binds it together is that when you talk about that Lobster Summit, that was the first President Bush bringing Vladimir Putin to his estate at Kennebunkport for the lobster so that his son, George W. Bush, could maybe open up warmer relations with Putin. And a lot of people said that might be a good idea. The Obama administration, and I said with the reset button, they tried to do that too. What's different now, is the Trump administration has talked about look, we can have warmer relations with Russia that can help with us Syria and North Korea. And people have said no, this is about collusion; you shouldn't have warmer relations with them. And I think that's why there are some frustrations in the White House with no evidence, at least not yet of collusion to say, wait, the last two administrations tried to have warmer relations, what's wrong with that?"

Here right now with more, Michael Caputo, former Trump campaign senior adviser; and Michael Starr Hopkins, Democratic strategist who served on President Obama and Hillary Clinton's presidential campaigns. Good to see you both. I'll start with you, Mr. Caputo. You know, it seems as though, as Ed points out, that various administrations have tried to reset, if you would, with Russia. But what troubles me is that during the Obama administration, while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state, decisions about Russia, including Uranium One and the passage of that deal, they were made despite, I think what were very real concerns about Putin's territorial ambitions and the reality that Ukraine was going to be facing sooner or later. How come?"

      "utterance": "Well, when I lived in Russia, in the 1990s, it was in, I guess, 1995 when the Russians were kind of forced to sign a treaty where they gave up Crimea. I remember liberals, communist, conservatives, every politician in Russia said to each other that they were someday going to have Crimea back. That was always going to be -- was going to happen. It was always going to be in the cards. And somehow or another, the Obama administration took their eye off the ball. And it was during their siege of Ukraine that they really honed their skills in its online warfare with Twitter and Facebook and all the other online tools they have, and they've turned those tools on us."

I will say, however, the Obama administration put harsh sanctions on the Russian economy. And then, Jeh Johnson, during the 2016 election attempted to have our election system determined as critical infrastructure so that then it would be federally taken on instead of having states deal with it. And that was something Mitch McConnell stopped him from doing. So, I think both sides from have little blood on their hands."

      "speaker": "REGAN",

Why is it that no one in the Obama administration said, wait a second, they are trying to influence things? I mean, they were getting reports. We have learned of this. In the final months of the Obama administration, the final year, and yet nobody, nobody responded to these in a way that you should, if they're trying to influence our elections."

    {
      "speaker": "CAPUTO",

Even though I disagree with the Ambassador McFall on a lot of things, he knows a lot about Russia. And there's probably no one more plugged into what goes on in Russia. So, I'm quite sure that Ambassador McFall, you know, sent up flairs time and again, and, of course, our national security apparatus was aware that they were tinkering and poking in a lot of our computer systems. And we all have known for many years that some of the best or worst in this case -- you know, Internet scammers in the world are in Russia, especially hackers and the like. So, the signs have always been there. I think it's quite true that Obama and his administration didn't follow through, perhaps, on a lot of this online activity, these online active measures of the Kremlin. And the commentary in 2012 about we saw it on the tape earlier, about how Romney was insulted about saying Russia went on the top of his list of national security concerns, it really came back into play again just after the Ukrainian invasion. And unfortunately, it doesn't appear that we really kept up -- in July of 2016, when the hack of the DNC e-mails came out, I set off the alarm then that this was most likely Russia. And in fact, something needed to be done about this state, and nothing was."

So, a lot of questions as to why nobody cared about it until perhaps it was too late. But, before I let you go, Michael Caputo, you actually worked for the Kremlin. You spent years working in Russia. Then you were on the Trump campaign. I know that you've certainly been questioned by authorities, what is your response when they say what role did Russia have in the election?"

And I actually founded and put together the (INAUDIBLE) Russia project which brought young people out to boat and droves in 1996. But when Vladimir Putin came in, those of us who were advising the Yeltsin administration were quickly sent packing. In fact, most Western advisors were sent out during that time."

I worked more closely with him in the last several years. But we had one conversation, only one conversation about Russia. And he asked me what was it like to work there? And I told him and we changed the topic to the NFL after that. No one ever, during the entire time I was at that campaign, ever asked me one question about my seven years in Russia. That's why in my opinion that there is no collusion."

I just want to say President Trump's comments about rigging the election made it really hard for President Obama and Jeh Johnson to respond to some of the hacking of Russia, because they were worried about the politicization of, you know, bringing it into the media's network and explaining to the American people what was going on. So, you know, I don't think President Trump did the American people a service by making it so political."

And I think that we have all acknowledged that there is a certain way in which the president uses his social media accounts that is not necessarily what we have come to understanding as presidential. But to Kayleigh's point that President Obama was so divisive, I mean, when you look at the polling, even on this issue, President Trump, 66 percent of Americans have said that he's done more to divide us than unite us. Barack Obama only ever got to 55 percent, and George Bush only got to 55 percent. And I'm sure they'll say it's the media coverage, but it's also the action."

And that would be something that, Kayleigh, I think the president would tell you has been extremely effective. In other words, he's able to bypass reporters and journalists and members of the media that want to basically take certain parts of what he says and reinterpret it and spin it out to the public. He's able to bypass that level and go straight to them himself. And that, to him, has a ton of value."

He is facing unprecedented hatred from some members of the mainstream media. You see the Harvard study that said 80 percent of the coverage of his first 100 days was negative. The new MRC media research center study said 90 percent of coverage in his first year was negative. He has to use Twitter to attack the fake news onslaught coming directly at him.

And you can see as you progress there from Clinton, to Bush, to Obama, to Trump. President Trump wins the award for the worst, most negative coverage.

New York's governor cleared the way for prepayments last week with an executive order with New Jersey's governor following suit today. Now the IRS put out a statement today about these prepayments saying they may be tax deductible under certain circumstances.

Fat cat billionaires are paying off both parties to ensure that they can treat their income, and it is their income like an investment, and pay a lower tax rate. Investment gets taxed at a lower rate and it should, absolutely should. I don't begrudge anyone that and I don't begrudge the industry that. But income is income and you can't, or at least you shouldn't be treating it otherwise. Steve Schwartzman, CEO of the world's largest private equity firm has given more than $3 million to a Mitch McConnell linked super PAC. So, you wonder why a New York City cop might be paying a higher tax rate on his income than a Steve Schwartz private equity type that may make $400 million? Because I'll tell you what, the swamp has allowed it. Now, the good news is we have found a way for the president to still fix this and to save American taxpayers $180 billion enough to -- hey, pay for the wall, maybe a couple of walls. Maybe reduce our deficit. And the president, he will not need the swamp to do it, to heck with congress. In a new op-ed for the hill, my next guest argues, quote, Mr. President, close the carried interest loophole. Ned Ryun, CEO of American majority joins me now. Ned, it's good to see you. You've been talking about this a lot lately, often with me on the Fox Business Network. But, let's back up for a second because I want people to understand what they're actually doing.

Well, I'll tell you what the American people care about, they care about fairness. This is fundamentally unfair. And I would argue the carried interest loophole is immoral. This guys -- this carve out has given the private equity and even real estate investors billions a year, and as you said, maybe up to 18 billion a year. And what they've been able to do is essentially by the silence of congress, you look at the open secrets from 2016 election cycle, they gave 21 million to 381 members of congress. Like you said, Steve Schwartzman gave 3 million to Mitch McConnell's leadership PAC. Now, those donations, some will call them free speech. In this case, Trish, I would call it approved bribery."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REGAN",
      "utterance": "So they're buying themselves a lower tax rate? And we've got some numbers here. We can show you. I mean, it's not as though it's just the Republicans. It's not just Mitch McConnell and just Paul Ryan. It's Chuck Schumer as well. I mean, both sides. And this is just the beginning of it. If you go down the list, the private equity industry has given quite a bit of money away. But why wouldn't you, Ned. Hey, if you get a much better tax bracket as a result and you get to treat your income as though it's investment and pay half as much, so what if you pay a few hundred thousand or even a few million dollars?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RYUN",
      "utterance": "Few million. But, I will say this, Trish, congress is never going to close this loophole. The swamp dwellers are never going to bite the hands that feed them."

There is a code section 707 inside the tax code that has given treasury wide discretion on how they can deal with partnerships and how they define, perhaps, partners that are not actually partners, but are in fact service providers, because that's the heart of the issue here, Trish."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REGAN",
      "utterance": "I think you're right, because I think about what treasury did under President Obama. And treasury actually said we're going to end these inversion deals. Remember those safety deals where American company say we're going to relocate to Ireland because they have a 12 percent corporate tax rate, but they weren't really in Ireland. Same kind of thing. They said at treasury, enough. Well, this is an opportunity, perhaps, for this administration to say enough, and save us a whole lot of money. Ned, do you think it will happen."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RYUN",
      "utterance": "So, there's a couple things that I would say could happen. I mean, Trump could pick up the phone and call secretary of treasury Mnuchin and say you need to deal with this, and you have wide discretion, too. I would hope that he has the political courage. Because the thing is, Trish, he was right in 2016."

Like you said, this could build like 8 southern walls. But I will say this, I think the American people -- this is a microcosm of the 2016 election. The American people woke up. They started to realize the system was rigged against them. And I would argue it's been hijacked by ruling class that they've done it to benefit themselves and their special interest cronies. Enough is enough. Drain the swamp. Close the carried interest loophole."

Here now, General Anthony Tata who served in the army for nearly 30 years before retiring in 2009. He's also the author of the brand new book, Direct Fire. Good to have you here, sir. So, China, signed on to these sanctions. But China is not abiding by them?"

      "utterance": "Well, China, you know, normally when they agree with us they abstain from a U.N. vote. And now they are trying to put a good face forward on this, Trish, I think. But about a year ago, they were -- they had 28 percent increase in trade with North Korea, and I think they're probably feeling a little bit of sting, and they're probably funneling things to North Korea that they shouldn't. And they're fighting a proxy war with us through North Korea. They don't want to lose that North Korean buffer between the west and their border."

      "speaker": "REGAN",

We now get reports that basically the Chinese have been secretly giving them oil. And so doing this trade transaction -- if they're growing nearly 4 percent and their only partner to trade with is China. It means that China is not doing what it promised to do. So, how do we go back at China and make them understand."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TATA",
      "utterance": "Well, I think we need to tighten the screws on China now, obviously, diplomatically. You think about fighting a war and that's what we're doing with North Korea right now. It's not just a hot war. We've got diplomatic information, military, economic elements of national power. And so, what we're trying to do diplomatically was tighten the screws on North Korea and use Russia and China as pliers, you know, to pop them so to speak. But they're not doing their part. And Russia is not innocent in this thing as well. And so."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REGAN",
      "utterance": "But, we have the purse strings, right? I mean, we, China doesn't have a lot of economic opportunity without us. We are crucial to China's success. So why don't we go back and say, OK, China, you want to keep trading with North Korea, well, guess what? You're not going to be able to trade with the people you actually do need to trade with."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TATA",
      "utterance": "Well, I think that's the next step here. When we get verifiable evidence that China is actually not participating in the sanctions, and I think what we do is we go to China. What we're also trying to deal with North Korea, and we go to China with Secretary Tillerson and the department of treasury and we go back and say, OK, here's the deal. We're going to cranked down on these things that you like about being a trading partner with us, and you're not going to like the way we're moving forward."

      "speaker": "REGAN",

Those Chinese banks are doing enough business somehow filtering this money through to North Korea as well. So, there's a lot of opportunity. I think treasury could actually do something about this in a pretty big way before we start talking about actual force."

They talk about the prosperity of Americans. Well, there's a big linkage between prosperity and America and the Chinese economy. And so, you have to sort of unpack that a little bit before we go in there, and you've got to be very surgical about what we do because."

We'll probably talking about the second week of January before we see any real significant warm-up from this cold air that we're talking about. So, here you go. This is what it feels like right now. Obviously, going towards northern Canada and that is where the super cold air is. But a lot of that air is settling down here across the lower 48. So, it feels like minus 17 right now in Fargo. And really this cold air is kind of spilling down here on the eastern side of the Rockies, all the way in across part of west Texas. Thirty seven is your actual air temperature right now in Dallas. But, obviously, the coldest air as you go further toward the north. So, international falls. We've got the Icebox of America last night broke the record for your coldest temperature for the date, which says a lot for that place this time of year. So right now, actual air temperature is minus 19. Not a lot of wind there. But you get the idea here that we've got cold air all across the central part of the country. We also have a little bit of rain here across the south right now. But the snow has been the big thing across the great lakes. Tapers off a little bit the next couple of days, change in wind direction but it is back by Sunday into Monday, so more snow. And I'll tell you what, we're going to be talking about temperatures by Sunday night in New York City, Trish, right at around 10, 11 degrees. Actual air temperature not wind chill."

She's already failed twice. And the simple fact is that the voters had it two chances to elect Hillary Clinton president and both times did not do so. So the notion that three times a charm and galvanize this now transformed party to maintain her face at the helm.

She's not and she didn't. And so, let's move forward on how we are being affected by those elected officials on the hill. I mean, we have a multi- million-dollar slush fund right now that is not transparent for sexual harassment on the hill. Let's talk about those kinds of issues.
