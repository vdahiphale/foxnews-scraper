Lawmakers set to dig deeper into Russian interference in the U.S. Presidential Election. And France heads to the polls, how will result there affect the economy here? Good morning, I'm Maria Bartiromo, thanks so much for being with us. This is \"Sunday Morning Futures.\"  A victory for President Trump as House Republicans pass the bill to overhaul ObamaCare. Now it heads to the Senate. But how much of the House measure will survive? House Majority Whip Steve Scalise and one of the key senators in health care fight, Senator Bill Cassidy will join me live coming up.  Also, FBI Director James Comey defending his decision to tell Congress about new Clinton e-mails just days before the election, but will critics on the left be satisfied? Former Assistant to FBI Director James Kallstrom with me this morning in the studio. Plus, the French Election and what it means for you. Why the outcome of the Presidential race there could have a big impact on the U.S. economy and American jobs here. I'll talk with Steve Hilton, a former Adviser to former British Prime Minister David Cameron as well as the Head of a leading French automaker as we look ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\"  This week senators will take up the republican fight to dismantle ObamaCare. President Trump and Republican Leaders claiming victory late last week after the House narrowly approved the Health Care Bill. But it now faces uncertainty in the Senate. Senate Republicans are expected to write their own bill, I'm joined right now by House Majority Whip Congressman Steve Scalise. Congressman, always a pleasure to see you, thanks so much for joining us.",

You know, and they're focused on doing the things they've got to do to pass the bill out of their chamber. And look, what we sent them is a really good bill that focuses on some main important points. One is lowering premiums for families that are struggling under ObamaCare.   Another is let people actually have control of their own healthcare decision, and we made extra care with multiple layers of protection that people with pre-existing conditions are protected. And I just want to make this point on that. No matter what kind of plan you have today, if you have a pre-existing condition under our bill, you cannot be denied coverage, and you cannot be charged more than anyone else. Those are provisions in our bill. Those can't even be waived by a governor if a governor wants more flexibility. But it is a good bill that focuses on lowering costs. And look, ObamaCare is failing, we're seeing, even more, examples, Maryland, some counties are going to be facing over 50 percent increases, Iowa's complete market has collapsed, this law is not working. The bill we passed over to the Senate is a really good bill and I hope they can make it better because putting that coalition together is complicated. It was complicated in House but House came together because we wanted to fulfill that promise we made to the American people and we did.",

Because look, ObamaCare says, you can't be charged more if you have a pre-existing condition, the problem is that costs are too high for everybody. And the real story for people with pre-existing conditions in ObamaCare are the deductibles. If you're paying a $12,000 deductible, that really almost impedes your ability to use health care because everything you do, you're paying out of pocket even though you have expensive insurance. In our bill, we actually put $8 billion in. That was the final change we made to the bill specifically focused on people that just got out of insurance marketplace altogether but have a pre-existing condition and want to get back in. They want to buy at normal competitive rates like everybody else. We put specific money to help them get back into the insurance marketplace at affordable rates so that everybody's premiums can be lower.",

There were some really good ideas that House members had that number one, didn't fit the definition of budget reconciliation. You know, like buying insurance across state lines. We want to do that too. But that would have made this a 60 vote bill in the Senate as opposed to a 51 vote bill. So I'd encourage the Senate to add as many things as they can. But the main thing they're going to find too was that anytime you add something on one end maybe to please moderates, then some of the more conservative members might not like that. So you have to find the balance. You have to thread the needle. And we did that, it was delicate but all of our members got involved in figuring that out. I hope they do the same. But our focus was always on lowering premiums, and putting families back in charge of their health care. As long as the Senate follows that template, they -- you know, and they've got to figure out a way to put those things together and get 51 votes in the process, then we'll be fine. And let's get a bill out on President Trump's desk to provide relief for families across the country who are struggling.",

We've gotten the President 28 different bills under his desk that has already signed in a law to create jobs and to reduce tax burdens for families. But this is a key part, ObamaCare repeal and replacement and tax reform. We can walk and chew gum at the same time. We're working on tax reform, the Senate is going to, of course, be taking up the health care bill but we're going to doing all of them in conjunction. And hopefully by the end of this year, if you've got both of those things in place, you're going to see the economy take off like we have not seen in decades.

But I guess they're more concerned about the net that legacy item for Barack Obama as opposed to the law that actually works for families across the country. So we said OK. We'll use the budget reconciliation process because it allows us to do it with 51 votes versus 60. So, in the end with tax reform, we're going to do the same thing, but if they want to play all the old class warfare games and try to pit one group of Americans against the another, we're just not going to do that.  Donald Trump doesn't want to do that. He wants to unite people and he wants to actually to lower tax rates for all people across America. And look, our plan actually is simplified, you literally will be able to put your tax returns on a postcard over 90 percent of families in America under our plan will be able to do their own tax returns on a postcard. That's something that's real refreshing in terms of a reform to Washington and the old way of doing things that people have went hungry for, for a long time.",

It's complicated to do. But Kevin Brady, the Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee and his entire Committee have been working months on this. They didn't just wait until health care got passed onto the House. They literally been working for months to try to figure out the best way to do it working now with the White House. And all those questions you raised will be answered through the Committee, but the main focus is on growing the economy, creating jobs, and look, getting people back to work that have been struggling under an economy that's been growing less than 2 percent over the last 8 years. That is unacceptable. We can do better, we will do better with this pro-growth tax plan that simplifies the code.",

And ObamaCare premiums are going up 40 to 50 percent per year. So it would be 20 percent on top of that. So, clearly, it did not achieve President Trump's pledge.

So if you also make sure that folks have the coverage that is adequate and the President very much has supported that concept, as has Mick Mulvaney, his OMB Director, then I think we come up with a product. And the product I think will end up looking somewhat like Cassidy-Collins, I've thought about it for seven or eight years, I'm a physician worked in hospitals for uninsured, taking care of folks. I kind of get it, you give power back to the patient, lower premiums, it works. If the House plan doesn't do it, we'll push our own.",

So if you have a few sick people and they're in a risk pool or a group of people ensured of 50,000 strong, the cost of the few is spread out over many. If you look at a fortune 500 company that's how all of them manage their illness. So our plan actually expands the number insured -- fulfilling Trump's pledge on that by the way -- by allowing states to enroll folks who are eligible, unless they don't' to be enrolled. So if you do that, you get a bigger risk pool. And instead of being older and sicker like the ObamaCare risk pools or premiums climbing up every year, is actually younger and healthier and therefore the cost of few is spread among the many. That's a key difference and our is more actuarially sound. Ours has been proven by experience with again, every fortune 500 company that manages its own health care.",

You've also got the cultural aspect of it from immigration, and particularly in France, the issue of Muslim immigration and a sense that traditional values and culture are being undermined.

      "utterance": "Good Sunday morning, everybody. The battle to repeal and replace ObamaCare headed to Senate now. Lawmakers set to dig deeper into Russian interference in the U.S. Presidential Election. And France heads to the polls, how will result there affect the economy here? Good morning, I'm Maria Bartiromo, thanks so much for being with us. This is \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" A victory for President Trump as House Republicans pass the bill to overhaul ObamaCare. Now it heads to the Senate. But how much of the House measure will survive? House Majority Whip Steve Scalise and one of the key senators in health care fight, Senator Bill Cassidy will join me live coming up. Also, FBI Director James Comey defending his decision to tell Congress about new Clinton e-mails just days before the election, but will critics on the left be satisfied? Former Assistant to FBI Director James Kallstrom with me this morning in the studio. Plus, the French Election and what it means for you. Why the outcome of the Presidential race there could have a big impact on the U.S. economy and American jobs here. I'll talk with Steve Hilton, a former Adviser to former British Prime Minister David Cameron as well as the Head of a leading French automaker as we look ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" This week senators will take up the republican fight to dismantle ObamaCare. President Trump and Republican Leaders claiming victory late last week after the House narrowly approved the Health Care Bill. But it now faces uncertainty in the Senate. Senate Republicans are expected to write their own bill, I'm joined right now by House Majority Whip Congressman Steve Scalise. Congressman, always a pleasure to see you, thanks so much for joining us."

      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Congratulations on this (INAUDIBLE) win last week for the House. What are you expecting as this now heads to the Senate?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCALISE",
      "utterance": "Well, you know as you said, the Senators have been -- having their own task force put together. I talked to Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn. You know, and they're focused on doing the things they've got to do to pass the bill out of their chamber. And look, what we sent them is a really good bill that focuses on some main important points. One is lowering premiums for families that are struggling under ObamaCare. Another is let people actually have control of their own healthcare decision, and we made extra care with multiple layers of protection that people with pre-existing conditions are protected. And I just want to make this point on that. No matter what kind of plan you have today, if you have a pre-existing condition under our bill, you cannot be denied coverage, and you cannot be charged more than anyone else. Those are provisions in our bill. Those can't even be waived by a governor if a governor wants more flexibility. But it is a good bill that focuses on lowering costs. And look, ObamaCare is failing, we're seeing, even more, examples, Maryland, some counties are going to be facing over 50 percent increases, Iowa's complete market has collapsed, this law is not working. The bill we passed over to the Senate is a really good bill and I hope they can make it better because putting that coalition together is complicated. It was complicated in House but House came together because we wanted to fulfill that promise we made to the American people and we did."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Talk to us specifically about the pre-existing conditions issue. Obviously, the Senate filled with Moderates. What are the changes that you made do you think that will appeal to the moderates in Senate?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCALISE",
      "utterance": "There were two things that were added along the way to specifically put more money into the areas for people with preexisting condition so their premiums can come down. Because look, ObamaCare says, you can't be charged more if you have a pre-existing condition, the problem is that costs are too high for everybody. And the real story for people with pre-existing conditions in ObamaCare are the deductibles. If you're paying a $12,000 deductible, that really almost impedes your ability to use health care because everything you do, you're paying out of pocket even though you have expensive insurance. In our bill, we actually put $8 billion in. That was the final change we made to the bill specifically focused on people that just got out of insurance marketplace altogether but have a pre-existing condition and want to get back in. They want to buy at normal competitive rates like everybody else. We put specific money to help them get back into the insurance marketplace at affordable rates so that everybody's premiums can be lower."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "So how different do you think this bill looks once it gets through Senate?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCALISE",
      "utterance": "You know, that's going to be up to Senate, I think what they'll find is I heard a lot of really good ideas by different senators. There were some really good ideas that House members had that number one, didn't fit the definition of budget reconciliation. You know, like buying insurance across state lines. We want to do that too. But that would have made this a 60 vote bill in the Senate as opposed to a 51 vote bill. So I'd encourage the Senate to add as many things as they can. But the main thing they're going to find too was that anytime you add something on one end maybe to please moderates, then some of the more conservative members might not like that. So you have to find the balance. You have to thread the needle. And we did that, it was delicate but all of our members got involved in figuring that out. I hope they do the same. But our focus was always on lowering premiums, and putting families back in charge of their health care. As long as the Senate follows that template, they -- you know, and they've got to figure out a way to put those things together and get 51 votes in the process, then we'll be fine. And let's get a bill out on President Trump's desk to provide relief for families across the country who are struggling."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "There is -- there is some skepticism around the Senate right now because perhaps they get overloaded, you've got health care bill right now, headed to the Senate, then you want to hope to see tax reform soon after. Is it too much? Do you think -- do you think you can still stick to this timeline of getting these two major pieces of legislation done this year?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCALISE",
      "utterance": "You know, we set an aggressive agenda because President Trump wants to get big things done. And frankly, I think he's shown and proven in his actions already that he's pushing hard to follow through on the promises he made. And there are already a lot of really good results. I mean, of course, Neil Gorsuch is on the Supreme Court, the Keystone Pipeline is green lighted. We've gotten the President 28 different bills under his desk that has already signed in a law to create jobs and to reduce tax burdens for families. But this is a key part, ObamaCare repeal and replacement and tax reform. We can walk and chew gum at the same time. We're working on tax reform, the Senate is going to, of course, be taking up the health care bill but we're going to doing all of them in conjunction. And hopefully by the end of this year, if you've got both of those things in place, you're going to see the economy take off like we have not seen in decades. You're going to see jobs being created and the middle class being rebuilt in ways that we haven't seen in a long time. And it's a good thing that -- you know, that wire pushing this agenda hard because families want this. This is what we campaigned on."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCALISE",
      "utterance": "And that is what Donald Trump and our majorities we were elected on."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "This is what -- this is what people have voted for sure. Let me ask you, because these two major pieces of legislation, health care reform, tax reform, are being done during -- you know, reconciliation where you can -- where you can get 51 votes versus 60 votes. How tough has it been to for you to come up with plans with zero participation from the democrats?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCALISE",
      "utterance": "You know we reached out early to democrats and they made it clear, they didn't want to do anything that unraveled ObamaCare. And that's unfortunate because again, you're seeing ObamaCare collapse all across the country. But I guess they're more concerned about the net that legacy item for Barack Obama as opposed to the law that actually works for families across the country. So we said OK. We'll use the budget reconciliation process because it allows us to do it with 51 votes versus 60. So, in the end with tax reform, we're going to do the same thing, but if they want to play all the old class warfare games and try to pit one group of Americans against the another, we're just not going to do that. Donald Trump doesn't want to do that. He wants to unite people and he wants to actually to lower tax rates for all people across America. And look, our plan actually is simplified, you literally will be able to put your tax returns on a postcard over 90 percent of families in America under our plan will be able to do their own tax returns on a postcard. That's something that's real refreshing in terms of a reform to Washington and the old way of doing things that people have went hungry for, for a long time."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Yes. I mean, certainly transparency is one thing that everybody agrees on. But there are some debate as well going on. Does it need to be revenue neutral, the tax reform package? Does -- do you need to keep some of those deductions that are so important to different pockets of the country? What are the debates going on right now around tax reform? And is there more common ground around tax reform than there was with health care? Because, you know, somebody might say, look, why should I believe that you're going to get tax reform done watching the massive fight and delay around the repeal and replace?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCALISE",
      "utterance": "Maria, as we've seen, you know nothing important and big that the country really wants us to do easy, but it's necessary. You know, we said with health care, failure is not an option. And I think the same way with tax reform. There's a reason that you haven't had a major overhaul of our tax codes since 1986. It's complicated to do. But Kevin Brady, the Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee and his entire Committee have been working months on this. They didn't just wait until health care got passed onto the House. They literally been working for months to try to figure out the best way to do it working now with the White House. And all those questions you raised will be answered through the Committee, but the main focus is on growing the economy, creating jobs, and look, getting people back to work that have been struggling under an economy that's been growing less than 2 percent over the last 8 years. That is unacceptable. We can do better, we will do better with this pro-growth tax plan that simplifies the code."

Thanks so much for joining us."

      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "So, I know that you're working on your own act and have been for a long time in terms of the health care bill. Let me ask you, are you planning to rewrite this bill start from scratch or add to it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CASSIDY",
      "utterance": "So the bill that we put forward, the Patient Freedom Act, it's known as the Cassidy-Collins actually achieves President Trump's goals that he set in campaign. And those goals were to make sure people had coverage, care for those with pre-existing conditions without mandates and the lower premiums. Now if the House bill doesn't accomplish that -- we don't have a score yet -- I'll continue to push the Patient Freedom Act, the Cassidy- Collins plan because it does achieve the President's goals."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "When will have you a score on the House bill? Why do you think that perhaps the House bill doesn't achieve those things?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CASSIDY",
      "utterance": "If you look at the first iteration, 24 million people it was scored as losing insurance. Now, you could say that the CBO over scored that. Then let's just say 9 million people lost their insurance, it also said that premium rose by 20 percent in the first year relative to ObamaCare. And ObamaCare premiums are going up 40 to 50 percent per year. So it would be 20 percent on top of that. So, clearly, it did not achieve President Trump's pledge. His contract if you will with the voter. And so, I'm basing on that previous score, we have to wait for next score."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "So are you expecting the kind of fight we just saw take place in the House similar situation in the Senate?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CASSIDY",
      "utterance": "I don't know. As long as the President's contract with United States which is those four things -- and I added something to it called the Jimmy Kimmel desk -- you can lower premiums with a really lousy policy. Which when someone gets sick, they suddenly realize it only gives them $50,000 worth of coverage, but they now have liver failure, or heart failure or a car wreck and they need more. So if you also make sure that folks have the coverage that is adequate and the President very much has supported that concept, as has Mick Mulvaney, his OMB Director, then I think we come up with a product. And the product I think will end up looking somewhat like Cassidy-Collins, I've thought about it for seven or eight years, I'm a physician worked in hospitals for uninsured, taking care of folks. I kind of get it, you give power back to the patient, lower premiums, it works. If the House plan doesn't do it, we'll push our own."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "So how does the Cassidy-Collins Act and the Cassidy-Collins bill differ specifically when it comes to pre-existing conditions to the House's?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CASSIDY",
      "utterance": "So, the way you really need to lower premiums is by expanding the risk pool. So if you have a few sick people and they're in a risk pool or a group of people ensured of 50,000 strong, the cost of the few is spread out over many. If you look at a fortune 500 company that's how all of them manage their illness. So our plan actually expands the number insured -- fulfilling Trump's pledge on that by the way -- by allowing states to enroll folks who are eligible, unless they don't' to be enrolled. So if you do that, you get a bigger risk pool. And instead of being older and sicker like the ObamaCare risk pools or premiums climbing up every year, is actually younger and healthier and therefore the cost of few is spread among the many. That's a key difference and our is more actuarially sound. Ours has been proven by experience with again, every fortune 500 company that manages its own health care."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Since actually you've been working on this for 7 years and you have a real feeling about what could work, and what won't work. But let me ask you this, what is your timing on this? I mean, are you expecting this to be, you know, weeks drawn out? I mean, we all know that you've got a lot on the agenda not just health care reform but then tax reform, expected to come soon after. Are you going to be able to get that done this year?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CASSIDY",
      "utterance": "I hope so. It's really important. ObamaCare premiums continue to climb. Insurers keep pulling out of markets, I'd love to have some cooperation from the Democratic Party, which so far they've not cooperated at all because it's important. Whether it's a blue state or a red state, these insurance markets are escalating and caused in and in some cases are imploding. So we'd like to get it done this year. If the other side decides not to help, it makes it harder."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "But don't you know that they're not going to help? I mean, don't we that already? We've heard everything from Chuck Schumer calling this administration's swamp cabinet, to Elizabeth Warren saying people are going to die. You know, I mean, we know that they're not going to be there, so what's the plan B then?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CASSIDY",
      "utterance": "Let me start off as my perspective as a physician. And I had patients as I look back, some would have voted have voted for Obama, some would have voted for Trump but they were my patients. This is not a Democratic issue, it's not a Republican issue. If a senator looks at his or her state, and sees that the insurance market is collapsing and there's counties without any insurer at all, and they only come back in if premiums are allowed to arise -- to rise100 percent, hopefully that senator will look beyond partisan politics and say, this is not democrat this is not republican, this is about our patient. And if you look at Trump call that he enunciated in the campaign, his contract to the voter, that's something that we should all be able to endorse, no matter your party. Hopefully, patients will take precedence over party."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "So you think you'll be able to do health care and tax reform this year then?"

      "speaker": "CASSIDY",
      "utterance": "That's my hope."

      "utterance": "When would you expect the health care bill on president's desk?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CASSIDY",
      "utterance": "Well, that's in some way related to what the CBO scores, both the House bill and our bill, and the time it takes for us to get consensus, but I would guess sometime in the fall."

But I mean, the President has been talking about things like a reciprocal tax, an import tax, whereas if China charges us 80 percent in tax, we're going to charge then 80 percent of tax. I know that components that go into the car cross the border six, seven, eight times. You have these components that goes in the seat, and the seat is made in Mexico, you got to send it over the border and then come back over the border again.

At the same time, you don't want to create too much commonality because you know, you end up cannibalizing all your brands. We're talking about Renault-Nissan but we're talking also about Mitsubishi.

There was not going to be a serious investigation because the Attorney General would not approve a grand jury. So, I mean, look, it's a hard job being the FBI Director, and I feel for Jim Comey but I think for him to go along with this hollow investigation with no grand jury, no subpoenas, you know, and begging interviews and begging to look at a court and then all of this stuff, and have that interview of Hillary Clinton. And then they have him, and his people -- not his people -- him, say that his people thought she had no intent because she didn't know what was going on. You're telling me that this woman that's been called \"the smartest woman in the world\", that was the first lady of the United States, that was the Secretary of State, doesn't understand about encrypting secret information, doesn't understand about those networks? That is baloney. You know, wiping it off with a cloth, you know, that was all - anyone to believe that story, you know, that's just their way out, you know? And then for the director to basically take on the responsibility of the Attorney General, and let her off the hook after she visited with President Clinton on the tarmac, which was an outrage. And then, basically, I think he was trying to do the right thing by laying out all the elements but they left all of these felonies on the table. I mean, there's about 10 felonies they left on the table. And not to exclude all of the other people that worked for her, you know, they all got a pass. You know, then a notion of Weiner, Anthony Weiner. Well, what do they expect to find? Do they expect to find something on that computer that was more - that was worse than what they've already left on the table? I don't think so."

I have nothing but the highest esteem for the - for the agents. But, the people running the agency, I mean, I just have a - I have a problem with some of their decisions.

Like most major investigations are, so I never - I never seek it at all. I didn't want it. When I was in the FBI, I would fire people for that - for that.

In fact, it's exactly what was going on. And I guess one question is, after all of that that we know about the servers, about the lying, and about the destroying evidence, why wasn't Hillary Clinton's interview recorded with the FBI? It was - it was not on the record?"

On this unmasking, you know, if you can believe what's in the media, thousands of people unmasked. I mean, this is a serious, serious problem. This has the potential to show a little bit of a third-world country here, if it's true. I'm sure the majority of the names unmasked were for legitimate reasons. These laws are there to protect the United States of America, that's why it's so risky to step outside the boundaries of what you should be doing. You know, the National Security Council is not an investigative agency, the FBI is. So, what are they doing unmasking these names? The Attorney General of the United States needs to - needs to put a special grand jury in place and get to the bottom of what this is about. So, this is serious."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HILTON",
      "utterance": "Well, if Marine Le Pen wins, that is a political earthquake. And I think this - the most immediate implication would be, probably, to see the beginning of the end of the E.U. as we know it because there's no way that the current direction that the E.U. is going, and more centralization, more regulation, more bureaucracy, the end of nation states, the pooling of sovereignty, that just brought right to a dead stop if she wins. And it's probably going to be reversed. On other hand, if ma Macron wins, and frankly, most people think that that's going to be the outcome, it's kind of a, you know, a victory for the elite, he is a creature of the elite, he's part of the establishment, he's very familiar to the international organizations, you saw President Obama backing him. And so, in a way, a Macron win, I think, will be a kind of no-change outcome."

Let me ask you about that because she has talked a lot about closing borders, perhaps, you know, leaving the E.U., going back to the French Frank. I guess, if she were to win, and I know it's a long shot, markets here in the U.S. will sell-off tomorrow."

They know that they can see years into the future and then what's going to happen. And no one knows what will happen. She have said she wants to - if she wins, she said she wants to leave the Euro, as you said, and have a referendum on the E.U. Now, the thing is in the French constitution, she can't just decree, a referendum on leaving the E.U., she needs to work with parliament. There are parliamentary elections coming up just a few weeks' time. So they'll be tremendous uncertainty if she does win."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HILTON",
      "utterance": "Yes, you're exactly right. And, in fact, even if Macron wins, as is expected, those problems aren't going to go away, those underlying problems. The first is economic. France along with many of the other countries in the E.U. have a sclerotic economy that's not producing the jobs and incomes that people need, you've got many, many millions of people left behind by the modern economy. And they are angry at what's been done to them by the elites over many, many years, elites from both parties. You've also got the cultural aspect of it from immigration, and particularly in France, the issue of Muslim immigration and a sense that traditional values and culture are being undermined. And Marine Le Pen spoke very strongly to that. Now, even if Macron wins, those issues are going to remain on the agenda in France. And he is talking if he wins, about reforming the economy and reforming the E.U. We've heard that many, many times from candidates in France, and it has never happened."
