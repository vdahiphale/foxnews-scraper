He'll think up some crazy to get the Twitter sphere going. And Vice President Biden is going to be talking about us, not us, political figures, us, theAmerican people, and how our lives would be different and better. If we had a president who actually leveled with theAmerican people instead of lying about theCoronavirus, president who actually understood what it was like to come up in the middle class instead of being born a multimillionaire and then using tax tricks not to have to pay his share, you're just going to see two fundamentally different people with fundamentally different visions. And on theissues, the American people already agree with Joe Biden. So, I'm looking forward to seeing him make that case tonight."

Now, that is an issue that could be front and center. And yet Joe Biden when asked about it and Kamala Harris as well when asked about it today, refused to answer that question. What do you say to them about that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BUTTIGIEG",
      "utterance": "Well, I think their focus right now is on avery immediate fight that's coming before theSenate in a matter of days. And it's got very real, very personal implications for so many Americans, including members of my family. I mean, remember, the Supreme Court could throw out pre- existing condition coverage in a matter of days. This is an incredibly immediate concern. And, you know, we've got all kinds of views in our party. And I'm a big fan of bipartisan reforms to reduce the politicization of the bench. Right now, we've got a much more immediate issue on our hands. And I'm with the majority of theAmerican people who believe that the next president ought to pick the next Supreme Courtjustice. And this is another example of where theAmerican people already agree with Joe Biden. So, I'm looking forward to seeing him have theopportunity to speak directly to the American people tonight."

So, what is she going to say when that does come up? Because she danced around the issue today. And I do think it's something that Americans do feel is at the forefront of this conversation. If they choose Joe Biden and this justice is on the bench before then, we are likely to see a situation where there's an argument to expand the court."

But we don't have the luxury of talking about I mean, I love academic issues about reform, and I'll continue to take an interest in them. But right now, I mean, in amatter of days, our health care is on the line. That's what most Americans are focused on. And that's what Vice President Biden and Kamala Harris aregoing to continue to talk about. Because this isn't about some arcane, obscure point of legal academia. This is about how our lives go differently when the Supreme Court does things like take away our health care. This is deadly serious stuff and we're not going to get distracted by issues that are further down the road."

You've got aprofessed Christian who's going to be in the position of defending the character of a president who got caught sending hush money to a porn star. You've got the person who has been placed incharge of the Coronavirus task force leading thenational response for our country, this country having the worst Coronavirus outbreak in the world. So, on the issues, he's in a tough spot, but also say I mean, he's obviously an effective politician and an effective debater, that's part of why he is where he is. I'm looking forward to watching that debate, just as I'm looking forward to watching the debate tonight."

President Trump led Hillary Clinton in the battleground state of Ohio by two points. Today, he trails Joe Biden by just over three. So, President Trump goes into tonight's debate, not only the underdog nationally, but also here in this important battleground state. In order to turn around those numbers, thepresident's campaign believes that he needs to hit Joe Biden on his ability to be president, to do something to make it look like Joe Biden is not up to the job, to either force him into lashing out or making a mistake during this debate. Trump campaign officials believe that the best way for thepresident to do that is to go after Joe Biden on Hunter Biden and the millions of dollars that Hunter Biden allegedly made in Ukraine, China and Russia and what Joe Biden knew about what his son may have been doing. Listen here to Kayleigh McEnany."

    {
      "speaker": "ROBERTS",

Karl Rove saying earlier today that the president needs to go on offense and point out what Joe Biden and his advisers were saying about Coronavirus, when Biden brings that up tonight, which it's almost certain that he will. Biden, no doubt, is going to go after President Trump as well on The New York Times tax story. Biden adding some fuel to the fire today by releasing his and his running mate, Kamala Harris, his tax returns. Biden and his wife paying just under $300,000 in federal taxes on income of just under $1 million. Kamala Harris and her husband paying more than $1 million in taxes on some $3.1 million inincome. Now, Biden and Harris's income puts them solidly inthe top 1 percent of income earners, which isn't exactly working-class salary. They will be able to say Bret and Martha, that they paid their fair share of taxes, which may make it difficult for the president to explain in tonight's debate why he paid so little."

That's really what tonight is about. That's what this election is about, a referendum about. If it's this bad after four years of Donald Trump, imagine four more years. And so, we're excited not to have a mud fight, but to actually talk about what American people aresuffering through in our plans to do something about it."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "GARCETTI",
      "utterance": "Well, we're taking nothing for granted, I mean, I think these polls are probably even more accurate than 2016. I think there are fewer people who are shy about who they're voting for, like in2016. But look, we're going on a whistle stop tour tomorrow and trains going through the heartland here of Ohio. Those factory towns like Lordstown where President Trump promised the factories would come back and they have it going to theworking centers of Pennsylvania. This is really Scranton against Wall Street and Park Avenue. This is about those folks that are struggling at the table who play by the rules and pay their taxes and those who twist the rules and try to play in their own ways for their own cronies. I think it's pretty clear to Americans that we all pay more probably in one month of taxes than President Trump played in a year. That is something that fundamentally feels un-American, either if you're rich, no problem, but pay your fair share or if you're not, admit that you're a failed businessman and get on with it. But you can't have it both ways."

One is this push by some progressives in the nation to defund police departments. We understand where theformer vice president has said his position is. Your home city of Los Angeles kind of helped lead that by cutting $115 million from the police budget in July. But you had places like Minneapolis City Council now openly regretting their decision to push for that effort as they're seeing crime on the rise. Do you think this is a big issue in your party about trying to declare where Joe Biden is and where progressives are on this issue?"

We have a president who has not stepped up to help local governments and state governments. Joe Biden is not in favor of defunding the police. I'm not in favor of defunding the police. I am in favor of refunding communities that have been overlooked by this president."

      "utterance": "No, we have had to cut across all of our departments, including the police department. But that is it something that is the result, because this president has not stood up, I think, here in Ohio, themayor of Toledo who put it best. He said the only person in Ohio who is defending the police is President Trump by not passing assistance for local and state government. So, we will continue to tell the good stories of all the first responders that defend lives and put their lives on the line. We had two sheriff's deputies that were shot and brutally attacked in Los Angeles County, but we need themoney to support them. You can't just say you support first responders andnot actually fund them with the federal funds that we have been waiting for every single day. These are the people who are saving us from COVID, the people who are saving us from fires. And I think that that squarely lands on President Trump and his inability to help America's local communities."

Can you tell us about the trip here? The president's been called an underdog in this race quite a bit lately. What kind of mood is he in and what's his attitude as he goes into this fight tonight?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REP. JIM JORDAN (R-OH)",
      "utterance": "Never underestimate President Trump. He's in a great mood. Remember, it was five years ago in this very city when he first took the stage, center of the stage, never left the center of the stage, I think redefined politics in that very first debate here in Cleveland five years ago. So, look, he's going to talk about the amazing things he's done in three and a half years for the American people have done what he said he would do. I mean, you think about taxes cut, regulations reduced, economy growing at an unbelievable pace before COVID, wages up for everyone. Lowest unemployment in 50 years out of the Iran deal. Embassy in Jerusalem, hostages' home from North Korea. New NAFTA agreement, building the wall, now rebuilding our economy post-COVID. And of course, Gorsuch, Kavanaugh on the court and Coney Barrett on deck. That's amazing record in three anda half years. Contrast that with Joe Biden's four anda half decades in public life. That will be what I think the American people will see tonight and they aregoing to see throughout the remainder of this campaign."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So, in terms of Joe Biden, thepresident has said that Joe Biden hasn't really been tested. He doesn't go out for a lot of interviews. He's spent a lot of the portion of this campaign so far inhis basement. He has gotten out in recent weeks. And this is actually the first time he's flown to aswing state. So, what's the president going to do to sort of reveal what he feels the media has not?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JORDAN",
      "utterance": "Well, I think maybe the first thing Joe Biden will do tonight is announce he's running for president. I mean, for goodness sake, I think for half of this month, he's put a lid on his campaign, half of the days of this month at like 9:30 in the morning. I don't know. I mean, maybe you get up and have acup of coffee and call it a day. So, the American people haven't seen him for four or five months of this campaign. They've sure seen the president, theschedule he's kept and the accomplishments he's done. So, again, I think that will be something that will be highlighted tonight as well by the president. Their records, Joe Biden's lack of engagement with the American people, in this case, he's probably thefirst guy to run for president by not running for president. I've never seen anything like this. So, I'm sure that will come up as well tonight in the debate."

      "speaker": "JORDAN",
      "utterance": "I'm not going to get into strategy andtactics of the president. He'll be ready like he always is. Look, the one thing I know about this president is, he knows how to win. He thinks like an athlete. He competes. He will be, I think, ready to go tonight. I think he'll win the debate."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "JORDAN",
      "utterance": "He paid what he owed. He gives back his salary. He's done it every single year. I mean, and he cut taxes for the American people, for every family in this country. I mean, the real question is what did Hunter Biden, the Biden family, take from theRussians and from the Chinese, all while thepresident was doing that? And frankly, thepresident's given $1.6 million to the American - back to the Treasury, to the American taxpayer, in the fact that these salaries 400,000, he's giving it that back each and every year. I think the American people appreciate that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "All right, what about ACA, there's going to be a lot of talk about that that Americans can't risk this Supreme Court nominee because she's going to gut ACA if she gets the opportunity. What do you tell them about that? What do you say?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JORDAN",
      "utterance": "She's a great pick. And remember, the so-called Affordable Care Act has been anything, but most people's health insurance has went up since President Obama passed that. And never forget. I mean, I think this is so important to understand about Obamacare. All the lies they told us about that when they passed it. Remember they told us, you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor, like your plan, keep your plan. They told us premiums will go down. They said they go down average $2500. They said deductibles will go down. They said the website was going to work. They said the website was secure. They said these co-ops they created were going to be wonderful. Every single one of them went bankrupt. So that's the Affordable Care Act the Democrats think is so great. I want to have affordable insurance for American families so they can pick the plan that fits their family's need and so does the president of the United States. And that's what he'll fight for. That's what Republicans will fight for if we're given the opportunity on Election Day."

I think yesterday's announcement, I will tell you, this could be just a game changer. These are these Abbott strip tests that are in large quality, they're going to be coming to Ohio and every state and theunion. And as a governor who is fighting this every day, I'm just delighted to have this coming and this is an effort from the White House, they've worked with Abbott and they got it done and it's going to make a difference, it's going to help us on nursing homes. It's going to help us get more kids back in school, it's going to help us keep kids in school.

Joe Biden, for many voters, even though he's been around, been in politics 47, eight years, whatever. For most voters, even though he was vice president, they don't really focus on somebody until the point where they're going to be potentially the next president. And so, for 90 minutes tonight, you know, millions of Americans are going to really, to some extent get their real reintroduction to Joe Biden, so I think, you know, he's got a lot at stake and a lot riding -- riding on this."

There's also a large presence of law enforcement.

And finally, I'm looking for tone. The winner of this debate in the minds of the people that are up for grabs is going to be the one that seems to be more likable with a vision that seems to be make sense for their future and sets the contrast in an appropriate way with their opponent so they understand what the stakes are and how and each one of them does, that's going to go a long way in deciding how they come out of the end -- at the end of the evening."

      "speaker": "KATIE PAVLICH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Well, I think the president is really going to focus on his economic achievements before the coronavirus entered the country and I would be disappointed if he did not, when Joe Biden brings up how he has handled a pandemic, if he doesn't hearken back to the Obama administration and how they handled the swine flu, which also turned into a pandemic andleft a lot of the PPE supplies without proper or substantial restocking so that we can handle thesituation. I would also be disappointed if he didn't focus on what Democrats were talking about when this virus came into the country, the issue of impeachment is not something we heard a whole lot about. And thepresident is going to have to make the argument that you saw what I did with the economy beforehand, it was the best economy we've had inreally long time, you want to go back to a Joe Biden/Obama policy set where we have GDP that's the slowest growth since World War II. We can do that but if you look at what I have planned for you moving forward, we will go back to an era of economic growth, which of course affects everyone positively in the country. We've seen that with the Democrat members the president has often repeated which he'll talk about I'm sure tonight."

Well Joe Biden just a few minutes ago tweeted out this. He said, I have my earpiece and my performance enhancers ready, and it is an ice cream, salted peanut butter chocolate flex. So, a little trolling by the Democratic nominee, Juan."

You know, it's kind of ridiculous at some level, drug test, transmitters in someone's head. You know, I don't know. At some point you want to say OK, enough with thejuvenile antics, let's go for a real debate, let's go for substance. When we get into this debate tonight, I think that the president wants to make it a choice and he needs to articulate the vision that Katie was talking about. What is his second term agenda? And I think Joe Biden, for his part, wants to say to the American people, you've got a safe alternative to what Biden will say has been the chaos and thejuvenile behavior, the Twitter storms, that we've experienced over the last four years."

One is, the ice cream that was shown in a tweet from Joe Biden is the same ice cream that was in Nancy Pelosi's refrigerator when she opened the door. I know that because I eat Jeni's ice cream as well, really good stuff."

You may remember, I think it was a2004 debate, President Bush had a bad suit that had a bump on the back of it and the theory was that I had put a transmitter in his back and I was talking inhis ear the entire debate. The guy who never graduated college was guiding the guy who is a Yale history major and Harvard MBA. So, this is not the first time this has come up, but it's all an attempt to get inside each other's heads and it's frankly useless, it really doesn't work."

I asked them specifically about the drug test issue. And they said, you know, I want to hear what the vision is for thenext term. So, you know, Katie, when you look at that, I mean, that is really the job that lies before the president tonight, is to be, you know, presidential, to reach out to some of those voters who maybe don't love thechaos that much and show the vision and the way forward. How do you see that and how do you want to review that?"

This is a top choice for them and both candidates tonight have to make the case that this isn't just vote for me because I'm not the other guy, vote for me because I will make your life easier come November and come inauguration day in January 2021."
