We take interest of this nature extremely seriously and have a zero tolerance policy for any professional misconduct Fox Business had in the statement. This matter is being thoroughly investigated and we are taking all the appropriate steps to reach a resolution in a timely matter. Now, according to the Los Angeles Times, a married female political analyst who frequently appeared on Payne's Program and who then worked as a CNN Contributor last year, made the allegations last month to Fox's outside law firm. The woman alleges that Payne coerced her into a three-year affair but she was black pulled (ph) from Fox Business after ending the affair in 2015 according to the LA Times. And that she tried to report the situation to executives at Fox News. Payne's lawyer denies the allegations and the host offered a strong response on Twitter, \"that is an ugly lie. I vehemently deny to my core. There is a mountain of proof that also proves it's a lie.\" He also tweeted, \"I will fight this like a lion armed with truth.\" The statement National Enquirer which for us reported on the matter, Payne acknowledged a, \"romantic affair with the woman,\" said he was \"ashamed and trying to rebuild trust in his marriage and apologize to his wife, children and friends.\" Now, some websites have identified the woman, but major newspapers have declined and we will decline as well because she is alleging coercion. I will say this, Fox's Parent Company, 21st Century Fox has shown a determination to move quickly in such cases, a number of cases starting with the lawsuit last year that led to the ouster of the late Roger Ailes. In a separate matter, Jamie Horowitz, Fox's Head of Sports Programming was fired this week over allegations of sexual harassment as first reported by the LA Times. The Sports Division President told staffers in a letter, \"Everyone at Fox Sports no matter what role we play or what business function or show we contribute to should act with respect and a view to professional conduct at all times. These values are non-negotiable. Horowitz's lawyer, Patricia Glazer said the company's treatment of Horowitz have been appalling and that at no point in his tenure, was there any mention by his superiors or human resources of any misconduct or an ability - inability to adhere to professional conduct. The attorney for Fox counted that this termination was fully warranted and his lawyer's accusations are ill-informed and misguided. Now, I'm not going to go ballistic over this \"New York Times\" correction, but after the paper said that North Korea's Government had tweeted that a military exercise between the U.S. and South Korea demonstrated near total ignorance of ballistic science, the paper had to acknowledge that came from a parody Twitter account, boom.

And, you know, Howie, I've been paying close attention to print reporters, to networks, the cable stations there are a few journalists out there who have really done a great job trying to get to know this president and his administration, his cabinet, his senior staff. And I think those folks are still doing what traditional journalism has always done which is they're trying to get the story. Others are trying to just get the president. Look at the screaming headlines. Look at the lower third, the chyrons and what they say.

Their role is to be the connective tissue between information and the people who deserve to hear it.

But, you know what, it wouldn't be because they very much believe in the kind of policies that this president is putting forward and I very much believe in helping people however we can. We are in a bounty blessed position to do so and it doesn't matter what the haters say. It matters what we get done."

They also see - they know that the president is doing many things that don't get covered. What have I said from the beginning, I'll continue to say it others are saying it now. It's not about biased coverage so much as about incomplete coverage. And so, you had two to three networks never even mention the passage of Kate's Law last week. Kate's Law was huge. It's a huge moment for this country."

      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Exactly. Now, Bret Stephens' argues that it facilitates a form of, in his words, self-righteous, digital bullying, he mentions the president and he is anti-Trump. But, more broadly, a kind of a mob mentality can take hold that can ruin some people's lives."

      "utterance": "Yes, I mean - tell me about it. I make a mistake on air sometimes and I, you know, dozens of tweets about how ugly and dumb I am, but you know, that's obviously can go much deeper than that. And, you know, Twitter is a great place to unify people around good but it can also be a lot of piling on hatred. I mean even this week, a popular musician, Ed Sheeran announced that he is leaving Twitter because he got so many mean tweets from Lady Gaga supporters who thought that they had - he'd insulted their idol. And so, you know, one of the point humans made which I found interesting was, he called us out for this kind of dirty behavior of taking pleasure in watching the humiliation of others on Twitter. And I -- I feel that we've all been guilty of this kind of base behavior at some point."

Again, sometimes they've lost their jobs over this. That concerns me; although, I've - I do think there's a lot of healthy aspect of Twitter too opening up the dialogue. So, a tech columnist, Farhad Manjoo and then also - another columnist where he says it is making the news dumber. He says there's a lot of group thing, particularly among journalists because journalist tend to flock to Twitter and use it to promote themselves, and that there are so many conspiracy theories on Twitter that sometimes these breakthrough to mainstream media because journalists pick up on unproven garbage basically."

And, you know, they feel they're not doing their job if they don't and, you know, furthering, you know, furthering this is the reaction - the coverage that they give to reaction of these stories. I mean, you know, any Joe SMO can get, you know, Carson Daily to read their tweet on-air on Today's Show for example and so, you know, you've got journalist covering stories that are trending and also then news programs, you know, giving a reaction time to the stories and so it's just one big, you know, dumb circle to author's (ph) point."

      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Fox Business Network has suspended Charles Payne, host and program \"Making Money\" and he'll remain off-the-air while the network investigates allegations of sexual misconduct. We take interest of this nature extremely seriously and have a zero tolerance policy for any professional misconduct Fox Business had in the statement. This matter is being thoroughly investigated and we are taking all the appropriate steps to reach a resolution in a timely matter. Now, according to the Los Angeles Times, a married female political analyst who frequently appeared on Payne's Program and who then worked as a CNN Contributor last year, made the allegations last month to Fox's outside law firm. The woman alleges that Payne coerced her into a three-year affair but she was black pulled (ph) from Fox Business after ending the affair in 2015 according to the LA Times. And that she tried to report the situation to executives at Fox News. Payne's lawyer denies the allegations and the host offered a strong response on Twitter, \"that is an ugly lie. I vehemently deny to my core. There is a mountain of proof that also proves it's a lie.\" He also tweeted, \"I will fight this like a lion armed with truth.\" The statement National Enquirer which for us reported on the matter, Payne acknowledged a, \"romantic affair with the woman,\" said he was \"ashamed and trying to rebuild trust in his marriage and apologize to his wife, children and friends.\" Now, some websites have identified the woman, but major newspapers have declined and we will decline as well because she is alleging coercion. I will say this, Fox's Parent Company, 21st Century Fox has shown a determination to move quickly in such cases, a number of cases starting with the lawsuit last year that led to the ouster of the late Roger Ailes. In a separate matter, Jamie Horowitz, Fox's Head of Sports Programming was fired this week over allegations of sexual harassment as first reported by the LA Times. The Sports Division President told staffers in a letter, \"Everyone at Fox Sports no matter what role we play or what business function or show we contribute to should act with respect and a view to professional conduct at all times. These values are non-negotiable. Horowitz's lawyer, Patricia Glazer said the company's treatment of Horowitz have been appalling and that at no point in his tenure, was there any mention by his superiors or human resources of any misconduct or an ability - inability to adhere to professional conduct. The attorney for Fox counted that this termination was fully warranted and his lawyer's accusations are ill-informed and misguided. Now, I'm not going to go ballistic over this \"New York Times\" correction, but after the paper said that North Korea's Government had tweeted that a military exercise between the U.S. and South Korea demonstrated near total ignorance of ballistic science, the paper had to acknowledge that came from a parody Twitter account, boom.
