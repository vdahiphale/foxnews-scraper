And so the back and forth went on all week and included an appearance by General Kelly in the briefing room, a gold star father himself. And then this from Congresswoman Fredericka Wilson. \"I feel very story for him because he feels such a need to lie on me and I'm not even his enemy.\" And it didn't end there. President Trump also took a stab at Wilson Saturday on Twitter. \"I hope the fake news media keeps talking about whacky Congresswoman Wilson in that she as a representative is killing the Democrat Party.\" Julie, what is the White House thinking this morning?",

You've seen John Kelly at the podium backing him up. White House officials certainly would like to put their attention on things like tax reform, which is really probably what the president is going to be judged on this year in terms of whether this year has been a success or not.

It's a fight he feels like he needs to win, which is a bit odd because this is -- this is a fight where I don't think anybody really comes across looking -- looking very good right now.",

We felt good last week but not only did the Senate then pass the bill, we're hearing now that the House may go ahead and either take the Senate amendments or move very quickly to accept the Senate amendments and we may save as many as 10 or 12 legislative days, which is a big deal. It sounds like it's not much, when you only here in the end of October, but in the congressional calendars, that's a long time and it really does buy us some more time and some opportunity to get this done before the end of the year."

Number two, that the corporate tax rate is going to come down. We wanted 15 percent. The House kept pushing and pushing and pushing. We talked about 20, we love to get back down to 15 percent as we continue that negotiation. But those two things are sort of the foundation of a tax plan for the president and I don't think the House really wants to negotiate those very much."

And there has been some discussion mostly on the Hill about adding that top bracket. What we've just said at the White House is, look, we're agnostic about that. It's not a big piece for us. If the House needs to add it to pass a great tax reform, that's great. If they don't, that's great, too. It's not what's driving this for the effort of the White House."

I guess what we're saying is, look, we want the very best tax package that can actually pass, and if there's things the House has to do or the Senate has to do to get that last vote or two to get across the finish line, that's up to them. That fifth bracket is not a party (ph) for the White House. We're not pushing for it. We don't necessarily even want it. But it's something that in the greater scheme of things, if the House and Senate tell us we have to take, then we'll open to it."

      "utterance": "No chance. In fact, I've asked a couple of Democrats if they'd ever vote to lower the corporate tax rate, they told me no, which is just bizarre, Dana, since they've supported themselves bills in the past, in fact some Democrats supported bills that Schumer has talked about and Ron Wyden talked about that actually lowered that corporate tax rate. President Obama talked about lowering the corporate tax rate. It's almost as if since it's President Trump's administration and it's a Republican plan, now they're against it."

      "speaker": "PERINO",

That in order to pay for the tax cuts, which I know you care about, but there's about 40 House Republicans who represent taxpayers in those high tax states, like New York and California, and lot of them in New England, and they're saying that this is a deal breaker for them."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MULVANEY",
      "utterance": "I hope it's not because at foundation here, one of the things we're driving is fairness. And if you live in Wyoming and I live in New York and we make the same amount of money, our house is worth the same amount of money, our cars are worth the same amount of money, all other things being equal, shouldn't we pay the same amount of federal tax? I think it's yes. The president thinks it's yes. Secretary Mnuchin thinks it's yes. Most people think that we should pay the same amount. That's not the way our tax system works right now. Right now, if you live in Wyoming, all other things being equal, you pay more tax than someone who lives in New York. That's just not fair and it's something we really are hoping to change and we hope the House and the Senate can accept that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "But -- so, some are saying, though, that those taxpayers in those states would end up actually disproportionately paying for the tax cut bill if this stays in there?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MULVANEY",
      "utterance": "Yes, and that's -- you have to be careful there, because one of the reasons it's so hard to do tax reform, and we haven't done tax reform in this scale since the 1980s, if ever, is that you can always sort of go in and look at one provision and say, oh, this is so bad for this person. I can't vote for it. You have to look at it holistically. You have to look at the entire impact of the tax plan. I heard Governor Cuomo in New York said this tax plan would raise taxes of every person in New York. That's just patently false, when you look at it writ large for example, doubling the standard deduction, most people aren't going to be interested in their state and local taxes deduction (INAUDIBLE). They're not going to take."

      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "OK. So, thirty-six years ago, the U.S. national debt crossed a trillion dollars for the first time. Today, it's $20 trillion. And I know you came to Washington, D.C. because you wanted to combat overspending and you even talked about it actually in January at your confirmation hearing. Can we just listen to that?"

    {
      "speaker": "MULVANEY",
      "utterance": "I believe as a matter of principle that the debt is a problem that must be addressed sooner rather than later. I also know that fundamental changes are necessary in the way Washington spends and taxes if we truly want to help the economy. This must include change in our government's long-term fiscal path, which is unsustainable. Part of that also means taking a hard look at government waste and ending it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "I know that your principles haven't changed."
    },

      "utterance": "I fully understand that politics has. But have the economics changed?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MULVANEY",
      "utterance": "No, all that's changed is sort of the politics. Well, what's changed is that we sent $54 billion worth of discretionary spending reduction ideas to the House, Dana. I think the House took maybe four or five billion of it. I don't think the Senate took any of it. It's very, very hard in this environment to lower spending. So, what we've done is sit back and go, OK, how do we balance the budget in the 1990s? We did not cut our way to balance in the 1990s, we sort of restrained the growth of government, so that government revenues, tax receipts, grew faster than expenditures. And that's what we're trying to do. We're not abandoning fiscal restraint by any measure. I would never do that. But we're sitting there and going, OK, if we can slow the expenditures but increase the revenues by growing the economy. As America gets wealthier, the families get wealthier, the government actually gets wealthier, too. That's how we balance the budget in the 1990s. That's how we're going to do it again today, but we need to tax reform to do it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "If you get the economic, if you get the tax reform passed and the resulting economic growth that you project, would you try to revisit with President Trump your concerns about the growth of entitlement spending?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MULVANEY",
      "utterance": "In fact, I had a meeting with the president just the other day. We walked over some of the numbers, as the deficit came out to -- the deficit came out last week, about what's driving the deficit. And I actually said, look, here's where it is, here's where it isn't, and, Mr. President, I'm going to come back to you again and want to talk to you about entitlement spending. And he said, look, I'm still not going to do it, but happy to have a conversation. Same thing we -- discussion we had in the spring, I promised people I wouldn't change Social Security. I'm not going to do it. I said, that's fine, but my job is to show what that means. And I think that's the right way to do it, and I think that if we do get this growth, Dana, both 3 percent, you can start to see that deficit trimmed down, which is what's driving everything we do."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "Are you concerned about the uncertainty in the health care market with the confusion about whether the president could support the bipartisan short term fix of Alexander-Murray, that that would hurt your ability to actually hit that 3 percent growth target?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MULVANEY",
      "utterance": "No, not at all. In fact, I'm surprised now that the Democrats are all of a sudden concerned about uncertainty in the health care markets when it's been uncertain since the day ObamaCare passed. They're concerned now about rates going up when they've been going up since the day it was passed. So, again, that's the politics of the day. I think on the CSRs, which is thing that the president is, look, I would be OK with making these payments, if I get something for people in exchange, if I get something that actually helps people, give us more ability on associated health plans, give us more ability to sell state lines, give us more ability to expand health saving account, give us tools that actually help people and we'll talk about looking at Alexander-Murray."

      "speaker": "MULVANEY",
      "utterance": "Well, tax reform for certain. But the one thing that doesn't get a lot of discussion mostly in the media is the lack of progress on our nominees. And we're very excited to hear Mr. McConnell commit this week to having the Senate starting to work on Monday and Friday and even the occasional weekend. And as a House member, I sort of laugh when I hear that, former House member. I think President Obama had twice as many of his confirmees in place at this point of his administration, as we did. This is a Republican Senate with a Republican president, we need our people in place."

      "speaker": "MULVANEY",
      "utterance": "We got tremendous job on judges, but we do need them to start working more, again, why? Because the Democrats are obstructing it every turn. They're obstructing people, Dana, who go on to get 80 or 90 votes, people who are never contentious in the first place. Everybody knows they're qualified. It's obstruction for the sake of obstruction and we just need the Republicans to push back."

So, tell me about your lawsuit and how you expect to win it given that information?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BECERRA",
      "utterance": "So, that decision had been put on hold. The Obama administration first, now, the Trump administration are in court against that decision. And we have now states joined in that effort as well to try to keep not only that decision on hold but permanently on hold and to move forward with the Affordable Care Act because millions of people depend on it, some 7 million will probably be affected if the Trump administration's efforts to kill the cost-sharing subsidy that people depend on to afford their deductibles and their copayments and their insurance are taken away."
    },

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BECERRA",
      "utterance": "Well, we went and asking for the court to give us an emergency ruling to stop what the Trump administration did last week, or a little bit more than a week ago, but it was supposed, under the Trump administration, take effect immediately, or under their order and we can't afford to have that kind of uncertainty. There are people who are day to day depending on their health insurance. There are someone, like Rebecca in California, Modesto, California, mid-30s, she is a quadriplegic. She has constant visits to the doctor. She right now pays about $15 in copayments for those visits. Without those copayments being made, part of the ACA, well, guess what? Her payments go up to about $105 every visit. Someone like that cannot afford to have this kind of uncertainty hanging over her. She requires that health care. She depends on it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "Given all the uncertainty and what we were just talking about, going forward, would you personally support something like what Senator Bernie Sanders has suggested, which would be a Medicare for all plan?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BECERRA",
      "utterance": "Oh, absolutely. I've been a supporter of Medicare for all for the 24 years that I was in Congress. This year, as attorney general, I would fight for that if we had an opportunity to put that forward in the state of California, because I think what we do is we give people that certainty that they're going to able to access a doctor or a hospital. The worst thing we used to have was situations were young families wouldn't know if they should take their children to the hospital because it can lead to personal bankruptcy. That ended with the Affordable Care Act. We can't go back to those days. And so, absolutely, when you give people access to Medicare and talk to seniors who have their Medicare who say keep your hands off my Medicare, I think it would have the same effect for most Americans if they knew they could depend on something like Medicare for themselves as well."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",

    },

      "speaker": "BECERRA",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "Maybe we can have you back and we'll have a big debate when it ever actually ripens into an issue. Let me ask you about the lawsuit that you filed about DREAMers and DACA. I'm curious that, you know, the president has asked the Congress to come back to him with an actual law instead of relying on the Obama executive orders for DREAMers. So, why not wait to see how that turns out before pushing forward on this lawsuit?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BECERRA",
      "utterance": "Well, again, if the Trump administration weren't putting people's lives at risk, their ability to continue to go to school, to work, to provide for their family, then perhaps we could wait. But Donald Trump didn't wait. He decided to repeal the DACA program all together and now, we have to act because we can't afford to put people in this kind of limbo. So, we're out there to protect at least in California, more than 200,000 young people. We're fighting really hard to continue to show that they belong in America."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BECERRA",
      "utterance": "Dana, if we had that kind of certainty, things would be different. But we don't. We know of DREAMers who have been deported for no reason, no criminal history, nothing that they particularly did. And at the same time, you don't want to put people in limbo this way. Just the way Rebecca doesn't want to lose her Affordable Care insurance because someone says, well, don't worry, we'll find another way for you do it.

That coupled with the regulatory changes the president's already implementing, we think, give us a chance to achieve at least 3 percent growth.

We would have gotten the majority of senators, but for the fact that they were able to nominate people who could not win in November. In '14, they were defeated everywhere. In '16, they were defeated everywhere. And the difference is, we've been in majority, in 2014 and 2016, two congresses in a row. Look, this is not about personalities. This is about achievement. And in order to make policy, you have to actually win the election. The kind of people that are supported by the element that you'd just been referring are specialists in defeating Republican candidates in November. And that's what these inner-party skirmishes about.

You know, I've never -- I've had a chance to be on the panel, but to never run the panel, so I'll try to do my best. So this is not a controversy that the White House anticipated before the Rose Garden press conference with Mitch McConnell, but as soon as President Trump referenced how his predecessors handled outreach to families of the fallen, I knew they would have a firestorm on their hands. And so the back and forth went on all week and included an appearance by General Kelly in the briefing room, a gold star father himself. And then this from Congresswoman Fredericka Wilson. \"I feel very story for him because he feels such a need to lie on me and I'm not even his enemy.\" And it didn't end there.

He doesn't like to back away from a fight. His strategy tends to be to push forward. So he's really been the one driving this forward every single day. You've seen John Kelly at the podium backing him up. White House officials certainly would like to put their attention on things like tax reform, which is really probably what the president is going to be judged on this year in terms of whether this year has been a success or not. But you saw the president out there again this morning. It's a fight he feels like he needs to win, which is a bit odd because this is -- this is a fight where I don't think anybody really comes across looking -- looking very good right now."

And then President Trump seemed to indicate that she had fabricated something. Then it turns out, in fact, Kelly comes out and says that, oh, no, he did say that. Maybe the context was a little off, but he did say that. And then Kelly attacks her by saying she took credit for the funding for an FBI office in Miramar, Florida, and that wasn't true. So I -- you know, they're attacking Fredricka Wilson in a very aggressive manner, but I just think it's been unfair.

And I remember just the impact. It certainly gave me a greater appreciation for when you win and versus when you lose."

      "utterance": "You know, at that age, it seemed fun and fascinating. When most kids were going to summer camp, I was doing like the Arkansas Festival Circuit. And so I thought it was all great. And I loved the campaign aspect from a really early age. And I was excited for him to be part of that race."

In this job we -- everybody sees you all the time. We know that you're working 24/7. So how do you balance it all?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SANDERS",
      "utterance": "I think one of the biggest things is the moments that I do have with my kids, I have to be really present. I try to put my phone away and fully focus on the time that I have with them and I try to block out specific time, whether it's early in the morning - I think it's probably a blessing I have early rises. People always ask, what's the hardest thing about your job. For me it's being away from my family."

And I've always said, if I ever walk into the building and I'm not in awe of being here and being part of it, then I've been here too long and it's time to go. Thankfully, I still feel a sense of reverence every time I step into the building, certainly every time I step into the briefing room, and I hope I never lose that."

      "utterance": "No. I know Glenn well, but, you know, I think that there's always going to be tension between whatever administration is in place at that time with the White House press corps. But I do think that there is a heightened tension certainly between this administration and the press. You have -- hold on, I allowed you to finish. I think you can see that in the coverage. I mean I've been around press and worked in politics my entire life and I've never experienced the level of kind of hostility that I think we see day to day."

And I felt like it was an appropriate time, if ever, to show the emotion of that situation. But the biggest thing I wanted to do was talk about the spirit of our country. And I wanted to make sure to communicate that."

So I'm in there walking him through, you're going to go out, you're going to take the picture, you'll come back in, and I look up and I see the bushes in the Rose Garden like violently shaking, and then I see a little blonde head pop up and then I see my son's face peeking into the window of the Oval. And the president's like, there's a little boy in the bushes. And I'm like, yes, that's --"

You try to avoid tangling with the former occupants of the Oval Office. There is such a small group of people who know what that job is like. I do think it was remarkable that both Bush and Obama, in these separate set of remarks, came out, said fairly similar things, expressed concerns about divisions in the country. President Bush has been so careful about weighing in, in politics for almost a decade now and Obama has chosen his spots pretty carefully."

It did -- it looked like a -- like a two frontal attack, even though they were -- President Bush's remarks were scheduled a year in advance and President Obama was in Virginia. Jason, Steve Bannon has said that President Bush was the most destructive president in the history of the country, but that was in the same speech where he was calling for Republican unity.

I mean, let's attack people on policy, but let's not play into the Democratic hands with this division of -- based on identity. And this identity politics, it really does scare me. And when you turn that fire internally, hey, that's the fastest way to becoming the minority party."

Juan, I want to talk to you about President Trump. He's got a big decision, whether to release long, secret government documents relating to the assassination of President Kennedy. This is what he tweeted. \"Subject to the receipt of further information, I will be allowing, as president, the long blocked and classified JFK files to be opened.\" Are you excited about that?"

You've got about 3,000 files still there. And then there are other papers that -- that have things that have been redacted. Maybe they would be fully released now. And there's some resistance on the part of Mike Pompeo, the CIA director, because apparently these papers involve the activities of CIA people, CIA agents, who were looking at Lee Harvey Oswald in Mexico City, his ties to the Cubans, to Russia and the like. And it could be that you have some sources, methods of operations revealed. Maybe even some negligence by CIA officials. But in terms of real revelation about why Lee Harvey Oswald acted and what happen, it doesn't seem to be there according to historians."
