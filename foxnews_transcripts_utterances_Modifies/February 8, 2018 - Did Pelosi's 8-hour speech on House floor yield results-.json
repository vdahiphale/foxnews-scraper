That background check for his security clearance, Porter's security clearance, should have been completed a long time ago. But Raj Shah said today that because of the fact that Porter denies the allegations against him, it extended that investigation and that that investigation is still not complete.  But we understand at least for a period of time here before Tuesday, the chief of staff John Kelly was aware of this. In a statement that was released early Wednesday afternoon, he offered his full support to Porter saying, quote, Rob Porter is a man of true integrity and honor and I can't say enough good things about him. He is a friend, a confidant and a trusted professional. I am proud to serve alongside him. But when those photographs came out and the world took a look at what had happened to his first wife, chief of staff John Kelly did a dramatic about-face issuing another statement on Wednesday night where he said, quote, I was shocked by the new allegations released today against Rob Porter. There is no place for domestic violence in our society. I stand by my previous comment to the Rob Porter that I've come to know since becoming chief of staff and believe every individual deserves the right to defend their reputation. I accepted his resignation earlier today and will ensure a swift and orderly transition. That first statement that we've showed you, Jesse, was written in part by the White House communications director Hope Hicks who is romantically involved with Rob Porter. The White House said today that Hope Hicks has recused herself from many of the discussion surrounding Porter today. So, we still have not heard from him, Jesse. We don't know his side of the story, but he is still maintaining his innocence in all of this. Jesse.",

So, yes, there is an FBI check if you're going to have a top-secret clearance or a secret clearance or whatever the compartmentalized one is called now, SCI. But, if you're going to be a top White House employee, the White House counsel's office brings you in and there's a one-on-one conversation about you. And it is an uncomfortable conversation. They ask you things that you don't ever want to talk about in public, but it's because they want to make sure that you do not have anything that could hurt the president of the United States. Maybe they did this process. Maybe he didn't think he had anything that would have a problem. But then the FBI knows about it, they alert them. I do think it's a real disservice to the president to not let him be aware of it because then he could have made a decision and avoided a week's worth of this terrible coverage, which looks like some really bad underlying facts with the White House.",

When you couple it with this fact pattern though, in 2009 you had Russian operatives according to the FBI and the hill, kickback and bribes to American officials to gain leverage on atomic energy deals here. And then you have over $100 million that flew in to the Clinton Foundation from Uranium One interest.

They're getting good press back in their districts or on their blogs. That's what matters to them. They're raising more money than Republicans so far. I think that could change in Q1, 2018, after the tax reform bill was in, and Republicans numbers, including the president, is way up compared to then.

Colbie Holderness who is Rob Porter's first wife was made public. You see her there with a black eye. She told me that she got that black eye on vacation with her husband Rob Porter in Italy, when they had an argument and then he punched her in the eye. She said that she got Porter to take this picture of herself, this is -- when she got the puffy eye right after the hit, she says because she wanted to have evidence that ever happened again. And then she took these photographs herself of her with the bruise and blacken eye.

      "utterance": "Now, when the White House became aware of this really is a question because Colbie Holderness told me that on January 25, 2017, more than a year ago, she sat down with agents from the FBI who were conducting a background check of Porter in which she laid out to these FBI agents numerous episodes of what she called verbal, emotional, and physical abuse and gave them the pictures that we showed you there on the screen. That background check for his security clearance, Porter's security clearance, should have been completed a long time ago. But Raj Shah said today that because of the fact that Porter denies the allegations against him, it extended that investigation and that that investigation is still not complete. But we understand at least for a period of time here before Tuesday, the chief of staff John Kelly was aware of this. In a statement that was released early Wednesday afternoon, he offered his full support to Porter saying, quote, Rob Porter is a man of true integrity and honor and I can't say enough good things about him. He is a friend, a confidant and a trusted professional. I am proud to serve alongside him. But when those photographs came out and the world took a look at what had happened to his first wife, chief of staff John Kelly did a dramatic about-face issuing another statement on Wednesday night where he said, quote, I was shocked by the new allegations released today against Rob Porter. There is no place for domestic violence in our society. I stand by my previous comment to the Rob Porter that I've come to know since becoming chief of staff and believe every individual deserves the right to defend their reputation. I accepted his resignation earlier today and will ensure a swift and orderly transition. That first statement that we've showed you, Jesse, was written in part by the White House communications director Hope Hicks who is romantically involved with Rob Porter. The White House said today that Hope Hicks has recused herself from many of the discussion surrounding Porter today. So, we still have not heard from him, Jesse. We don't know his side of the story, but he is still maintaining his innocence in all of this. Jesse."

I just to make a point on the process, which I don't know if this White House is different, but let me just give you an example about clearances. So, yes, there is an FBI check if you're going to have a top-secret clearance or a secret clearance or whatever the compartmentalized one is called now, SCI. But, if you're going to be a top White House employee, the White House counsel's office brings you in and there's a one-on-one conversation about you. And it is an uncomfortable conversation. They ask you things that you don't ever want to talk about in public, but it's because they want to make sure that you do not have anything that could hurt the president of the United States. Maybe they did this process. Maybe he didn't think he had anything that would have a problem. But then the FBI knows about it, they alert them. I do think it's a real disservice to the president to not let him be aware of it because then he could have made a decision and avoided a week's worth of this terrible coverage, which looks like some really bad underlying facts with the White House."

ADCO the firm that the informant says with the -- the lobbying firm, they say that the informant doesn't have things quite right. So I don't exactly know there.

Vladimir Putin according to the witness said this was easy, I can't believe the Obama administration is such a bunch of suckers. And we're going to take over the uranium industry in North America. When you couple it with this fact pattern though, in 2009 you had Russian operatives according to the FBI and the hill, kickback and bribes to American officials to gain leverage on atomic energy deals here. And then you have over $100 million that flew in to the Clinton Foundation from Uranium One interest. And then, Bill Clinton got paid half a million dollars by a bank in Moscow linked to the Uranium One deal.

Everything that Trump does is construed in the most evil way possible by Eric Holder and him compadres there. Would he be OK for future office? I guess. I wouldn't think on a national platform. But I don't know even what state he's in. He's spending a lot of time in California, I know. May be a Kamala Harris -- if Eric Holder were to run for her seat or something like that.
