What a week for the Dems, two new candidates, Kamala and Java Man. Kamala is the Hillary of '20. We know because it's easy to predict a Democratic candidate, just follow the mob. When Obama first ran, the press and pundits shouted to the heavens we all know its Obama, so everyone out of the pool.  And then later, they all knew it'd be Hillary until the orange Godzilla ambushed them. He showed that it's not hard to ambush a mob, especially a mob of lemmings, just dress up like a cliff and they'll jump right off. This year, it's Kamala's turn. How do we know?

Certain people, oftentimes, on the left, for law enforcement or what they go through every day. What's interesting, though, because I looked at a poll that -- from Gallup, from June 2018, and it talked about the institution that people have the most confidence in. And if you look at it, at the top is the military at 74 percent, next is small business, interestingly enough, at 67, and the police are third at 54 percent. So a majority of the people in the country do back law enforcement are horrified when you look at stories like this, and do understand the complexity of these people's job and how, you know -- they're basically sacrificing their lives every single day. So that was refreshing for me to see because I think your instinct is always to say, to look at those groups who sometimes can be anti-police or could rally against all law enforcement, isn't looking out for the common good. And you think that's the norm in terms of how people feel, but it's not. Most of the country looks at something like this and they want to rally around law enforcement and everything they do for us every day.",

But you won't -- no one wants to hear that. They want the isolated anecdotal incident, because that helps the media. And they took the anomaly and they made it representative of the system, which is unfair. And then you get this hangover here where people are getting hurt. Every industry must improve. It has. Body cameras is something that we should be for. But the issue here for me has always been the media entering the picture and relying on the oppressed narrative that it's all about race. But minorities are victims, but they're also the officers, especially in New York City. Minority is the majority. All right? So these are people that are doing their jobs in the community. They're beloved in their community. It's not about race. It's about improving an industry, that's for sure.

When Obama first ran, the press and pundits shouted to the heavens we all know its Obama, so everyone out of the pool. And then later, they all knew it'd be Hillary until the orange Godzilla ambushed them. He showed that it's not hard to ambush a mob, especially a mob of lemmings, just dress up like a cliff and they'll jump right off. This year, it's Kamala's turn. How do we know?

The key point that he is making and I -- you know, it's interesting that Steve Schmidt who worked with McCain, I think, Greg Striple who was also a Republican pollster, Bill Burton who work with Obama, these are his top people, OK? They were with him yesterday here in New York. And what you're seeing him say, 40 percent of Americans now identify as independent. They don't like Republicans or Democrats. They really are independent. The problem with that analysis is most independents lean one way or the other.

So when you look at a 70 percent marginal tax rate, when you look at Medicare for all, all he's saying is it's un-American to have massive government overtake of the industry. And he knows that it reduces the quality of care of those items. That that top tax rate is gonna cost when you hike that up on people at the top, you're going to lead to job losses. You're going to lead to a trickle-down economics. This guy has been alive for a minute, he's a successful businessman, and he's saying these things sound great. The Democrat are coming out and saying all these sound bites, this utopia that they want to live in. But when you get out of liberal academia, this stuff just doesn't work.

Mueller has never charged or alleged that there has been any participation with the Trump campaign in the hacking of the DNC server and Podesta. Remember, the DNC server was hacked before Trump was even the nominee. And Podesta just gave his password to somebody and it wound up in the hands of WikiLeaks, all those e-mails. Stone has never been alleged to have been complicit in the hacking. And if you read the indictment, it says the Trump campaign had no idea what WikiLeaks had. And so they go, hey, Stone, can we get a heads up on what WikiLeaks said, and Stone goes, OK. And he had no idea. So he starts asking around, trying to get the scoop on WikiLeaks, and he couldn't find out. He got nothing. So all he did was hype it up based on publicly released documents.

Certain people, oftentimes, on the left, for law enforcement or what they go through every day. What's interesting, though, because I looked at a poll that -- from Gallup, from June 2018, and it talked about the institution that people have the most confidence in. And if you look at it, at the top is the military at 74 percent, next is small business, interestingly enough, at 67, and the police are third at 54 percent. So a majority of the people in the country do back law enforcement are horrified when you look at stories like this, and do understand the complexity of these people's job and how, you know -- they're basically sacrificing their lives every single day. So that was refreshing for me to see because I think your instinct is always to say, to look at those groups who sometimes can be anti-police or could rally against all law enforcement, isn't looking out for the common good. And you think that's the norm in terms of how people feel, but it's not. Most of the country looks at something like this and they want to rally around law enforcement and everything they do for us every day."

But I think if you break it down by groups and especially people in this neighborhood, you'd say, yeah, we want protection. But guess what? You don't want police to abuse their authority and power.

Right? We have statistics that will tell you about how shootings have declined and that, in fact, white shootings of unarmed blacks is actually lower statistically than minority police shooting minority victims. But you won't -- no one wants to hear that. They want the isolated anecdotal incident, because that helps the media. And they took the anomaly and they made it representative of the system, which is unfair. And then you get this hangover here where people are getting hurt. Every industry must improve. It has. Body cameras is something that we should be for. But the issue here for me has always been the media entering the picture and relying on the oppressed narrative that it's all about race. But minorities are victims, but they're also the officers, especially in New York City. Minority is the majority. All right? So these are people that are doing their jobs in the community. They're beloved in their community. It's not about race. It's about improving an industry, that's for sure. But statistics tell stories that the media ignores, and the consequence of that is that they made the bug in the system the system and that's unfair."

At one point, he tells a great story about how Trump, in the middle of an Oval Office meeting, where Paul Ryan is boring the heck out of him for 30 minutes on health care policy, Trump just leaves, walks out and starts watching TV in the den. And he's just sitting there like, \"What just happened?\" Also, very negative portrayal of Sean Spicer. Not a good manager. And they take us through how they did the whole crowd size first press conference and how that was a debacle and how he stole a little mini fridge from one of his staffers. But all in all, this guy is from Alabama. A devout Christian. His father was a pastor. His mother was a Sunday school teacher. He was a Cruz supporter, Rubio guy and was really disgusted after the \"Access Hollywood\" tape. Almost left the campaign, because he couldn't handle it. And he said to himself, \"You know what?

If you're a CEO, if you're a boss, if you're an interesting person, if you've done a lot in your life, the tell- all will come, and it be bad.
