I repeat, nothing, that Biden has done while in office. Biden's fast and dramatic slide downward explains why McConnell is now totally comfortable just telling Republican governors to ignore altogether the Biden administration's guidance on how to spend that infrastructure money they're going to get. In other words, ditch the bike lanes, fix the bridges. And how happy are Manchin and Sinema that they didn't buckle on that voting rights bill now? Pelosi's media bullies turned up the pressure campaign on them, but the senators resisted. And then they were trashed by the left. They didn't care. But they obviously made the right call.

They tuned out Biden, and they're going to tune out Tester as well. But the abandonment of Biden isn't just happening on the home front, of course. Our allies are also moving on from him. Just recently, French president Emmanuel Macron decided to bypass the bumbling Biden altogether, and then go on to have his own meeting with Vladimir Putin to defuse the Ukraine situation. Now, it's obvious what happened here. European leaders saw Biden as a problem, not a solution, kind of a bull in a China shop, or Biden in a China shop. So they felt that they had to rush into de escalate. How embarrassing for America getting briefed and ordered around by the French? But not any more embarrassing than America being left in the dust by the Chinese. Under Biden, our overall trade deficit ballooned to an all-time high, this is shocking, $859 billion. That's a 27 percent increase from the year before. President Biden might not know how to make Americans happy, but the Chinese, they got to love him. Because the trade deficit with China grew 14.5 percent for the full year to $355 billion, reversing the decline that followed then-President Donald Trump's policies aimed at reducing the deficit with tariffs and purchase targets. By the way, Biden's team wants to get rid of all the tariffs too. This is as despicable as it is as heartbreaking. Now, all because we have a president that no one trusts or respects to stand up for the average American. President Xi knows that Biden is easily rolled, or just easily ignored all together. Ditto with his military men. Secretary Austin and General Milley for whom, I don't think, China or probably Putin have much respect for. To them, woke is a joke. And the U.S. military, sadly under this leadership, great men and women, are pushed to go woke. So Democrats, they made a terrible choice in Joe Biden. His hologram campaign has become a hologram presidency. And what when he does appear in public, I put \"appear\" in quotes, he has no presence. He has no credibility, and he has little influence. Now, given all this, maybe he should just stay home alone for the next three years. And let Nancy run things for a while. Oh, on second thought. And that's the 'Angle'. All right. Joining us now John McLaughlin, CEO of McLaughlin Associates, and Trump 2020 pollster; and Mark Pennsylvania, democratic pollster and former Clinton strategist. Mark, now as someone who's polled a lot for the Democrats over the years, is there anything Joe Biden can do now to stop the bleed of public approval, which I've never seen anything in my lifetime? And I've been around for a long time in Washington, longer than I like to admit. What can you do?",

In fact, Floridians and South Dakotans they even seemed happier, a lot happier than the mandate states.

In other words, ditch the bike lanes, fix the bridges. And how happy are Manchin and Sinema that they didn't buckle on that voting rights bill now? Pelosi's media bullies turned up the pressure campaign on them, but the senators resisted. And then they were trashed by the left. They didn't care. But they obviously made the right call.

They tuned out Biden, and they're going to tune out Tester as well. But the abandonment of Biden isn't just happening on the home front, of course. Our allies are also moving on from him. Just recently, French president Emmanuel Macron decided to bypass the bumbling Biden altogether, and then go on to have his own meeting with Vladimir Putin to defuse the Ukraine situation. Now, it's obvious what happened here. European leaders saw Biden as a problem, not a solution, kind of a bull in a China shop, or Biden in a China shop. So they felt that they had to rush into de escalate. How embarrassing for America getting briefed and ordered around by the French? But not any more embarrassing than America being left in the dust by the Chinese. Under Biden, our overall trade deficit ballooned to an all-time high, this is shocking, $859 billion. That's a 27 percent increase from the year before. President Biden might not know how to make Americans happy, but the Chinese, they got to love him. Because the trade deficit with China grew 14.5 percent for the full year to $355 billion, reversing the decline that followed then-President Donald Trump's policies aimed at reducing the deficit with tariffs and purchase targets. By the way, Biden's team wants to get rid of all the tariffs too. This is as despicable as it is as heartbreaking. Now, all because we have a president that no one trusts or respects to stand up for the average American. President Xi knows that Biden is easily rolled, or just easily ignored all together. Ditto with his military men. Secretary Austin and General Milley for whom, I don't think, China or probably Putin have much respect for. To them, woke is a joke. And the U.S. military, sadly under this leadership, great men and women, are pushed to go woke. So Democrats, they made a terrible choice in Joe Biden. His hologram campaign has become a hologram presidency. And what when he does appear in public, I put \"appear\" in quotes, he has no presence. He has no credibility, and he has little influence. Now, given all this, maybe he should just stay home alone for the next three years. And let Nancy run things for a while. Oh, on second thought. And that's the 'Angle'. All right. Joining us now John McLaughlin, CEO of McLaughlin Associates, and Trump 2020 pollster; and Mark Pennsylvania, democratic pollster and former Clinton strategist. Mark, now as someone who's polled a lot for the Democrats over the years, is there anything Joe Biden can do now to stop the bleed of public approval, which I've never seen anything in my lifetime?

JOHN MCLAUGHLIN, CEO, MCLAUGHLIN & ASSOCIATES: Well, it's about government control. What's crazy about this is - by the way, the poll that you quoted a CNN poll. In 2020, we kept on saying those polls were skewed, they under polled Republicans, Trump voters. And guess what, Chris Cuomo who attacked us, said our polls were wrong, et cetera. And we were saying, the election was close. He's wrong. He's gone. Your ratings are up. And I tell you what, our polls right now the voters say - 60 percent say, Joe Biden should be tested cognitively. And it should be made public. That's how bad it's gotten. Most Americans think this guy doesn't have the capacity to run the country. And guess what, the rest of the world knows that. This is really scary right now. And his job disapproval, it's 57 percent. That's a ton of votes for Republicans to get, including 22 percent of the Biden voters now think they disapprove of him. 22 percent of Democrats; 25 percent of the liberals; 25 percent of the African-Americans; 50 percent of the Hispanics; and 45 percent of our urban voters.

And I'd like to give my employees a raise. And I realized yesterday or the day before, that this is clearly not enough. I don't know what Joe Biden is doing. I don't know what he's looking at.

It's simply because we cannot get employees to work. We cannot staff our two locations. This is New York City. We can't staff. We are struggling. And between the President and this new mayor, I just don't know what to say anymore. I mean, I just can't believe that I am a desperate person on national media saying that the country feels like it's collapsing. It's getting out of control. We don't have leadership at the top.

I think they said, inflation is at 7.5 percent. I mean, I dare say that it's much more than that. I ordered takeout the other night for a family of three. It was $125. I was shocked at what I was experiencing as a business owner that should be able to afford that.

Well, DHS, of course, doesn't say. They don't want to actually give you facts, which is why the center to advance security is demanding that DHS turnover records showing how they make these determinations. As DHS conjures up phony threats, the Pentagon embraces a real one.

Dinesh, the real threat to this country that they're trying to map out for us are the people of this country, who are now overwhelmingly rejecting Biden's agenda. Does that mean like the 58 percent who disapprove, they're all potential domestic terror threats at this point? DINESH D'SOUZA, \"THE DINESH D'SOUZA PODCAST\" HOST: What I find really remarkable is that there seems to be an embedded point of view inside the Biden administration that America has now somehow become under Biden, a one party state. And what I mean by that is that with a one party state goes a one perspective, a party line in thinking about issues. And so, if you fall outside the party line, they don't just want to ostracize you, or de platform you, or excommunicate you, they want to actually brand you an enemy of the state. Now, they're very far from this point of view becoming established or consolidated. But if it is, just think what a short step it is, to essentially start locking people up, setting up camps, basically treating people as if they deserve to be somehow shut down because they represent a danger to the country's national security. But this seems to be the operating premise of the Biden administration. And you see it in a number of areas, including DHS."

This - a small minority of people make all the decisions for everyone else. And if they don't like it, they're dealt with. There's some weird disturbing parallels here, given what the DHS and the DoD is saying now. STEPHEN MILLER, \"AMERICA FIRST LEGAL\" FOUNDER: No, America's leftist elites are envious of the Chinese system and the ability it provides them to control the population. What is truly terrifying right now, Laura, is that the left has gained control of the security state. In other words, between DOJ, within it, the FBI, CIA, as well as, of course, the Department of Homeland Security, they're able to use the security apparatus to police speech and to police thought they disagree with. And if this sounds like it's too hard to believe, ask yourself how many innocent people were jailed as a result of the Russia collusion hoax? How many people were given unequal legal treatment as a result of that? They are advancing the idea that law enforcement can be used for expressly political purposes. That DHS bulletin should be taken with utmost seriousness about all Americans who treasure their civil liberties. We are heading down a very dark path."

The CIA is not supposed to be conducting elaborate intelligence operations within the United States. And so what you seem to have here is a rogue agency, either an agency gone rogue, or an agency operating with the sanction of the Biden administration to turn its lenses away from Islamic radicals abroad, or Chinese subversives, and focus really within the United States, and that would be a very scary turn."

And let me tell you something, when you have the Department of Justice and Merrick Garland treating parents concerned about Critical Race Theory as domestic terrorists, when you have the Department of Homeland Security accusing people of spreading what they call disinformation, what you and I would call common sense, of being potential terrorists, we should take this all very seriously. At the same time, our citizens are literally being killed by the drugs pouring across our border by actual foreign criminal organizations, and this administration is aiding and abetting that lethal import into our country while targeting our citizens.

And if we put this in the broader context, we seem to see a process in which aliens, in other words, people who are foreign to the United States, are being treated as citizens, or being given the rights of citizens, allowed to come into the country, allowed to operate in the country. Meanwhile, citizens are treated as aliens, and that would make sense of what the CIA is doing.

So kindergartners, they would learn about identity groups. Third-graders, they'd have to sit through cultural identity lectures.

In the District of Columbia, they are under much further draconian measures from the mayor's office, but we know the archdiocese has been willing to take the mayor to the mat in the past. Last December they file fired a lawsuit when she tried to restrict the number of people who go to church. And they have not shown a willingness on behalf of their students or parents to go to Mayor Bowser and advocate on behalf of their parishioners and their parents and their students, most importantly. And last summer we got a very large group of parents, hundreds and hundreds of people signed a letter to the archbishop, Cardinal Gregory, begging for normalcy and mask choice. And the response, it fell completely on deaf ears. And alarmingly, one of the major takeaways that came out of the letter was that the diocese appeared to be entertaining this idea that vaccinated students could take their masks off."
