And her critics are calling it a highly transparent piece of political gamesmanship. Meanwhile, another 1,000 people are genuinely risking their lives. They're trying to make it to the border. And Congress so far is doing nothing to provide them with an orderly system to be processed. A fence system that encourages them to risk everything relying on coyotes to ram them across the border at poorest openings.  Karl Rove and Juan Williams on that issue at the heart of all of this.

People were held up migrants at the Guatemalan border today for several hours while their identities were checked also, looking for criminals.  We've been watching them come across this mountain road here. It's mainly young men. But we are seeing also some families, parents with small children. And sometimes, it's not even the parents that are carrying those small children. Here is what we saw.   Martha, we're seeing mainly small groups of 5 to 10 people. Some of them meet along the way on the caravan. You can see the young man is carrying a 1-year-old boy. That's the mother behind him. He met her on the caravan. They've been walking since 8:00 this morning. And they have another 70 miles to go. They said people have been feeding them along the route. He has absolutely no money on him, neither does she. They have a 1-year-old boy and a 13- year-old is up ahead. Inside those two knapsacks, clothing for himself, and for that 1-year-old boy. You can see these roads are tough. Trucks whip around the mountain road. There's no real sidewalk. They've got 75 more miles to go. They were strangers a few days ago. Now, they're trying to get to Guatemala City.   Just physically, I think, it's so hard to understand how you can carry that 1-year-old for 13 hours, so far, was still three or four more hours to go. A real physical challenge for many of these people as they try and make their way forward. The numbers up to 2,000 more. Traveling in that convoy. And even before this, this caravan reaches the United States. There are already two more new ones rowing being built, being organized in Honduras. So, more caravans ahead to come. Martha.",

Speaking to a CNN reporter, Patterson said, quoting, \"all I care about right now is Jayme's family. I want to get them a note.\" But he wouldn't say what was in the note. In fact, he wouldn't say anything except repeating over and over again that he is sorry and that he can't talk. Mr. Patterson was in the courtroom for his son's arraignment and initially sat on the prosecution side until a deputy asked them to sit on the defense side. As the charges were read and Jake Patterson appeared by video camera the father sobbed and buried his head into the shoulder of a relative. Remember, Jayme Closs says that during her three months of captivity in Jake Patterson's, his father came over on a regular basis and during those times Jake Patterson would make her hide under the bed telling her if she made noise, bad things would happen. And now, we have the 911 call made shortly after Jayme Closs escaped that cabin and was found by a woman walking her dog. Listen to this.",

What I am trying to do is get us to focus on the facts that we, as a conservative party have an opportunity to be heard by every single American in every quarter of the country if we are able to overcome some of the overtones that come from members of our party. And by doing so, instead of talking about Steve King or racism, we'll talk about the fact that this president, President Trump has led to the lowest unemployment rate ever recorded for African-Americans, the lowest ever recorded unemployment rate for Hispanics. We have passed landmark legislation that will help 31 million Americans mired in poverty living in distress communities called opportunity zones. We have forced the debate on criminal justice reform to make sure that we are doing the right thing for America by keeping our communities safe. And at the exact same time, providing more opportunities for those folks who are returning to communities to have the right programs to make sure that they don't recidivate, which means that crime rates will go down because of the Criminal Justice Reform Act that was signed into law by President Trump.

What I can say is that when we are tripping over our own message because our messengers get in the way, that's not good for the party. But more importantly it's not good for America.

And her critics are calling it a highly transparent piece of political gamesmanship. Meanwhile, another 1,000 people are genuinely risking their lives. They're trying to make it to the border. And Congress so far is doing nothing to provide them with an orderly system to be processed. A fence system that encourages them to risk everything relying on coyotes to ram them across the border at poorest openings. Karl Rove and Juan Williams on that issue at the heart of all of this.

People were held up migrants at the Guatemalan border today for several hours while their identities were checked also, looking for criminals. We've been watching them come across this mountain road here. It's mainly young men. But we are seeing also some families, parents with small children. And sometimes, it's not even the parents that are carrying those small children. Here is what we saw. Martha, we're seeing mainly small groups of 5 to 10 people. Some of them meet along the way on the caravan. You can see the young man is carrying a 1-year-old boy. That's the mother behind him. He met her on the caravan. They've been walking since 8:00 this morning. And they have another 70 miles to go. They said people have been feeding them along the route. He has absolutely no money on him, neither does she. They have a 1-year-old boy and a 13- year-old is up ahead. Inside those two knapsacks, clothing for himself, and for that 1-year-old boy. You can see these roads are tough. Trucks whip around the mountain road. There's no real sidewalk. They've got 75 more miles to go. They were strangers a few days ago. Now, they're trying to get to Guatemala City. Just physically, I think, it's so hard to understand how you can carry that 1-year-old for 13 hours, so far, was still three or four more hours to go. A real physical challenge for many of these people as they try and make their way forward. The numbers up to 2,000 more. Traveling in that convoy. And even before this, this caravan reaches the United States. There are already two more new ones rowing being built, being organized in Honduras. So, more caravans ahead to come. Martha."

That Nancy Pelosi did not tell the truth today when she claimed that this was all because of national security. She did this because she is angry with the president, she wants to humiliate the president, she wants the president to surrender, she's like -- you know, Ulysses S.

I want to say first and foremost to the families of the four American heroes, me and my family sent our sincere condolences. I work and I've had the honor to work with the American servicemen and women especially on stuff in Syria and I know the caliber and character of these individuals and the amazing success that they've given us over terrorism and over adversaries. I think Senator Graham is absolutely right. I think that today. Under this administration we have had huge strides in the fight against ISIS. We're nearly there. We've almost defeated them. It's important that we lock down that win before we withdraw. And it's also really important to remember that if we do and we will have to come back later, if we don't finish the job, we're going to have to come back later and we're not going to have the same amazing allies that we've had before because they're not going to trust us after this."

I know these families and I know exactly where they're coming from. I also know what our operators on the ground and what the people working in Syria with our partner forces also think and want to do about this. I think it's important to remember that Syria is not Afghanistan. And I think that we - - our goal should be to pull out and bring our troops back home. But let's remember, this is a very small footprint and a small bill. This small footprint has been able to give us huge returns in almost completely defeating ISIS and being a huge stone in the side of Iran and Russia in keeping this -- if I give you just one example. One base with a few hundred servicemen and women are able to protect the lives of 50,000 people that would be slaughtered if we pull out and would also block the superhighway between Baghdad and Damascus that Iran so desperately needs. At the very least, we're costing them hundreds of millions of dollars to go around and not have that freedom. And so I think we must finish the job and we must bring our troops home. But remember the footprint and remember Syria is not some of these other conflicts that we do need to look at."

Speaking to a CNN reporter, Patterson said, quoting, \"all I care about right now is Jayme's family. I want to get them a note.\" But he wouldn't say what was in the note. In fact, he wouldn't say anything except repeating over and over again that he is sorry and that he can't talk. Mr. Patterson was in the courtroom for his son's arraignment and initially sat on the prosecution side until a deputy asked them to sit on the defense side. As the charges were read and Jake Patterson appeared by video camera the father sobbed and buried his head into the shoulder of a relative. Remember, Jayme Closs says that during her three months of captivity in Jake Patterson's, his father came over on a regular basis and during those times Jake Patterson would make her hide under the bed telling her if she made noise, bad things would happen. And now, we have the 911 call made shortly after Jayme Closs escaped that cabin and was found by a woman walking her dog. Listen to this."

What I am trying to do is get us to focus on the facts that we, as a conservative party have an opportunity to be heard by every single American in every quarter of the country if we are able to overcome some of the overtones that come from members of our party. And by doing so, instead of talking about Steve King or racism, we'll talk about the fact that this president, President Trump has led to the lowest unemployment rate ever recorded for African-Americans, the lowest ever recorded unemployment rate for Hispanics. We have passed landmark legislation that will help 31 million Americans mired in poverty living in distress communities called opportunity zones. We have forced the debate on criminal justice reform to make sure that we are doing the right thing for America by keeping our communities safe. And at the exact same time, providing more opportunities for those folks who are returning to communities to have the right programs to make sure that they don't recidivate, which means that crime rates will go down because of the Criminal Justice Reform Act that was signed into law by President Trump.

I mean, frankly, here we are sitting in the midst of a shutdown and one of the tactics of the left is to make the wall immoral or talk about racism that somehow conflated with protecting our country. Common sense suggests that if you have 1,950 miles of border and you have about 700 miles that don't need a fence because you have a natural border there, what do you do? You find a way to strengthen border security which includes barriers, more bodies called and more patrol officers and at the same time using technology. But instead of having that conversation, the left because of their focus on identity politics is trying to scare people into not supporting our president as it relates to providing the resources necessary to protect our nation, to be a nation we have to have strong security at our borders.

I'm not in the position to know what it's in his heart. I've not been one of his constituents. And those really are the only two of himself, one person, and his constituents, the other body that will make that decision. I don't think it's my responsibility, nor is it my opportunity to weigh in what he should do from his own perspective. What I can say is that when we are tripping over our own message because our messengers get in the way, that's not good for the party. But more importantly it's not good for America. Because what we've done in the last two years under President Trump's leadership is to transform our nation economically to undergird the success of our nation from a regulatory perspective which only means that the greatest asset we have -- the average person in our nation is our greatest asset. They now have a chance to flourish like they haven't had in more than a decade. And that's good news.
