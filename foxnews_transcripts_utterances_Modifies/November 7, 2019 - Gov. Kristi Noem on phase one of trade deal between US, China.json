      "sentences": "Thank you, Shannon. And how about a couple of records to tell you about? Signs that China and the U.S. may, may, may be moving to roll back tariffs, even though that was disputed later in the day, had stocks rolling to record highs, the Dow and the S&P 500 finishing there, the Nasdaq a little shy.  This another reminder that, if you want to know what dictates Wall Street's move, it is everything to do with trade and zilcho to do with, well, impeachment.  Stocks were losing some of their gains earlier on a report that everyone is not exactly everyone when it comes to getting rid of these tariffs or taxes on some goods here.  We're kind of confused on this, but, by and large, the tariffs are going to go, and that was enough to ignite this rally. Now, we're going to talk to Republican South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem about all this. You talk about a state that has a lot of agricultural interests at stake, what she thinks about all of this.  In the meantime, first to FOX Business' Blake Burman with what he's hearing on this confusion of the tariffs. First off, Blake, on, off, delayed, what?",

      "sentences": "May, may, may is how you started your show, Neil, and I think that's a very, very, very good way to put it.   There's been a lot of headlines moving over here in the last 24 hours or so. Let me just try to try to tick through it and work through it with you here. According to sources who we have been talking to, the idea of rolling back tariffs is still being mapped out at this point. But the markets earlier today certainly love the comments that were coming out of Beijing from a government spokesperson there, a spokesperson for China's Commerce Ministry, who said at one point the following, saying -- quote -- \"Both sides agreed to remove the additional tariffs imposed in phases, as progress is made on the agreement. If China and the U.S. reach a phase one deal, both sides should roll back existing additional tariffs in the same proportion simultaneously.\" Now, so far, no one back here in Washington within the Trump administration has put forth an official comment. And that includes the U.S. Trade Representative's Office, which is leading the negotiations for the U.S.   However, a source familiar with the negotiations here at home says the comments made in China today are on the correct course. The question then, Neil, becomes which tariffs might be in play, and when might they be rolled back? Again, the U.S. side not publicly touching this one. But according to Chinese sources, China wants tariffs lifted as the deal is being negotiated and comes together, with all of the tariffs being rolled back before the completion of a full trade deal. Those Chinese sources also say the U.S. wants some tariffs to stay in place after an eventual deal is completed. This is seen as ensuring the China keeps up their end of a trade deal after implementation.  Now, if there is a trade one deal -- let's just bring this back to trade one first -- phase one for a second. If there is a phase one trade deal, sources on both sides say the tariffs for December 15 likely will not go into effect.   As for the timing of this, Neil, we are also told from sources on both sides that they are still operating under the APEC timeline, which is trying to have phase one wrapped up by the end of next weekend. That is when APEC, of course, was supposed to take place, no longer taking place. Important to note, with all of this, Neil, when you look at all of the headlines, the comments in China, what we're seeing at home and the headlines that have moved the markets up and down, as of this very moment, as we talk today, there is still not a phase one trade agreement at this point for President Trump and President Xi to sign, though some are feeling that -- some are feeling optimistic that this is moving in the right direction -- Neil.",

In this agreement, which, if you remember, Neil, when I was in Congress, I was on Ways and Means, and we negotiated these trade agreements.  We faced not just access to market challenges. We also faced regulatory challenges. So, we have got language in this agreement that is going to deal with some of those regulations that China used to punish our farmers. If we can remove those regulations and open it up and be treated much more fairly, that's really going to help us at the end of the day.",

That experience is incredibly important. And, remember, Neil, back when we negotiated the USMCA agreement, we got language in there that helped set the table for this China agreement. So if we could get USMCA ratified and through the House, if Pelosi would get that finalized, that helps this Chinese agreement get completely finalized as well.   So, phase one looks very encouraging, but let's not forget about the other markets that we need to finish. And the only one holding that one up is Nancy Pelosi. USMCA is incredibly important, and it could be done within a matter of weeks.",

And what was a common pattern throughout, Governor, as you probably know better than I, is that women are not big Republican supporters, especially suburban women, suburban voters, period.  Is this a problem for the party? This is the third type of election like that running since the president was elected where that has been the case.",

But if you look at who the Republican House leadership has recruited to be candidates for Congress, there are some incredible women in that group.  They are young. They're businesswomen. They're family-focused, and they're out there running hard to really represent the demographics of this country. So I have long said, Neil, there's not women's issues, there's not men's issues, there's issues and a women's perspective on every single one of them.   I think that women just bring a different perspective to every single issue. And that's why it's important that we're weighing in on policy. So we need to maybe go out and tell our story better. That's maybe what Republicans don't do very well.  But if we do that and talk about how we're impacting families, we're making decisions that really do help those working hard every single day in our lives to be better, people will see that the Republican values line up with that agenda.",

And we also try to the best of our knowledge and abilities to do due diligence to make sure that U.S. taxpayer dollars are being spent for the purposes that they were appropriated and that they are as effective as they can be.\" Meanwhile, FOX News has learned Ohio Republican Congressman Jim Jordan wants Chairman Adam Schiff to call the whistle-blower to Capitol Hill to testify.

And, on Tuesday, we had evidence on both sides of how big this problem could be. But we also had some silver linings in it. We saw, in Virginia, the Republicans lost the suburban seats in Northern Virginia, in the Richmond area. On the other hand, they gained seats in New Jersey in the Assembly in suburban areas. And they lost historic battleground -- or excuse me -- strongholds in the southeast part of Pennsylvania. But on the other hand -- and this is why -- we have spent a lot of time in last couple of days talking about Kentucky and about the suburban problem there. It is a problem for the governor, not for the rest of the ticket. For the first time since -- I think since the Civil War, the Republicans took every statewide constitutional office, except the governorship, which has been held for -- out of -- since 1973, by Republicans for only eight years out of the last 30-some odd years. But Bevin got 705,000 votes. Right underneath him, the Republican candidate for attorney general got 823,000, running 118,000 votes ahead of the Bevin. The agriculture commissioner, 821,000 votes, 116,000 ahead, the auditor, 779,000 votes, the secretary of state candidate 746,000. At the very bottom of the Republican statewide ticket is the state treasurer, 856,000 votes, ran 151,000 votes ahead of the governor. And if you look at it, a large part of it is the difference in the suburbs. South of Cincinnati and Northern Kentucky are Canton and Boone, two suburban counties. And then just north of Louisville is Oldham, which is a suburb of Louisville. And in each of those counties, the attorney general candidate ran 11 points ahead of Governor Bevin. So in there is a lesson, that if you're a Republican who can appeal to suburbanites, you can hold those voters. And we will see how it goes for Republicans next year, but they better be focused on it and they better have a plan.",

For example, if you take a look here in Texas, we lost two members of Congress, one in Houston, one in Dallas, who were Republicans, and, on the other hand, the Republican -- the Republican governor gets reelected by a 13-point margin. So it's -- those suburbanites are being very discriminating in who they're voting for and who they're voting against. And last fall, like in most midterm elections, they had a chance to send one message to the president of disapproval and hope that he does better. But at the same time, they tended to support Republicans with a strong image who represented their values and views. So the Republicans have got -- this is not inevitable that they lose the suburbs. They have got to focus on what will keep the suburbs, bring them back slightly, and keep what they have got there. And I think there are two issues. One issue is, who do the Democrats nominate? Because the further left the Democratic nominee is, the better the Republicans can do in the suburbs, but only if they make a focused,, disciplined case about how bad, say, Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders would be.",

The 2 cents thing is a little disarming here, but you should realize that, in the case of people like Jeff Bezos, it would mean another $7 billion in taxes, in the case of someone like Bill Gates, closer to $15 billion, at a minimum, in taxes. And that's just to get started. So the 2 cent thing can be a little misleading. Nevertheless, that is the issue she's pounding. It's making her very popular with her base and maybe making her closer to the Democratic nominee. But what happens after that? Well, anyone's guess. We have got market watcher John Tamny here, our own Charlie Gasparino. Welcome to both. John, she is trying to say it's no big deal for these guys. There, you have someone like a Bill Gates saying, well, it is a big deal, and I'm open to paying $20 billion vs. $10 billion. So I guess he's open to a doubling in his taxes, but maybe $100 billion is where he draws the line. But what do you think of this back and forth?",

Signs that China and the U.S. may, may, may be moving to roll back tariffs, even though that was disputed later in the day, had stocks rolling to record highs, the Dow and the S&P 500 finishing there, the Nasdaq a little shy. This another reminder that, if you want to know what dictates Wall Street's move, it is everything to do with trade and zilcho to do with, well, impeachment. Stocks were losing some of their gains earlier on a report that everyone is not exactly everyone when it comes to getting rid of these tariffs or taxes on some goods here. We're kind of confused on this, but, by and large, the tariffs are going to go, and that was enough to ignite this rally. Now, we're going to talk to Republican South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem about all this. You talk about a state that has a lot of agricultural interests at stake, what she thinks about all of this. In the meantime, first to FOX Business' Blake Burman with what he's hearing on this confusion of the tariffs. First off, Blake, on, off, delayed, what?"

      "utterance": "May, may, may is how you started your show, Neil, and I think that's a very, very, very good way to put it. There's been a lot of headlines moving over here in the last 24 hours or so. Let me just try to try to tick through it and work through it with you here. According to sources who we have been talking to, the idea of rolling back tariffs is still being mapped out at this point. But the markets earlier today certainly love the comments that were coming out of Beijing from a government spokesperson there, a spokesperson for China's Commerce Ministry, who said at one point the following, saying -- quote -- \"Both sides agreed to remove the additional tariffs imposed in phases, as progress is made on the agreement. If China and the U.S. reach a phase one deal, both sides should roll back existing additional tariffs in the same proportion simultaneously.\" Now, so far, no one back here in Washington within the Trump administration has put forth an official comment. And that includes the U.S. Trade Representative's Office, which is leading the negotiations for the U.S. However, a source familiar with the negotiations here at home says the comments made in China today are on the correct course. The question then, Neil, becomes which tariffs might be in play, and when might they be rolled back? Again, the U.S. side not publicly touching this one. But according to Chinese sources, China wants tariffs lifted as the deal is being negotiated and comes together, with all of the tariffs being rolled back before the completion of a full trade deal. Those Chinese sources also say the U.S. wants some tariffs to stay in place after an eventual deal is completed. This is seen as ensuring the China keeps up their end of a trade deal after implementation. Now, if there is a trade one deal -- let's just bring this back to trade one first -- phase one for a second. If there is a phase one trade deal, sources on both sides say the tariffs for December 15 likely will not go into effect. As for the timing of this, Neil, we are also told from sources on both sides that they are still operating under the APEC timeline, which is trying to have phase one wrapped up by the end of next weekend. That is when APEC, of course, was supposed to take place, no longer taking place. Important to note, with all of this, Neil, when you look at all of the headlines, the comments in China, what we're seeing at home and the headlines that have moved the markets up and down, as of this very moment, as we talk today, there is still not a phase one trade agreement at this point for President Trump and President Xi to sign, though some are feeling that -- some are feeling optimistic that this is moving in the right direction -- Neil."

In this agreement, which, if you remember, Neil, when I was in Congress, I was on Ways and Means, and we negotiated these trade agreements. We faced not just access to market challenges. We also faced regulatory challenges. So, we have got language in this agreement that is going to deal with some of those regulations that China used to punish our farmers. If we can remove those regulations and open it up and be treated much more fairly, that's really going to help us at the end of the day."

Are there mechanisms, from what you have been told, to make sure the Chinese are going to follow up on those purchase ideas?"

And that's what I think a lot of my knowledge that I had in working with Ambassador Lighthizer when I was in Congress, I'm bringing to the seat now as governor of a state of South Dakota, where our number one industry is agriculture. That experience is incredibly important. And, remember, Neil, back when we negotiated the USMCA agreement, we got language in there that helped set the table for this China agreement. So if we could get USMCA ratified and through the House, if Pelosi would get that finalized, that helps this Chinese agreement get completely finalized as well. So, phase one looks very encouraging, but let's not forget about the other markets that we need to finish. And the only one holding that one up is Nancy Pelosi. USMCA is incredibly important, and it could be done within a matter of weeks."

And what was a common pattern throughout, Governor, as you probably know better than I, is that women are not big Republican supporters, especially suburban women, suburban voters, period. Is this a problem for the party? This is the third type of election like that running since the president was elected where that has been the case."

But if you look at who the Republican House leadership has recruited to be candidates for Congress, there are some incredible women in that group. They are young. They're businesswomen. They're family-focused, and they're out there running hard to really represent the demographics of this country. So I have long said, Neil, there's not women's issues, there's not men's issues, there's issues and a women's perspective on every single one of them. I think that women just bring a different perspective to every single issue. And that's why it's important that we're weighing in on policy. So we need to maybe go out and tell our story better. That's maybe what Republicans don't do very well. But if we do that and talk about how we're impacting families, we're making decisions that really do help those working hard every single day in our lives to be better, people will see that the Republican values line up with that agenda."

So I look at what -- the fact that he campaigned on, what he's actually accomplished has been incredibly important for families and those who are pursuing the American dream. So we live in a world, Neil, that is addicted to being offended, and we love to be offended by everybody. And I'm just going to ask the American people to quit wasting time on that.

A year-and-a-half ago, all the experts said there's no way in the world that we could have the economy that we have, wages through the roof and jobs through the roof and the stock market through the roof.

This is a serious matter. And I know people can come to their own conclusions about whether it rises to the level of an impeachable offense, but in no world is it OK for a president to seek support and help from a foreign government in investigating a political opponent and trying to influence the outcome of an election. And that's what we have seen, not just from the synopsis of the phone call -- it wasn't a transcript, but the synopsis -- but these other witnesses that have come forward. So I think it's OK for people to come to different conclusions as to whether that rises to an impeachable offense, but I don't think in any way, shape or form should it be tolerated or somehow considered a new norm.

      "utterance": "Well, look, they should be worried. 2018 showed a lot of defections in the Republican suburbs. The question is, are they going to come back? And, on Tuesday, we had evidence on both sides of how big this problem could be. But we also had some silver linings in it. We saw, in Virginia, the Republicans lost the suburban seats in Northern Virginia, in the Richmond area. On the other hand, they gained seats in New Jersey in the Assembly in suburban areas. And they lost historic battleground -- or excuse me -- strongholds in the southeast part of Pennsylvania. But on the other hand -- and this is why -- we have spent a lot of time in last couple of days talking about Kentucky and about the suburban problem there. It is a problem for the governor, not for the rest of the ticket. For the first time since -- I think since the Civil War, the Republicans took every statewide constitutional office, except the governorship, which has been held for -- out of -- since 1973, by Republicans for only eight years out of the last 30-some odd years. But Bevin got 705,000 votes. Right underneath him, the Republican candidate for attorney general got 823,000, running 118,000 votes ahead of the Bevin. The agriculture commissioner, 821,000 votes, 116,000 ahead, the auditor, 779,000 votes, the secretary of state candidate 746,000. At the very bottom of the Republican statewide ticket is the state treasurer, 856,000 votes, ran 151,000 votes ahead of the governor. And if you look at it, a large part of it is the difference in the suburbs. South of Cincinnati and Northern Kentucky are Canton and Boone, two suburban counties. And then just north of Louisville is Oldham, which is a suburb of Louisville. And in each of those counties, the attorney general candidate ran 11 points ahead of Governor Bevin. So in there is a lesson, that if you're a Republican who can appeal to suburbanites, you can hold those voters. And we will see how it goes for Republicans next year, but they better be focused on it and they better have a plan."

They're losing support in the suburbs among college-educated voters, particularly women. Now, it's not across the board. For example, if you take a look here in Texas, we lost two members of Congress, one in Houston, one in Dallas, who were Republicans, and, on the other hand, the Republican -- the Republican governor gets reelected by a 13-point margin. So it's -- those suburbanites are being very discriminating in who they're voting for and who they're voting against. And last fall, like in most midterm elections, they had a chance to send one message to the president of disapproval and hope that he does better. But at the same time, they tended to support Republicans with a strong image who represented their values and views. So the Republicans have got -- this is not inevitable that they lose the suburbs. They have got to focus on what will keep the suburbs, bring them back slightly, and keep what they have got there. And I think there are two issues. One issue is, who do the Democrats nominate? Because the further left the Democratic nominee is, the better the Republicans can do in the suburbs, but only if they make a focused,, disciplined case about how bad, say, Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders would be."

So he's got to find a way to be more presidential, which is sort of -- he's been a disruptive candidate and disruptive president, but he's got to find a little way to mellow things out between -- sometime between now and the election, so people say, I can -- you are doing good things on the policy side, and I think I can put up with everything else for the next four years. Otherwise, we're going to have real problems in key states like Pennsylvania and Michigan and Wisconsin, where -- where he had some weakness in 2016 in the suburbs already, but it was offset by strength in sort of blue-collar, working-class areas, nontraditional Republican sources of support."

This year, they nominated a four-term attorney general that was very popular. He served 16 years in state office and had been a district attorney up in the north part of our state for eight years prior to that. So he had never lost an election. He was popular. And he -- and he ran a good race. But, at the end of the day, we had overwhelming turnout by conservatives throughout our state. And we ended up with a six-point victory. And we feel very, very good about the outcome."

And what's remarkable about it -- and you know better than others -- is that both parties seem to be very successful now at bringing out crowds that would normally not be there in an off-year election or a special election. I'm wondering what that says about next year, especially in your state?"

And I think the reason for that is because people are engaged. People understood the importance of this election. And, honestly, the fact that President Trump stumped here for us late in the campaign, as did Vice President Mike Pence. And then, by the same token, former President Barack Obama did robo-calls for my opponent..."

Do you buy that, that Republicans have to sort of look over their shoulder here, that maybe something's going on in the South that they are taking for granted?"

      "speaker": "REEVES",

When you talk about President Trump and winning Pennsylvania winning Michigan in his original election in 2016, the -- races are competitive now. There are more people paying attention. There are more people getting their news and getting their information from online and other sources. And so, with that being the case, I don't think we're necessarily taking it for granted, but I do think you have to run a campaign like we ran our campaign. We literally went to every county in the state. We tried to earn the vote of every single Mississippian. And when you look at the returns, what you find is that we did -- we performed very well, throughout our state. This was a statewide victory. And I think Republicans across the South, just like Republicans across the country, can be competitive, and must be competitive. But they got to work hard to do it, and they can't take anything for granted."

If it's $10 billion now, he could pay $20 billion. The 2 cents thing is a little disarming here, but you should realize that, in the case of people like Jeff Bezos, it would mean another $7 billion in taxes, in the case of someone like Bill Gates, closer to $15 billion, at a minimum, in taxes. And that's just to get started. So the 2 cent thing can be a little misleading. Nevertheless, that is the issue she's pounding. It's making her very popular with her base and maybe making her closer to the Democratic nominee. But what happens after that? Well, anyone's guess. We have got market watcher John Tamny here, our own Charlie Gasparino. Welcome to both. John, she is trying to say it's no big deal for these guys. There, you have someone like a Bill Gates saying, well, it is a big deal, and I'm open to paying $20 billion vs. $10 billion. So I guess he's open to a doubling in his taxes, but maybe $100 billion is where he draws the line. But what do you think of this back and forth?"

It cannot be stressed enough that an extra dollar in Bill Gates' pockets is exponentially more stimulative to the economy than an extra dollar in my pockets. And the reason for that is, I would spend it. But what really drives economic growth is saving and investment. When Bill Gates has a lower tax bill, we all benefit, given the basic truth that there are no companies and no jobs without investment first. The rich invest. And so a tax on them puts a bullseye on everyone who's not rich."

    {
      "speaker": "CHARLIE GASPARINO, SENIOR CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Yes, it is movable. They do save and invest more than the average person, which definitely helps the economy. I think the bigger problem with Warren is not that she wants to tax billionaires and millionaires a little more. It's the other side, the spending side. It just doesn't add up. And when you start adding it up, the Medicare for all, just all the crazy program she has, I mean, she probably wants to forgive student debt as well. I mean, I'm not sure she went there yet, but she will be. When you start adding up everything she wants to do, forget about billionaires and millionaires. This is the average Joe is going to get screwed. It's just logic. And even her Democratic opponents know it. Even guys like the most woke people in corporate America are people like Bill Gates, they're people like Jamie Dimon. They are Democrats. They are -- they used to be called liberal."

Now, maybe that was for dramatic effect, but that it would be that damning. Now, there are others that say she can only do this if she has a Democratic House or Senate with her. What are your thoughts on this?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TAMNY",
      "utterance": "Well, I think there is a lot of drama here for exactly the reasons you allude. She would have to have Democrats go along with her. She would have to have control of Congress, which I doubt she would have. She would lose it very quickly. And so her ability to do one-tenth of 1 percent of what she wants to do is probably pretty limited. But it concerns me when Bill Gates says, oh, I'd happily pay $20 billion. It's got to be remembered that a tax on Bill Gates as a tax on me, because politicians don't take in that money to stare lovingly it. As Charlie alludes, they have all these spending plans. Every extra dollar they get means more control over the economy by politicians."

Even if she doesn't have the Senate and the House -- and, obviously, if she does, that's really bad for the markets, they will tank -- but she's -- just being president, you can do so much damage, I mean, in terms of regulation and things of that nature."

To a man and a woman, what they seem to be saying is, when we leave this Earth, we're certainly not going to leave it to Washington. We're going to leave it in better hands.

The other two are believed to be in Saudi Arabia. And the FBI is encouraging them to come to the United States for trial, saying, in part -- quote -- \"We encourage them to return to the United States to face these allegations. As with all defendants in the United States, they are presumed innocent until proven guilty, and they have a right to a fair trial and to defend themselves in federal court\" -- end quote. Now, the two former Twitter employees are being accused of violating the terms of their employment to access private information on certain users, in exchange for money and other benefits. Who were they spying on? People that were considered to be dissidents within the kingdom of Saudi Arabia? There's a third man. He was a go-between. He allegedly took the information from the men and to the government of Saudi Arabia, though no officials have been named in this complaint. What kind of information are we talking about? E-mail addresses, phone numbers, I.P. addresses, dates of birth, presumably the kind of information that users need to establish an account and the kind of information that would help you locate them if you needed to. So many privacy issues here, Neil, and this is just another example, another layer of this lengthy conversation that we have been having."

The other part of the argument is -- and if you read the language of the bill, importantly, she's not actually saying that schools would have to keep students in school to 6:00. She's just saying they would have to be open until 6:00, so that students could stay there, parents pick them up longer, and that gap in child care, which, really, one of the leading costs for working families is child care.
