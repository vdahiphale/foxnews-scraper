A mysterious Russian is granted special entry, then pulls a bait and switch on a naive private citizen, a citizen who happens to be a Trump. So, who is colluding now? But it's obvious why the media embraced this latest Russian story, because what that woman did to Donald Jr. is exactly what the media does to the public every day since the election. They bait, then switch. They promise something juicy that when you hear them out, it is emptier than a protester's resume. And when their hysteria is met with public disgust, what does the media do? Rather than admit to their compulsive overselling, they blame those who question them. Suddenly, it is your fault for being skeptical. It is your fault when their mania trumps back, it is your fault for their addiction to re-litigating the past.   They say when you are a hammer everything becomes a nail. When you are a bitter hack, everything becomes collusion -- except actual collusion.",
