But obviously, there was another very big story this week, the second summit meeting between President Trump and Kim Jong-un involving perhaps the world's foremost nuclear threat and a surprising outcome, no deal being made. But on the other two cable news networks, one story dominated. It was practically all Cohen all the time. On Wednesday night, U.S. time, as the summit was about to get underway, MSNBC in primetime devoted just two minutes to the nuclear talks, 132 minutes to the Michael Cohen saga. On CNN which has the most reporters around the world, in primetime, it was under two minutes to the Vietnam summit, 141 minutes for Michael Cohen. On Fox in primetime, 85 minutes for the U.S. and North Korea, 66 minutes for the Cohen saga. Now, let's move to Thursday night. President Trump had broken off the talks so it was the new story. It would have been easy to portray this as his failure. And yet, MSNBC primetime: five minutes for North Korea, 88 minutes for Cohen. CNN primetime: eight minutes for North Korea, 32 minutes for Cohen. Fox primetime: 37 minutes for North Korea, 38 for Michael Cohen, an even split.  Now, look, I get that Cohen is the sexier story and of course ratings may be a factor, but the other networks made an editorial decision that pounding away at the Cohen hearings even a day later and listening and replaying the best sound bites was far, far more important than an effort, even unsuccessful effort, to get rid of Kim Jong-un's nuclear arsenal.

With so many liberals and television Hollywood, It's refreshing to see a prominent member of a Republican family make the grade in morning TV. That's it for this edition of Media Buzz. I'm Howard Kurtz. You know, we have been on the air for an hour. President Trump gave his address to the CPAC conference yesterday, he spoke for two hours with no commercial breaks. People who love the president love the speech. People who don't like the president didn't like the speech. But the man can certainly talk. He doesn't use a lot of notes. He said he was going off-script and he did. Hey, check out my new Podcast, Media Buzzmeter. We rife on the day's five hottest stories. We don't talk for two hours, maybe 20 minutes or so. But you can subscribe at Apple iTunes, Google Play, or FoxNewsPodcast.com. I also hope you like our Facebook page. We post my daily columns there, original videos.

Plus, an expose on Facebook censors. The staffers who removed violent or offensive content say they are so traumatized that they are smoking dope, having sex in stairwells or embracing conspiracy theories. I'm Howard Kurtz and this is \"Media Buzz.\" CBS, NBC, and ABC in a rare move joined the cable news networks in airing the House testimony of the man who was Donald Trump's fixer for a decade. Michael Cohen is also a convicted felon who soon will be serving a three- year prison term for charges that include lying. This time, he says, he's telling the truth.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)"

Guy, the nonstop coverage of Cohen is still going on, focused on all the negative things that Michael Cohen said about his former client. The fact that he is a convicted liar is sort of a subsidiary point."

      "speaker": "GUY BENSON, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",

So, I think generally the media, I would have liked to see a bit more skepticism about this road to Damascus moment and thinking about the motives that he has to do the what was me, I'm so sorry, I was bamboozled by this guy. He now has to ponder to the resistance because he has torched his bridge to Trump world, he will have a life after prison, and he's spoon feeding the left exactly what they want to hear. Now, some of it is very likely true and in fact he has proven that some of it is true with documentation. I think on the flip side of the media argument from my side of the aisle, the conservative press, I think that too many of us were too willing to go along with the White House and the Republicans with this all hands on deck, this man is a liar, you cannot believe a word he says, because he actually testified a few things that are helpful to the president, and I think it's disingenuous to say he's a complete liar except for these three things which we like."

I mean, look at all the news networks taking this. They clearly saw this could be a moment that could be leading to the downfall of the president potentially. We don't know."

But you're right, Democrats go in there and they are sort of leaning on a key witness to be bringing out some details that could be juicy. Republicans go in there and they say, look, don't believe this guy, he doesn't want to have a bad sentence, this is good for him to be here, and he can't be trusted. It's so polarized."

Much of what Cohen said, whether it was about the hush money payments he participated in, he said it was at the president's direction to Stormy Daniels, or continuing to work on the Trump Tower Moscow project throughout the campaign important but we kind of already knew most of that because of previous reporting."

    {
      "speaker": "BENSON",
      "utterance": "There was tons of damaging stuff from his testimony. I think you can't spin it some sort of unvarnished positive for the president. He came across as a man of very low character, from a fellow man of very low character. It was sort of a mess to watch. As I alluded to in my first answer though, how there were some interesting developments when he was asked, Cohen, do you have evidence of collusion, did you witness collusion? He said, no, I may have suspicions but I have no evidence. He also said in a crucial piece of testimony that he did not visit Prague in the Czech Republic which was a key piece of that infamous Steele dossier which discredits that document which is the basis of so much of this investigation. So, again, if the Republicans on the panel had been a little bit less obsessed with just trashing this guy and calling him a liar and a sleaze which he admitted being both of those things --"

      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Yeah."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "The one exception was Michael Cohen testifying that Roger Stone had called Donald Trump in December 2016, given him advance where the WikiLeaks dump of Democrat e-mails, but Stone denies that. Meanwhile, Sara, the president gave a two-hour speech at CPAC yesterday calling Cohen's allegations \"BS,\" kept to use the whole word, and then dumping on the press saying journalists are sick and they take his jokes and make them serious stories. They play dirtier than anyone who has ever played the game."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FISCHER",
      "utterance": "But to Guy's point, the president is going to leverage the one point he does like and say, look, all this is not true except the point that sort of says I didn't direct Cohen to like, that part, the no collusion part. That is totally fair game. I think this is just an example of everyone takes out of the hearing what they need to get out of it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "On that point, Clarence, I want to focus on one moment that has gotten an enormous amount of days of media coverage. It had to do with Republican Congressman Mark Meadows bringing an African-American woman who works for HUD, her name is Lynne Patton, to stand behind him as to sort of counter Michael Cohen's charges of racism, and then it brought -- we will just play a little bit of reaction from Democratic Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REP. RASHIDA TLAIB (D), MICHIGAN",
      "utterance": "The fact that someone would actually use a prop, a black woman, in this chamber, in this committee, is alone racist in itself."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "So, Lynne Patton says she was not a prop. She was just there speaking for him in person. Tlaib later apologized to Meadows. Are you troubled by this incident or pundits just made way too much of this one moment?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAGE",
      "utterance": "I know across the black community as much as I know it. There was a bit of awe struck by the moment of seeing Mark Meadows calling over this black woman to stand there looking like the liberal stereotype of a token. I'm not saying she is but this is what it looked like. It was just a weird scene in the first place. We have found out that Miss Patton was trying to -- has been campaigning to get a reality TV show of her own. It's no sin. Almost everybody watching is doing that these days. But it just sort of adds to the media circus."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Yeah, and she's giving a lot of interviews. You know, ordinarily, Sara, Cohen's account of various racist comments by Donald Trump would be explosive, but in this presidency, we're sort of used to those allegations as the whole country and so forth."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FISCHER",
      "utterance": "It's become totally awash. And this is a breakthrough moment. You have a hearing that is supposed to have so much power around something completely different with the president is being sidetracked  by this conversation around race. But at the end of the day, we've had so many of these conversations involving the president that quite frankly it's going to be something that we're probably not even going to be talking about next week."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Let me turn to the BuzzFeed story because you recall that a few weeks ago, BuzzFeed reported President Trump directed his long-term attorney Michael Cohen to lie to Congress, personally instructed him to lie. Robert Mueller's office disputed that. BuzzFeed stuck by the story. So, in the testimony, Michael Cohen was asked about this, having to do with his account about the Trump Tower Moscow project. Here is what he said."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "COHEN",
      "utterance": "And so I lied about it, too. Because Mr. Trump had made clear to me through his personal statements to me that we both knew to be false and through his lies to the country, that he wanted me to lie."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "So, Cohen is saying, well, he didn't directly tell me to do this. I just interpreted that was his intent. What does that do to the BuzzFeed story?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BENSON",
      "utterance": "Well, the BuzzFeed story is still usually problematic for BuzzFeed because what they reported was that Trump directed Cohen to lie under oath and he denied that. Cohen did on the stand saying, I felt like I knew what he wanted me to do which was to lie, which was a very different thing than being ordered or directed to do something. It is plausible, but that is not what BuzzFeed reported. There is still this outstanding problem that they have, which is the true reporters on that piece, one of them when it first broke said that they had seen documentation that proved that this directive had occurred. One of them said they had seen it, the other one said they had not seen it. And to this day, they still can't get on the same page."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Just briefly, Clarence, Cohen said it is not his job to be a fact checker for BuzzFeed, and why didn't he speak out on this earlier. But even if he is telling truth as he sees it, that's not what BuzzFeed reported."

    {
      "speaker": "PAGE",
      "utterance": "I mean, this is -- that argument has already started and continues like all the other arguments. I called this issue awash right now. It is true BuzzFeed is on the defensive for good reason. They have to back up that story, if you will. But this whole affair is really, like I said, a political process or media process to try (ph) Donald Trump over the media, through the media and make an issue out of everything and interpret it from the advantage point they are speaking from."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "That is why it has been such an enormous media story this week. Let me get a break. Ahead, the Democratic House passes a gun control bill.

The president actually is referring to -- shouldn't be referring to a manuscript, a book pitch to publishers for Cohen when he was still on the Trump train to do positive book about Donald Trump.

We do not know for sure if Kim Jong-un complained to President Trump about it. Sarah Sanders was asked about that and she said, I wouldn't say that. But when they went to go in for what is called the pool spray for the dinner where President Trump was having dinner with Kim Jong-un, Mick Mulvaney, the secretary of state, and a couple of other folks on the North Korean side, there were four reporters, Mason and Lemire and reporter from Bloomberg and one from Los Angeles Times, who were not allowed into that pool spray.

Now, some of us like me were staying at the Melia Hotel, but every time we go to a city around the world with the president, we set up what is called the White House Filing Center. We usually set this up a couple weeks in advance. It costs tens of thousands of dollars. When Kim Jong-un got to that train station at China-Vietnam border, rumors started flying around at the Melia Hotal that he was upset that we were in his hotel. And just before that filing center officially opened on Tuesday morning at 11, we got an e-mail from the White House saying we were moving our filing center over here to the International Press Center. I mean, logistically it was a huge hurdle to get over. But I think principle more than anything, in the 10 years that I have covered the White House off and on through Clinton and through Bush and now President Trump, we have never had to shut down and move a file center in a hotel because there was a complaint by a foreign leader."

But on the other two cable news networks, one story dominated. It was practically all Cohen all the time. On Wednesday night, U.S. time, as the summit was about to get underway, MSNBC in primetime devoted just two minutes to the nuclear talks, 132 minutes to the Michael Cohen saga. On CNN which has the most reporters around the world, in primetime, it was under two minutes to the Vietnam summit, 141 minutes for Michael Cohen.

Now, look, I get that Cohen is the sexier story and of course ratings may be a factor, but the other networks made an editorial decision that pounding away at the Cohen hearings even a day later and listening and replaying the best sound bites was far, far more important than an effort, even unsuccessful effort, to get rid of Kim Jong-un's nuclear arsenal.

At the same time, for a few days, there have been stories from anonymous aide who were afraid he would give away the store, that he was so anxious for positive headlines.

I think there are things that are reasonable to criticize, Trump for on North Korea, but I feel like it's incumbent on journalists to look at the last few decades of history.

But at the end of the day, the media was pretty hard on the president for this one. He decided to take a walk. I think anyone that's' going to label this as a huge massive failure -- I mean, the whole diplomacy with North Korea has not been successful to date.

    {
      "speaker": "JASHINSKY",
      "utterance": "Right. It's not conveying the truth."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LIASSON",
      "utterance": "Well, there are two things. The truth that it doesn't convey is the House majority was made up of moderate women, not of people like AOC. She represents an 85-percent Democratic district. The majority of female -- new female Democrats are not like her. That's a failing of the media to not point that out."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Well, no, I would go further. I would say the media are probably helping the Republicans paint the Democrats as a socialist party."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LIASSON",
      "utterance": "Yes, yes, yes, yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Because this is not a competition. She is brilliant in getting media attention. But she and a few others are kind of representing the face of the party..."

      "speaker": "LIASSON",
      "utterance": "Yes."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "LIASSON",
      "utterance": "I totally agree, except there is one thing that I disagree with. The reason there is not a cover somewhere else of Republican women shaping the future because in 1989, there were 13 Republican female members of the House. In 2019, there are still only 13 Republican members -- female members of the House."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JASHINSKY",
      "utterance": "Yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LIASSON",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "JASHINSKY",
      "utterance": "There were some great women running in 2018 that got basically zero attention."
    },

      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "That's right."
    },

      "speaker": "JASHINSKY",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "In a troubling piece on some of Facebook's content reviewers whose job is to remove violent or offensive postings, the Verge reports it's an environment where workers -- dark jokes by committing suicide and then smoke weed during breaks to numb their emotions. Their employees desperate for a dopamine rush amid the misery, but found having sex in stairwells where people develop severe anxiety while still in training and continue to struggle with trauma symptoms long after they leave. Joining us now, Shana Glenzer, a technology analyst and executive here in Washington. So, the Verge says that these sensors, I call them, work for a Facebook contractor, they sign nondisclosure agreements. So, apparently, Mark Zuckerberg's company doesn't want people to know that some of these workers are so traumatized because they have to watch repeatedly things like people being killed."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHANA GLENZER, UPRIGHT CONSULTING",
      "utterance": "I mean, their job is stressful, it's an understatement of the year, when you're out there smoking pot on their break just to cope. And what Facebook has done here is they committed to double their workforce and they do it quickly, so they spent a lot oft these centers. But, really, in the United States, this is a huge cost- cutting opportunity for Facebook."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Why?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GLENZER",
      "utterance": "Paying these employees, these outsource centers are making something like 100K less a year than a lot of the average Facebook employees."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "The average job in this facility is said to be $28,000 a year, not exactly what you get in memo part. And so, these are the people who are responsible in protecting us or protecting Facebook's users from the really violent or disturbing or offensive, more racist stuff. And yet, these reports, as some of them in conspiracy theory, what do you make of that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GLENZER",
      "utterance": "Well, these folks are reviewing thousands. I mean, hundreds a day, thousands a week of these posts that are coming up, whether it's conspiracy theories or violence. And yes, they are normal people when they go in. But it seems reports show some of them are -- starting with conspiracy theories. And while Facebook has multiple checks in place to try to make sure that these individual views don't influence work. You got to imagine that if they start thinking the way that these conspiracy theories, you know, are being posted, it's influencing how they're applying the rules."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Right. Well, for example, one of them is promoting the idea that the earth is flat. A former employee said he began to question certain aspects of the holocaust. And we're talking really disturbing stuff here. Facebook says look, they are showing examples of when they are in the process of being hired. Then they try to screen people who have coping skills. But you get to this question of community standards, because that's what this is supposed to be upholding. And some of these seem to be ambiguous, even arcane, which troubled me. What do you make about the standards Facebook is using?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GLENZER",
      "utterance": "First of all, there are a lot of them and they're complicated. And some of them seem to make no sense. One of them, one post, I want to make sure I get it right. It's hard to even say. But a post saying that autistic people, for example, should be sterilized doesn't come down from the site, because that characteristic isn't a protected characteristic. Autism isn't."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Even if they say they should be sterilized, you can't say, if you're talking about race or gender."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GLENZER",
      "utterance": "Correct."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "If you have autism then it's OK."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GLENZER",
      "utterance": "That is according to their standards, an OK post to continue to keep up online. It wouldn't come down."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Also, my favorite N word can stay up because you're making a positive reference, but you're still using the N word."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GLENZER",
      "utterance": "If you're calling your friends that, it stays up online."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "So what does this tell you about Facebook standards? And by the way, I wasn't super duper -- technology is supposed to solve all of these problems. We have about half a minute."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GLENZER",
      "utterance": "Artificial intelligence is supposed to be the way of the future when it comes to content moderation. But clearly, we're a long way from there. Facebook needs to take a close look at some of these practices as they move forward."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Yeah. And I guess the standards, in some degree, subjective. But it just makes you wonder why people always complain about this and in political terms, too. Why is it taken off and this was allowed to remain? Shana Glenzer, great to see you."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GLENZER",
      "utterance": "Thank you."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Thanks so much for coming in. Still to come, the corporate shake-up that could affect CNN. And the co- host of fourth hour of the Today Show is a pretty prominent Republican. Stay tuned."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "CNN President Jeff Zucker maybe expanding his portfolio as part of a shake-up at AT&T whose takeover in Warner Media was just upheld on appeals. Zucker will also assume oversight of Turner Sports, which carries a lot of pro-basketball, that according to the Wall Street Journal. And he's not a tall rookie, having overseen NBC Sports when he ran that network. CNN declined to comment as part of the corporate shake-up. Turner President David Levy abruptly resigned along with HBO Chairman Richard Plepler who built that movie network into a powerhouse. The new co-host of the fourth hour of the Today Show is Jenna Bush Hager."

      "utterance": "If anyone were to ask, we were like we don't know."
    },

      "utterance": "No, it feels humbling and I can't believe it. My dad just wrote me three words, which made me weep. He said very proud dad."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Worst kept secret, I didn't know about it. Obviously, a former president's daughter has some advantages. But there are drawbacks in terms of expectations, just ask Chelsea Clinton, who kind of bombed in her short time as a special correspondent for NBC. With so many liberals and television Hollywood, It's refreshing to see a prominent member of a Republican family make the grade in morning TV. That's it for this edition of Media Buzz. I'm Howard Kurtz. You know, we have been on the air for an hour. President Trump gave his address to the CPAC conference yesterday, he spoke for two hours with no commercial breaks. People who love the president love the speech. People who don't like the president didn't like the speech. But the man can certainly talk. He doesn't use a lot of notes. He said he was going off-script and he did. Hey, check out my new Podcast, Media Buzzmeter. We rife on the day's five hottest stories. We don't talk for two hours, maybe 20 minutes or so.
