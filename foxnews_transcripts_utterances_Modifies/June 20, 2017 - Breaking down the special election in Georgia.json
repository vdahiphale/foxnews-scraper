Until you realize that donations came from 7,000 Californians and only 800 from his own district. And that tells you who is behind him: People who don't even live there. Just like Ossoff. Celebrities like Alyssa Milano, Chelsea Handler, George Takei -- they are all over this election. So as the media obsesses over Putin's failed meddling in our elections, how is this not similar? Here you have one state meddling in another. How is California not Russia and Georgia not America? The only difference are the celebrities who are way more obnoxious than Putin.  I get it, California, Georgia, they're in same country. But still, you have aristocratic outsiders instructing the rubes on how to vote, undermining an election thousands of miles away. Talk about interference, obstruction. So, why would these interlopers do that? It's an emotional thing. The Trump election was humiliating, it was painful. So this election offers celebrities their psychotherapy. They are using the district as a giant valium to soothe their bruised egos. Now, that emotion is missing on the other side. Here's why: If you ask Trump voters in October, what would you prefer to win the election with Trump and lose the seat in Georgia or lose to Hillary and still have that seat, I think you know the answer.  So no matter what happens tonight, who wins or loses, it's only because of Donald Trump winning. That still has to hurt and will still need more therapy.   All right, you got Hollywood, California, rich liberals. Jesse, also New York millionaires from the East colluding to steal an election.",

Until you realize that donations came from 7,000 Californians and only 800 from his own district. And that tells you who is behind him: People who don't even live there. Just like Ossoff. Celebrities like Alyssa Milano, Chelsea Handler, George Takei -- they are all over this election. So as the media obsesses over Putin's failed meddling in our elections, how is this not similar? Here you have one state meddling in another. How is California not Russia and Georgia not America? The only difference are the celebrities who are way more obnoxious than Putin. I get it, California, Georgia, they're in same country. But still, you have aristocratic outsiders instructing the rubes on how to vote, undermining an election thousands of miles away. Talk about interference, obstruction. So, why would these interlopers do that? It's an emotional thing. The Trump election was humiliating, it was painful. So this election offers celebrities their psychotherapy. They are using the district as a giant valium to soothe their bruised egos. Now, that emotion is missing on the other side. Here's why: If you ask Trump voters in October, what would you prefer to win the election with Trump and lose the seat in Georgia or lose to Hillary and still have that seat, I think you know the answer. So no matter what happens tonight, who wins or loses, it's only because of Donald Trump winning. That still has to hurt and will still need more therapy. All right, you got Hollywood, California, rich liberals. Jesse, also New York millionaires from the East colluding to steal an election."

I don't think a surgical strike is actually possible on the nuclear weapons when they have weapons aimed at Seoul, South Korea, and what are the consequences of that. The containment strategy hasn't been worked that well. We had the six party talks.

They're going to say, you know, I'm helping America to fight ISIS but at the same time they're helping Syria and Iran fight America. So they're talking out of two sides of their mouth. All we care about is defeating ISIS, but there's going to be this big power vacuum so everyone is just trying to claim territory after we defeat them. And are we going to let the Iranians to slide in or the Syrians and the Russians slide in because it creates like you said before, this regional kind of trade route were these pipelines go through and business goes through and they have the access to the Mediterranean and it squeezes out the Kurds and it squeezes out the Saudis. So, you know, it just looks like, you know, everybody who voted for Donald Trump to kind of get out of this stuff and all of a sudden it looks like we're getting in the middle of this stuff again.

      "speaker": "GUILFOYLE",
      "utterance": "Well, I see it a different way. I think that if you have something to share and you are in the White House, you have an obligation to talk and discuss with the media what's going on. But then you have, I think the best solution would be to have -- Dana and I talked about this and points that you have to be able to put forward and proper some things to give them to be able to talk about -- talk about your accomplishments. I wouldn't be always be on defense. You would come forward with programs or ideas, things that you have to actually give them something to write about, to talk about, and to investigate. Otherwise, they'd think you're playing catch up every day and they're taking -- making shots at them but they've already been very public and transparent saying they're re-working their communications strategy and their team. So, maybe for a second they might not have as many briefings. And President Trump is somebody that tries things, you know, he does things by a different playbook. He's not afraid to take chances or to make changes and approach things in a different way. And I think we can give him the opportunity to do that, to continue the relationship with the press, and driving forward, you know, his agenda that he promised the American people. I think it can be done in a better way and I think they're trying to do that."

      "utterance": "Well, for what Kimberly said, I mean, it seems to me you would handle a more professional manner to make your point. But the idea of a briefing, it just seems so essential and elemental to me. In fact, I think what's going on here is the White House had considered doing away with the daily briefing. Just doing away with it and they got resistance, tremendous resistance including from Fox News to say, no, that's not kosher, you can't do that. And now they've simply tried to I think slowly, steadily, eliminated by saying, oh, you can't have pictures or you can't have sound or only certain people are admitted in the gaggle and the like. I just think it's not the way to do business in a democracy and I know that the president and many of his supporters feel that there is an unlimited amount of criticism directed at him specifically you mentioned CNN. But I just don't care who else is doing it. The press is not the enemy of the American people. And Donald Trump is not and should not see himself as some authoritarian figure who is going to trample our first amendment rights."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Well, I don't think he's trampling anyone's rights. I just think that 90 percent of the news media coverage about the president has been negative. That's where the enemy line comes in. Dana, when they don't give the briefing on camera, is that to punish the media for negative reporting or is that because they don't want to put someone out there that's just going to get annihilated on live television."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "Well, you know, I talked to Sean about it. I think that the White House benefits from having a daily presence on television to drive their story. But I also think the media is missing a huge story and that's because they're so much of a hyper focus on the White House that there's an entire big federal government out there and there are not reporters every day -- you would see reports out of the things that are happening at transportation, with labor, or EPA. Well, sometimes, a little bit of EPA. You can even find any story about Rick Perry at the Department of Energy that there's all sorts of things happening across the federal government, happening very quietly, and the media isn't focusing on it because they're so hyper focused on the White House itself. So, if the media wants to actually broaden out and do its duty to citizens and cover the federal government, get out of the briefing room and go see some of those other places."

And that frustrates them. He dumped to them for twitter. That's his new girlfriend. They are the ex and they're just like,, why don't you look at me? You know, I'm here. That's what this is."

What do you think, Dana?"

      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "Well, I think that he has and he also, unlike other presidents, like 43, would try to ignore it, right, and so he wouldn't talk about it. President Trump is very open about talking about how that he feels like he's being treated unfairly and his supporters hear that and so actually I think even Democrats would say, yes, that's true, because they're part of the criticism. The thing I would say to the White House is I wouldn't worry about the daily tracking poll for the next four months. I would just focus relentlessly on trying to get a legislative win which I think they will be able to have him sign a legislation on health care before Labor Day, and then they'll be on their way to working on tax reform. If he can actually sign a couple of bills before say October 1st, because the debt ceiling done, I think they'll see those approval numbers go up and obsessing about it right now until you have legislative wins is probably like a dog chasing its tail."

Why are Republicans all of a sudden starting to decline in terms of support in President Trump?"

      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "I think what Dana touched on as he hasn't been able to drive through any legislative accomplishments the way that people expected to with the large majorities that they have. I don't put a ton of stock in these CBS polls because CBS predicted Hillary would win handily, predicted that Trump would lose North Carolina, that Trump would lose Pennsylvania, and that Trump would lose Wisconsin. He won all three. I also don't understand, you know, Trump's approval rating is kind of in the high 30s if you're going to believe the poll. But consumer confidence is way up. Consumer optimism on home sales, on wages, on the markets, things are on the right track, all almost at record highs. I don't see how that jives with his personal approval numbers. It doesn't make sense to me."

      "utterance": "-- because a third of the Americans say that his approach to the Russia investigation is hurting him. Only 20 percent of Republicans agree with the chair of the Republican Party that they should stop Bob Mueller's investigation. Do you think that's the problem?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUILFOYLE",
      "utterance": "Well, the problem is we are where we are right now and they're going to see this through to its end. It's unfortunate because then he can't discuss all the positive things that have been happening with increased values in 401K and the stock market and jobs, and we're not hearing about that because there is a flood in the media, the mainstream media about negative stories, 97 percent, and there really isn't much air or oxygen left for other accomplishments. So that's why I think you tie this into the communications department as well who really need to get those stories out there and put forward the president's agenda so the people actually have a clear understanding of what else is going on besides this whole Russia story that so far there has been no evidence or proffered."
