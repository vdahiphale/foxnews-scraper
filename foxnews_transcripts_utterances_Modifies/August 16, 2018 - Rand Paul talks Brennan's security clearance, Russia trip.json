Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell should get huge plaudits for making Trump's judicial confirmations a priority. Yet, conservatives are still frustrated. But why? Well, because the most notoriously activist and the most reverse circuit court in the nation, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals out west, is still sitting with seven vacancies.  Before Trump took office, the Ninth Circuit was totally lopsided, with 18 Democratic and seven Republican appointees. Trump has managed to get one nominee through from Hawaii and another from Idaho is likely to be confirmed later this year, plus, a Seattle attorney was nominated to the court this summer.   But still, now more than half of the 13 circuit court vacancies remaining nationwide are out on the Ninth Circuit. And what's more concerning, is that the White House has yet to nominate anyone for the three open seats in California. I can think of two good nominees. The reason for this lies with the time-honored practice known as blue slipping court nominees. That is the courtesy of giving a state two senators an opportunity to say yay or nay to the judicial nomination of a president going forward. And the Democrats, by the way, already accusing the Republicans of messing with this 100-year-old tradition, which is kind of funny considering that in 2013, Democrats themselves chose to go what they call nuclear and ended the ability of opponents to filibuster trial and appellate court nominations. And when Harry Reid, by the way, announced the change, it was all of course, making perfect sense.",

Well, it's time for senate Republicans to use their own common sense to bust the current standoff with California senators, Kamala Harris and Dianne Feinstein. As all these seats sit empty on the Ninth Circuit, it continues on its progressive merry way. So, is it time to formally ditch the slip?  The argument against doing that after all could be that this could all come back to bite Republicans big time when a Democrat wins the White House down the road. And I get that, I understand it, but given how the Ninth Circuit has stymied key elements of the president's agenda, I think we are kind of pass the point of worrying about Senate tradition.   The Ninth Circuit is completely out of control, from reversing the presidents travel ban last year to blocking Trump on sanctuary cities, it's essentially been acting like an extension of the anti-Trump resistance. There is another option, though, that is short of killing the blue slip altogether, and it would just be to minimize its effect, in other words, the views of the home states senators are still a factor in selecting judicial nominees but they are not the equivalent of an automatic veto over any presidents pick.  But we need to face facts. Even if the president fills all the open seats with terrific constitutional conservatives, the makeup of that Ninth Circuit runaway court will still be 16 Democrat appointees and 13 Republican nominees. But certainly, there would be a better chance to have balance than any random three-judge panel, right? The odds are better that way. And that wouldn't just be better by the way, for the president or his agenda. It would be better for the rule of law, the constitution, and the country. And that's \"The Angle.\" And it's not just the federal judges, the latest example in that horrifying case out of New Mexico involving a remote compound, child abuse, and radical Islamic extremists.  Astoundingly, Judge Sarah Backus is granting bail to five adults in the abuse case, claiming prosecutors failed to identify any specific threat to the community. Now, that's the spite (ph) prosecutors alleging that these guys were training kids to use all those firearms to carry out terror attacks at schools. How is this possible?  Joining us now with reaction is Attorney Harmeet Dhillon who works on these types of cases along with constitutional law attorney Troy Slaten. Harmeet, let's start with you because I think the regular folks watching this cannot believe their ears, where we had the authorities who visited this compound, said that , you know -- the first police officer on the scene, said he had never seen conditions like this. It was so sad, so depraved, kids were starving, and of course, a body of a child found on that compound, as well. So now, four of the defendants have $20,000 bail set? What?",

It's a $20,000 signature bond, meaning that if they don't show up for their court dates, they have to promise to pay the government $20,000, which is obviously ridiculous. If you have somebody who is potentially going to be put away for life on terror charges, a $20,000 promise to pay is not a deterrent for them to flee or commit more crimes.   This is as a result of New Mexico's very liberal bail law. They did bail reform in 2016 and the chief justice of the -- one of the justices of the Supreme Court added some additional conditions to that so that at the very early stage, the prosecutors have to show why \"clear and convincing evidence\" that the person is either a flight risk or a danger to the community. Now, let's review the evidence here. Here, as you said, you have 11 children who are starving and being trained, according to prosecutors, to commit crimes including terror crimes, rapid recharging of guns, and are being abused. You have a dead child, you have numerous weapons, you have hundreds of feet of tunnel under this compound, and you have somebody who is being held on a kidnapping charge in another jurisdiction. So, if this isn't clear and convincing evidence that a, there's a flight risk, and b, there is a potential danger to the community, I don't know what is.

And so what we are seeing here is the rekindling of Al-Qaeda 2.0, just starting to resurface on a tactical level. I think that Al-Qaeda has had a significant amount of time since 2011 since Osama bin Laden was killed. All of the P.R. and all other military operations have shifted to ISIS primarily in Iraq and in Syria. And after President Trump came into power, he was extremely aggressive by unleashing our forces, not just our Special Ops, but larger quantities of conventional light infantry, to really flush out those pockets. So, it's given Al-Qaeda, Laura, a pretty significant amount of time to regroup.

And that means that they are now operating in what I have called nomad terror, which is essentially they can function independently from central leadership, any type of real organization, and they can go online and they can train and recruit on this dark web and begin to carry out attacks, not unlike we saw in London just the other day.",

They are openly embracing socialism, they are telling the truth about abortion. Remember, they said abortion is just health care, which is their favorite euphemism for it. We now see the truth. It is about power, it is about profits. That is what abortion is about. And you made a really great point, by the way, in the very beginning, Laura, when you talked about the number of women who are no longer -- who are prevented by entering the workforce because of Roe versus Wade. Those are 20 some million women, by the way, mostly minorities, who are no longer in the workforce, who are not contributing to our country, aren't paying taxes, aren't paying Social Security, aren't inventing the cure to cancer, aren't running for president.

      "utterance": "In only 20 months, he has nominated and the Senate has confirmed 26 new district court judges, and a record 24 federal appeals court judges, with two more appellate court nominees scheduled for votes this week. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell should get huge plaudits for making Trump's judicial confirmations a priority. Yet, conservatives are still frustrated. But why? Well, because the most notoriously activist and the most reverse circuit court in the nation, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals out west, is still sitting with seven vacancies. Before Trump took office, the Ninth Circuit was totally lopsided, with 18 Democratic and seven Republican appointees. Trump has managed to get one nominee through from Hawaii and another from Idaho is likely to be confirmed later this year, plus, a Seattle attorney was nominated to the court this summer. But still, now more than half of the 13 circuit court vacancies remaining nationwide are out on the Ninth Circuit. And what's more concerning, is that the White House has yet to nominate anyone for the three open seats in California. I can think of two good nominees. The reason for this lies with the time-honored practice known as blue slipping court nominees. That is the courtesy of giving a state two senators an opportunity to say yay or nay to the judicial nomination of a president going forward. And the Democrats, by the way, already accusing the Republicans of messing with this 100-year-old tradition, which is kind of funny considering that in 2013, Democrats themselves chose to go what they call nuclear and ended the ability of opponents to filibuster trial and appellate court nominations. And when Harry Reid, by the way, announced the change, it was all of course, making perfect sense."

The senate is a living thing and to survive, it must change as it has over the history of this great country. To the average American, adapting the rules to make the Senate work again is just common sense."

    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Just common sense, OK. Well, it's time for senate Republicans to use their own common sense to bust the current standoff with California senators, Kamala Harris and Dianne Feinstein. As all these seats sit empty on the Ninth Circuit, it continues on its progressive merry way. So, is it time to formally ditch the slip? The argument against doing that after all could be that this could all come back to bite Republicans big time when a Democrat wins the White House down the road. And I get that, I understand it, but given how the Ninth Circuit has stymied key elements of the president's agenda, I think we are kind of pass the point of worrying about Senate tradition. The Ninth Circuit is completely out of control, from reversing the presidents travel ban last year to blocking Trump on sanctuary cities, it's essentially been acting like an extension of the anti-Trump resistance. There is another option, though, that is short of killing the blue slip altogether, and it would just be to minimize its effect, in other words, the views of the home states senators are still a factor in selecting judicial nominees but they are not the equivalent of an automatic veto over any presidents pick. But we need to face facts. Even if the president fills all the open seats with terrific constitutional conservatives, the makeup of that Ninth Circuit runaway court will still be 16 Democrat appointees and 13 Republican nominees. But certainly, there would be a better chance to have balance than any random three-judge panel, right? The odds are better that way. And that wouldn't just be better by the way, for the president or his agenda. It would be better for the rule of law, the constitution, and the country. And that's \"The Angle.\" And it's not just the federal judges, the latest example in that horrifying case out of New Mexico involving a remote compound, child abuse, and radical Islamic extremists. Astoundingly, Judge Sarah Backus is granting bail to five adults in the abuse case, claiming prosecutors failed to identify any specific threat to the community. Now, that's the spite (ph) prosecutors alleging that these guys were training kids to use all those firearms to carry out terror attacks at schools. How is this possible? Joining us now with reaction is Attorney Harmeet Dhillon who works on these types of cases along with constitutional law attorney Troy Slaten. Harmeet, let's start with you because I think the regular folks watching this cannot believe their ears, where we had the authorities who visited this compound, said that , you know -- the first police officer on the scene, said he had never seen conditions like this. It was so sad, so depraved, kids were starving, and of course, a body of a child found on that compound, as well. So now, four of the defendants have $20,000 bail set? What?"

      "utterance": "It isn't even bail, Laura. So, it's worse than that. It's a $20,000 signature bond, meaning that if they don't show up for their court dates, they have to promise to pay the government $20,000, which is obviously ridiculous. If you have somebody who is potentially going to be put away for life on terror charges, a $20,000 promise to pay is not a deterrent for them to flee or commit more crimes. This is as a result of New Mexico's very liberal bail law. They did bail reform in 2016 and the chief justice of the -- one of the justices of the Supreme Court added some additional conditions to that so that at the very early stage, the prosecutors have to show why \"clear and convincing evidence\" that the person is either a flight risk or a danger to the community. Now, let's review the evidence here. Here, as you said, you have 11 children who are starving and being trained, according to prosecutors, to commit crimes including terror crimes, rapid recharging of guns, and are being abused. You have a dead child, you have numerous weapons, you have hundreds of feet of tunnel under this compound, and you have somebody who is being held on a kidnapping charge in another jurisdiction. So, if this isn't clear and convincing evidence that a, there's a flight risk, and b, there is a potential danger to the community, I don't know what is. And the judge went out of her way to say to the prosecutors that, oh well, this seems like an unconventional lifestyle that you are describing here."

And apparently, the prosecutors, according to the judge, didn't do that. Now, this judge has a bit of a reputation. There was another case where people were up in arms because of a -- in a low bail set involving another individual. We'll show his picture right here. Another individual and it was another case of abuse and the bail seemed low, $10,000, and people were not happy about that.

And you know, the prosecution included in their evidence to the judge a handwritten terrorist manifesto about what they wanted to do and, you know, of course, the prosecutor wasn't able to bring these children into court to testify themselves because, a, they are small children, b, they're, you know, probably in a hospital recovering from this abuse. So, you know, this judge went on to make some gratuitous comments. She accused the prosecutors of playing on religious prejudice because the prosecutors mentioned in the court that these are Muslim rituals that were being done that torture these children leading to the death of one of them. And the judge said oh, well, I can't take their religion into consideration. Nobody was asking her to take their religion into consideration. It's the specific acts of the fact."

A disturbing new report from the U.N. finds the terror group showing surprising levels of resilience and is now stronger than ISIS in places like Somalia, Yemen, and South Asia. For more, we are joined by counter terror veteran Aaron Cohen. Aaron, I read this report and I just read a report about what was happening in Iraq and in Afghanistan, specifically in Afghanistan, where our forces and the Afghan forces are losing some ground against the Taliban, and now this. What do you know and what do we need to know as Americans?"
    },

      "speaker": "AARON COHEN, COUNTER-TERRORSIM EXPERT",
      "utterance": "Well, first of all, Osama bin Laden's son, Hamza bin Laden, who is 29-years-old, and you know, sees himself as sort of the next young gun on the street. He's publicly come out and taken over for his dead father and wants to rekindle the Al-Qaeda brand. And as we know with terrorism over the years in I0srael, this is a very large psychological war and the fact, you know, that is run by fear. And so what we are seeing here is the rekindling of Al-Qaeda 2.0, just starting to resurface on a tactical level. I think that Al-Qaeda has had a significant amount of time since 2011 since Osama bin Laden was killed. All of the P.R. and all other military operations have shifted to ISIS primarily in Iraq and in Syria. And after President Trump came into power, he was extremely aggressive by unleashing our forces, not just our Special Ops, but larger quantities of conventional light infantry, to really flush out those pockets. So, it's given Al-Qaeda, Laura, a pretty significant amount of time to regroup. But from what I understand, like with any other terror group that we have taken down in Israel or have smashed in Israel, what happens is you have pieces of these organizations which smashes into hundreds, if not thousands of small pieces and they are able to operate and what they are doing is they are going dark. And that means that they are now operating in what I have called nomad terror, which is essentially they can function independently from central leadership, any type of real organization, and they can go online and they can train and recruit on this dark web and begin to carry out attacks, not unlike we saw in London just the other day."

Might come hard on this thing and then back off if you find out that's not what it supposed to be. But it sounds like its terror. It sounds like it's inbred. It sounds like it has sporadic nomad terror camp. And so it's very disturbing and it is something that I almost feel like we're going to see more of because it is that easy to set up. And you've got kids who are in hospitals being hidden in witness production. I mean, this is very real. And I think it needs to be treated very real and I think Hamza bin Laden is very real and I think that ISIS being taken down is also significant because Al-Qaeda just went boom and so, all of it needs to be treated like terrorism."

I wrote a letter to the FBI director last January does he still have clearance. But with John Brennan, I think what the left is ignoring is that I think he should have had his clearance revoked for cause. You know, he leaked information that came out in the media, that we had a double agent in Yemen -- remember when we were going after the underwear bomber? There still is a bomb maker in Yemen. He leaked that his media. Two people, Richard Clarke, who had a security clearance, and then he went on television saying oh, not to worry, we have a double agent in Yemen.

You get a lot of respect, congressman, because you put yourself out there day in and day out in your district, and other congressmen and women should not be shrinking from doing town hall events. No way. Go out and preach the gospel of economic growth. I think is good for all people. By the way, speaking of immigration, Congressman, I've got to ask you about this wild story from your home state, I think it was officials just arrested this guy, Omar Ameen, a suspected ISIS member. He's accused of killing an Iraqi police officer in Sacramento but he came to the United States as a refugee, and he was even able to apply for a green card. Isn't this exactly why the president wanted an aggressive travel ban and aggressive vetting? Of course, we've heard that this constant refrain of a warning from the left."

They are protesting me there, and the federal government is arresting Omar Ameen, who came to the country, was a member of ISIS and Al Qaeda. He got approval to come to America but he didn't come directly here. He first then went to Iraq, killed the police officer, and three months later comes to America. And why does he come to California? Because they advertise that they want to be a sanctuary state. He's sitting in Sacramento. The feds are able to arrest him, the FBI has been looking at him since I think 2016. This is why the president is correct. He was sitting there -- you should vet these people. He was just a refugee. That is why he was in Turkey. He was part of ISIS."

When I hear Chelsea Clinton speak about all the money that the economy has gotten because of, I guess, more than 44 million abortions in the United States, which is a staggering figure, since 1973 and Roe, that that would improve the economy. And to that I say, to monetize life, to me, it's pretty dehumanizing, to a lot of Americans. And how much would 44 million Americans, how much would they have added to the U.S. economy, let alone inventions they might have invented or breakthroughs in medicine -- I mean, every child gone as a loss. But for Chelsea, it's a gain. So who is dehumanizing whom here?"

But I don't know, coming off the Omarosa thing, I don't like anyone being called a dog. I don't think the president should have gone there. He calls everybody, though, and that is kind of his lingo, New York lingo. But I don't know, when I heard that, I was like, wow, that is what we are using to justify 44 million abortions. I thought they were supposed to be safe, legal, and rare. Is 44 million rare?"

      "speaker": "RACHEL CAMPOS-DUFFY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "No, absolutely not. And first of all, I'm really enjoying this moment of transparency in the Democrat party. They are openly embracing socialism, they are telling the truth about abortion. Remember, they said abortion is just health care, which is their favorite euphemism for it. We now see the truth. It is about power, it is about profits. That is what abortion is about. And you made a really great point, by the way, in the very beginning, Laura, when you talked about the number of women who are no longer -- who are prevented by entering the workforce because of Roe versus Wade. Those are 20 some million women, by the way, mostly minorities, who are no longer in the workforce, who are not contributing to our country, aren't paying taxes, aren't paying Social Security, aren't inventing the cure to cancer, aren't running for president. So again, I actually appreciate her honesty and transparency about what abortion really is about. It's about a person."

And finally, we want to end tonight remembering the life and unbelievable talent, never be another one like her, Aretha Franklin, who passed away today at age 76. Aretha got her start in the church pews singing gospel music, so it's only fitting to close things out with one of her extraordinary gospel performances. Good night from Washington.
