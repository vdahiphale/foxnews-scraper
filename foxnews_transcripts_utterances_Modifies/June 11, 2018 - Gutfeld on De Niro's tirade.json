And the clenched fists at the end, that really drove it home. It looks like he was pressing a 2-pound weight in a Jenny Craig commercial. Look at it again. It's so cute. It's like he found out the restaurant serves JELL-O or that he won a $10 scratch-off or he scored a cameo in \"Jersey Shore,\" or had his first number two in a week. Thank you, FiberCon.  What a sad end for a great actor. He went from \"Raging Bull\" -- \"Raging Bull\" -- to this.",
