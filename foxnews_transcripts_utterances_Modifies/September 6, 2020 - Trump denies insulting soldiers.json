President Trump and numerous top officials are strongly denying an explosive report by the Atlantic that he repeatedly disparaged American soldiers. Editor in chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, cites four unnamed officials familiar with the conversation saying Trump cancelled a visit to honor World War I soldiers at a French cemetery in 2018. Extensively because of rain, saying why should I go to that cemetery. It's filled with losers, and calling the 1,800 marines suckers for getting killed.",

The Trump administration has seen so many of these information operations where current or former government officials get reporters to allow them to be anonymous, to spread narratives that turn out -- You know, you find out days, weeks, months, or sometimes years later, that the narrative that they spread was false. And so what's important for reporters to do here, if they want to participate in information operation, which I would caution them to be thinking about whether that's a good idea. Make sure that you include all of the on-the-record refutations from government officials. I think we're up to 10 of or 12 now from firsthand accounts in many cases, the contemporaneous evidence including government documents that dispute the story, and even just the years of photographic evidence of how Donald Trump acts around disabled vets, how he makes trips to Walter Reed, how he likes to bring them into the Oval Office, how he's shown hugging and kissing on them and what not.

You can say, well, on the one hand, he does lots of things for vets. On the other hand, look at what he said about John McCain. You can build a case either way. But in the case of an anonymous source, without knowing specifically who was making this claim, how close they were to the potential situation, were they really there and overheard it, or is this part of the game of telephone.

Jennifer Griffin of our own network has confirmed this, corroborated this, Washington Post, New York Times. But in addition, Howie, you have you to look at a pattern of behavior.

She was doing her job. Now, it's fine for the president to attack the story. But he really needs to stop trying to cancel journalists based on reporting he doesn't like. And on that point, Mollie, here's what Jen Griffin told Neil Cavuto yesterday. She said deep throat was an unnamed source, doesn't make what he said untrue. My sources are unimpeachable.

I want to be very clear about what is confirmed when someone talks to anonymous sources.   What's confirmed is that anonymous sources are talking. It doesn't confirm the underlying claims. We know that the Russia collusion hoax was spread through numerous government officials making claims based on what reporters felt was credible. It turned out it was all false. So we have to be careful. Yes, you can talk to people who you can grant them anonymity if you want. It doesn't mean other people have to believe the underlying claims.

So at the end of the day, that I as voter sit down and say --  I think voters look at the pattern of behavior of this individual with regard to truthfulness and with regard to these types of comments about these individuals. Look, there are people that probably believe what he said won't vote for him anyway, Howie, especially in the military. The military are typically very pro-Republican. And the president is the incumbent Republican candidate.

I think the media really should just not care so much about the fact that the riots are hurting the Democratic Party and just report honestly about what is happening.

But I do think that certainly Biden is getting much more favorable coverage throughout the course of not just this week, but the last month, the last year. This sort of bar has been very much lowered for Joe Biden. And so on an issue like this where you begin to actually see a lot of voters who previously said, look, I'm sympathetic to black lives matter.  I believe we want to see racial injustice addressed in this country but are now seeing what's happening in Portland, which seems completely divorced from any sense of trying to pursue racial injustice.

He picked the woman with the most liberal voting record in the Senate as his running mate. And so this is something that the Trump campaign is really trying to emphasize.

So, isn't it Donald Trump with his denials that pushed the story into the media stratosphere? GAYLE TROTTER, COMMENTATOR, HOST OF \"RIGHT IN DC\" PODCAST: No. It is surprising how much traction the story got because that was based on hearsay if not outright manufactured about this visit in the first place.

And if the system is good as the mainstream media has been pushing for months, then if anyone were to try and vote illegally a second time, the system would catch them.

Editor in chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, cites four unnamed officials familiar with the conversation saying Trump cancelled a visit to honor World War I soldiers at a French cemetery in 2018. Extensively because of rain, saying why should I go to that cemetery. It's filled with losers, and calling the 1,800 marines suckers for getting killed."

      "utterance": "Joining us now to analyze the coverage, Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at the Federalist and Fox News contributor, Kristen Soltis Anderson, a Washington Examiner columnist and Fox Nation Host, and in Los Angeles, Leslie Marshall, a radio host and Fox News contributor. Mollie, as I said, Jeffrey Goldberg claims four unnamed sources and reporting on the French cemetery. I know you have a major problem with anonymous sources. Certainly, the story would be stronger with on-the-record comments. But as I learned during my years of investigative reporting, sources are sometimes the only way to get a story."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Right. All reporters use anonymous sources. You don't want to overuse anonymous sources or allow anonymous sources to run information operations through you. The Trump administration has seen so many of these information operations where current or former government officials get reporters to allow them to be anonymous, to spread narratives that turn out -- You know, you find out days, weeks, months, or sometimes years later, that the narrative that they spread was false. And so what's important for reporters to do here, if they want to participate in information operation, which I would caution them to be thinking about whether that's a good idea. Make sure that you include all of the on-the-record refutations from government officials. I think we're up to 10 of or 12 now from firsthand accounts in many cases, the contemporaneous evidence including government documents that dispute the story, and even just the years of photographic evidence of how Donald Trump acts around disabled vets, how he makes trips to Walter Reed, how he likes to bring them into the Oval Office, how he's shown hugging and kissing on them and what not. And so you want to make sure you include all the information if you decide you want to take part in the information operation that's going on."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Fair points. You know, the White House did initially decline to comment to the Atlantic. Kristen, also from the magazine on a visit with John Kelly to the Arlington grave where his son is buried, Trump reports to have said I don't get it. What was in it for them? Now, Kelly declined to comment. But based on my understanding of journalism, this was clearly run by him, a friend of Kelly's. A retired four star general was quoted in the piece. President has now attacked John Kelly as having been exhausted and dysfunctional as his White House chief of staff. So it's created this kind of guessing game."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KRISTEN SOLTIS ANDERSON, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Well, the worry about anonymous sources is without knowing the name of the folks who are claiming that this statement was made. It's hard to assess their credibility. So while on the one hand, you can point to things President Trump has done publicly to either confirm or deny your suspicions about this. You can say, well, on the one hand, he does lots of things for vets. On the other hand, look at what he said about John McCain. You can build a case either way. But in the case of an anonymous source, without knowing specifically who was making this claim, how close they were to the potential situation, were they really there and overheard it, or is this part of the game of telephone. It's hard for your average voter to know how much credit they should give to this."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Also a fair observation. Now, Jeffrey Goldberg has done many defense stories over the year. Fox's Jennifer Griffin has confirmed key elements of this story based on her sources, as has the Washington Post. But Leslie, this isn't just a routine White House denial. You have several top aides that were there in France, including Sarah Huckabee Sanders, saying on the record this didn't happened. John Bolton trashes (ph) Trump in his book saying he never heard it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LESLIE MARSHALL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Well, I think maybe they weren't standing with him when he said it. Look, there are two things here. Jennifer Griffin is an outstanding journalist. And to me, you've got to look at not only if there's an anonymous source, but who was reporting that source. Jennifer Griffin of our own network has confirmed this, corroborated this, Washington Post, New York Times. But in addition, Howie, you have you to look at a pattern of behavior. And the president, I mean, with the mocking of the disabled journalist, the president, you know, saying negative things about a Gold Star family, a grieving mother, saying to a mother of fallen soldier in Niger, you know, that he knew what he signed up for, the things that he said about John McCain, and also his level of defense about it. You know, my mom used to say if you accuse somebody of something and they defend themselves again and again and again, they're probably guilty, because if you're not, it doesn't bother you. So to me, the pattern of behavior speaks to the journalist's claims."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "I just want to say. President Trump has called for Jennifer Griffin to be fired. This is one of the fairest, most conscientious reporters on the planet, a former war correspondent, has done this throughout various administrations. And she wasn't offering opinion. She was doing her job. Now, it's fine for the president to attack the story. But he really needs to stop trying to cancel journalists based on reporting he doesn't like. And on that point, Mollie, here's what Jen Griffin told Neil Cavuto yesterday. She said deep throat was an unnamed source, doesn't make what he said untrue. My sources are unimpeachable. Why haven't they come forward? She says you can see how people get destroyed when they get cross-wise with the president, your thoughts."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "Well, Jeffrey Goldberg said that the reason why he didn't name his sources is because they didn't want to receive mean tweets. So on the one hand, we're supposed to believe these are high level officials who are bravely coming forward, except they're not giving their name. I want to be very clear about what is confirmed when someone talks to anonymous sources. What's confirmed is that anonymous sources are talking. It doesn't confirm the underlying claims. We know that the Russia collusion hoax was spread through numerous government officials making claims based on what reporters felt was credible. It turned out it was all false. So we have to be careful. Yes, you can talk to people who you can grant them anonymity if you want. It doesn't mean other people have to believe the underlying claims. The story hasn't been confirmed, just the fact that anonymous sources are spreading the story has been confirmed. And there's a really big difference between those two things."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Right. Leslie, in the Atlantic, some of this confirmed by other news organizations, disparaging attributed to the president about the late John McCain. But of course, going back to the last campaign, Donald Trump said, you know, McCain -- he likes people who weren't captured, referring to his POW status."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MARSHALL",
      "utterance": "Again, this speaks to the pattern of behavior. This is not -- you know, quite frankly, it's very sad that these remarks aren't shocking coming from the president. And when you also speak of the pattern of behavior, the president has a pattern of behavior of not telling the truth. So at the end of the day, that I as voter sit down and say -- I think voters look at the pattern of behavior of this individual with regard to truthfulness and with regard to these types of comments about these individuals. Look, there are people that probably believe what he said won't vote for him anyway, Howie, especially in the military. The military are typically very pro-Republican. And the president is the incumbent Republican candidate. So I don't -- but I do think, and I've heard from on my radio show some vets that weren't shocked but it was just sort of rubbing salt in an old wound that reminded them with the election coming up of who their commander in chief is."

    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",

By the way, the president this morning continuing his assault, calling Jeffrey Goldberg a conman, and saying people should write to the Atlantic's majority owner, Laurene Powell Jobs, Steve Jobs' widow, to express their dissatisfaction, and Kristen, what about the timing. I mean, the Atlantic is a liberal, anti-Trump magazine was for impeachment early on, comes out two months before the election. Does that make people question it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ANDERSON",
      "utterance": "Well, I think the timing of this, of course, being right before the election. It certainly indicates that these sources would quite like to move voter sentiment with these statements. I don't know that the timing necessarily to me affects the credibility of the story one way or the other. I do wish we had some names, on-the-record, saying, yes, I heard this. That would make it much easier to assess whether it's credible or not."

      "utterance": "Mollie, Biden says Trump is fanning the flames. And when the president defends his supporters in Portland for shooting paintball and pepper spray at liberal protesters, it does make many in the media say, see, he's egging his side on."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "The media have really struggled with how to cover the violent riots that have hit the country nationwide. For many months, they claimed that they weren't happening or that they mostly peaceful. As soon as they found that they were hurting the Democratic Party's electoral chances, they began begging Joe Biden to finally say something. And they began claiming that the riots were happening, but they were Trump's fault and whatnot. I think the media really should just not care so much about the fact that the riots are hurting the Democratic Party and just report honestly about what is happening. It's getting to the point that when you see the media claim these are mostly peaceful protests. The average person thinks they must have been particularly violent last night."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Kristen, the president got, let's say, sceptical coverage of his trip to Kenosha. He met with law enforcement officials. Joe Biden got much more sympathetic coverage, in my view. He met with the family of Jacob Blake who was, you know, shot in the back seven times during an attempted arrest. Jacob Blake, by the way, has just put out a video calling for calm from his hospital bed. So my question is the media say that Trump's playing to his base. But when Biden goes and talks mostly about racial injustice, isn't he playing to his base as well?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ANDERSON",
      "utterance": "I wouldn't say that when you're talking about the issue of racial injustice that they play to the base. Fighting racial injustice is something that's important to voters of all political stripes. We would all like to see less racial injustice in this country. So I'd push back against you a little bit on that one. But I do think that certainly Biden is getting much more favorable coverage throughout the course of not just this week, but the last month, the last year. This sort of bar has been very much lowered for Joe Biden. And so on an issue like this where you begin to actually see a lot of voters who previously said, look, I'm sympathetic to black lives matter. I believe we want to see racial injustice addressed in this country but are now seeing what's happening in Portland, which seems completely divorced from any sense of trying to pursue racial injustice. And it's just people who want to see the world burn, that's where you begin to see voters go I'm off this train."

You can make a comment as the leader of this nation. But certainly, you need to have due process. Everyone is constitutionally allowed that right. You're innocent until proven guilty. And you need to let the law play out in the court with the people and not the president's opinion."

I don't think we've seen that in the last -- and we definitely haven't seen that in the last several months. There are hundreds of millions of police interactions each year. Very few of them lead to violence, particularly against unarmed people. The media have not shown that story. They have not accurately described that story. They haven't talked about how police shootings are down in major cities by record amounts. This is something that's very important to tell, and so that the failures by certain -- a few certain individuals are put in accurate context. Because I think if you ask the American public because of the media coverage, they have this idea that police interactions are always this horrific hell scape, and that's not an accurate telling of events."

But if every time the president said something that was indelicate, it blew up the media headlines for weeks, which is sometimes does. It's a distraction away from the critical stories that matter most to voters. What do you think voters care about more? The president used a really bad metaphor about golf in a very serious situation, or the fact that we still have this pandemic, the fact that we still have riots in the streets, the fact that we still have people who are protesting because for very justifiable reasons. We have a lot of big issues facing the country. And I'm not sure that this deserves wall to wall coverage."

But if the president had to put it in these terms, it's certainly -- he could have brought the focus to what you just said, Howie. And quite frankly, in the eloquent manner in which you just said it. When you have somebody who is going to be allegedly a paraplegic at this point, whose children will no doubt have a mental and emotional issues having watched their father being shot.

He changed his position on abortion to force people to pay for abortions, says he would, you know, sue nuns if he were elected. He picked the woman with the most liberal voting record in the Senate as his running mate. And so this is something that the Trump campaign is really trying to emphasize.

President Trump has called The Atlantic magazine article on disparaging soldiers a hoax, says the magazine made it up or the sources are lying. Editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg says he has four sources with direct knowledge. How does the president or your campaign know that The Atlantic sources are lying? ERIN PERRINE, TRUMP 2020 PRESS COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR: It's clear that The Atlantic sources are lying. There are 10 on the record sources that are publicly available now for everybody to see that prove this wrong. There are White House e-mails that prove that this story is false. And you have eight people of the 10 that have gone on the record with direct first-hand knowledge. These aren't sources. These are people who were really there and are out there saying that this is false. I think it's pretty clear here that journalism was abandoned, that journalistic integrity has to be in question here when you have four off the record anonymous sources who are trying to hide their identities instead of standing up to level such disgusting accusations against the president of the United States."

And this letter says from these veterans that they believe that the media is trying to meddle in the election and undermine the integrity of our nation with this reporting. Look at what the president does. You don't need unanimous sources. Look at the man's action. Look at the way he is when he goes to Walter Reed, when he's at Dover, welcoming the bodies home of our of fallen members, the work he has done to reform the veteran's administration. You look at the actions of this president. It's a commander in chief proud of his troops, proud of his soldiers, his sailors and his airmen.

What does that mean?"

Kamala Harris tweeting that along the same lines, as well, saying if you can give money to bail out these protesters, these rioters, that you should do so. Their actions speak louder than any words that Joe Biden finally made over 90 days after violence has erupted. Any day, there has been violence or unrest in the United States. President Trump has said, yes, you have the right to peaceably assemble, but you do not get to choose which laws you abide by. Violence has no place in this country. He has said he will every day provide federal resources to restore law and order. It's clear that Joe Biden who himself said that he would not send up the National Guard in these instances is siding with the violence instead of siding with trying to restore law and order to communities."

He met with local law enforcement. He brought Attorney General Barr and Chad Wolf there to have a conversation about what needs to change and how we can better support communities just like Kenosha. Joe Biden went for purely political reasons. There was no other reason for Joe Biden to go than to try to stoke political unrest in a city that was coming back from what has been an incredibly difficult few days for them. And you see the media just fawning over Joe Biden and trying to hit this president for going. It really shows the unfairness and the bias that exists in the media and in journalism against this president. This is why we have to fight every single moment of every day to try and get the truth out there because while the media will hold Joe Biden's hand and help him along the way, they want to try to tear down this president, and we are glad to stand up here --"

The president responded on Twitter, now they are trying to say that your favorite president, me, went to Walter Reed Medical Center, having suffered a series of mini-strokes, never happened to this candidate, fake news, perhaps they are referring to another candidate from another party. When CNN analyst Joe Lockhart, the former Clinton White House press secretary, asked on Twitter whether the president had suffered a stroke, the Trump campaign called for him to be fired. Joining us now to analyze the coverage, Gayle Trotter, host of the \"Right in DC\" podcast, and Mara Liasson, national political reporter for NPR and a Fox News contributor. Gayle, the president going off on fake news by denying he had a stroke. But no one in the media accused him of having a stroke. He did say that it was not true that vice president had been put on standby. Mike Pence says he doesn't remember that. So, isn't it Donald Trump with his denials that pushed the story into the media stratosphere? GAYLE TROTTER, COMMENTATOR, HOST OF \"RIGHT IN DC\" PODCAST: No. It is surprising how much traction the story got because that was based on hearsay if not outright manufactured about this visit in the first place. Presidents go to the doctor and there was scant evidence that there was anything unusual about this trip. I think the significance of this story is that if there is anything, it shows the media echo chamber and the lengths that they can go to invent stories out of thin air."

But this is not one of them because Michael Schmidt did not say the president went to Walter Reed because he had some mini-strokes. I would hope every time the president, any president, goes to the hospital, that the vice president is told that's happening. You know, if he needs anaesthesia or whatever, you're going to be on standby. But Joe Lockhart is not a journalist and what Joe Lockhart was doing was what operatives of both parties and Donald Trump as the foremost practitioner of this, say, oh, some people say Hillary Clinton is dying, hmm, some people say Joe Biden takes what did he call them, enhancements, some kind of enhancement drug for his senility. I think the stories I read about this were stories that pointed out that no one in the media accused the president of having a mini-stroke. I think he overreacted and he gave this story legs that it originally shouldn't have had or it didn't have."

This is exposing their very effort to have it both ways because they've spent months telling the American voters that mail-in balloting is secure and yet when the president points out an obvious weakness in mail-in voting, the media go berserk. It just shows that there are issues with fraud and coercion with mail-in voting. And if the system is good as the mainstream media has been pushing for months, then if anyone were to try and vote illegally a second time, the system would catch them.

      "utterance": "Thank you so much, Gayle Trotter and Mara Liasson. Still to come, how some don't think Nancy Pelosi's hair salon escapade is news and how a former Melania aide justifies secretly taping the first lady."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "When Fox reported that Nancy Pelosi had been seen in the San Francisco hair salon, as you can see her, not wearing a mask, it generated plenty of criticism since salons in that city have not been allowed to reopen. MSNBC mentioned the house speaker's embarrassment exactly once. Fox frequently followed up on the story. CNN briefly covered it a number of times but with little criticism of Pelosi."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHRIS CUOMO, CNN ANCHOR",
      "utterance": "Maybe she was listening to the president who said masks are weakness, who is always encouraging people to take off masks."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE",
      "utterance": "She didn't have a mask on. She wasn't following the rules. This is very, very clear now that she thinks there's a separate set of rules for her."

      "utterance": "The congresswoman defended herself to reporters and demanded that salon owner apologize."

      "speaker": "NANCY PELOSI, SPEAKER OF THE UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES",
      "utterance": "I take responsibility for trusting the word of the neighborhood salon that I've been to over the year many times. As it turns out, it was a set-up. So I take responsibility for falling for a set-up."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "That salon owner, Erica Kious, told Tucker Carlson, Pelosi's visit was a slap in the face, she lost a majority of her clients and staff during the six-month shutdown, and the speaker's comments were hurtful. Joining us now from New York is Kat Timpf of \"The Greg Gutfelf Show\" and a Fox Nation host. So, MSNBC weighs in exactly once. CNN, you know, as I say, not really criticizing Pelosi. Fox did dozens of segments on this. Would it be so different at the other two cable networks if this had been maybe the House Republican leader?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KAT TIMPF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Yes, but I think the reality is this is even worse. I saw a piece in The Washington Post also that was sort of mocking this, saying, huge scandal that Nancy Pelosi got her hair done. No, no, no. That's not the scandal. It's obviously the hypocrisy, right? I was glad at least at CNN. Don Lemon did sort of mention that. You messed up, say you messed up. It is because Nancy Pelosi has been so, so devoted to promoting herself as a sort of zero tolerance for violating rules when it comes to the coronavirus and the pandemic and social distancing. And it is unbelievably hypocritical to see her there after she's been saying even since June that we are long overdue for a mask mandate to see her there apparently not mandating one for her own face."

    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "By the way, her hair stylist, Jonathan DeNardo in a statement actually backed up the speaker, saying that the owner had approved the visit and also made several vitriolic and incendiary comments about Speaker Pelosi, suggesting this is political. I don't think we need a special prosecutor here but it has got --"

      "utterance": "Let me move on to this tell-all book, \"Melania and Me,\" by a former senior advisor and former friend, Stephanie Winston Wolkoff. She says in this book that Melania used private e-mail. That seems to be a legitimate story. She quotes what the first lady supposedly said, negative comments about other Trump family members. That strikes me more as gossip. But on \"The Rachel Maddow Show,\" here's what Wolkoff said about secretly taping Melania Trump."

      "utterance": "Melanie and the White House had accused me of criminal activity and publicly shamed and fired me and made me their scapegoat. At that moment in time, that's when I pressed record. She was no longer my friend."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Kat, does that justify secretly recording somebody who had been your friend for 15 years, that brought you into the White House, even though the job didn't work out and she was pushed out?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "Yeah. I mean, I certainly hope none of my friends are secretly recording me. But, look, I guess the bottom line is I'm not sure how much it matters. There was a headline about this in The New York Times that I thought was kind of hilariously self-aware. Who is this woman? Why should you care, right? Because even if there are tapes, even if she did tape, which she says she did, I'm not sure how much it matters because whenever these tell-alls come out, it's its own genre at this point, there's this breathless coverage on the left and people who are anti-Trump, but people who support Trump never really care. I mean, whatever is on there probably couldn't be as potentially damaging as an Access Hollywood tape in 2016. What happened after that? He became the president. So, we hear a lot of people on the left saying --"

By the way, Michael Cohen out with a new book absolutely disparaging the president but also excoriate himself. He secretly taped the president. The president's niece secretly taped the president's sister. You can see why people get upset about this."
