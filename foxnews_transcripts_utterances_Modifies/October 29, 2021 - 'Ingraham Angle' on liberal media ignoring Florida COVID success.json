      "sentences": "I'm Laura Ingraham and this is THE INGRAHAM ANGLE from Washington tonight. Well, Florida has the hottest economy in the country and among the lowest COVID case and death rates in the country. So why is the national media still attacking Ron DeSantis? Well, the governor is here. And he has a theory about that. Plus Biden slippery meeting with the Pope and why won't politicians stop dancing? Raymond Arroyo has it all in \"Friday Follies.\" And, and we have a special anniversary surprise at the end of the show, so be sure to stick around for that one. But first, \"Where's all the Men Gone?\" That's the focus of \"Tonight's Angle.\" Now once relegated to women's studies, classrooms and college campuses, the phrase toxic masculinity entered our cultural vernacular a few years ago. Now this was around the time that the American Psychological Association jumped in to warn that, \"males who socialized to conform to traditional masculinity ideology are often negatively affected in terms of mental and physical health.\" Well, the argument is that boys are conditioned to be tough, and not show weakness - that's a bad thing, I guess. And then by some pressing boys' feelings, their emotions, then they're likely to be more prone to violence or aggression, more likely to end up in prison, or in trouble at school. And people who work in gender studies programs, they're dead set against the old confining roles of masculinity, and you'll see this in a highly produced Hollywood conversation.",

      "sentences": "This is how far we've fallen in America, telling a boy not to be a girl, I guess it's now considered abusive. We're in an upside down world, my friends. And I think more people now see right through the attempt that they're making to kind of wrap their attacks on traditional gender roles around an anti-bullying campaign. Well, that's absurd, because real men do not bully, we know that. Real men don't beat their wives, we know that. Real men don't hurt animals or children, we know that. All decent people agree on that. And by the way, long before the phrase \"gender fluid\" popped up, good parents told their sons, both to be a man and to be courageous, valiant, compassionate. Now heard my friend's father say, \"stop whining and be a man if he was complaining about something.\" He said it a lot actually. It didn't hurt my buddy one bit. He's a great dad today. But today, the radical left has one goal in mind, it's to destroy the underpinnings of the nuclear family by targeting the distinct parental roles that fathers and mothers play. Ideally - come on, we all know that it's better for children to be raised by a mother and a father who are present and involved. Now, we also all know that single moms and dads do their best, but it's much harder, God bless them all. And I say this as a single mom myself. It's somehow this idea of the traditional roles, it's threatening to the radicals who see the traditional family, especially traditionally minded men, as an impediment to the ultimate goal of the left of socialism and rewriting of American history. Now remember, Black Lives Matter had the disruption of the nuclear family as one of its main goals? Now the entertainment industry joined the anti- family, anti-masculinity crusade long ago. In television and films male protagonists are often portrayed as kind of goofy, helpless - you know, helpless saps or gender fluid geniuses.",

A more shocking incident took place in Philly last week when a woman was raped on the El train with other passengers aboard. Not a single one did anything to help her. And earlier this week in San Francisco, it was a young woman who chased down a man, who pushed an elderly Asian lady to the ground. When the woman confronted the assailant, she was stabbed three times. Where were the men? Frankly, the mass feminization of men should trouble women the most. The victims and all those heinous attacks were women who were overpowered by bad men. And because the cultural elites and institutions have spent years villainizing masculinity, there were no good men willing to step in to save them. And that's \"The Angle.\" Joining me now is someone who did answer the call when lives were threatened. Alek Skarlatos, one of the heroes of the 15:17 train to Paris. Alek knows situations are different, and maybe people are worried about getting sued or worried about being branded a racist if they step in or - but to what do you attribute this seeming end of traditional masculinity, or at least the goal of ending traditional masculinity? ALEK SKARLATOS, STOPPED TRAIN TERROR ATTACK IN 2015: Well, thanks for having me first of all. I really appreciate it. And I would say that not only is it a culture, war with the media and things like that, I also think it starts at the school board level, and conservatives have kind of dropped the ball on school board level elections and things like that for a long time. You see some of the kids coming out of high school, and they're more concerned with making TikTok videos then playing on the football team or going hunting with their friends or anything like that. And it's really sad to see. But in those cases, in particular, I mean, I honestly don't know what it would be like to be a man in a major city these days. You have DAs that oftentimes, don't charge these criminals for committing these crimes. And then if they don't, a lot of times are back on the street next day or two. And then in a major city, a lot of times in America, you can't carry a gun. So you see - even if you did stop that man on the subway from punching that woman, he might run into you, two or three days later, you don't have the gun to defend yourself and you don't know what's going to happen. I mean, it's I don't know if there's one single thing that we can pin this on. But it's just the degradation of our society as a whole when it comes to treating men like they should be treated and asking men to step up in a way that they should step up.",

On the \"heartbeat bill\" that they talked about, 55 percent of Texans supported, including 58 percent of Hispanics and 47 percent of Blacks. And on the UIL Bill about stopping boys from playing girl sports, 58 percent Of Texan support that and only 25 percent oppose it. So they're totally wrong and everything they said. And financially, Laura, think about this. They want the Black players to support Joe Biden who will dramatically increase their taxes on some of the highest paid Black people in America. 74 percent of NFL players are black - or NBA players. 58 percent of NFL players are black and 8 percent of Major League Baseball players. If they live in California or New York, their total tax is over 60 some percent. Tell a Black player that you're going to sign that $10 million contract and only take 3.8 million home.

And so you know, that's fine. That's just politics. But the idea that somehow he should be withdrawn is ridiculous. He's actually already made a huge impact. Laura. Remember, CDC would say, all these healthy kids should be quarantined. In school, if one person is infected, the whole class goes home. That was terrible. It was disruptive for parents, and there was no data to support it. And so Joe, when he came in, and understood that, he got rid of healthy quarantines in the state of Florida, that has been a huge source of relief to so many parents. It's kept 1000s and 1000s of kids in school. And the result has been in the five weeks, we've done that our cases are down 74 percent, among school aged kids. So Joe was right about that. The overall media narrative would have said you need to quarantine healthy kids. And he saw through that. So I think they view him as a threat. I think part of it's about me.

Well, the governor is here. And he has a theory about that. Plus Biden slippery meeting with the Pope and why won't politicians stop dancing? Raymond Arroyo has it all in \"Friday Follies.\" And, and we have a special anniversary surprise at the end of the show, so be sure to stick around for that one. But first, \"Where's all the Men Gone?\" That's the focus of \"Tonight's Angle.\" Now once relegated to women's studies, classrooms and college campuses, the phrase toxic masculinity entered our cultural vernacular a few years ago. Now this was around the time that the American Psychological Association jumped in to warn that, \"males who socialized to conform to traditional masculinity ideology are often negatively affected in terms of mental and physical health.\" Well, the argument is that boys are conditioned to be tough, and not show weakness - that's a bad thing, I guess. And then by some pressing boys' feelings, their emotions, then they're likely to be more prone to violence or aggression, more likely to end up in prison, or in trouble at school. And people who work in gender studies programs, they're dead set against the old confining roles of masculinity, and you'll see this in a highly produced Hollywood conversation."

And I think more people now see right through the attempt that they're making to kind of wrap their attacks on traditional gender roles around an anti-bullying campaign. Well, that's absurd, because real men do not bully, we know that. Real men don't beat their wives, we know that. Real men don't hurt animals or children, we know that. All decent people agree on that. And by the way, long before the phrase \"gender fluid\" popped up, good parents told their sons, both to be a man and to be courageous, valiant, compassionate. Now heard my friend's father say, \"stop whining and be a man if he was complaining about something.\" He said it a lot actually. It didn't hurt my buddy one bit. He's a great dad today. But today, the radical left has one goal in mind, it's to destroy the underpinnings of the nuclear family by targeting the distinct parental roles that fathers and mothers play. Ideally - come on, we all know that it's better for children to be raised by a mother and a father who are present and involved. Now, we also all know that single moms and dads do their best, but it's much harder, God bless them all. And I say this as a single mom myself. It's somehow this idea of the traditional roles, it's threatening to the radicals who see the traditional family, especially traditionally minded men, as an impediment to the ultimate goal of the left of socialism and rewriting of American history. Now remember, Black Lives Matter had the disruption of the nuclear family as one of its main goals? Now the entertainment industry joined the anti- family, anti-masculinity crusade long ago. In television and films male protagonists are often portrayed as kind of goofy, helpless - you know, helpless saps or gender fluid geniuses."

A more shocking incident took place in Philly last week when a woman was raped on the El train with other passengers aboard. Not a single one did anything to help her. And earlier this week in San Francisco, it was a young woman who chased down a man, who pushed an elderly Asian lady to the ground. When the woman confronted the assailant, she was stabbed three times. Where were the men? Frankly, the mass feminization of men should trouble women the most. The victims and all those heinous attacks were women who were overpowered by bad men. And because the cultural elites and institutions have spent years villainizing masculinity, there were no good men willing to step in to save them. And that's \"The Angle.\" Joining me now is someone who did answer the call when lives were threatened. Alek Skarlatos, one of the heroes of the 15:17 train to Paris. Alek knows situations are different, and maybe people are worried about getting sued or worried about being branded a racist if they step in or - but to what do you attribute this seeming end of traditional masculinity, or at least the goal of ending traditional masculinity? ALEK SKARLATOS, STOPPED TRAIN TERROR ATTACK IN 2015: Well, thanks for having me first of all. I really appreciate it. And I would say that not only is it a culture, war with the media and things like that, I also think it starts at the school board level, and conservatives have kind of dropped the ball on school board level elections and things like that for a long time. You see some of the kids coming out of high school, and they're more concerned with making TikTok videos then playing on the football team or going hunting with their friends or anything like that. And it's really sad to see. But in those cases, in particular, I mean, I honestly don't know what it would be like to be a man in a major city these days. You have DAs that oftentimes, don't charge these criminals for committing these crimes. And then if they don't, a lot of times are back on the street next day or two. And then in a major city, a lot of times in America, you can't carry a gun. So you see - even if you did stop that man on the subway from punching that woman, he might run into you, two or three days later, you don't have the gun to defend yourself and you don't know what's going to happen. I mean, it's I don't know if there's one single thing that we can pin this on. But it's just the degradation of our society as a whole when it comes to treating men like they should be treated and asking men to step up in a way that they should step up."

First of all on the Election Bill 82 percent of Texans supported a third degree felony from vote harvesting. 79 percent supported adding the last four digits of your Social Security number to mail-in-ballots to protect fraud in them. 59 percent agree with prohibiting drive-in voting or late night voting. On the \"heartbeat bill\" that they talked about, 55 percent of Texans supported, including 58 percent of Hispanics and 47 percent of Blacks. And on the UIL Bill about stopping boys from playing girl sports, 58 percent Of Texan support that and only 25 percent oppose it. So they're totally wrong and everything they said. And financially, Laura, think about this. They want the Black players to support Joe Biden who will dramatically increase their taxes on some of the highest paid Black people in America. 74 percent of NFL players are black - or NBA players. 58 percent of NFL players are black and 8 percent of Major League Baseball players. If they live in California or New York, their total tax is over 60 some percent. Tell a Black player that you're going to sign that $10 million contract and only take 3.8 million home.

Right now, we've lost over the last 4 years 40 percent of the Black community due to abortion - 20 million Black babies. You see them voting against pro-choice for Black kids, and that's why we have 75 percent of the Black boys in the State of California who cannot read and write. Now these guys are on the wrong side. And I'm thankful for the opportunity for us now to show who these Black leaders are all about. It was not White supremacist did my race in. It was one time the 60s was leading our country in growth in middle class. Men matriculating from college, men committed to marriage. It was a Black elitist that we trusted, that opened the doors to Leftists and Marxists. And we've seen result of that.

Even though there's actually been more COVID deaths under Joe Biden's presidency than under Donald Trump's, and Trump didn't even have any vaccine except for the very end of the administration. And so they do the same thing. They protect the governors in their own party. They try to explain away anything that that happens. It's bad like these nursing home disasters we've seen.

And so you know, that's fine. That's just politics. But the idea that somehow he should be withdrawn is ridiculous. He's actually already made a huge impact. Laura. Remember, CDC would say, all these healthy kids should be quarantined. In school, if one person is infected, the whole class goes home. That was terrible. It was disruptive for parents, and there was no data to support it. And so Joe, when he came in, and understood that, he got rid of healthy quarantines in the state of Florida, that has been a huge source of relief to so many parents. It's kept 1000s and 1000s of kids in school. And the result has been in the five weeks, we've done that our cases are down 74 percent, among school aged kids. So Joe was right about that. The overall media narrative would have said you need to quarantine healthy kids. And he saw through that. So I think they view him as a threat. I think part of it's about me.

The church teaching is clear here. Thou shalt not kill, and the canon law says if you support these things, abortion on demand as a public official, no communion. It's not just a sign. It's a sign that you are part of this community, and you agree with the teachings of the church. You are free to leave or stay, but those are the rules."

And we want to respect your point of view, respect your intelligence.
