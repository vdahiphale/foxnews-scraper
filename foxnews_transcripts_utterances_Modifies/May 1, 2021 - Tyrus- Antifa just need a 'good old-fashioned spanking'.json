Reminds me the time I rescued a poor kitten outside my apartment only to learn a few months later, it was a raccoon. Whatever was initially adorable. Now evil. It's like relationships. Some women date the bad boy with the face tattoo because he's fun and dangerous. But it's not fun a year later when he sold all your furniture and he's passed out in your living room which is also where he keeps his bike and his meth lab. Which brings us to Antifa and Ted Wheeler, the mayor of Portland, Oregon. Last July he stood with rioters after 100 nights of Mayhem or as CNN called it peaceful protesting. As they tried to injure the police. He tried to play the hip stepdad promising he'll buy you a beer if you promise to drink it at home.",

And maybe that is his real voice. He's just breathing heavy from standing up too fast. He likely has a hygiene problem because he only showers once every moon phase. Still, they threaten a political leader with death. Then again, so did Madonna and Johnny Depp and it didn't really matter, but it should. But they're now threatening a Democrat. So maybe it might matter for once. I suppose you would call this terrorism, but they aren't Trump's supporters are white supremacists. Sorry, that's redundant, according to the media. By the way, if you want to see white terrorists, take a look at the mug shots of Portland rioters, even for a city that's 75 percent white, they're suspiciously pasty. Apparently, student loan debt causes green hair and acne. I'm starting to think the cure for Antifa is getting laid. So, I get no joy over Wheeler being threatened and I hope he learned something from this. Other than that it's not appropriate to wear a cardigan to a riot. But maybe you should side with the citizens before you side with those who want to hurt them. This is on page two of how to be a mayor handbook. You thought that by courting the barbarians they would stop at the gate. They didn't. They correctly surmised, you had less balls than a bodybuilder on steroids. And they ran you into the ground like a rental car. That's what happens when you pretend that you could be a mayor of a city but you look like you're suited to be manager at Circuit City.

Reminds me the time I rescued a poor kitten outside my apartment only to learn a few months later, it was a raccoon. Whatever was initially adorable. Now evil. It's like relationships. Some women date the bad boy with the face tattoo because he's fun and dangerous. But it's not fun a year later when he sold all your furniture and he's passed out in your living room which is also where he keeps his bike and his meth lab. Which brings us to Antifa and Ted Wheeler, the mayor of Portland, Oregon. Last July he stood with rioters after 100 nights of Mayhem or as CNN called it peaceful protesting. As they tried to injure the police. He tried to play the hip stepdad promising he'll buy you a beer if you promise to drink it at home."

And maybe that is his real voice. He's just breathing heavy from standing up too fast. He likely has a hygiene problem because he only showers once every moon phase. Still, they threaten a political leader with death. Then again, so did Madonna and Johnny Depp and it didn't really matter, but it should. But they're now threatening a Democrat. So maybe it might matter for once. I suppose you would call this terrorism, but they aren't Trump's supporters are white supremacists. Sorry, that's redundant, according to the media. By the way, if you want to see white terrorists, take a look at the mug shots of Portland rioters, even for a city that's 75 percent white, they're suspiciously pasty. Apparently, student loan debt causes green hair and acne. I'm starting to think the cure for Antifa is getting laid. So, I get no joy over Wheeler being threatened and I hope he learned something from this. Other than that it's not appropriate to wear a cardigan to a riot. But maybe you should side with the citizens before you side with those who want to hurt them. This is on page two of how to be a mayor handbook. You thought that by courting the barbarians they would stop at the gate. They didn't. They correctly surmised, you had less balls than a bodybuilder on steroids. And they ran you into the ground like a rental car. That's what happens when you pretend that you could be a mayor of a city but you look like you're suited to be manager at Circuit City.

Watch every season of the \"Jersey Shore\"? I bet they also found out that a man with a giant Nike logo is more likely to just do it. Study also set out to determine whether women are more attracted to men and flashy clothes or men who are rich. Authors say such clothing helps facilitate mate attraction, but also indicates poor long term parental investment, which is really a complicated way of saying (BLEEP). So, let's go to the woman on the panel. I always like saying that. That is you Kennedy for today. You identify as a woman today?"

And the parental investment for men can be as low as 30 seconds. For women, it's as low, and we're talking about, you know, hominids, not anatomically modern humans. For women, it's the least parental investment is four years. So, you have a lot more if you're a woman invested in actually getting pregnant, and men want to signal that they can procure resources."

There are no quote unquote dumb ideas, except maybe that one. In 2016, economist, Howard Chernykh, was asked about the same idea. And here's the problem, income taxes about a 50 percent, 65 percent of the federal government's money. So, if no one paid taxes, the government would have to borrow a lot more money or reduce spending. Which do you think would happen, Greg? Rhetorical question, don't answer it. Yes."

Why is this not your show? But I just thought, well, you know, you're nice to say that. Portland, as you said, what would happen if the Raider resigned, it would be even worse.

As an 8-year-old boy back in 1996, I used to run home right after school and Squeeze It to the mail. First one is from Mott, \"Fox said, this was going to be a comedy show how many weeks in will the comedy actually start?\" Mott, the comedy starts the moment you leave for work and then I stopped by to bang your wife. I kid, I kid that's not true. She usually comes to my place. You don't get this kind of quality entertainment on \"FOX AND FRIENDS.\""

They are in fact canceling GUTFELD! And replacing it with the viewer named Jesse Hour, where you'll be filmed in your small bedroom emailing world famous celebrities like me in between pleasuring yourself to amateur porn on a musty twin bed and eating funyuns with your feet. It won't do better in the ratings in my show, but you will beat Don Lemon. And that's all that matters. Anyway, here's a question from Christie, \"Why, why can't you see that being awful mean and hateful to people isn't comedy?\" Who said it was Christie, are you hearing voices again? I told you before those voices aren't real you know Christy I hear voices too every day the articulation of Clive oh and tells me to eat light bulbs. But I don't most of the time anyway so that I asked you also ignore the voices in your head as well. Unless they tell you to meet me at the Port Authority Bus Station this Saturday night with a brown paper bag full of large bills and a jar of mayonnaise."

So, the answer is off and on. Also, George, can you make me a sandwich and leave it in their fridge before you go to work? I usually get pretty hungry. Next question is from Norman, \"Are you going to ever hire comedy writers for the show? Well, Norman, are you ever going to hire comedy writers for your face? Maybe he's right. That wasn't my best work. Actually, we've hired an entire crew of comedy writers pumping out five star copy around the clock. I think we have tape of them. They get so excited when I mentioned them on T.V. and they do a great job. Stay right there. More stuff is next."

Went to Central Park and oftentimes their little promotional giveaways and there was a cart and a man giving away free Red Bulls. I don't normally drink red pool because I just gets me to wired but there was Anderson Cooper, pounding him like it was nothing and then he just couldn't handle couldn't handle it. With going crazy around the park bumping into people it was really rude. Very, very rude. There he goes again. Anyway, splendid fellow I might add. There you go. Set your DVRs every night so you never miss an episode. Thanks to Brian Kilmeade, Kennedy, Ari Fleischer, Tyrus, Steve Phoenix, Jr., our studio audience. \"FOX NEWS AT NIGHT\" is next. I'm Greg Gutfeld."
