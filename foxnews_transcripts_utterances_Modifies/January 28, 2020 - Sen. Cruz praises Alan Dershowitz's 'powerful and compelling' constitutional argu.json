      "sentences": "All right, Tucker. Fiery speech. Welcome aboard. I want you to listen very closely to this monologue. This Schumer sham -- Schiff show, it's over. And I'm going to tell you why it's over. I listened closely to every detail of the president's defense, including the actions of quid and pro and quo Joe and zero experience Hunter and how Joe shook down the country of Ukraine. Everyone looked at what Hunter and Joe did and were doing and said don't do this. Hunter has zero experience in Ukraine. No experience in oil. No experience in gas. No experience in energy. Hunter Biden got a whopping $84,000 a month. Did you know? Pam Bondi told us the average American family of four makes less  than $54,000 in a year. Everyone knew. Everyone knows now. Everyone saw this at the time for what this was. And then you have Joe Biden. We just passed the two-year anniversary. Joe Biden on tape admitting to the shakedown. And, by the way, at a minimum, everyone sees what this is. We can identify it. We have identified several potential serious violations of the law, felony.  Look at this, on your screen. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, 15 USC 78, quote: It is illegal for a U.S. person to coerce -- you're not getting the billion unless you fire -- or influence through bribery or extortion, if you fire him, you get the billion, a foreign nation into taking action that might financially benefit that person, his family, Hunter, or business. And that's not all. Bribery, 18 USC 201c: Whoever corruptly gives offers or promises anything of value to a public official to influence an official act is guilty of bribery. You're not getting the billion unless you fire the prosecutor paying my zero experience son 83 grand a month, millions and millions of dollars. Oh, we found another law. It's called the Gratuities Act, 18 USC 201B: Giving offering, promising anything of value to a public official in exchange for any official act. Uh-oh. And the Hobbs Act, 18 USC 1951. A threat to a foreign official in order to obtain an official benefit affecting interstate, foreign commerce would constitute extortion. Now, never forget, it's the president of president of the United States' duty, his sworn duty, to faithfully execute the laws of the land. Tonight, the country now needs to make a transition. This B.S. witch hunt is over. It has to be over. The president will rightly be acquitted and vindicated for good reason and I'll explain. Go back to the Trump-Zelensky call that the president released freely. During the call, what was the president worried about? He was worried about Ukrainian corruption. He was concerned, remember Zelensky was working with some of the same bad actors in the previous Ukrainian administration, the Poroshenko administration. And he was worried Ukraine had interfered in the 2016 election separate and apart from Russian interference that Devin Nunes warned us all about in 2017. A Ukrainian court had determined government officials interfered in our election, January 2017, January 11 to be exact. Investigative report from \"Politico\" detailed Ukrainian interference. We have described in detail. And after, by the way, three years, never ending, nonstop, lying, hysteria about foreign election interference. It would have been a dereliction of duty, would it not, for President Trump to not rightly address the issue. Do us a favor. My country's been through all of this. Can we get to the bottom of it? He never mentioned aid or a quid or a pro or a quo like Joe. And let's not forget, on the very call in question, not a penny was ever mentioned. Now, there are weak Republicans in this country, so-called moderate Democrats in the U.S. Senate, thinking about giving validation to this Schumer-Schiff sham show with new witnesses and investigations. Well, to all of you thinking about it, you're not only ripping the country apart, you are spitting in the face of every law-abiding American, your constituent, because this president was looking out for their money. And you are also simultaneously trampling on and shredding the Constitution of the United States because of, what, a shameful political stunt because you can't wait 280 days knowing you're likely going to, well, lose in the next election? Well, how stupid and dangerous do you want to be here? Because the total B.S. surrounding Bolton is just the latest manufactured crisis. Now, I've known John Bolton for I think two decades, thereabouts. I have a message for John Bolton tonight. He used to be a colleague here at the FOX News Channel.  I remember when John was first up for the job of national security advisor. I had heard through many sources John was calling everyone that would listen, asking them to put in a good word for him with President Trump. He wanted this job badly.  I spoke on an occasion to John Bolton, and I asked him why he wanted the job, and I also remember asking him -- well, you know, Donald Trump's foreign policy positions are very different than your foreign policy positions. Would you be willing to serve his agenda, not yours? Again, I've known him for two decades.  Now, I'm not today recognizing the guy that I thought I knew because, John Bolton, I say to you tonight, you have something to say, John, come here. You worked here. This is your old home. Come on the show. And have your say on this show. We've invited you repeatedly, radio and TV, over the past number of weeks.  Now, nobody I think truly knows what's in his book except for whatever manuscript he might've sent to whoever has seen it. I have no idea if any of these reports are true. But let's assume for a second that they are true. Here's the bottom line -- Jim Jordan has reminded us four facts never change. This case is over. Why? Because the Trump-Zelensky transcripts, they show zero linkage between U.S. aid and any investigation.  One fact witness in the House said when he asked the president, what do you want? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. No quid, pro, or quo.   Both Trump and Zelensky, they have denied repeatedly that any aid was conditional. There was never any pressure whatsoever. Zelensky even going so far as what are you talking about, what are you doing? At the time of the initial call, Ukrainian officials never knew that the U.S. aid was temporarily paused. And don't forget, this is critical. Even if Donald Trump may be said they'd better do this or I'm not giving them any aid, let's assume he might've even said that, doesn't matter, does it? Because the fourth fact the never changes, the aid was released in one case earlier with zero strings attached. And that means they got the aid. They never did anything. They never said they would do anything. They never called for an investigation. They never said they would call for an investigation. And they have said all of that repeatedly.   And I add one fifth, well, if you will, fact that will never change. There were five separate subsequent high-level meetings, in the meetings with Zelensky. All those audition witnesses, hearsay, opinion witnesses, have all said the same thing. Aid was never discussed. Linkage was never brought up. So you have here an anonymous source telling, what, a liberal hack for the liberal \"The New York Times\" that hates Donald Trump that John Bolton in a manuscript, well, is claiming the president wanted Ukraine to investigate the Bidens and may be election interference. OK, let's assume that's true. That's a big \"if,\" considering it's \"The New York Times.\" But let's say it's true. Does it make any difference? Well, I would answer absolutely none whatsoever. Now, the DOJ and the Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, they totally refute Bolton's claims. Now you have conflicting testimony. At best, Bolton's testimony would be heavily disputed.  But again, the facts don't change. Even then it doesn't matter one bit. President Trump is allowed to talk. He's allowed to vent, he's allowed to exchange ideas with his close advisors.   That is not a crime. It's kind of like -- well, you tell your friend, I want to rob this jewelry store. I want to rob this grocery store, convenience store. Oh, I'm going to punch this guy the face. I'm going to rip somebody's face off. But you never do it. You weren't seriously plotting the act. That would not be a crime, would it?  We all think about things, thoughts flow through our brains constantly, at least if you're a conservative. When you think about things, that's not a crime in any way. In the White House, it's certainly not a crime to talk about policy ideas or to vent. Now, if the president did what they said, it would still be so insignificantly meaningless that it would never rise to the level of quid pro quo Joe and zero experienced Hunter. So, for you senators, if you're going to validate thought crimes to smear a duly elected president, just 280 days before the election, when the facts never change. John Bolton can say, oh, no. The president said there's going to be linkage.  But there never was. We will be in big trouble as a country if you legitimize this.  John Bolton, come on the show. Your country wants to hear from you. I would like to hear from you. You have a story to tell the country, John, stop playing games. This is not a game when it's the presidency of the United States. It's not a game when you're pushing the boundaries of executive privilege, which George Washington used, and every president pretty much in between and since. Take a look.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Jay is right. What's happening here is dangerous.  Now, a small group of Republican senators, well, they are thinking of caving to the Democratic colleagues. Maybe they want to be like. Maybe they are putting their own election results ahead of the Constitution. And what's in the best interests of the country and the principle of executive privilege and the right of a president to get free and fair and open advice from his top advisors. Maybe they want the Democrats to get all the witnesses they want. Maybe they want the smear to go on and on and because of \"The New York Times\" saying in a manuscript that Bolton might have said that the president had linkage, but linkage never happened.   Let me say one other thing. I want to address Mitt Romney. I liked Mitt Romney. I think he would've been a great president in 2012. He was the better person to be the president. I thought I was friends with Mitt Romney. I don't recognize this guy anymore, another one. He has been a huge disappointment.  I thought he would've been a better president than Obama. We all went all in, wanted him to win, liked his family, wife, kids, wonderful people. But this sanctimonious Trump hatred is getting old, especially as you watch the president accomplishing everything you said, Mitt Romney, you wanted to have happen in the country.  Really? Mitt, look at the four facts, I will say five, that never change. Ukrainians said they never felt pressure. They never, ever did a single thing. They never said they would do a thing, and they got all their money. So, do you really think that you should take on the role of their U.S. House of Representatives, the sole constitutional role to impeach, and now you want to put on a whole other case and take on their job? All I see, with all due respect, Mitt Romney, is your personal hatred for Donald Trump, and it's clearly clouding your judgment. Do you really think Americans are too stupid to choose their president? Mitt Romney, Senator, we have an election in 280 days. Why don't you go out and campaign for quid or pro or quo Joe? I haven't heard you talk about quid pro quo Joe. I haven't heard you talk about zero experience Hunter, either. And I haven't heard you ask them to be called as witnesses.   Really? You are not getting the billion unless you fire the prosecutor that's investigating my zero experience son? You don't want him as a witness? And do you not think that the president, knowing this, is saying, wow. That seems really bad.  And, Mitt, I will send over to your office tomorrow, all the applicable laws in the case of quid pro quo Joe and zero experience Hunter. And, by the way, the media that is loving you now, Mitt, they were the same people that were out there saying you were a misogynist, you were a racist, you cut some kids here in grade school. They were the ones saying everything and anything about you to destroy you.  Do you think they like you? Do you think they are going to like you? Never.  And this goes for you other Republican senators. Do you really believe the very same Democrats that accused that innocent man, Justice Kavanaugh, of being a serial gang rapist and put the country through all of that mess, are you going to believe the same congenital liars that pushed the Russian hoax conspiracy theories for over three years? Never touched Hillary Clinton's dirty Russian dossier. Never touched premeditated fraud on the FISA abuse, spying on a presidential campaign, a transition team, and a presidency -- you want to trust those guys? The hacks that have been plotting impeachment since 2016, all through 2017, '18, '19. This Bolton hysteria manufactured crisis, to use a term, is just the latest example in what is, let's see, the, media mob, which is state run media for the Democratic radical socialist party, and their phony feigned, selective moral outrage. It is the latest so-called bombshell.  Everything is a bombshell. Destroying this administration. This is it, we've got it. It's a bombshell, bombshell, bombshell. Take a look.",

That the Constitution requires high crimes or misdemeanors, that the test for impeachment is treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.  And the House Democrats, they haven't alleged any crime whatsoever. It utterly fails the constitutional standard. But, you know, Sean, I listened to your opening monologue and the four and five points that you made, and they are right. But let me boil it down to one. One point that explains why the president is innocent and he should be acquitted and why he will be acquitted.  Quid pro quo doesn't matter. It's a red herring. It doesn't matter if there was a quid pro quo or not. The reason is, a president is always justified and in fact has a responsibility to investigate credible evidence of corruption. The Democrats built their entire case on the proposition that it was baseless and a sham and phony to investigate corruption, to investigate Burisma and the Bidens. You've done a good job of walking through the reality, which is there was a mountain of evidence. Now, do I know for a fact Joe Biden was corrupt? No. But there was more than enough for the president to say, hey, we ought to investigate him, when this guy's son is getting paid a million bucks a year, when he's bragging about forcing Ukraine to fire the prosecutor -- that stinks, and a minimum should be investigated. That in and of itself eliminates the Democrats' case.",

We heard all the evidence, all the witness testimony, every argument that they made over and over and over again. You know, they spent about half of that time trying to prove that President Trump wanted an investigation into Joe Biden, and Hunter Biden, and Burisma. Well, you know what, you and I could've proved that in 30 seconds because the president has said that on national television t repeatedly. That is conceded, yes. Donald Trump wanted the corruption or potential corruption investigated. That's a good thing, not a bad thing.   I will tell you something else that's ironic. Everything they accused the president of and say the president did wrong, the Democrats have done worse. So they accuse the president of withholding aid to Ukraine. Well, you and I both know that Barack Obama refused to give legal aid to Ukraine for his entire presidency. Donald Trump has given Javelin missiles, antitank missiles. So if delaying aid to Ukraine is wrong, then Obama did it worse. If investigating a political rival is wrong, then let's pause for a second, because Obama investigated a political rival, sent in spies, sent in wiretaps, unleashed the FBI and DOJ and investigated the Republican nominee. So, for the Democrats, it's worth asking them, what exactly are you saying the president did wrong, and which part of it has your party not done tenfold worse?",

      "utterance": "All right, Tucker. Fiery speech. Welcome aboard. I want you to listen very closely to this monologue. This Schumer sham -- Schiff show, it's over. And I'm going to tell you why it's over. I listened closely to every detail of the president's defense, including the actions of quid and pro and quo Joe and zero experience Hunter and how Joe shook down the country of Ukraine. Everyone looked at what Hunter and Joe did and were doing and said don't do this. Hunter has zero experience in Ukraine. No experience in oil. No experience in gas. No experience in energy. Hunter Biden got a whopping $84,000 a month. Did you know? Pam Bondi told us the average American family of four makes less  than $54,000 in a year. Everyone knew. Everyone knows now. Everyone saw this at the time for what this was. And then you have Joe Biden. We just passed the two-year anniversary. Joe Biden on tape admitting to the shakedown. And, by the way, at a minimum, everyone sees what this is. We can identify it. We have identified several potential serious violations of the law, felony.  Look at this, on your screen. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, 15 USC 78, quote: It is illegal for a U.S. person to coerce -- you're not getting the billion unless you fire -- or influence through bribery or extortion, if you fire him, you get the billion, a foreign nation into taking action that might financially benefit that person, his family, Hunter, or business. And that's not all. Bribery, 18 USC 201c: Whoever corruptly gives offers or promises anything of value to a public official to influence an official act is guilty of bribery. You're not getting the billion unless you fire the prosecutor paying my zero experience son 83 grand a month, millions and millions of dollars. Oh, we found another law. It's called the Gratuities Act, 18 USC 201B: Giving offering, promising anything of value to a public official in exchange for any official act. Uh-oh. And the Hobbs Act, 18 USC 1951. A threat to a foreign official in order to obtain an official benefit affecting interstate, foreign commerce would constitute extortion. Now, never forget, it's the president of president of the United States' duty, his sworn duty, to faithfully execute the laws of the land. Tonight, the country now needs to make a transition. This B.S. witch hunt is over. It has to be over. The president will rightly be acquitted and vindicated for good reason and I'll explain. Go back to the Trump-Zelensky call that the president released freely. During the call, what was the president worried about? He was worried about Ukrainian corruption. He was concerned, remember Zelensky was working with some of the same bad actors in the previous Ukrainian administration, the Poroshenko administration. And he was worried Ukraine had interfered in the 2016 election separate and apart from Russian interference that Devin Nunes warned us all about in 2017. A Ukrainian court had determined government officials interfered in our election, January 2017, January 11 to be exact. Investigative report from \"Politico\" detailed Ukrainian interference. We have described in detail. And after, by the way, three years, never ending, nonstop, lying, hysteria about foreign election interference. It would have been a dereliction of duty, would it not, for President Trump to not rightly address the issue. Do us a favor. My country's been through all of this. Can we get to the bottom of it? He never mentioned aid or a quid or a pro or a quo like Joe. And let's not forget, on the very call in question, not a penny was ever mentioned. Now, there are weak Republicans in this country, so-called moderate Democrats in the U.S. Senate, thinking about giving validation to this Schumer-Schiff sham show with new witnesses and investigations. Well, to all of you thinking about it, you're not only ripping the country apart, you are spitting in the face of every law-abiding American, your constituent, because this president was looking out for their money. And you are also simultaneously trampling on and shredding the Constitution of the United States because of, what, a shameful political stunt because you can't wait 280 days knowing you're likely going to, well, lose in the next election? Well, how stupid and dangerous do you want to be here? Because the total B.S. surrounding Bolton is just the latest manufactured crisis. Now, I've known John Bolton for I think two decades, thereabouts. I have a message for John Bolton tonight. He used to be a colleague here at the FOX News Channel. I remember when John was first up for the job of national security advisor. I had heard through many sources John was calling everyone that would listen, asking them to put in a good word for him with President Trump. He wanted this job badly. I spoke on an occasion to John Bolton, and I asked him why he wanted the job, and I also remember asking him -- well, you know, Donald Trump's foreign policy positions are very different than your foreign policy positions. Would you be willing to serve his agenda, not yours? Again, I've known him for two decades. Now, I'm not today recognizing the guy that I thought I knew because, John Bolton, I say to you tonight, you have something to say, John, come here. You worked here. This is your old home. Come on the show. And have your say on this show. We've invited you repeatedly, radio and TV, over the past number of weeks. Now, nobody I think truly knows what's in his book except for whatever manuscript he might've sent to whoever has seen it. I have no idea if any of these reports are true. But let's assume for a second that they are true. Here's the bottom line -- Jim Jordan has reminded us four facts never change. This case is over. Why? Because the Trump-Zelensky transcripts, they show zero linkage between U.S. aid and any investigation. One fact witness in the House said when he asked the president, what do you want? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. No quid, pro, or quo. Both Trump and Zelensky, they have denied repeatedly that any aid was conditional. There was never any pressure whatsoever. Zelensky even going so far as what are you talking about, what are you doing? At the time of the initial call, Ukrainian officials never knew that the U.S. aid was temporarily paused. And don't forget, this is critical. Even if Donald Trump may be said they'd better do this or I'm not giving them any aid, let's assume he might've even said that, doesn't matter, does it? Because the fourth fact the never changes, the aid was released in one case earlier with zero strings attached. And that means they got the aid. They never did anything. They never said they would do anything. They never called for an investigation. They never said they would call for an investigation. And they have said all of that repeatedly. And I add one fifth, well, if you will, fact that will never change. There were five separate subsequent high-level meetings, in the meetings with Zelensky. All those audition witnesses, hearsay, opinion witnesses, have all said the same thing. Aid was never discussed. Linkage was never brought up. So you have here an anonymous source telling, what, a liberal hack for the liberal \"The New York Times\" that hates Donald Trump that John Bolton in a manuscript, well, is claiming the president wanted Ukraine to investigate the Bidens and may be election interference. OK, let's assume that's true. That's a big \"if,\" considering it's \"The New York Times.\" But let's say it's true. Does it make any difference? Well, I would answer absolutely none whatsoever. Now, the DOJ and the Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, they totally refute Bolton's claims. Now you have conflicting testimony. At best, Bolton's testimony would be heavily disputed. But again, the facts don't change. Even then it doesn't matter one bit. President Trump is allowed to talk. He's allowed to vent, he's allowed to exchange ideas with his close advisors. That is not a crime. It's kind of like -- well, you tell your friend, I want to rob this jewelry store. I want to rob this grocery store, convenience store. Oh, I'm going to punch this guy the face. I'm going to rip somebody's face off. But you never do it. You weren't seriously plotting the act. That would not be a crime, would it? We all think about things, thoughts flow through our brains constantly, at least if you're a conservative. When you think about things, that's not a crime in any way. In the White House, it's certainly not a crime to talk about policy ideas or to vent. Now, if the president did what they said, it would still be so insignificantly meaningless that it would never rise to the level of quid pro quo Joe and zero experienced Hunter. So, for you senators, if you're going to validate thought crimes to smear a duly elected president, just 280 days before the election, when the facts never change. John Bolton can say, oh, no. The president said there's going to be linkage. But there never was. We will be in big trouble as a country if you legitimize this. John Bolton, come on the show. Your country wants to hear from you. I would like to hear from you. You have a story to tell the country, John, stop playing games. This is not a game when it's the presidency of the United States. It's not a game when you're pushing the boundaries of executive privilege, which George Washington used, and every president pretty much in between and since. Take a look."

Now, to be specific, you cannot impeach a president on an unsourced allegation. But to have a removal of a duly elected president based on a policy disagreement, that's not what the framers intended.

      "utterance": "Yes, Jay is right. What's happening here is dangerous. Now, a small group of Republican senators, well, they are thinking of caving to the Democratic colleagues. Maybe they want to be like. Maybe they are putting their own election results ahead of the Constitution. And what's in the best interests of the country and the principle of executive privilege and the right of a president to get free and fair and open advice from his top advisors. Maybe they want the Democrats to get all the witnesses they want. Maybe they want the smear to go on and on and because of \"The New York Times\" saying in a manuscript that Bolton might have said that the president had linkage, but linkage never happened. Let me say one other thing. I want to address Mitt Romney. I liked Mitt Romney. I think he would've been a great president in 2012. He was the better person to be the president. I thought I was friends with Mitt Romney. I don't recognize this guy anymore, another one. He has been a huge disappointment. I thought he would've been a better president than Obama. We all went all in, wanted him to win, liked his family, wife, kids, wonderful people. But this sanctimonious Trump hatred is getting old, especially as you watch the president accomplishing everything you said, Mitt Romney, you wanted to have happen in the country. Really? Mitt, look at the four facts, I will say five, that never change. Ukrainians said they never felt pressure. They never, ever did a single thing. They never said they would do a thing, and they got all their money. So, do you really think that you should take on the role of their U.S. House of Representatives, the sole constitutional role to impeach, and now you want to put on a whole other case and take on their job? All I see, with all due respect, Mitt Romney, is your personal hatred for Donald Trump, and it's clearly clouding your judgment. Do you really think Americans are too stupid to choose their president? Mitt Romney, Senator, we have an election in 280 days. Why don't you go out and campaign for quid or pro or quo Joe? I haven't heard you talk about quid pro quo Joe. I haven't heard you talk about zero experience Hunter, either. And I haven't heard you ask them to be called as witnesses. Really? You are not getting the billion unless you fire the prosecutor that's investigating my zero experience son? You don't want him as a witness? And do you not think that the president, knowing this, is saying, wow. That seems really bad. And, Mitt, I will send over to your office tomorrow, all the applicable laws in the case of quid pro quo Joe and zero experience Hunter. And, by the way, the media that is loving you now, Mitt, they were the same people that were out there saying you were a misogynist, you were a racist, you cut some kids here in grade school. They were the ones saying everything and anything about you to destroy you. Do you think they like you? Do you think they are going to like you? Never. And this goes for you other Republican senators. Do you really believe the very same Democrats that accused that innocent man, Justice Kavanaugh, of being a serial gang rapist and put the country through all of that mess, are you going to believe the same congenital liars that pushed the Russian hoax conspiracy theories for over three years? Never touched Hillary Clinton's dirty Russian dossier. Never touched premeditated fraud on the FISA abuse, spying on a presidential campaign, a transition team, and a presidency -- you want to trust those guys? The hacks that have been plotting impeachment since 2016, all through 2017, '18, '19. This Bolton hysteria manufactured crisis, to use a term, is just the latest example in what is, let's see, the, media mob, which is state run media for the Democratic radical socialist party, and their phony feigned, selective moral outrage. It is the latest so-called bombshell. Everything is a bombshell. Destroying this administration. This is it, we've got it. It's a bombshell, bombshell, bombshell. Take a look."

That the Constitution requires high crimes or misdemeanors, that the test for impeachment is treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors. And the House Democrats, they haven't alleged any crime whatsoever. It utterly fails the constitutional standard. But, you know, Sean, I listened to your opening monologue and the four and five points that you made, and they are right. But let me boil it down to one. One point that explains why the president is innocent and he should be acquitted and why he will be acquitted. Quid pro quo doesn't matter. It's a red herring. It doesn't matter if there was a quid pro quo or not. The reason is, a president is always justified and in fact has a responsibility to investigate credible evidence of corruption. The Democrats built their entire case on the proposition that it was baseless and a sham and phony to investigate corruption, to investigate Burisma and the Bidens. You've done a good job of walking through the reality, which is there was a mountain of evidence. Now, do I know for a fact Joe Biden was corrupt? No. But there was more than enough for the president to say, hey, we ought to investigate him, when this guy's son is getting paid a million bucks a year, when he's bragging about forcing Ukraine to fire the prosecutor -- that stinks, and a minimum should be investigated. That in and of itself eliminates the Democrats' case."

We listened to the House Democrats for 22 hours. We listened until practically our ears bled. We heard all the evidence, all the witness testimony, every argument that they made over and over and over again. You know, they spent about half of that time trying to prove that President Trump wanted an investigation into Joe Biden, and Hunter Biden, and Burisma. Well, you know what, you and I could've proved that in 30 seconds because the president has said that on national television t repeatedly. That is conceded, yes. Donald Trump wanted the corruption or potential corruption investigated. That's a good thing, not a bad thing. I will tell you something else that's ironic. Everything they accused the president of and say the president did wrong, the Democrats have done worse. So they accuse the president of withholding aid to Ukraine. Well, you and I both know that Barack Obama refused to give legal aid to Ukraine for his entire presidency. Donald Trump has given Javelin missiles, antitank missiles. So if delaying aid to Ukraine is wrong, then Obama did it worse. If investigating a political rival is wrong, then let's pause for a second, because Obama investigated a political rival, sent in spies, sent in wiretaps, unleashed the FBI and DOJ and investigated the Republican nominee. So, for the Democrats, it's worth asking them, what exactly are you saying the president did wrong, and which part of it has your party not done tenfold worse?"

Joining us now, he did an amazing job, author of \"Guilt by Accusation,\" Professor Dershowitz. Professor, I don't -- I want you to just, this is now dangerous for this country in my view. ALAN DERSHOWITZ, AUTHOR, \"GUILT BY ACCUSSATION\": This is extremely dangerous. If we allow abuse of power to become a criteria, a criteria that the Framers implicitly rejected when they rejected maladministration, which is the same thing as abuse of power, we weaponize impeachment, and it becomes normalized, and it will be used every time there's a president with an opposing party in Congress. I gave a list on the floor of the Senate yesterday of over 30 American presidents from George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Jefferson, who had been accused of abuse of power. And none of them was impeached, which shows you how vague and open-ended and selective that criteria is. It can be weaponized and used against anybody or nobody, depending on the whim of Congress."

      "utterance": "Well, first of all, under my constitutional analysis, witnesses would not be proper because this is a case for dismissal. If you accuse somebody, impeach somebody for being, say, dishonest, that's not a criteria. So it doesn't matter how many witnesses you call, it doesn't matter how many witnesses you call when you accuse somebody of abuse of power or obstruction of Congress. But if they do call witnesses, they have to call witnesses on both sides, and Hunter Biden is obviously a relevant witness to the state of mind of the president which is crucial to impeachment."

He didn't ask for investigation of Elizabeth Warren, or Bernie Sanders, or Amy Klobuchar. He didn't get Joe Biden's name out of the phone book. He asked for an investigation of Vice President Biden because he was investigating corruption. And how do we know that? Four words: Hunter Biden and Burisma. Now, we know for a fact -- I'm not accusing anyone of anything, Sean, but the Ukrainian government is historically and organically corrupt. And Vice President -- or rather, President Obama placed Vice President Biden in charge of the foreign affairs of two countries, Ukraine and China. And in both cases, in both cases, Mr. Hunter Biden, his son, walked away with millions and in some cases billions of dollars of contracts. Now, you know the message that was sent to the rest of the world? That America's foreign policy can be bought like a sack of potatoes. And I think the president's lawyers have proven clearly and convincingly that the president was not investigating Joe Biden because he was a political rival. That he was asking for investigation of corruption, possible corruption, by the vice president and his son. And that is a perfectly legitimate thing for a president to do."

Now, when you hear Joe Biden bragging on tape, I told them they're not getting the billion. I will give you the billion but you've got to first fire the prosecutor investigating my zero experience son being paid millions. Now, I don't know. I grew up in New York.

He's like a 5-year-old in a Batman costume. He's going to this camera and that camera and this camera. He's all atwitter with anticipation. We won't have enough digits to list the number of witnesses that Senator Schumer is going to want to call. And that's why I said that if we open this thing up, if we open this thing up, then we're going to be here at least through April, May, maybe longer.

They are called the members and leaders of the Freedom Caucus, without which we are all screwed. Just saying it. Jim Jordan, four facts never change. And why is that relevant again tonight?

It never will. Those facts are so solid. I also like what Senator Kennedy said. He said this -- it will never be enough for the Democrats. They're always going to want something more. And understand where were at right now, Sean -- the witness count right now is 17-0. Adam Schiff subpoenaed all 17 witnesses, and we didn't get to call any of them. So, it's 17-0, and what do the Democrats want? They want it to be 18-0, and then, pretty soon, it will be 19-0. We should stop this now. All the facts are on the president's side, the Constitution is on his side and the lack of due process that was not there for him in the House, that argument is also on his side.

Here's what I do know. If John Bolton were to testify, it will not change anything. It will not make President Zelensky say he was pressured. It will not make Vice President Pence say that he actually performed a quid pro quo. It will also not inform the Ukrainians that the aid was being held any earlier than they found out in the \"Politico\" article, you know, at the end of August. So, his testimony doesn't matter. What does matter is 53 Republican senators are going to have to make a real hard decision here in a few days. They're going to have to make a decision on whether they're going to let Adam Schiff continue, not only for three years, but for all four years of the first term of the presidency, continue to obstruct and not address prescription drug prices, not fix our roads and bridges. Hopefully, they'll make the right decision because it's not going to matter in the end because the president didn't do anything wrong."

And we've got a book, but we are not going to confirm or deny anything that might or might not be in the book and we're going at all that out there, we're going to sell the book and meanwhile, first, they invoke -- they're going to invoke executive privilege.

But he had to know when he submitted that book to the general counsel at the NSC, where Vindman's brother works and others, that there were going to be problems, and it had to have been -- he's smart enough to know that he was going to create problems, or at least visually give the Democrats something to raise Cain about, even though there is no \"there\" there. But tomorrow's going to be a great day. Questions are going to be asked of the House managers and even though the senators agreed they can't object to the content of an answer, if Schiff doesn't answer a question, they need to submit it again. And if John Roberts is going to actually preside as he is supposed to, he should direct the witness to answer the question. So, I'm hoping we're going to see some good answers tomorrow."

I want to hear from quid pro quo Joe.
