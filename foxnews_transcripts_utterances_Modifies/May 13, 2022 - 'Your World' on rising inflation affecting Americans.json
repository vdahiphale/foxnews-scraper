I'm Neil Cavuto, and this is \"Your World\" focusing right now on a battle back and forth on Title 42 and its legality. Twenty state A.G.s say there is something very illegal going on here by just dumping it, as the administration wants to do on the 23rd of this month, about 10 days away. Let's get the read from Bill Melugin right now in Eagle Pass, how things are looking at the border -- Bill.",

      "sentences": "Neil, good afternoon to you. That federal court hearing on Title 42 wrapped up a little bit earlier this afternoon. It ended with the judge deciding to take no action yet. What that means is that, for now, Title 42 is still set to drop on May 23. That can change, however, when the judge comes up with his decision. He could decide to do an injunction or something else. So we will keep tabs on that. In the meantime, it's chaos down here. I want to show you some video we have shot just right here today. Take a look at this. This was earlier this morning right here, where we're standing in Eagle Pass. This was a single massive group of about 150 illegal immigrants that cross in the middle of broad daylight, right in the middle -- right in front of the Texas National Guard and Border Patrol here in Eagle Pass. This was mostly made up of Cubans, Venezuelans and Colombians. But this was the third day in a row that we have seen a massive group of more than 100 crossing in this exact same spot at pretty much the exact same time, 10:45 a.m. local morning -- local time each morning like clockwork. And these huge groups are a massive drain on Border Patrol resources. But this certainly wasn't the only group today. Take a look at this. Just a short time later, the second piece of video here, another group crossed in the exact same spot. This was a group of 52 we first saw crossing in the river, once again, another group of mostly Colombians, Venezuelans and Cubans. And, for this group, there was only one single Border Patrol agent on hand to receive them once they got here into Eagle Pass. Again, they have to call other agents in from other areas. And that depletes their manpower in other sectors of the border. And keep in mind, all this happening while Title 42 is still in effect right now. And DHS is projecting things could get three times worse come May 23, once Title 42 actually drops. Last thing we'd like to show you, take a look at this piece of video, exact same location again this morning here in Eagle Pass. What you're looking at are a group of suspected smugglers in the river escorting a group of migrants illegally into Eagle Pass. You will see one of the smugglers actually takes a life jacket off one of the women, and then the smugglers go back into Mexico. Pretty rare for us to actually get a look at the smugglers as they're actually physically doing their thing in the middle of the river. And U.S. law enforcement essentially just has to watch. They can't do anything unless these guys cross over to the U.S. side of the border. And back out here live here in Del Rio Sector, where we are, Border Patrol reporting just in a seven-hour span, they arrested two convicted sex offenders, child sex offenders, both of them Mexican nationals who were both previously deported, both of them apparently trying to come back. Thankfully, though, border agents able to arrest both of them -- send it back to you.",

In fact, when we process people through quicker, that just means more people are going to continue to come. That is inviting people to come here. We're hoping for the best.

So when you look at that, right now, we're only expelling about 55 percent of the people that cross the border illegally. Once that goes away completely, that just means everybody from around the world are going to continue to come. So it's just a Band-Aid to push it back. What we have to have is, we have to have permanent solutions. And, Neil, you and I have both talked about what those solutions are. And the Biden administration knows what they need to do.

But it's already been proven under the Obama administration that expedited removal doesn't work, because all somebody has to do is claim that they have a fear of going back to the country. Then that order, that expedited removal order, is canceled, and they're put through the asylum process and released into the United States. So, nothing in those pillars does it give enforcement tools. All it's doing is talking about moving people through the system faster. And that doesn't work.

They have to go through what's called notice and comment. They have to take in comment. They have to put the public on notice. They have to consider all the public input they get, and then they can make their decision. Instead, they just short-circuited that whole process and issued it right away.

In that time, we have made the Nasdaq into a bear market, the S&P 500 not too far from a bear market, and the Dow well into, well, a correction that could be a bear market, but, for today, stable news, confident news out of companies and the belief that maybe they overdid it in the prior days.

But, listen, the drama continues, and on Friday the 13th, no less, I mean, Elon Musk sending shockwaves that the Twitter deal is on hold. He tweeted this morning -- quote -- \"Twitter deal on hold pending details supporting the calculation that spam fake accounts do indeed represent less than 5 percent of users.\" At its last report, the company had confirmed less than 5 percent was accurate, though admitted it was an estimate. But this has investors spooked. I mean, Twitter stock closed down almost 10 percent on the news, nearly $14 below Elon's offer. That means the market value of the company is roughly $13 billion below the $44 billion deal. I mean, that shows how much leverage Musk has. If the deal falls through, Twitter stock may not recover. And this all could be a tactic for the Tesla CEO to renegotiate for a lower purchase price amidst tech stocks being down across the board. Musk did follow up with a tweet saying he's -- quote -- \"still committed to the acquisition.\" Now, if he's looking for a reason to walk, it will be difficult for him to get out of the deal without getting sued by Twitter, as he reportedly declined due diligence to close the deal faster That $1 billion breakup fee could become far greater. But if it surfaces the company misrepresented info when he pokes under the hood, that does give him cause. Now, Twitter is operating under the assumption the takeover is happening, just yesterday firing key leaders and freezing hiring. The CEO weighed in just now, saying -- quote -- \"While I expect the deal to close, we need to be prepared for all scenarios and do what's right for Twitter\" -- so, positive, but he's leaving the door open. Neil, I will leave you with this. Regardless of what happens, I mean, Musk does need to be careful how much his comments shift the stock price.

Let's get the read from Bill Melugin right now in Eagle Pass, how things are looking at the border -- Bill."

      "speaker": "BILL MELUGIN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Neil, good afternoon to you. That federal court hearing on Title 42 wrapped up a little bit earlier this afternoon. It ended with the judge deciding to take no action yet. What that means is that, for now, Title 42 is still set to drop on May 23. That can change, however, when the judge comes up with his decision. He could decide to do an injunction or something else. So we will keep tabs on that. In the meantime, it's chaos down here. I want to show you some video we have shot just right here today. Take a look at this. This was earlier this morning right here, where we're standing in Eagle Pass. This was a single massive group of about 150 illegal immigrants that cross in the middle of broad daylight, right in the middle -- right in front of the Texas National Guard and Border Patrol here in Eagle Pass. This was mostly made up of Cubans, Venezuelans and Colombians. But this was the third day in a row that we have seen a massive group of more than 100 crossing in this exact same spot at pretty much the exact same time, 10:45 a.m. local morning -- local time each morning like clockwork. And these huge groups are a massive drain on Border Patrol resources. But this certainly wasn't the only group today. Take a look at this. Just a short time later, the second piece of video here, another group crossed in the exact same spot. This was a group of 52 we first saw crossing in the river, once again, another group of mostly Colombians, Venezuelans and Cubans. And, for this group, there was only one single Border Patrol agent on hand to receive them once they got here into Eagle Pass. Again, they have to call other agents in from other areas. And that depletes their manpower in other sectors of the border. And keep in mind, all this happening while Title 42 is still in effect right now. And DHS is projecting things could get three times worse come May 23, once Title 42 actually drops. Last thing we'd like to show you, take a look at this piece of video, exact same location again this morning here in Eagle Pass. What you're looking at are a group of suspected smugglers in the river escorting a group of migrants illegally into Eagle Pass. You will see one of the smugglers actually takes a life jacket off one of the women, and then the smugglers go back into Mexico. Pretty rare for us to actually get a look at the smugglers as they're actually physically doing their thing in the middle of the river. And U.S. law enforcement essentially just has to watch. They can't do anything unless these guys cross over to the U.S. side of the border. And back out here live here in Del Rio Sector, where we are, Border Patrol reporting just in a seven-hour span, they arrested two convicted sex offenders, child sex offenders, both of them Mexican nationals who were both previously deported, both of them apparently trying to come back. Thankfully, though, border agents able to arrest both of them -- send it back to you."

      "speaker": "JACQUI HEINRICH, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Hey there, Neil. Well, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki got some questions in the briefing about how the Biden administration might respond to this upcoming federal court ruling that will determine whether they can follow through with their plans to lift Title 42 on May 23. She was asked how that would all work, if there was a delay, whether it would change any plans at the White House. She said that preparations have been ongoing for Title 42 to lift for months. It includes sending more resources to the border to increase processing capacity, but she would not weigh in on how she thinks this case is going to go."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEINRICH",
      "utterance": "Attorneys general bringing that suit are thinking the judge might lean in their favor because he was willing to issue that temporary restraining order, which they took is a sign that he wants the White House to pump the brakes. And they're issuing warnings again that, if Title 42 is lifted, this migrant surge will overwhelm law enforcement and communities."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MARK BRNOVICH (R), ARIZONA ATTORNEY GENERAL",
      "utterance": "You never -- I learned a long time ago not to predict what a judge will do. But the fact that he was willing to issue a temporary restraining order and tell the Biden administration to stop and pump the brakes is a good sign that he's inclined to -- he is inclined to rule in our favor. It's overwhelming our social services. it's overwhelming our border communities. And so there's a great fiscal cost, but there's also this toll in human lives that's being paid as a result of the failure of Joe Biden and Secretary Mayorkas."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEINRICH",
      "utterance": "So part of the DHS plan to address the migrant surge at the border involves sending 600 law enforcement personnel from other government agencies down to the border to help with the surge, to help out with Customs and Border Protection, which is a force already 23,000-people strong and struggling even without this coming surge of up to 18,000 migrants a day that is expected when Title 42 is lifted. Of course, that is much more than the average of 7,000 that we're seeing right now. And this group of border state attorneys general say what's really going to get worse is the cartels and fentanyl that is going to be coming across that border -- Neil."

You have heard a lot of these migrants who are no longer being processed in Texas, and they spread about in places like Washington, D.C., the latest in New York City, where a good many have just arrived. Brandon Judd is the Border Patrol Union president. Brandon, I have a feeling we could be seeing a lot more of these flights and/or buses of those trying to find their way here beyond Texas. How do you feel about that, that process has not been interrupted; in fact, it's picking up considerable steam?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BRANDON JUDD, PRESIDENT, NATIONAL BORDER PATROL COUNCIL",
      "utterance": "Neil, every single one of my agents and myself, we're extremely upset. We feel beaten down. We feel like this administration has not given us the enforcement tools. They have given us the processing tools, but they haven't given us the enforcement tools to stop this crisis that currently goes on. In fact, when we process people through quicker, that just means more people are going to continue to come. That is inviting people to come here. We're hoping for the best. But there's been nothing from this administration that has given us any hope that there's going to be a light at the end of the tunnel. This just continues to get worse and worse and worse. And the American public is paying for it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Brandon, I always wonder, what will come of this decision, whether they will just remove this Title 42 suspension or just suspend the suspension, you know what I mean, like push it back another month or so. That won't help you in any way."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUDD",
      "utterance": "No, it doesn't. We have already seen what happens when you cut out segments. As Bill was reporting down there, on -- in Del Rio, when we cut out segments, when we give carve-outs to Venezuelans, Cubans, Colombians, which, by the way, we do not exercise on Title 42 on any of those countries, that just invites more people to come. So when you look at that, right now, we're only expelling about 55 percent of the people that cross the border illegally. Once that goes away completely, that just means everybody from around the world are going to continue to come. So it's just a Band-Aid to push it back. What we have to have is, we have to have permanent solutions. And, Neil, you and I have both talked about what those solutions are. And the Biden administration knows what they need to do. They just fail to do it. They will not put this -- the proper enforcement tools in place, because they pander to their far left, open border base."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Do you know, Brandon, whether the administration, if it were to get its way to stop Title 42 on the 23rd, that they're going to beef up manpower, womanpower on the border with your people to deal with what even they acknowledge could be an increase, and likely a significant increase, to your point, in migrants trying to get through?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUDD",
      "utterance": "No, I have never been more disappointed in a plan than what I saw from DHS, that six-pillar plan. All it's talking about is moving people through the system faster. It's not talking about any enforcement tools, except for pillar number three, where they say it's going to be expedited removal. But it's already been proven under the Obama administration that expedited removal doesn't work, because all somebody has to do is claim that they have a fear of going back to the country. Then that order, that expedited removal order, is canceled, and they're put through the asylum process and released into the United States. So, nothing in those pillars does it give enforcement tools. All it's doing is talking about moving people through the system faster. And that doesn't work. That just encourages more illegal immigration."

And he just wants -- wants everyone to slow down, stop, think about the importance of this. John Yoo on the legal implications of all of this right now, the former deputy assistant attorney general, following this very, very closely. John, from a legal perspective here, what's the best someone like a Brandon Judd can hope for out of this judge, to push it back, say that the suspension was entirely unnecessary? What?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JOHN YOO, FORMER DEPUTY ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL",
      "utterance": "Under the law here, the federal government does have the power to lift what's called this Title 42 restriction, which is what prevents people from coming across the border, because of fear that they might be bringing COVID with them. Eventually, the government can lift it. What this lawsuit is about by the attorney generals is that the Biden administration did not do it in the right way. They can't just lift it immediately. They have to go through what's called notice and comment. They have to take in comment. They have to put the public on notice. They have to consider all the public input they get, and then they can make their decision. Instead, they just short-circuited that whole process and issued it right away. Then the second thing, I think this is the other problem that the Biden administration has, is that the position they're taking seems inconsistent with the other positions they're taking in other COVID litigation."

    {
      "speaker": "YOO",
      "utterance": "We have talked on the show before about the mask mandate, about the vaccine mandate, where the government is saying, no, COVID still a danger. We have still got to require everyone on planes to wear masks. We want to vaccinate everyone in the country. That doesn't seem consistent with the idea of, like, COVID being brought by aliens crossing the border, where we don't know if they're vaccinated, we don't know if they have been wearing masks, is OK."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Yes, the other part I wondered about, they don't -- they want to keep this sort of on the CDC health grounds. I get that. But they have been reminding -- I don't know if it was part of their case today -- to say that, if Title 42 were such a great thing, why are we having this surge we're having with it in place now? How legally sure of their ground are they on that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "YOO",
      "utterance": "So this is the thing that the by administration has to survive, is that the district judge, the one here in Louisiana, who then they can go to the Fifth Circuit, which is based in Texas and Louisiana, that judge can say, I think you're -- you, the agency, I think your views are arbitrary and capricious. You don't have any facts. You don't have any reasons. And the problem is that, as you just said, Neil, COVID could go up or down. We might have just left a wave. But what if a wave comes back? If you drop that ability to block COVID-carrying immigrants across the border, then you're kind of defenseless if another wave comes back."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "John Yoo, the former deputy assistant attorney general. Very quickly, I want to bring your attention, before we take a break here, to the corner of Wall and Broad. We had a strong day, a comeback day, for the markets, but still down on the week. The Dow, the S&P, the Nasdaq, although up smartly today, maybe on the notion that they overdid the selling, it didn't remove the fact that we sold for the seventh straight week in a row for these market averages here. And that's something that has not changed. In that time, we have made the Nasdaq into a bear market, the S&P 500 not too far from a bear market, and the Dow well into, well, a correction that could be a bear market, but, for today, stable news, confident news out of companies and the belief that maybe they overdid it in the prior days. Anyone's guess."

It gets kind of in the weeds, but I have noticed, with Kelly O'Grady following this story, she can explain those weeds. Kelly, is he's saying, I'm not interested in this? What is going on here?"

      "speaker": "KELLY O'GRADY, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Well, that's high praise, Neil. I will try and do it justice. But, listen, the drama continues, and on Friday the 13th, no less, I mean, Elon Musk sending shockwaves that the Twitter deal is on hold. He tweeted this morning -- quote -- \"Twitter deal on hold pending details supporting the calculation that spam fake accounts do indeed represent less than 5 percent of users.\" At its last report, the company had confirmed less than 5 percent was accurate, though admitted it was an estimate. But this has investors spooked. I mean, Twitter stock closed down almost 10 percent on the news, nearly $14 below Elon's offer. That means the market value of the company is roughly $13 billion below the $44 billion deal. I mean, that shows how much leverage Musk has. If the deal falls through, Twitter stock may not recover. And this all could be a tactic for the Tesla CEO to renegotiate for a lower purchase price amidst tech stocks being down across the board. Musk did follow up with a tweet saying he's -- quote -- \"still committed to the acquisition.\" Now, if he's looking for a reason to walk, it will be difficult for him to get out of the deal without getting sued by Twitter, as he reportedly declined due diligence to close the deal faster That $1 billion breakup fee could become far greater. But if it surfaces the company misrepresented info when he pokes under the hood, that does give him cause. Now, Twitter is operating under the assumption the takeover is happening, just yesterday firing key leaders and freezing hiring. The CEO weighed in just now, saying -- quote -- \"While I expect the deal to close, we need to be prepared for all scenarios and do what's right for Twitter\" -- so, positive, but he's leaving the door open. Neil, I will leave you with this. Regardless of what happens, I mean, Musk does need to be careful how much his comments shift the stock price. He's already under fire from the Tesla shareholders and the SEC for the impact of his tweeting."

I mean, I watched the reaction of a lot of the left-wing liberals and they got freaked out. I mean, they dedicated their whole shows, their whole Twitter accounts to how this was a takeover and it was going to mess up free speech and all that stuff. So he laughed.

If stock markets go up, especially when you heard Jerome Powell yesterday talking about short-term pain to get inflation lower and raising interest rates by one full percentage point at least this summer, and stocks end the week lower -- higher -- pardon me -- and stocks rally into the weekend, I think that's positive."

For people in America, inflation is a very big problem in America; 23 percent are saying it's a moderately big problem. And it's only 6 percent - - they have got to be ungodly rich -- are saying, no, it's a small problem or not a problem at all, so why are you bothering us? Well, the bottom line is, it's out of control. And it remains out of control. And it's gotten so bad that we celebrate when it's not rising as quickly as it was, but it's still rising at multidecade levels. To Senator Joe Lieberman with us, the former Connecticut senator, the 2000 vice presidential nominee, much, much more. Senator, now we're hearing that many Democrats and the powers that be are indeed talking to the White House, right, and they're talking to President Biden directly that this has got to be topic one, job one, issue one day in and day out. What do you think of that?"

That's an underlying, continuing problem, and that his administration..."

But how can he connect with the American people, when it's happening under his watch, when it's not nearly as short as he claimed, and just say, all right, part of this is on me, but I'm going to work with us to make sure this problem goes away?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LIEBERMAN",
      "utterance": "Yes. No, I totally agree with you. I think that's part of regaining the confidence of a lot of people in the country, that he's leveling with them. There's no question that, though there are a lot of other issues boiling like the Supreme Court decision and a war in Ukraine..."

      "utterance": "... it is inflation that strikes people in the face every day in this country, most people. And he's got to be talking about and doing something about it. Now, part of the problem is, what can he do? I do think that the -- in the short run, which is, politically speaking, between now and the November elections, the Federal Reserve plays the largest part. It really did, by now, by its own acknowledgement, wait too long, and underestimate how serious inflation would be. Now they have got to deal with it. But they have got to deal with it in a way that doesn't send us into a recession. Second thing is, I think the Biden administration has to do everything it can to make sure that there's not another outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic because that would again exacerbate the problem by taking people out of the labor force, limiting supply chain and creating a problem."

      "speaker": "LIEBERMAN",
      "utterance": "And then I think the final thing, maybe it's clear, that the administration and Congress unfortunately did contribute to the inflation problem by putting a lot of money in people's pockets, stimulus checks, unemployment benefits, done with good intentions. But there was more money out there than there were goods. And that's -- that causes inflation. So there's got to be some limits on spending right now."

And then, finally, we got to improve our relations with the Gulf Arab countries, who can pump a lot more oil into the world economy. And part of why they're not doing it now is not only for their own profit, but because they don't have confidence in us to side with them as against their main enemy, which is Iran."

But word right now that Ukrainian forces took out an entire Russian armored column as it was trying to cross a river in the Russian-controlled Donbass region raise concerns anew that even places that our strongholds for Vladimir Putin aren't so strong. Let's get the read from Lieutenant Colonel Bob Maginnis, author of many books, \"Alliance of Evil\" just one of them. Colonel, they're having a devil of a time, aren't they, the Russians, but even in regions where you would think they have the edge, maybe still do, but not nearly as much as we thought. What's going on?"

    {
      "speaker": "LT. COL. BOB MAGINNIS (RET.), U.S. ARMY",
      "utterance": "Yes, drone shots of that river crossing are just tragic for the Russians. They tried three times, and they left in place the hulks of many tanks, based upon locals. And so what's happened over the last several months, Neil, is that the Russians have taken a real whacking. They have lost maybe 20-something-thousand troops. They have lost a lot of their mainline battle tanks, by some estimates, 500, 600. And, of course, what's happened overall is that the Russian capability is diminishing as the Ukrainian, interestingly, capability is increasing. So what we have here is that Mr. Putin, his ambitions haven't changed, according to DNI Haines. However, his capability with his conventional forces isn't what is needed if he really intends to not only capture the Donbass, but all the way to Moldova, much less much more of Ukraine."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Colonel, I'm thinking, if I'm Finland, and I have got a better- than-800-long-mile border with Russia, and I'm being threatened by Vladimir Putin because I want to join NATO, and I'm looking at all the problems he's having in Ukraine, even in regions he supposedly dominates, I'm not as worried. Or should I be?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MAGINNIS",
      "utterance": "Well, they are neighbors. They have 800 miles of common border. But the Finns have a very capable military. In fact, the Finns have been working hand in glove with NATO for many, many years. They have all the modern and sophisticated weaponry. And, of course, I think that, in a matter of weeks, they will probably be NATO members. And then we will really increase the number of exercises in the region. And it's quite possible -- this is -- Putin doesn't want to hear this -- but that the U.S. will put a permanent force in Finland. And if that does happen, then what's happened in Ukraine is going to really be just a precursor to something that perhaps many years from now may happen again."

We're going to be exploring this in a lot more detail tomorrow at 10:00 a.m. Eastern time on my weekend show, \"Cavuto Live,\" where we pick apart the strategy that is just not going that well for Russia, and any hope that it will anytime soon.

In fact, it was, where he shut down Keystone. And you reminded a lot of folks then that oil trades in the open markets, and that was quickly taken as a signal this administration didn't like traditional fossil fuel, and this was going to be the tune and the tone. How bad does this get?"

      "speaker": "PERRY",
      "utterance": "It could get very bad. And I suggest that it will. I wish that wasn't the message. But -- and here's one of the reasons, is that diesel is what runs this country. When you think about the trucks that move the groceries, all the other produce around in this country, diesel is right at the heart of it. That's one of the things that's really driving up the cost of food. And that comes from heavy crude. Heavy crude was accessed through two countries, interestingly, Russia and Venezuela. I will suggest to you the Biden administration knew and know what's going on today, that their policies are going to drive up the cost of inflation, particularly energy costs, which, in turn, multiplies into the inflation factor. But here's the issue. We saw Biden making these decisions, the Biden administration making these decisions. And I think it's one of the reasons that there were people whispering in his ear when the Ukraine war started that we can't stop taking crude from Russia because it's going to really drive up the cost of diesel and the heavy..."

I mean, they -- that is, the administration teased opening some lands and licenses and permits to oil companies, then, this past week out of the blue, shutting virtually all of that down. I mean, whatever people's views on this subject, the politics of it and all, I can't imagine a worse-timed move."

We're fixing to go into one of the high traveling seasons of the year. And gasoline prices, I think we have not seen the top by any sense of the imagination. And stopping the -- the message that it sends to producers for the spokesperson in the White House to stand up and say, well, we have all these permits, and they just -- nobody's interested, well, Ms. Psaki, the reason they're not interested is because they know that you all will play the old \"Peanuts\" game and jerk the football away from the from the player.

Number one, forgiving the debt, as they're calling it, does nothing to control the real issue, which is the soaring cost of college tuition. To be clear, $10,000 worth of debt is like two books at the bookstore these days. And that's the thing we need to tackle, is that colleges have such a monopoly. And the prices just keep going up, up, up. But when everybody says to you, oh, it's so -- it sucks for these kids, because they have this major debt, and they're stuck with it, maybe it does suck. But you know what sucks more, Neil? Being the person who didn't even go to that school who's now paying for some of it in their tax bill. So, to oversimplify this, imagine this is like Applebee's mailing you a bill for a meal you didn't even get to eat. Like, yo, Biden at least stick some chicken fingers in the envelope."

According to the economic data we have at our disposal, the higher income earners are the kids who have these degrees. So, the AOCs of the world that are driving Teslas are now getting bailed out by the Jimmy Faillas of the world that are hitchhiking or driving a yellow cab when they're not here at FOX News. And that's the real racket, man, is, they're taking personal responsibility out of society. And I can tell you, as someone who really, I mean, for all intents and purposes, literally had to fight to get here -- when you're driving a cab, you're getting cut off and shot at.
