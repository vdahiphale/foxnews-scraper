As today, even the Washington Post acknowledged that blue-collar jobs are growing in this country at the fastest rate since 1984 which could boost Republicans ahead of the midterms. Because the boom is happening in rural areas that President Trump promised to help in 2016. Those areas that, of course, he carried to victory in the last election.  The key is these are the types of jobs and as you noted, former President Obama said, would never be coming back in the manufacturing industry, construction industry, and others. In fact, he claimed at the time, as you noted that Donald Trump was giving workers a false hope by pretending to have some sort of magic wand.   Well, whether it's magic or something else, those jobs have come back in the manufacturing, mining, and construction industries. The Post reporting in the last year, the economy has added 656,000 blue-collar jobs, you see them there. Rural employment growing in an annualized rate of 5.1 percent in the first quarter. And then, in the second quarter, overall economic growth as you've heard has reached 4.2 percent. Now, former President Obama admits he's abandoning an American tradition of former presidents sitting on the sidelines because he wants to make the case to midterm voters that as he puts it, our Democracy depends on his party taking back Congress. A move that thrilled some Democrats but is also cheering president Trump because he thinks Obama being front and center will fire up the Republican base.",

Remember, Whitewater led to the Monica Lewinsky investigation. Starr says, during the depositions President Clinton bobbed and weaved but was pleasant as he avoided answering questions. But he says the first lady was different quoting now in the space of three hours she claimed by our count over a hundred times that she did not recall or did not remember this suggested outright mendacity. To be sure human memory is notoriously fallible but her strained performance struck us as preposterous. Though Starr also acknowledges it would have been difficult to prove that she lied. He also says he regrets taking on the Lewinsky phase of the investigation but writes that there was no practical alternative. And Starr says there are eerie parallels to his investigation and the Robert Mueller investigation saying, both came at times when the American economy was thriving and then he was asked about President Trump's comment that Democrats wouldn't impeach him because he's doing such a good job.

That's a pretty strong looking storm out there, Adam.",

      "sentences": "Yes, it's a big one. This morning it was a Category Two storm jumping up to a Category Four storm already, so rapidly intensifying and the strength we're seeing currently is going to be sticking with it. Now, this is still a long ways offshore. There it spins nice to find eyewall there as it spends winds at 140 miles Category Four. Here's the projected path right now and you can tell south of Bermuda we still have to wait a while until this eventually makes its way to shore. But if I take you in by Thursday morning, that is when we're sitting just off the coast I think conditions begin to deteriorate in South Carolina to North Carolina by Thursday morning. It's going to be an afternoon to overnight event as far as landfall goes for this system. Winds will still be up to Category Four level which means 140, 150 miles an hour. This is going to be a major wind event when it eventually makes landfall. There's your Category Four ranking. It's likely going to stay right there around 150 mile-an-hour winds when this makes landfall. Typically a storm where this is sitting, South of Bermuda would turn and head off to sea. That is not going to be the case because we have this high-pressure system. So even though we're days and days out we have a pretty good idea. These are several forecast models taking this into the Carolinas anywhere for perhaps Myrtle Beach stretching up towards the Outer Banks, an area that will likely eventually see this. Now, where there's a bit of indecision still because this is so far out, what happens once we get to the coast? Well, the models all begin to kind of fall apart. You can see there several have it hovering just off the coast, some right over the coast, some bring it right in. And that's going to make a huge difference for folks living in those regions because if you spin right over an area, we're already going to see the wind, we're already going to see the storm surge, but if you spin right over an area, that's when you start to see rainfall really beginning to pile up 12 to 20 inches, some spots getting up well over two feet. This is just one forecast model and it's a little early but it gives you an idea what would happen if we see this storm spin over one location for a long time. So again the timing for this we're looking getting closer on Wednesday that I'm really thinking Thursday evening into early Friday morning, that is when we officially see landfall, but definitely all day Thursday, Martha, is when we really start to focus on this.",

He was -- because it feels like a different brand from Obama's populace. It's a different set of voters. It's appealing predominantly to an appeal to working class white voters especially in the upper Midwest whereas Obama was talking to some of those voters but a different group. And Obama was lamenting the divisiveness. And he was lamenting the demagoguery and all of that stuff. And I kept thinking, well, it was pretty good for you when you were doing it. It was pretty for you when you were running in 2008 and you were building straw men and using light demagoguery of a different maybe more subtle kind but using some of the same tactics, Look, populism is always appealing because the guy who comes says I will fix it for you, not those suckers, I'll fix it for you.

Their lives ravaged by their trusted family priest who betrayed them in the most depraved way imaginable, steeling the innocence of five of their beloved daughters. All while masquerading as a man of god. It was early 1980 when Father Gus Giella suddenly packed up and left his parish in New Jersey. He headed to a new church in Pennsylvania. The Fortney family welcomed the new priest into their home. He came for dinners. Gave the kids gifts. Ask the children to come to the rectory and helped them count the Sunday collections. The sisters say he began to groom them under the guise of what he called education. The family says the abuse began to happen in the rectory, in their home, on family trips. Virtually everywhere they went together. For Patty it started when she was 13. Continued until she was 15. Lara was 10 years old and it went on until she was 14. Teresa was just eight. She went through this for four long years. Marissa was only seven and it stopped when she turned 10. Carolyn was just a toddler. She was two years old. He didn't stop until she was 12. And only then because that's when his story blew up in his face. While we do not know the full extent of what they suffered, a recent grand jury said he admitted to fondling the girls, investigators then found he had regularly collected samples of their urine, pubic hair and blood. Tragically, the grand jury also discovered now in all-too familiar tale that the church new about Gus Giella. In 1987, a local teacher got a complaint that Giella was doing, quote, \"wrong things with children.\" Asking to follow them into the bathroom. The teacher reported them to the principal who immediately reported it to the diocese where it went nowhere. Another note rested then bishop and later Cardinal William Keeler mentioned concerns about Giella. But neither did anything. Although he voluntarily retired in 1988, he was still an active predator according to his victims. And in 1992 some of the Fortney's beach house when the unthinkable happened. A young niece found a box of photos in the house. Inside were pictures of naked young girls. One of them was Caroline Fortney. Father Giella was confronted and questioned by a Father Helwig. Giella told Helwig it had started in the bath and had progressed from there. He said he imagined the family would be sore at him. And he would agree not to contact them. Father Helwig told Mrs. Fortney, you can relax. Father said that - redacted - just took his intentions to her wrong. That he loved her and he would never hurt her. That is when Giella was arrested but he died before his trial. No available church records indicate that they ever told the authorities about him. The full story only coming out decades later as a part of a massive state investigation into clergy church abuse. Joining me now on set, sisters Laura, Patty, Carolyn and Teresa. And from Pennsylvania, mom Pat and dad Ed, and their supportive sisters, Sandra and Jennie. You know, I do want to start, Pat, with you in Harrisburg. Because when I go through your story and you learn about after all of this, begin to become exposed. You went to the priest.",

But that is nothing compared to what could come next as conservatives are urging the President to go one step further. And to deliver what they hope might be a knockout punch by authorizing the release of classified documents detailing the earliest days of the Trump-Russia probe. And whether or not, the Obama administration may have played a role. New York Post columnist Michael Goodwin and Marie Harf at President Obama's former State Department spokesperson join me in a moment. But first, chief national correspondent Ed Henry live at the White House tonight with all this backstory. Hi, Ed."

      "utterance": "Martha, great to see you. Advantage President Trump over former President Obama at least for now. As today, even the Washington Post acknowledged that blue-collar jobs are growing in this country at the fastest rate since 1984 which could boost Republicans ahead of the midterms. Because the boom is happening in rural areas that President Trump promised to help in 2016. Those areas that, of course, he carried to victory in the last election. The key is these are the types of jobs and as you noted, former President Obama said, would never be coming back in the manufacturing industry, construction industry, and others. In fact, he claimed at the time, as you noted that Donald Trump was giving workers a false hope by pretending to have some sort of magic wand. Well, whether it's magic or something else, those jobs have come back in the manufacturing, mining, and construction industries. The Post reporting in the last year, the economy has added 656,000 blue-collar jobs, you see them there. Rural employment growing in an annualized rate of 5.1 percent in the first quarter. And then, in the second quarter, overall economic growth as you've heard has reached 4.2 percent. Now, former President Obama admits he's abandoning an American tradition of former presidents sitting on the sidelines because he wants to make the case to midterm voters that as he puts it, our Democracy depends on his party taking back Congress. A move that thrilled some Democrats but is also cheering president Trump because he thinks Obama being front and center will fire up the Republican base."

It's actually, first time in about 10 years. But the point is, the recovery is getting stronger, and this conservative Charlie Kirk noted that if President Trump is doing such a bad job as a resistant -- resistance movement claims, why is former President Obama trying so hard to claim credit for what's happening right now? Martha."

Hillary Clinton is still on the sidelines throwing little grenades in every now and then. So, I think the Democratic Party sees this midterm clearly as a referendum on President Trump. But I think the economy is such a strong suit in the president's hands. And you mentioned earlier about these documents. I do think that there is still a big, big question as to who did what in the Obama White House, and in the Obama administration regarding the Russia probe. And whether James Clapper, John Brennan, how much the FBI was involved, Susan Rice, Samantha Power. I mean, on and on in terms of all the people in the administration. What role, John Kerry? What role did the State Department play? So, I think, this is still out there. And the president has the power to declassify the document."

Secrecy is one of the great advantages of the swamp. And so, for the president not to declassify, I think he's really helping the swamp keep its dirty secret."

Is -- then, in many of these places his campaign, its way ahead of where Donald Trump is. So, I actually think Barack Obama has a point here when he's getting on the campaign trail. But when it comes to Russia, the point he made there, I stood at the State Department podium and had to answer questions from Republican members of Congress about why our administration was quote, \"too willing to work with Russia.\" All of those Republicans in Congress now are silent. Now, that Donald Trump praises Putin, he stands next to him and blames the U.S. intelligence community, all of those Republicans are suddenly silent about Russia now. And that's what Barack Obama was saying."

If you hire Christopher Steele, and he's getting his information from Russians, and the Hillary Clinton campaign is paying for the stuff, and then, you use that stuff to get the FISA warrant, you know, you can -- you can laugh, but why not just answer those questions? Why not reveal those documents?"

It turns out the FBI was also paying him and then, fired him. Did they tell the judges that they fired him because he lied? I mean, if you don't give the judges all of that information, you have -- you have really committed I think a wrongdoing, a serious wrongdoing. Whether it's a crime, I don't know.

And they may have been working with Trump campaign people. Some of those journalists that were working on this, some of these Russian dissidents, there is a history of them disappearing, as we've seen in Russia.

The book drops tomorrow but a lot of jaws dropped today when we learned that former Independent Counsel Ken Starr considered bringing perjury charges against First Lady Hillary Clinton. Starr says in January of 1995, he deposed both President Clinton and Mrs. Clinton about the suicide of White House Adviser Vince Foster and other issues dealing with the Whitewater land deal investigation. Remember, Whitewater led to the Monica Lewinsky investigation. Starr says, during the depositions President Clinton bobbed and weaved but was pleasant as he avoided answering questions. But he says the first lady was different quoting now in the space of three hours she claimed by our count over a hundred times that she did not recall or did not remember this suggested outright mendacity. To be sure human memory is notoriously fallible but her strained performance struck us as preposterous. Though Starr also acknowledges it would have been difficult to prove that she lied. He also says he regrets taking on the Lewinsky phase of the investigation but writes that there was no practical alternative. And Starr says there are eerie parallels to his investigation and the Robert Mueller investigation saying, both came at times when the American economy was thriving and then he was asked about President Trump's comment that Democrats wouldn't impeach him because he's doing such a good job.

Hurricane Florence is now on track to be the worst storm to hit the East Coast in decades. The Category Four now gaining strength by the hour as it barrels towards the U.S. Meteorologist Adam Klotz is here now on the latest update on the projected path and the timing of Florence. That's a pretty strong looking storm out there, Adam."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ADAM KLOTZ, FOX NEWS METEOROLOGIST",
      "utterance": "Yes, it's a big one. This morning it was a Category Two storm jumping up to a Category Four storm already, so rapidly intensifying and the strength we're seeing currently is going to be sticking with it. Now, this is still a long ways offshore. There it spins nice to find eyewall there as it spends winds at 140 miles Category Four. Here's the projected path right now and you can tell south of Bermuda we still have to wait a while until this eventually makes its way to shore. But if I take you in by Thursday morning, that is when we're sitting just off the coast I think conditions begin to deteriorate in South Carolina to North Carolina by Thursday morning. It's going to be an afternoon to overnight event as far as landfall goes for this system. Winds will still be up to Category Four level which means 140, 150 miles an hour. This is going to be a major wind event when it eventually makes landfall. There's your Category Four ranking. It's likely going to stay right there around 150 mile-an-hour winds when this makes landfall. Typically a storm where this is sitting, South of Bermuda would turn and head off to sea. That is not going to be the case because we have this high-pressure system. So even though we're days and days out we have a pretty good idea. These are several forecast models taking this into the Carolinas anywhere for perhaps Myrtle Beach stretching up towards the Outer Banks, an area that will likely eventually see this. Now, where there's a bit of indecision still because this is so far out, what happens once we get to the coast? Well, the models all begin to kind of fall apart. You can see there several have it hovering just off the coast, some right over the coast, some bring it right in. And that's going to make a huge difference for folks living in those regions because if you spin right over an area, we're already going to see the wind, we're already going to see the storm surge, but if you spin right over an area, that's when you start to see rainfall really beginning to pile up 12 to 20 inches, some spots getting up well over two feet. This is just one forecast model and it's a little early but it gives you an idea what would happen if we see this storm spin over one location for a long time. So again the timing for this we're looking getting closer on Wednesday that I'm really thinking Thursday evening into early Friday morning, that is when we officially see landfall, but definitely all day Thursday, Martha, is when we really start to focus on this."

Part of the problem is that a lot of young particularly young people but a lot of people generally just when they say socialism they just mean an economic system different than the one way -- the one that we have right now.

He's -- you know, Denmark, Sweden, these places are much more free market than people realize and America's welfare state is much more generous than they realize. What they're saying is I didn't like the financial crisis, I want things to be different and they call that socialism."

And then we also heard from President Obama also saying and you know so much of the McCain funeral was all about you know, bringing people together.

He was -- because it feels like a different brand from Obama's populace. It's a different set of voters. It's appealing predominantly to an appeal to working class white voters especially in the upper Midwest whereas Obama was talking to some of those voters but a different group. And Obama was lamenting the divisiveness. And he was lamenting the demagoguery and all of that stuff. And I kept thinking, well, it was pretty good for you when you were doing it. It was pretty for you when you were running in 2008 and you were building straw men and using light demagoguery of a different maybe more subtle kind but using some of the same tactics, Look, populism is always appealing because the guy who comes says I will fix it for you, not those suckers, I'll fix it for you.

      "utterance": "This family went through hell. Their lives ravaged by their trusted family priest who betrayed them in the most depraved way imaginable, steeling the innocence of five of their beloved daughters. All while masquerading as a man of god. It was early 1980 when Father Gus Giella suddenly packed up and left his parish in New Jersey. He headed to a new church in Pennsylvania. The Fortney family welcomed the new priest into their home. He came for dinners. Gave the kids gifts. Ask the children to come to the rectory and helped them count the Sunday collections. The sisters say he began to groom them under the guise of what he called education. The family says the abuse began to happen in the rectory, in their home, on family trips. Virtually everywhere they went together. For Patty it started when she was 13. Continued until she was 15. Lara was 10 years old and it went on until she was 14. Teresa was just eight. She went through this for four long years. Marissa was only seven and it stopped when she turned 10. Carolyn was just a toddler. She was two years old. He didn't stop until she was 12. And only then because that's when his story blew up in his face. While we do not know the full extent of what they suffered, a recent grand jury said he admitted to fondling the girls, investigators then found he had regularly collected samples of their urine, pubic hair and blood. Tragically, the grand jury also discovered now in all-too familiar tale that the church new about Gus Giella. In 1987, a local teacher got a complaint that Giella was doing, quote, \"wrong things with children.\" Asking to follow them into the bathroom. The teacher reported them to the principal who immediately reported it to the diocese where it went nowhere. Another note rested then bishop and later Cardinal William Keeler mentioned concerns about Giella. But neither did anything. Although he voluntarily retired in 1988, he was still an active predator according to his victims. And in 1992 some of the Fortney's beach house when the unthinkable happened. A young niece found a box of photos in the house. Inside were pictures of naked young girls. One of them was Caroline Fortney. Father Giella was confronted and questioned by a Father Helwig. Giella told Helwig it had started in the bath and had progressed from there. He said he imagined the family would be sore at him. And he would agree not to contact them. Father Helwig told Mrs. Fortney, you can relax. Father said that - redacted - just took his intentions to her wrong. That he loved her and he would never hurt her. That is when Giella was arrested but he died before his trial. No available church records indicate that they ever told the authorities about him. The full story only coming out decades later as a part of a massive state investigation into clergy church abuse. Joining me now on set, sisters Laura, Patty, Carolyn and Teresa. And from Pennsylvania, mom Pat and dad Ed, and their supportive sisters, Sandra and Jennie. You know, I do want to start, Pat, with you in Harrisburg. Because when I go through your story and you learn about after all of this, begin to become exposed. You went to the priest."

He called me and he said, Pat, I talked to Father Giella and he assured me that Caroline was mistaken for his feelings for her. There was nothing was going on. Never heard from the church again."
