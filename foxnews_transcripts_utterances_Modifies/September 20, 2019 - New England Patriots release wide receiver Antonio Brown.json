      "sentences": "All right, I do want to update you on something that Shepard just pointed out here. We're following up on a scene. This is near the Woodfield Mall just about 25 minutes ago. Police are saying that a car just drove into the mall, entering through a Sears. Witnesses were saying on the scene that it was driving aimlessly.  There were gunshots heard as well. As Shepard was talking to a gentleman of a store in that mall, he was unaware of the vehicle, but did hear the gunshots. We do know that this has apparently ended and that the suspect or at least the driver that SUV is in custody.  So much we don't know. And we're not going to get into the conjecture game here.  But I did want to get a quick read on this from former NYPD Detective Pat Brosnan, who joins us on the phone. Very little to sort of put together at this point, Pat, but what do you make of what you heard?",

Aimlessly, as you pointed out, first of all, an SUV be driving through the mall.  Second is, apparently, several ear witness accounts of gunshots or what the ear witnesses believed to be gunshots. And, third, you have police with their weapons drawn fanning out throughout the area.   So if you if you align those -- those apparent facts together, it seems like a very, very serious situation.",

And this just happened about now close to half-hour ago at the Woodfield Mall, a driver apparently making his way into the mall -- deliberately driving through a Sears and into the mall, randomly driving around here. Now, you heard from a store owner in that mall near that Sears where apparently this vehicle entered he did not know about the vehicle entering, but he did hear gunshots. So, putting this together at this stage is a little bit risky.  We're going to monitor it for you. We're going to stay on top of it. We get more details, we will keep you posted.  In the meantime, other big news to tell you about today of the international variety. And that concerns the administration getting tough right now on Iran. It's not only upped the ante when it comes to sanctions, but it's gone after Iran's Central Bank. That is unprecedented. Remember, that is the means by which Iran gets money in and sends money out.

World leaders will gather next week in New York for the annual United Nations General Assembly.

The read right now from national security consultant Rebeccah Heinrichs. Rebeccah, he is being very, very cautious about all of this.

Remember, this is not a one-off attack. The Iranians have continued to attack either by proxies or them -- or doing it explicitly themselves for many, many months, and, in fact, going on during the Obama administration, and even through -- even after the Iran deal.  So this has continued. It slowed down a little bit when President Trump took office. I think that the Iranians were trying to figure out what kind of president President Trump was going to be. But there does seem to be an uptick again. And so at some point, they're going to continue to push until they meet -- until they meet steel. And so President Trump has to be careful. How do we demonstrate that there is steel with our allies, especially with Saudi Arabia taking the lead?",

And especially can we use the United States to help us target them and take those out? That would be something I think that would make a lot of sense to me, so that you're providing protection, obviously, of your own oil infrastructure, but of your own citizens.

And a range of opinions, but they all kind of coalesced on this, that Iran is suffering tremendously.  This is almost like the hand being stuck above water by a drowning person. Almost every -- I think every one but one of their pension funds is now bankrupt. There is high inflation rate -- inflation rates. There's civil unrest. And this is their attempt to provoke something which distracts their people from the miserable job their leadership has done.  Now, among that, we -- there is a range. I personally don't think we should be spending American treasure and blood in a war between Saudi and the Iranians. We should support the Saudis. We should recognize it's not the Iranian people, it's the Iranian leadership. Another person said, no American died. Until an American dies, we should not commit American forces. But if an American dies, watch out, Iran. And so there was this kind of this kind of range of thoughts.

So, when you send out words that you're not willing to back up, then it causes confusion. It says, what is your policy? What are you prepared to do? And if you are just prepared to make grand statements, and not back them up, then, frankly, we're not with you. So, if we're not with you, who is going to defend keeping the Gulf open?

      "sentences": "Well I think the president likes to reserve them for extra special people. I mean, these things, they're important diplomatic overtures. They all -- go all the way back to 1874, when president Ulysses S. Grant threw the very first state dinner for the king of Hawaii. Barack Obama and George W. Bush, by this time in their presidency, had had four state dinners. Bill Clinton tended to hand these things out like Happy Meals. He had 21 by this time, a total of 52 for his entire administration. But the only other one President Trump has had was during the height of the bromance with Emmanuel Macron. He wanted to show Emmanuel Macron how special the relationship was, brought him and his wife, Brigitte, over for a state visit and a state dinner. There's been some rocky road since then, but still the two leaders insist that their relationship is on a strong footing. This overture to Australia now is really to renew the relationship between the United States and Australia, because President Trump didn't exactly get along with the former prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, but he's like this, it appears, with Scott Morrison. And because Australia is such a huge player in the Indo-Pacific region, President Trump wants to make sure that the relationship is solid when it comes to national security and economic security. So that's why throwing the big lavish event today, and this is a really interesting event too. Other state dinners that I have attended -- I went to one in New Zealand under President Clinton. I went to another one in the State Dining Room for the king and queen of Spain. Sometimes, they're held at a tent out on the South Lawn, but this one is going to be held in the Rose Garden. And it will feature the largest collection as well of military musicians. And you know how much we love our military musicians. And while you're seeing some lovely table settings there, there you see some military musicians playing in the colonnade. But not only will they be playing in the colonnade. They will also be playing on the roof overlooking the Rose Garden. So that's something new as well. The first lady has been completely in charge of this one. I'm told that she has looked after every detail here, including the menu, sunchoke ravioli, Reggiano cream and shaved summer vegetables, main course of Dover sole with parsley crisps, zucchini squash blossoms, fennel mousseline, baby garlic rouille, and a dessert will consist of lady apple tart with Calvados ice cream. I didn't get invited to this one, Neil. I will have to figure out why.",

No evidence whatsoever of an active shooter, and there are no injuries. And contrary to some earlier reports, authorities are saying now no shot were fired. The suspect was described as having a very calm demeanor, almost stoic, as he was taken into custody by authorities. Apparently, that SUV he was driving drove a considerable distance into the mall, Neil, suggesting that this might not have been an accident, someone mistaking the brake for the other pedal of the car to increase its speed. But, at this time, no injuries, one suspect in custody, and the investigation continues -- Neil.",

It was based largely on suspicions the president might be rejecting the idea of an interim agreement, a temporary or initial agreement. And that was greeted with disappointment there. But there's a lot more to this than meets the eye here. The trade talks at least are still on. Everyone is offering some tantalizing alternatives here.

Police are saying that a car just drove into the mall, entering through a Sears. Witnesses were saying on the scene that it was driving aimlessly. There were gunshots heard as well. As Shepard was talking to a gentleman of a store in that mall, he was unaware of the vehicle, but did hear the gunshots. We do know that this has apparently ended and that the suspect or at least the driver that SUV is in custody. So much we don't know. And we're not going to get into the conjecture game here. But I did want to get a quick read on this from former NYPD Detective Pat Brosnan, who joins us on the phone. Very little to sort of put together at this point, Pat, but what do you make of what you heard?"

Aimlessly, as you pointed out, first of all, an SUV be driving through the mall. Second is, apparently, several ear witness accounts of gunshots or what the ear witnesses believed to be gunshots. And, third, you have police with their weapons drawn fanning out throughout the area. So if you if you align those -- those apparent facts together, it seems like a very, very serious situation."

So, it looks like, again, they did a great job. The guy is in custody. I have no idea what, if any casualties there are, if there are in fact any. But it certainly seemed like a very, very wild and dangerous scene from the known facts."

We are going to try to get as much as we can and more as we can on this as it becomes available. But this is the scene right now. This is a mall near Schaumburg, Illinois. And this just happened about now close to half-hour ago at the Woodfield Mall, a driver apparently making his way into the mall -- deliberately driving through a Sears and into the mall, randomly driving around here. Now, you heard from a store owner in that mall near that Sears where apparently this vehicle entered he did not know about the vehicle entering, but he did hear gunshots. So, putting this together at this stage is a little bit risky. We're going to monitor it for you. We're going to stay on top of it. We get more details, we will keep you posted. In the meantime, other big news to tell you about today of the international variety. And that concerns the administration getting tough right now on Iran. It's not only upped the ante when it comes to sanctions, but it's gone after Iran's Central Bank. That is unprecedented. Remember, that is the means by which Iran gets money in and sends money out. If you have all but stopped that flow, you have essentially stopped Iran. Rich Edson at the State Department what he is learning right now. Hey, Rich."

The secretary says the evidence points to Iran and only Iran. It also appears Iran's President Hassan Rouhani will be in the United States Monday, now that he has a visa. World leaders will gather next week in New York for the annual United Nations General Assembly. A senior administration official says that Iran requested about 120 visas for its delegation for next week's United Nations meetings, and that the State Department rejected about 40 of them, citing ties to the IRGC -- Neil."

And there's certainly no hint of military response or action to last week's attack on those facilities, those oil facilities in Saudi Arabia. The read right now from national security consultant Rebeccah Heinrichs. Rebeccah, he is being very, very cautious about all of this. This seems to be focused on upping the sanctions ante and here going after the country's central bank to watch the money that goes out and in, but, for now, that's it. Obviously, there are discussions continuing. But sort of handicap what you have heard thus far."

Remember, this is not a one-off attack. The Iranians have continued to attack either by proxies or them -- or doing it explicitly themselves for many, many months, and, in fact, going on during the Obama administration, and even through -- even after the Iran deal. So this has continued. It slowed down a little bit when President Trump took office. I think that the Iranians were trying to figure out what kind of president President Trump was going to be. But there does seem to be an uptick again. And so at some point, they're going to continue to push until they meet -- until they meet steel. And so President Trump has to be careful. How do we demonstrate that there is steel with our allies, especially with Saudi Arabia taking the lead?"

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Do you get any sense right now, Rebeccah, that this proportional response the president's promised -- some in the West have argued, be careful about making it a proportional oil response, because that would wallop the whole world, maybe not us so much, because we're churning out the oil and pretty resistant to whatever happens in OPEC, that it might be targeting drones or wherever the drones are centered or attack forces are utilized. What do you think of that?"

      "speaker": "HEINRICHS",
      "utterance": "I think that's right. I think if I were the Saudi government are advising the Saudi government, I would say, you better make sure that you -- that this doesn't happen twice. So you would want to be looking at, what were the weapons systems that were used to attack you? Do we know where they are? Can we locate them? And especially can we use the United States to help us target them and take those out? That would be something I think that would make a lot of sense to me, so that you're providing protection, obviously, of your own oil infrastructure, but of your own citizens. I mean, this is their country, their oil, so they have to demonstrate that they're able to provide defense of their own people. And so you can look at those particular targets as well."

      "utterance": "I was with the president yesterday in a meeting in which we were discussing the renewable fuel standard. At the end of the president, with about 10 senators present, went around and asked each what he thought we should do. And a range of opinions, but they all kind of coalesced on this, that Iran is suffering tremendously. This is almost like the hand being stuck above water by a drowning person. Almost every -- I think every one but one of their pension funds is now bankrupt. There is high inflation rate -- inflation rates. There's civil unrest. And this is their attempt to provoke something which distracts their people from the miserable job their leadership has done. Now, among that, we -- there is a range. I personally don't think we should be spending American treasure and blood in a war between Saudi and the Iranians. We should support the Saudis. We should recognize it's not the Iranian people, it's the Iranian leadership. Another person said, no American died. Until an American dies, we should not commit American forces. But if an American dies, watch out, Iran. And so there was this kind of this kind of range of thoughts. The president, though, by further ratcheting up the sanctions, further crippling their economy, brings to a point how their foolish leadership is hurting the Iranian people. Hopefully, that forces a change of tune."

But there's not a lot of interest back and forth on an inspector general and on the separate watchdog report about the genesis of the investigation into the president, the Mueller report, all of that. So is that really being fair and balanced? Democratic strategist Robert Patillo. We have got GOP strategist Alexandra Wilkes and The Wall Street Journal's Jillian Melchior.

Now, to do that obviously runs the risk that the Iranians would then declare all-out war in the region by attacking UAE, the Saudis, Bahrainis, and Kuwaitis. So there's a real risk involved. But that's all the reason why you don't send out a tweet that says, we're locked and loaded, we're ready to go, when, in fact, we're not ready to go. We don't have a coalition put together. We don't have an agreement by the Saudis, the UAE, or anyone else in the region. So when you send out a signal that you're ready to go, and then, whoa, wait a minute, we don't have everything in place just yet, then it sends a signal of weakness and fecklessness.

So, when you send out words that you're not willing to back up, then it causes confusion. It says, what is your policy? What are you prepared to do? And if you are just prepared to make grand statements, and not back them up, then, frankly, we're not with you. So, if we're not with you, who is going to defend keeping the Gulf open? Is it going to be the Chinese, the Russians, and not the United States? I think that would be -- that would bode not well for the United States.

      "speaker": "JOHN ROBERTS, CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Well I think the president likes to reserve them for extra special people. I mean, these things, they're important diplomatic overtures. They all -- go all the way back to 1874, when president Ulysses S. Grant threw the very first state dinner for the king of Hawaii. Barack Obama and George W. Bush, by this time in their presidency, had had four state dinners. Bill Clinton tended to hand these things out like Happy Meals. He had 21 by this time, a total of 52 for his entire administration. But the only other one President Trump has had was during the height of the bromance with Emmanuel Macron. He wanted to show Emmanuel Macron how special the relationship was, brought him and his wife, Brigitte, over for a state visit and a state dinner. There's been some rocky road since then, but still the two leaders insist that their relationship is on a strong footing. This overture to Australia now is really to renew the relationship between the United States and Australia, because President Trump didn't exactly get along with the former prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, but he's like this, it appears, with Scott Morrison. And because Australia is such a huge player in the Indo-Pacific region, President Trump wants to make sure that the relationship is solid when it comes to national security and economic security. So that's why throwing the big lavish event today, and this is a really interesting event too. Other state dinners that I have attended -- I went to one in New Zealand under President Clinton. I went to another one in the State Dining Room for the king and queen of Spain. Sometimes, they're held at a tent out on the South Lawn, but this one is going to be held in the Rose Garden. And it will feature the largest collection as well of military musicians. And you know how much we love our military musicians. And while you're seeing some lovely table settings there, there you see some military musicians playing in the colonnade. But not only will they be playing in the colonnade. They will also be playing on the roof overlooking the Rose Garden. So that's something new as well. The first lady has been completely in charge of this one. I'm told that she has looked after every detail here, including the menu, sunchoke ravioli, Reggiano cream and shaved summer vegetables, main course of Dover sole with parsley crisps, zucchini squash blossoms, fennel mousseline, baby garlic rouille, and a dessert will consist of lady apple tart with Calvados ice cream.

About an hour-and-a-half ago, though, a driver of a black Chevy Trailblazer drove through the doors of a Sears store into that mall. At this hour, we are told the suspect is in custody. No evidence whatsoever of an active shooter, and there are no injuries. And contrary to some earlier reports, authorities are saying now no shot were fired. The suspect was described as having a very calm demeanor, almost stoic, as he was taken into custody by authorities. Apparently, that SUV he was driving drove a considerable distance into the mall, Neil, suggesting that this might not have been an accident, someone mistaking the brake for the other pedal of the car to increase its speed. But, at this time, no injuries, one suspect in custody, and the investigation continues -- Neil."

I mentioned earlier we fell about 160 points today. A lot of that had to do with confusion that, all of a sudden, at the last second, the Chinese canceled a visit to a Montana farm facility, or at least a delegation of them did. It was based largely on suspicions the president might be rejecting the idea of an interim agreement, a temporary or initial agreement. And that was greeted with disappointment there. But there's a lot more to this than meets the eye here. The trade talks at least are still on. Everyone is offering some tantalizing alternatives here. So, we're going to be monitoring that 10:00 a.m. Eastern time tomorrow, and a lot more. Here comes \"The Five.\" Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
