The stock market has added more than $8 trillion in new wealth. Unemployment claims are at a 45-year low, which is something.  After years of stagnation the United States is once again experiencing strong economic growth. The stock market is smashing one record after another.  The stock market is up since my election almost 50 percent.",

      "sentences": "The president talks about the stock market a lot. He did not talk about it in a speech today. One of the reasons was what you are seeing on the screen. Today the stock market dropped almost 1,600 points before regaining and finishing at about almost 1,200 points down on the Dow. And there you see the rest of the markets. But as the president notes and the White House put out late this afternoon, since the election the Dow specifically has seen a major increase, and obviously today you see the top of the mountain fall off and many people say this won't be the last time in a volatile situation. Today was the single biggest one-day point drop ever but not the single biggest percentage drop in the markets.  So what about all of this? Let's bring in our panel: Guy Benson, political editor at Townhall.com; Mo Elleithee, executive director of the Georgetown Institute of Politics, and Kimberly Strassel, a member of the editorial board of Wall Street Journal. Kimberley, let me start with you. Your thoughts on this as you look at the big picture of the economy and what happens on a market day like this that obviously jars a lot of people who are in the markets.",

      "sentences": "I think the important thing to remember, Bret, is that the economy has not materially changed from Friday until Monday. So there isn't necessarily an economic reason behind this or for any reason to panic. More likely people have been talking that the market was potentially a little overvalued and due for a correction. Last week also we saw some rising bond yields. That makes people think inflation, that makes them think higher interest rates. That makes the stock market look a little less attractive. Some of this might also have been the machines taking over. At a certain point when the market drops enough, they have all these algorithms that kick in and that could have exacerbated it. But I think the important point is that the economy itself is still very strong, and it gets to the lack of wisdom of the president using the stock market as an indicator of that health.",

You put it out there is the single greatest indicator of your economic prowess, then when you take a hit, when the stock market takes a hit, you have to answer for that. And so I think he is facing that now too. Is it going to change the political dynamic heading into the midterm year at all, this single day drop? Probably not. I do think the economy is going to be the single biggest catalyst of what happens politically in the midterms moving forward over the course of the next year, but it's not going to be fought on this ground unless we continue to see many more days like this one.",

They are demeaning in many cases the crumbs that people are getting in the form of bonuses and enhanced benefits, 401(k) matches, expanded operations, and even what people are seeing in their paychecks, these pay bumps as a result of the tax cuts that Democrats themselves had argued hysterically in many cases would never materialize under a bill that was Armageddon and the end of the world. The proof is now in the pudding in the form of paychecks, and I think for Democrats to try to very quickly pivot from this is a terrible bill that will hurt working-class and middle-class people to the good news for working-class and middle-class people really isn't good enough news, it's just crumbs and they need to understand they shouldn't get too excited, that's a tough adjustment to make I think rhetorically.",

I agree with you, trivializing the benefits as crumbs probably wasn't the smartest way, but there's plenty of data out there in plenty of anecdotes. The president is fond of putting out all these anecdotes of bonuses people have received. But there's plenty of anecdotes of layoffs, corporations that took the tax windfall, closing down factories, laying workers off. Since the bill became law, 40,000 of love lost their jobs and $9 billion have been invested in corporate stock buybacks. And so for Democrats to be able to point out the growing disparity there, the consequence of people, these CEOs laying workers off in order to line their own pockets is a much I think more potent strategy for them to have this fight then trivializing the thousand-dollar bonuses that some workers are getting.",

And you look at the poll now as opposed to what it was in December of 2017 and the disapproval has been erased and it's essentially approve, disapprove. And that matches almost every poll.

And this is why the president has so much he could be talking about, not the stock market. Even though stock market -- people don't tend to feel that immediately anyway. Yes, they like to see their 401(k) going up, their 529s for their kids. But it's always something that's in the future or mostly in the future. What they care about is the day-to-day paycheck. And the fundamentals are so strong and getting stronger. And we are only a month into this, too, by the way, Bret. We are not even beginning to yet see some expansion that different companies have promised in investments that they are going to make.
