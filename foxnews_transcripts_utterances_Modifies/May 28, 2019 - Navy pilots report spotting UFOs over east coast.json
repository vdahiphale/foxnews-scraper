      "sentences": "Good evening and welcome to “Tucker Carlson Tonight.” A couple of hours ago, \"The Washington Post,\" our hometown newspaper here in the nation's capital published an op-ed by former FBI Director, Jim Comey. In the piece, Comey explains that whatever surveillance the Obama Justice Department conducted on the 2016 Trump campaign was entirely justified and within bounds, nothing weird about it at all. Yes, American citizens were monitored electronically without their knowledge, but it wasn't spying. Of course, it wasn't spying. It was investigating. It was done for your own good. And if you don't like it, you're unpatriotic and possibly mentally ill. That's Comey's position.  What the op-ed did not contain was any evidence at all that what he said is true. Comey is a bitter partisan with a long history of shading the truth, but he suggests you've got to trust him anyway. It's your duty to trust him.  Okay. Well, here's another idea. We could see for ourselves exactly what happened in 2016. We could declassify all the relevant information and then make it public. That way, we wouldn't have to take anyone's word for what happened. Comey's word, Trump's word, anyone else's word.  The President has suggested doing just that. The left is outraged by the idea. Watch.",

Trump giving Barr unilateral authority over classification is just a huge deal in the world of Intelligence agencies. Barr will be able to override other agencies' independent classification determinations. And the goal of all this here seems pretty clear. It's basically to give Sean Hannity material for his television show.  So the plan, as it appears now, is essentially a kind of purge of the ideologically suspect members of the Intelligence apparatus.",

Just another day of balanced news coverage on MSNBC. Keep in mind as you watch and rewatch that clip, that Chris Hayes is not a flak for the CIA. He's a member of the National Press Corps, but he isn't arguing for openness, just the opposite. Hayes is arguing, using his position as a public advocate to argue against giving the public more information.   These are not military secrets, by the way, or the names of U.S. agents working undercover overseas. The information in question is about how the FBI spied on Americans while investigating crimes that we now know did not occur. So what could possibly be the justification for keeping all of that secret? The details secret? Really, the only justification would be to protect the Intel agencies from embarrassment. That's what they fear. And that's exactly why the former director of the CIA, John Brennan, and so many others are anxious to preserve the veil of secrecy.",

It allowed him among other things, access to classified information, which he could then selectively leak to his colleagues at MSNBC.

      "sentences": "So shortly after that aired, the President announced that he was revoking John Brennan's security clearance. That was, as we said almost a year ago, it was July of 2018. What happened next?   Well, pretty much nothing. Apparently, as of tonight, John Brennan still has a security clearance amazingly enough as he works for MSNBC. According to \"The New York Times,\" the President's order was, quote, \"hampered by aides who slow rolled the President and by Justice Department officials who fought Mr. Trump on it.\" Keep in mind that Paul Ryan, then the Speaker of the House mocked the idea publicly when Trump said he was going to revoke Brennan's security clearance.  According to \"The New York Times,\" the same thing happened with documents that President wanted declassified. The bureaucracy fought back against the elected President and won.  This seems to be happening a lot recently. According to Bob Woodward's book on multiple occasions, Gary Cohn, the National Economic Council Director, prevented the President from pulling out of a trade deal simply by stealing the relevant order off his desk when he wasn't looking. The President ordered troops out of Syria last December, you remember that, but that order has not been laid down. It's been delayed and mitigated again, and again. Now, it looks like troops will stay in Syria indefinitely. In fact, we are now sending troops to the Middle East, in even larger numbers, directly contravening the President's campaign promises, and as we just showed you, the same might happen with the President's latest call for declassification.   John Brennan, among others is calling for the bureaucracy to ignore the order. Think about that, like so many on the left, Brennan is doing precisely when he accuses others of doing, \"You're undermining democracy,\" they screamed even as they work to do just that. How are they doing it?  Well, to recap civics at its most basic level, all authority and representative democracy flows from voters. The President and the Vice President are the only elected officials among the millions who work in the Executive Branch of government. If you subvert their policies ratified by voters, you are subverting democracy itself. Brennan obviously knows that. He doesn't care. But the rest of us should care.  Fox senior political analyst, Brit Hume joins us tonight. Brit, thanks a lot for coming on. So it seems to me that if you have a government where the elected leaders are ignored unilaterally by permanent employees and the bureaucracy, it doesn't matter what the political affiliations of anyone involved are, that's subverting democracy, isn't it?",

It's why throughout history, it's been a pillar of the liberal interpretation of national security really to want to apply maximum transparency to these institutions which have it as in their institutional interest to keep as much information as possible concealed. And yet, it's all totally flipped now because Trump apparently has some interest in putting out that information.

Well, with reasoning like that, it's no surprise that Jim Crow is making a fairly vigorous comeback in New York City's public schools. Under the rule of Chancellor Richard Carranza, the city has spent millions of dollars training administrators and teachers to fight something called implicit bias and achieve racial equity. We know where this is going. Administrators who underwent training were told that racial equity meant favoring or disfavoring students based purely on their skin code regardless of their economic or other background factors, and certainly regardless of their ability. In one case, administrators were told to give preference to middle class African-American students over and above poor white students, because color trumps all.  Well, others who work the school system say they were demoted because of their skin color. Deroy Murdock lives in New York City. He has been there a long time.

And by the way, I'm getting all this from Amazon, because I don't even think the book is out yet. But this is -- that the whole thesis right there is she discovered these records that men were executed and this sort of set off this chain of events where now we still shame people for being gay. So at this point in time, you know, people who have studied this period are like, \"What are you talking about? They executed people for being gay in England? In Victorian England?\" So they invite her on the show, it turns out that she misread legal documents from the time and she went back and she looked at them in this notation that she thought meant that they were killed -- did not -- it meant what that other gentleman said that it had been basically put aside and he didn't want to rule on it. So horribly embarrassing. She found this out on air. But it's the thesis for the whole book. So now the publisher is saying -- they're like, \"Look, you know, it's up to be author. We stand behind her, but she's the one that was supposed to be fact checking her work, but we basically think her thesis still holds up.\" It's terribly embarrassing. And actually, if you listen to the whole interview -- I have -- I mean, it's so embarrassing. I really feel for her, but here's the thing, you know, facts matter and checking your facts matter. And when anyone who has a huge following asks you to believe something, and to go down this whole train of thought, where suddenly, you know, you're condemning a whole group of people, or you're finding the origin of why we're all so flawed today, and we believe this certain thing, just make sure you see the facts with your own eyes. And it goes back to what you were saying about wanting records declassified -- trust your own eyes, and look for it yourself -- and in this case, you know, there were a lot of people that jumped on her bandwagon. And yes, she made a pretty simple mistake. But, you know, if she had consulted historians of the era or talked to other people, I think they would have said, \"Gosh, I've never heard of anyone being executed for this in this period. This is really groundbreaking.\" Either you found something that no one else knew about or you've made a mistake, and she could have done more, I guess, fact checking along the way. But I mean, others, this is like the other story I brought up with John Kerry, you know, and the State Department when they said the Syrian War was caused by this drought that didn't happen. They didn't check the rainfall, which was a very basic fact. But they made policy. And then they left office still believing this thing.

That's a 57 percent increase from 2012. Why? Because wait times were just too long. The average in California is now more than five hours and rising. Why is this? The illegal immigration is a major driver of it. It's making California poorer and much more crowded. People in charge can avoid the consequences, but normal people cannot, and that's why so many of them are fleeing the state of California. Instead of fixing things though, the left led by Joe Biden is now demanding free healthcare for illegal immigrants. Imagine what that will do to wait times in the emergency room. But they don't care.

In the piece, Comey explains that whatever surveillance the Obama Justice Department conducted on the 2016 Trump campaign was entirely justified and within bounds, nothing weird about it at all. Yes, American citizens were monitored electronically without their knowledge, but it wasn't spying. Of course, it wasn't spying. It was investigating. It was done for your own good. And if you don't like it, you're unpatriotic and possibly mentally ill. That's Comey's position. What the op-ed did not contain was any evidence at all that what he said is true. Comey is a bitter partisan with a long history of shading the truth, but he suggests you've got to trust him anyway. It's your duty to trust him. Okay. Well, here's another idea. We could see for ourselves exactly what happened in 2016. We could declassify all the relevant information and then make it public. That way, we wouldn't have to take anyone's word for what happened.

He's a member of the National Press Corps, but he isn't arguing for openness, just the opposite. Hayes is arguing, using his position as a public advocate to argue against giving the public more information. These are not military secrets, by the way, or the names of U.S. agents working undercover overseas. The information in question is about how the FBI spied on Americans while investigating crimes that we now know did not occur. So what could possibly be the justification for keeping all of that secret? The details secret? Really, the only justification would be to protect the Intel agencies from embarrassment.

It allowed him among other things, access to classified information, which he could then selectively leak to his colleagues at MSNBC.

      "utterance": "So shortly after that aired, the President announced that he was revoking John Brennan's security clearance. That was, as we said almost a year ago, it was July of 2018. What happened next? Well, pretty much nothing. Apparently, as of tonight, John Brennan still has a security clearance amazingly enough as he works for MSNBC. According to \"The New York Times,\" the President's order was, quote, \"hampered by aides who slow rolled the President and by Justice Department officials who fought Mr. Trump on it.\" Keep in mind that Paul Ryan, then the Speaker of the House mocked the idea publicly when Trump said he was going to revoke Brennan's security clearance. According to \"The New York Times,\" the same thing happened with documents that President wanted declassified. The bureaucracy fought back against the elected President and won. This seems to be happening a lot recently. According to Bob Woodward's book on multiple occasions, Gary Cohn, the National Economic Council Director, prevented the President from pulling out of a trade deal simply by stealing the relevant order off his desk when he wasn't looking. The President ordered troops out of Syria last December, you remember that, but that order has not been laid down. It's been delayed and mitigated again, and again. Now, it looks like troops will stay in Syria indefinitely. In fact, we are now sending troops to the Middle East, in even larger numbers, directly contravening the President's campaign promises, and as we just showed you, the same might happen with the President's latest call for declassification. John Brennan, among others is calling for the bureaucracy to ignore the order. Think about that, like so many on the left, Brennan is doing precisely when he accuses others of doing, \"You're undermining democracy,\" they screamed even as they work to do just that. How are they doing it? Well, to recap civics at its most basic level, all authority and representative democracy flows from voters. The President and the Vice President are the only elected officials among the millions who work in the Executive Branch of government. If you subvert their policies ratified by voters, you are subverting democracy itself. Brennan obviously knows that. He doesn't care. But the rest of us should care. Fox senior political analyst, Brit Hume joins us tonight. Brit, thanks a lot for coming on. So it seems to me that if you have a government where the elected leaders are ignored unilaterally by permanent employees and the bureaucracy, it doesn't matter what the political affiliations of anyone involved are, that's subverting democracy, isn't it?"

It will be one thing for Chris Hayes to have his colleague John Brennan on for an extended rant as to why it would somehow compromise national security for this classified material to be released. But Chris Hayes didn't even challenge any of his bombastic claims. He just let him spout unimpeded. And it's incredibly ironic that it's now being cast as some kind of authoritarian power grab for President Trump to delegate to Attorney General Barr the authority to declassify information that would shine a light on the conduct of the country's most secretive spy institutions in 2016. Supposedly, we're now to believe that it is authoritarian to release that information to the public, to let them view it. And it is somehow saving democracy, to have spy chiefs go on TV and declare that it would somehow jeopardize national security or put lives at risk to keep that information concealed. It's truly an inversion of the highest order, and, you know, more indication that we're in this weird bizarre world."

But, you know, all the incentives on somebody in the position of an MSNBC anchor is to elevate the most fanatical and alarmist interpretations of anything Trump does on a given day. So if there's an alternate explanation for why it might be a decent idea to release information in the public interest that would shed light on the activities of I don't know, the FBI, the CIA, the NSA, the institutions that not so long ago, we were told it was a progressive ideal to want to apply scrutiny, too. I mean, that's what people heralded the Edward Snowden revelations. It's why throughout history, it's been a pillar of the liberal interpretation of national security really to want to apply maximum transparency to these institutions which have it as in their institutional interest to keep as much information as possible concealed. And yet, it's all totally flipped now because Trump apparently has some interest in putting out that information. And the point that you mentioned about his subordinates, Trump's in the Executive Branch, not carrying out his will, is another weird paradox because we're constantly told that Trump is this ruthless, unbridled authoritarian, who can get anything that he wants done with the snap of a finger. And yet his direct employees in the Executive Branch are constantly simply ignoring his directives, and as you mentioned, in a way it's subverting the democratic will and they're doing so and yet nothing seems to happen."

He is a good person, because he's willing to judge people based on their sex and skin color. To prove it, instead of finding the best person for the job, Swalwell will make decisions based on superficial physical characteristics, the ones that matter that makes him deeply moral, unlike you who are immoral. Well, with reasoning like that, it's no surprise that Jim Crow is making a fairly vigorous comeback in New York City's public schools. Under the rule of Chancellor Richard Carranza, the city has spent millions of dollars training administrators and teachers to fight something called implicit bias and achieve racial equity. We know where this is going. Administrators who underwent training were told that racial equity meant favoring or disfavoring students based purely on their skin code regardless of their economic or other background factors, and certainly regardless of their ability. In one case, administrators were told to give preference to middle class African-American students over and above poor white students, because color trumps all. Well, others who work the school system say they were demoted because of their skin color. Deroy Murdock lives in New York City. He has been there a long time.

And yet my taxpayer dollars, $23 million for this program are being spent to root out the inner Jim Crow and inner Klansmen inside these people. It's really astonishing. And by the way, the price of a new teacher in New York City is about $57,000.00 per year.

And by the way, I'm getting all this from Amazon, because I don't even think the book is out yet. But this is -- that the whole thesis right there is she discovered these records that men were executed and this sort of set off this chain of events where now we still shame people for being gay. So at this point in time, you know, people who have studied this period are like, \"What are you talking about? They executed people for being gay in England? In Victorian England?\" So they invite her on the show, it turns out that she misread legal documents from the time and she went back and she looked at them in this notation that she thought meant that they were killed -- did not -- it meant what that other gentleman said that it had been basically put aside and he didn't want to rule on it. So horribly embarrassing. She found this out on air. But it's the thesis for the whole book. So now the publisher is saying -- they're like, \"Look, you know, it's up to be author. We stand behind her, but she's the one that was supposed to be fact checking her work, but we basically think her thesis still holds up.\" It's terribly embarrassing. And actually, if you listen to the whole interview -- I have -- I mean, it's so embarrassing. I really feel for her, but here's the thing, you know, facts matter and checking your facts matter. And when anyone who has a huge following asks you to believe something, and to go down this whole train of thought, where suddenly, you know, you're condemning a whole group of people, or you're finding the origin of why we're all so flawed today, and we believe this certain thing, just make sure you see the facts with your own eyes. And it goes back to what you were saying about wanting records declassified -- trust your own eyes, and look for it yourself -- and in this case, you know, there were a lot of people that jumped on her bandwagon. And yes, she made a pretty simple mistake. But, you know, if she had consulted historians of the era or talked to other people, I think they would have said, \"Gosh, I've never heard of anyone being executed for this in this period. This is really groundbreaking.\" Either you found something that no one else knew about or you've made a mistake, and she could have done more, I guess, fact checking along the way. But I mean, others, this is like the other story I brought up with John Kerry, you know, and the State Department when they said the Syrian War was caused by this drought that didn't happen. They didn't check the rainfall, which was a very basic fact. But they made policy. And then they left office still believing this thing. Now the State Department has gone back since John Kerry left and corrected the record. But when you're sold the bill of goods, you make sure you see the facts for yourself and don't just trust some person who is famous."

      "utterance": "Yes, we voted in a referendum to leave the European Union, the greatest democratic exercise, the most voters ever in the history of our nation. We then, the next year, in a general election, voted for Labour and Conservative Parties, our traditional parties, both of whom promised they would honor the result of the referendum. And the date was set. It was put into British law. We were leaving on March 29, 2019. And guess what happened? We didn't leave. And they kicked the can down the road to the end of October, the 31st of October, Halloween. And I watched all of this as being one of the architects of the original Brexit referendum and vote. And I thought, \"I can't stand aside. I can't bear the fact we're having to send members of the European Parliament back to Brussels.\" So I founded the Brexit Party, and would you believe within six weeks of a brand new party being set up, we took the polls, we smashed the Conservative Party, we smashed the Labour Party. And regrettably, I'm back here in Brussels, Tucker, after 20 years, once again, as a Member of the European Parliament."

      "utterance": "Now, I know it's complicated, but explain if you can, how it is a liberal or progressive position to remain in the German Empire, which is basically what the E.U. is. Why is that considered liberal?"

      "speaker": "FARAGE",
      "utterance": "Because they claim that as a European Union, they will deal with climate change. They claim that because they have open borders, this is the modern, liberal approach to the future. What they don't tell you is they are literally killing and destroying something -- something so important that just next week, we're going to celebrate the 75th anniversary of D Day when America and Canada and others came to our aid, helped us liberate, you know, Europe from Nazi-ism to bring back something called democracy and what the European Union does, it crushes democracy. It takes decision making powers away from ordinary people and gives it to unelected bureaucrats."

There's a quote -- a remarkable quote just the other day, which I doubt you saw and I'm quoting now, \"These stupid nationalists,\" he said, \"They are in love with their own countries.\" It doesn't sound like people like this have learned anything from these votes?"

      "utterance": "No, this is Mr. Juncker, who is President of the European Commission. That's his quote. But you know, the people I blame aren't necessarily the Brussels bureaucrats, the people I blame are British politicians in Westminster, who have not had the courage to take back the independence, sovereignty, democracy of our country. Last week, I've given them the biggest seismic shock that has been seen in modern British politics. And I'll make you this one promise. If we do not leave the European Union on October 31st, I will lead the Brexit Party after that into the next general election, and we will sweep away parties that have dominated British politics for over a hundred years."

We will show you how desperate the situation has become in the state of California after the break. Plus, the Navy just made a shocking admission on UFO's. We will share it with you, just ahead."

    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "If you ever needed emergency medical care only to find the emergency room crammed with people, you know what a nightmare that is. Obamacare was supposed to fix that problem. But things have only gotten worse. As with other major issues, California is leading the way. In 2017 more than 350,000 Californians had to leave the emergency room early against a doctor's advice. That's a 57 percent increase from 2012. Why? Because wait times were just too long. The average in California is now more than five hours and rising. Why is this? The illegal immigration is a major driver of it. It's making California poorer and much more crowded. People in charge can avoid the consequences, but normal people cannot, and that's why so many of them are fleeing the state of California. Instead of fixing things though, the left led by Joe Biden is now demanding free healthcare for illegal immigrants. Imagine what that will do to wait times in the emergency room. But they don't care. The Democratic Party has chosen its constituency and it's not the middle class. Not so long ago, anyone who uses the term \"UFO\" was considered a crank or a conspiracy nut. But now a growing number of military pilots and serious professionals are discussing their own encounters with strange objects in the sky. Those experiences are unpacked at some length in an upcoming History Channel A&E Special called \"Unidentified.\""

      "utterance": "There are a lot of people like that. According to a recent \"New York Times\" piece, in 2014, and parts of 2015, UFO shows were being spotted almost daily by the U.S. military along the East Coast. Dr. Michael Wall is a senior writer at Space.com and author of \"Out There.\" He joins us tonight. Dr. Wall, thanks very much for coming on. Almost daily, it's hard to process that information. Were you surprised to learn that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MICHAEL WALL, SENIOR WRITER, SPACE.COM",
      "utterance": "Yes. I mean, I'm a little surprised that it's sort of coming out now. But yes, I mean, I think it kind of speaks to a broader phenomenon that that this is not as sort of like a fringe pursuit as it used to be. People aren't as embarrassed as it used to be to kind of entertain the actual possibility that we're not alone. And I mean, I think that's probably a positive development."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Well, it kind of came out of nowhere. We, two years ago started doing shows on this subjects, because I thought, I don't know, it sounded like maybe it's real. People dismissed it as crazy just two years ago. But if this has been sightings almost every day, why are we just finding out about it now?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALL",
      "utterance": "Well, yes, I mean, there's sort of this groundswell, kind of kind of like you're talking about me, and part of that is in the scientific community. This is not viewed as so fringe anymore. I mean, we have learned recently over the past decade that there are probably about 50 billion habitable planets just in our galaxy alone. And we have found other worlds in our solar system that actually might be habitable. So yes, it's just sort of creeping across the entire public consciousness that this is not like a crazy thing to actually think about."

      "speaker": "CARLSON",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALL",
      "utterance": "No, I mean, I'm not concerned. I'm not a conspiracy theorist. I would say I'm kind of skeptical. But I don't dismiss these just out of hand. That's not very scientific. I mean, I would think if there are alien space crafts, I would wonder why they kind of got here on their own without being detected, like across vast scopes of space, but then zipped around for a little while, and then zoomed off. I mean, it just kind of would, would be weird to kind of think about what are they doing? Why did they allow themselves to be detected? What's the point? I mean, all of those things kind of factor in, but then you're getting into like ET psychology. And that's a very dangerous thing to kind of wade into, because we have no idea what we're even talking about."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Yes, no, we don't. But that kind of is the point. We don't know. And we can say that conclusively. There's an extensive phenomena we don't understand. Correct?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALL",
      "utterance": "Yes, yes. And I mean, I think it's really important to actually keep an open mind and say, I mean, it's probably instrumentation. Maybe it's like a software issue. And maybe people don't fully know what they're looking at on these infrared images of these weird objects from these fighter jet cameras. But that does not mean that we should just totally say that there is no way that it could be something we don't understand."
