Lori Lightfoot is one of the most repugnant and disgraceful people in elected office today. That a woman was such disregard for her own constituents serving as mayor of Chicago, one of our great American cities is itself shocking. As an unrepentant radical, her policies precipitated Chicago's decline and decay. The city's bleeding people, literally and figuratively. People are up and leaving and their record numbers of its residents are becoming victims of crime. As much as Chicagoans love the summer on the lake and who doesn't love the bears, the cubs, the restaurants, the architecture, they're not going to stay if their home becomes unlivable. Chicago under Lightfoot is slowly turning into Detroit. But you'd never know the situation is urgent, if you're listening to her.",

So thugs and gangs are running and gunning across Chicago, because they know that Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx and Lightfoot together, they're never going to take them on. Not really. Chances today are pretty slim, that criminals are going to be caught for maiming and even killing, and certainly for stealing. They'll probably do that without repercussions or penalty. If they're arrested, oftentimes they're put out in the streets the next day. But Lightfoot hopes people are stupid enough to believe that if Roe is overturned, what, federal authority is going to be busting through your bedroom door?

Police officers in the Windy City have told me that the revolving door of justice often makes arresting suspects essentially a fruitless exercise. And at a time when police morale has dropped so low, Lori Lightfoot decided to get into a fight with police over a pointless vaccine mandate. It's insane. Of course, she also sided with teachers unions and kept kids locked out of their schools for over a year during COVID. The damage that was inflicted through that decision alone was immeasurable. Again, the rich kids, they could figure out kind of doing tutors and a workaround, not the underprivileged, who needed in-person schooling the most. In the end, (ph) we should take on the teachers unions, force them to go back to school. Lightfoot wasn't going to do that. Think about this. This is all Lightfoot and her corrupt party. Republicans do not have the numbers to block her with things as they are. Look, how many of you would want your kids to work, or live alone in Chicago today? Would you? I love Chicago. It kills me to say this, or ask the question. Democrats there have had every chance to try to succeed. Their hero Barack Obama still calls it home. But where are his sustained efforts to influence the place for the better? The South side's a long way from Martha's Vineyard. It's what? It's faith, family, law and order, hard work, respect for small business. I mean, that's kind of it. It's not a secret. Chicago has a very sophisticated and highly educated workforce. It has a strong investment and banking sector. Sports franchises, come on, they're worth billions.

You talk about her focusing on the agenda issues of the left. She's been gaslighting people for two years. And what we've seen as of late is that now she's turning to the national issue of a possible decision about abortion rights, which is in no way, shape, or form under attack in the state of Illinois. It is the law in Illinois. It is legal in Chicago. But she wants to deflect to what's going on at the federal level in the hopes that, as you said, everyone will ignore her failures locally. Just today, three hours ago, we had a double mass shooting in the back of the arts community, where a group of individuals were shot at by - five people were shot at by gangbangers, and then the retaliation of six other people half a mile away and sued 30 minutes later. Not a peep out of the mayor.

That a woman was such disregard for her own constituents serving as mayor of Chicago, one of our great American cities is itself shocking. As an unrepentant radical, her policies precipitated Chicago's decline and decay. The city's bleeding people, literally and figuratively. People are up and leaving and their record numbers of its residents are becoming victims of crime. As much as Chicagoans love the summer on the lake and who doesn't love the bears, the cubs, the restaurants, the architecture, they're not going to stay if their home becomes unlivable.

Over Mother's Day weekend alone, at least 18 people were shot, 4 were killed, including the heinous attack on a 23-year-old culinary student Dakotah Earley Friday night.

So thugs and gangs are running and gunning across Chicago, because they know that Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx and Lightfoot together, they're never going to take them on. Not really. Chances today are pretty slim, that criminals are going to be caught for maiming and even killing, and certainly for stealing. They'll probably do that without repercussions or penalty. If they're arrested, oftentimes they're put out in the streets the next day. But Lightfoot hopes people are stupid enough to believe that if Roe is overturned, what, federal authority is going to be busting through your bedroom door? Not that we're supposed to be worried that a man is writhing on the ground under your apartment window in Lincoln Park gasping for life, left for dead."

Police officers in the Windy City have told me that the revolving door of justice often makes arresting suspects essentially a fruitless exercise. And at a time when police morale has dropped so low, Lori Lightfoot decided to get into a fight with police over a pointless vaccine mandate. It's insane. Of course, she also sided with teachers unions and kept kids locked out of their schools for over a year during COVID. The damage that was inflicted through that decision alone was immeasurable. Again, the rich kids, they could figure out kind of doing tutors and a workaround, not the underprivileged, who needed in-person schooling the most. In the end, (ph) we should take on the teachers unions, force them to go back to school. Lightfoot wasn't going to do that. Think about this. This is all Lightfoot and her corrupt party. Republicans do not have the numbers to block her with things as they are. Look, how many of you would want your kids to work, or live alone in Chicago today? Would you? I love Chicago. It kills me to say this, or ask the question. Democrats there have had every chance to try to succeed. Their hero Barack Obama still calls it home. But where are his sustained efforts to influence the place for the better? The South side's a long way from Martha's Vineyard. It's what? It's faith, family, law and order, hard work, respect for small business. I mean, that's kind of it. It's not a secret. Chicago has a very sophisticated and highly educated workforce. It has a strong investment and banking sector. Sports franchises, come on, they're worth billions.

You talk about her focusing on the agenda issues of the left. She's been gaslighting people for two years. And what we've seen as of late is that now she's turning to the national issue of a possible decision about abortion rights, which is in no way, shape, or form under attack in the state of Illinois. It is the law in Illinois. It is legal in Chicago. But she wants to deflect to what's going on at the federal level in the hopes that, as you said, everyone will ignore her failures locally. Just today, three hours ago, we had a double mass shooting in the back of the arts community, where a group of individuals were shot at by - five people were shot at by gangbangers, and then the retaliation of six other people half a mile away and sued 30 minutes later. Not a peep out of the mayor. Nothing from our police department because their hands are tied, trying to address this, while she's too busy gaslighting everyone else to deflect from the fear - the real fear that people have.

It was so embarrassing to have the Secretary of Treasury, who's presiding over this economic decline of the Biden-Harris administration, to actually read from pre-written notes perhaps supplied by Planned Parenthood. They give one pregnancy referral for every, about 81 abortions, they perform everybody. You pay about a half a billion dollars in taxpayer dollars a year to Planned Parenthood. And she's talking about the economy being more important than about 885,000 babies aborted a year. And then she goes in and channels her inner Margaret Sanger, the eugenicist, who started Planned Parenthood who said, Don't tell anybody but we'd like to extinguish certain race in this population. She goes and tells Tim Scott, a black Republican senator, who's just asked her to clarify her very racist remarks, and doubles down on them by saying, Look, a lot of these people who need access to abortion so they can participate, not be in labor, but be in the labor force, they're young, they're teenagers, they're black. What kind of life for their child have? My goodness, that is racist. And this is somebody, who as Secretary of the Treasury, should be worried about inflation. She should be doing what Steve Mnuchin did at this point in our administration, having presided over Tax Cut and Jobs Act, deregulation, a sound economy. It goes on and on. But this is what's defining the left now. They think they've got a new issue headed into the midterms, even the Vice President has something new to do. But it's not going to work."

They don't want you to know that roughly 400,000 black babies have been aborted per year, roughly about 18 or 19 million since Roe v Wade. And there's a great op ed on foxnews.com right now by T.W. Shannon. He's half black have check us all. And he says, Don't tell me black lives matter until black babies lives matter and goes through all the statistics for folks. So, I think that Janet Yellen's testimony today is the sort of Nantucket quieter version of what's going on in front of the justices' houses, where people are protesting, violating federal U.S. Code by doing so. Threatening, intimidating, not trying to change, not protesting an opinion that's been issued by the court, Laura, but trying to change an opinion, trying to intimidate in sight."

Kathy Barnette joins us now. Kathy, it's good to see you. You were on with us last week, a week-and-a-half ago or so, to talk about your mom and your own story of life.

To your question, Laura is we have simply ran a much better race than my opponent. And we ran a much better race because we have always kept the main thing the main thing, and that is the people of Pennsylvania. Instead of doing slick commercial ads and having posters tell me whether I use a fork or a spoon and what buzzwords I should say, we simply walked out of our front door, and I earnestly believe that if the people of Pennsylvania knew they had a better option, they would take it. And the polls are showing just that. They now know, contrary to many in the media who have just made this about two particular people, they now know that they have a better option.

I have always been here. I was here before Oz decided to leave New Jersey and come and run as a Pennsylvanian. I was here when McCormick was still living in Connecticut and decided to move here this year. I have always been here. So they could have done their due diligence. Now they are just late to the party, and they are upset. But again, the people of Pennsylvania, they are looking for someone who actually lives here in Pennsylvania and who shares their values.

And the real point is that we don't have time to wait for Mehmet to figure out who he is. Our nation is in trouble. And the people here in Pennsylvania, we see it. Now we're talking about not having enough baby formula for our children. We are looking at gas prices. We are looking, Biden inherited an inflation of 1.7 percent.

I understand how bad the situation is for the Ukrainian people, what they're going through and why some of my colleagues may have went that way. But I also understand what is happening here in this country with record levels of crime, a border that is wide open, an attorney general who treat the very moms and dads you were talking to as if they were domestic terrorists. And what have the Democrats done in the last two weeks? Last week they give us the disinformation governance board and come after our First Amendment liberties, and this week spend $40 billion on a foreign country. So that's the concern that I have, and I think so many Americans have. I voted for all so any kinds of help for Ukraine thus far, but this bill, we said no, look, we've got to focus on the issues that count here in America, that matter to American families, and also help Ukraine, but do it in a way that makes more sense than I think this piece of legislation did, particularly the fact that we only had a few hours to look at it, for goodness sake is another reason we should have been against it."

And at the same time we are taking the tariffs off of the Chinese goods coming into the country, which means we are helping the country that is giving money to Russia, by dumping the tariffs, Trump's tariffs. So figure out how that makes any sense."
