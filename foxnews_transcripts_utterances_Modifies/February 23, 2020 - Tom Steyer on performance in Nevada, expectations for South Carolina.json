      "sentences": "While the other Democratic candidates have spread themselves thin in the early contest, billionaire Tom Steyer has invested heavily in South Carolina. And he's running strong in the key primary there next Saturday. After the results came in from Nevada last night, I spoke with Steyer about his plans for the Palmetto state. Mr. Steyer, you spent more time in Nevada than any other candidate. You spent more money in Nevada than all the other candidates combined. You said you had to finish first or second. But as we sit here right now, you're running a distant fifth. You have made a -- an equally big commitment in South Carolina and there it does seem to be paying off for you. Let me put up the numbers there. According to the RealClearPolitics average of recent polls, you were in third place, behind Biden and Sanders, but ahead of Buttigieg and Warren. How do you explain that and don't you have to finish in the top three in South Carolina?  TOM STEYER (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I think I do for sure. But, Chris, I think I have done best with black people. I have done best with Latinos. I think that when we get to the diverse Democratic electorate, when we get to the diversity that is America and the Democratic Party, I do a lot better. So South Carolina happens to be a place that has a pretty high concentration of African-Americans. And that -- those happen to be people that I talk to a lot and have a lot of -- have a long history of working with and, therefore, those -- that's a population where I do really well. And so I think that that explains a lot of what's going on in South Carolina, and really what's going on in Nevada as well.  WALLACE: Now, one thing that you've done in South Carolina is you have put members of the Black Legislative Caucus on your payroll. You've put members of the Democratic Black Caucus on your payroll. And the former head of the Charleston County Democratic Party says, in effect, you're paying some people off to support you.  STEYER: Look, people are doing work as organizers on our campaign and we're paying them. The NAACP came out and described what people are criticize us as making racist remarks, Chris. Actually what we're doing -- I'm a grassroots organizer from way back. I started one of the biggest grassroots organizations in the United States, NextGen America. And what we've found is, if you want to organize in a community, you have to work with people from the community. And that's exactly what we're doing in South Carolina.  WALLACE: So how do you explain the fact that you're doing better? And you say that you have a particular connection with African-Americans. How come?  STEYER: Well, I think one thing is, I'm very willing to talk about race, Chris. You know, I believe that there is a substantial racial subtext in virtually every policy area in the United States. And the example I usually use is climate, where I'm a long-term climate hawk, but I've always started from the standpoint of environmental justice. I've always started in the communities where it's unsafe to breathe, because you'll get asthma and unsafe to drink the tap water because you'll get sick. And those tend to be overwhelmingly black and brown communities.  I'm the only person running for president who is openly, consistently for reparations for slavery. I'm someone who believes in talking about the underlying issues and trying to come up with answers to them so that we can resolve them together and move forward.  WALLACE: OK, let's unpack some of that.",

The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office says your plan would -- would certainly lift earnings for millions of people, but it would also cost millions of people their job.  STEYER: Well, let me say this, if we go back to 1980, Chris, and look at the minimum wage and just inflation adjust it, so there's no increase, it's just the same wage in 2020 dollars, OK, then the minimum wage would not be $7.25. It would be $11. That was -- that's no raise in the minimum wage in terms of buying power, just the same minimum wage.  If you then looked at the increased productivity of American workers between 1980 and now, and split it, the way it's traditionally been split, between employers and working people in America, that would get you to the $22.

Why did you do that?  STEYER: Chris, I did exactly what I'm asking Americans to do. You grew up in a fossil fuel economy. So did I. At some point, long -- before 2012, I assure you, I came to the conclusion that there was a huge, unintended side effect of fossil fuel and the government wasn't dealing with it.

But there's not intelligence that suggests that they're trying to help Trump. When this administration has sanctioned Russia, more than any administration since Ronald Reagan, and it seems that the Democrats are going to nominate somebody in Bernie Sanders who honeymooned in the Soviet Union and still seems to prefer Marxism over capitalism, it's hard to see why they'd be accusing Donald Trump over Bernie Sanders.

Well, Josh, I'm a little confused here, because basically what you heard Marc Short say is it didn't happen, there's no intelligence, but then he said -- well, in fact, I don't know what happened in the House committee, which is where the leak apparently came.

I'm not sure that the timeline there -- maybe it got moved up. I don't think this is a single incidence for why he was fired. But look, in terms of the president's reaction, we have spent the last three years making unfounded allegations about Russian collusion about his campaign in 2016, about his efforts ever since. We endured a Mueller report, we've endured countless hearings. I don't think we should be the least bit surprised and the president has a lot of anxiety about a classified briefing coming out once again in the same fashion that we've seen over three years to allege that somehow Russia has chosen him as their favorite candidate and sure enough, and a day later we find out Russia is also concluded that Bernie Sanders is a favorite candidate. Remember Tulsi Gabbard was a favorite candidate. I think this is an example of incredibly dangerous and reckless reporting.

I will say, though, on the bigger issue of the Barr-Trump relationship bubbling up this week, I think the people that have been criticizing Bill Barr as a Trump loyalist, some kind of a MAGA guy are wrong and are really missing the point here. The point is that Bill Barr had his own agenda, his own motives independently of President Trump literally for decades. I remember reading stuff that Barr wrote as an undergraduate in college in support of executive power and Barr saw with President Trump this opportunity to push his agenda of expanded presidential power forward. I think the second he's not able to do that or he sees he is not going to be able to do that, he's going to jump ship."

I think even as the possibility as this idea of the resignation was put out there as cover because of the damage that President Trump and Bill Barr have done not only to the Department of Justice, but done to the department -- down to the justice system in this country in terms of its great ability with federal prosecutors, federal judges this week, thinking of having an emergency meeting about this.

      "utterance": "While the other Democratic candidates have spread themselves thin in the early contest, billionaire Tom Steyer has invested heavily in South Carolina. And he's running strong in the key primary there next Saturday. After the results came in from Nevada last night, I spoke with Steyer about his plans for the Palmetto state. Mr. Steyer, you spent more time in Nevada than any other candidate. You spent more money in Nevada than all the other candidates combined. You said you had to finish first or second. But as we sit here right now, you're running a distant fifth. You have made a -- an equally big commitment in South Carolina and there it does seem to be paying off for you. Let me put up the numbers there. According to the RealClearPolitics average of recent polls, you were in third place, behind Biden and Sanders, but ahead of Buttigieg and Warren. How do you explain that and don't you have to finish in the top three in South Carolina?  TOM STEYER (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I think I do for sure. But, Chris, I think I have done best with black people. I have done best with Latinos. I think that when we get to the diverse Democratic electorate, when we get to the diversity that is America and the Democratic Party, I do a lot better."

And that -- those happen to be people that I talk to a lot and have a lot of -- have a long history of working with and, therefore, those -- that's a population where I do really well. And so I think that that explains a lot of what's going on in South Carolina, and really what's going on in Nevada as well.  WALLACE",
      "utterance": "Now, one thing that you've done in South Carolina is you have put members of the Black Legislative Caucus on your payroll. You've put members of the Democratic Black Caucus on your payroll. And the former head of the Charleston County Democratic Party says, in effect, you're paying some people off to support you.  STEYER: Look, people are doing work as organizers on our campaign and we're paying them. The NAACP came out and described what people are criticize us as making racist remarks, Chris. Actually what we're doing -- I'm a grassroots organizer from way back. I started one of the biggest grassroots organizations in the United States, NextGen America. And what we've found is, if you want to organize in a community, you have to work with people from the community. And that's exactly what we're doing in South Carolina.  WALLACE: So how do you explain the fact that you're doing better? And you say that you have a particular connection with African-Americans. How come?  STEYER: Well, I think one thing is, I'm very willing to talk about race, Chris. You know, I believe that there is a substantial racial subtext in virtually every policy area in the United States. And the example I usually use is climate, where I'm a long-term climate hawk, but I've always started from the standpoint of environmental justice. I've always started in the communities where it's unsafe to breathe, because you'll get asthma and unsafe to drink the tap water because you'll get sick. And those tend to be overwhelmingly black and brown communities.  I'm the only person running for president who is openly, consistently for reparations for slavery. I'm someone who believes in talking about the underlying issues and trying to come up with answers to them so that we can resolve them together and move forward.  WALLACE: OK, let's unpack some of that."

In fact, I think what I'm talking about --  WALLACE: No, but didn't it -- could it have stopped in 1900 or 1950 or 2000?  STEYER: No."

I think there's an implication in what you're saying that, in fact, you know, we're never going to deal with this, this is something in the past, and so we should just draw a line on today and move forward.

I guess I'm making the argument -- or -- or raising the question, is probably the better way to put it, that, you know, there -- at a certain point -- I remember when Sandra Day O'Connor was talking about Affirmative Action, she said, at some point we have to believe that -- that whatever reparations -- she didn't use that word, have been made, you know, that Affirmative Action should end. And if you're talking about 400 years of slavery, and now you're saying 400 years of reparations, an awful lot of people, I think, would have trouble agreeing with that."

And the example that you used of Sandra Day O'Connor, she said, at some point we should be able to move on. It -- but what she's saying implicitly is, at some point, but she's not saying let's -- let's go through and figure out what happened and figure out what to do. She's saying, at some point it just has to disappear into the past. I think that's unrealistic.  WALLACE: OK.  STEYER: I think that, in fact, talking about race in terms of environmental justice is entirely appropriate because something happened that led us to here."

Bernie Sanders wants to raise it to $15. But you're calling for $22 an hour. The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office says your plan would -- would certainly lift earnings for millions of people, but it would also cost millions of people their job.  STEYER: Well, let me say this, if we go back to 1980, Chris, and look at the minimum wage and just inflation adjust it, so there's no increase, it's just the same wage in 2020 dollars, OK, then the minimum wage would not be $7.25. It would be $11. That was -- that's no raise in the minimum wage in terms of buying power, just the same minimum wage.  If you then looked at the increased productivity of American workers between 1980 and now, and split it, the way it's traditionally been split, between employers and working people in America, that would get you to the $22. I'm not saying let's go to $22. I'm saying that's the fair number. That that's the number that actually you derive just by looking and seeing what American workers deserve from 1980."

You're a major proponent of climate change. But before you left your hedge fund, in 2012, you invested heavily in coal mines and coal fire power plants.  And I guess the question is, the -- they are now -- now you've left the company, but they are going to emit tons of pollution, millions of tons of pollution for years to come. Why did you do that?  STEYER: Chris, I did exactly what I'm asking Americans to do. You grew up in a fossil fuel economy. So did I. At some point, long -- before 2012, I assure you, I came to the conclusion that there was a huge, unintended side effect of fossil fuel and the government wasn't dealing with it. And I started to work on it. Over a decade ago, I divested personally from all this stuff."

And what I'm asking the government to do and what I'm asking American citizens to do, is to make the same transition that I made over 10 years ago, which is to say, gosh, no one got on a school bus or drove to work or turned on a light in order to cause climate change, but it's doing it. So we need to move to clean energy right now. It's a crisis. And I've been working on this for over a decade very successfully.  WALLACE: Mr. Steyer, I look forward to continuing --  STEYER: Mr. Wallace --  WALLACE: I look forward -- you can call me Chris -- to continuing the conversation with you.  STEYER: You can call me Tom.  WALLACE: And safe travels on the campaign trail, sir.  STEYER: Thank you, sir.  WALLACE: Up next, we'll bring back our Sunday group to discuss the state of play in the Democratic race now that Bernie Sanders has put together a string of victories.

But as a centrist Democrat, you're right, I think the Democrats won't win unless the ticket reflects the center and the passionate left. And how to get to that between now and July, which is the Democratic Convention, is a little tricky. It's very crowded in the middle and there are two people on the left.

But I think it's getting late early, to paraphrase Yogi Berra. I think these are not insignificant primaries and caucuses that we just went the. Any candidate who is winning Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, storming in with an incredible amount of momentum into South Carolina, in a state that Joe Biden, who was the prohibitive frontrunner for most of the year, has to win and probably has to win convincingly just to stay in the race. I think they've got a big problem. I -- no question that the establishment Democrats at this point are concerned about a Sanders coalition because the House majority, and many of the sort of hopefuls that are trying to get to a Senate majority, build what -- what they're trying to do politically around the suburbs in this -- in this country. It is very difficult to make the argument to suburban America, amidst a booming economy, that what you ought to do, for these people who, actually, the economy has been working for, is restructure your economy and make sure that we've got a more socialist view of America. That's a tough, tough argument. The one hedge I have four Republicans on all this is, let's not assume that this is not going to be an incredibly formidable coalition from Bernie Sanders. He is an authentic movement candidate. What that means is his people are coming out no matter what."

Now, let me just say, he's positioning himself in the middle to be the centrist alternative to Sanders if Biden fades, if Biden doesn't do well. Biden, by the way, is still doing pretty good.
