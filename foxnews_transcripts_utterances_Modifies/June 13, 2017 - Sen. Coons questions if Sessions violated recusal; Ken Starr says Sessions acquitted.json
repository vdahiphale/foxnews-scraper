He was quite defiant, defending his name, fiercely denying claims that he colluded at any time with Russians during the 2016 elections and making clear to allies and critics alike that he wanted this to be a public hearing.

The question that I have had all along was one that I raised this morning in front of the Oversight Committee, the Appropriations Subcommittee that is responsible for the Justice Department budgets were he didn't appear but instead send his deputy. And that was whether or not Attorney General Sessions violated his recusal.  Early on in his service as Attorney General, he notified Congress that he would not be involved in any matter arising either from the investigation of the Hillary Clinton's e-mails or this ongoing matter about potential Russian involvement in our 2016 election or collusion with the Trump campaign to that end. And it seems to me that the memo that was sent by Rod Rosenstein, the Deputy Attorney General, to Attorney General Sessions explaining why he thought FBI Director Comey should be fired, directly addressed one of those two matters. So, I asked Rod Rosenstein: why doesn't this violate the scope of his recusal?",

We have people standing in line filling out ballots and temporary ballots. We have people demanding to be allowed to vote who were on the rules. I mean, it could be very problematic.

But I think General Sessions was right constitutionally. When he was claiming executive privilege over was in fact well within the scope of past administrations. And so, it sounded a lot like a giant Claude Raines conference. Everyone was saying we're shocked that you would do this, it happens a great deal, often in hearings a question will come where a high-ranking official will say I don't feel comfortable with answering that.

The question that I have had all along was one that I raised this morning in front of the Oversight Committee, the Appropriations Subcommittee that is responsible for the Justice Department budgets were he didn't appear but instead send his deputy. And that was whether or not Attorney General Sessions violated his recusal. Early on in his service as Attorney General, he notified Congress that he would not be involved in any matter arising either from the investigation of the Hillary Clinton's e-mails or this ongoing matter about potential Russian involvement in our 2016 election or collusion with the Trump campaign to that end. And it seems to me that the memo that was sent by Rod Rosenstein, the Deputy Attorney General, to Attorney General Sessions explaining why he thought FBI Director Comey should be fired, directly addressed one of those two matters. So, I asked Rod Rosenstein: why doesn't this violate the scope of his recusal?"

I would say part of why these questions have come over and over to Representatives of the Trump administration is because there were a series of episodes that were not appropriately initially disclosed; say for example, the extent to which former National Security Advisor, Mike Flynn, represented foreign interest and failed to report them, or the extent to which Jared Kushner had meetings with Russian leaders early and explored a back channel in a way that was designed to acknowledge the oversight."

But and also, he said, you know, I knew that Senator Sessions would recuse himself for reasons that I can't really go into here. So, he dangled a lot about - specifically, about Attorney General Jeff Sessions, and that I think is what Tom Cotton was getting at. I mean, the preposterousness of, you know, Kislyak and Sessions meeting at this big hotel in front of all these people and doing something nefarious does strike you-when you look at it that way-as kind of silly, does it not?"

So, I don't think a lot was revealed today, and I think we're much farther down the road.

And I have stated previously that I have serious problems with the way Director Comey conducted himself. And those were really explored again today by virtue of the Senators going through meticulously: the Rosenstein memorandum, which enumerated the various areas in which the Director really violated, perhaps, law.

You don't say we're going to just cut this off; we're going to follow the trail, follow the money as the case may be or just follow the facts, follow the evidence.

I mean, this is supposed to be about Russian meddling in our election, that wasn't even an issue. Then it was supposed to be about the collusion, there's not an ounce of evidence. I'm open to empirical evidence; I used to be a doctor. You show me the facts. I'm willing to change opinion. You know, this has been investigated for seven months. There've been leaks like the Titanic, and yet has there been any leak of anything implicating the President or in the collusion with the Russians? No. And trying to tag it on Sessions is even more absurd. I mean, the man says, and I think he was right in saying that the big charge against him came from what was clear innuendo from the Comey testimony, where he implied that it was something nefarious, that he could not discuss in public, that would have forced the recusal of the Attorney General in the Russian case. Of course, the story that was then leaked from the closed session where Comey was the third meeting, which is exposed as ridiculous charge. All of us have been to receptions where you meet two-dozen people; you can't remember half of them. And he says which is quite likely, he had no interaction at all, and if he had any interaction it would have been brief, completely inconsequential, and forgettable. So, where is the charge, where is the crime?"

I think, look, he won fair and square. He's elected. He's the President. You don't like it? Then, you vote him out of office next time around. But the idea that there's this kind of obligation to bring him down, and to actually build a case for impeachment after three or four months is absurd. And I think it's sort of un-American. If he commits high crimes and misdemeanors, yes, but show me, show me the evidence. And I think this is just a sideshow of a sideshow.

This is a cloud hanging over him. I don't think that's the main cause, I think it is they worry is this the right time to have in the White House. They assume that once he was in the White House, he'd be tamed, that they would be able to get the agenda through. That's not happening and they're worried about the mid-term elections. But maybe some of them perhaps don't worry that there is a smoking gun, and that's why they're holding back. There are a lot of other reasons why Republicans would be holding back."

You know, when you get to the root of this, it's so easy in this kind of story to sort of getting pulled off in all of these different directions. But the question is: did anyone in the Trump campaign coordinate with the Russians to have an impact on our election? And what we have learned, and James Comey backed this up the other day as well, he said there's no evidence to show that that actually happened. But what has happened, according to these reports are that the Russians have been going after the software in the electoral polling systems in as many as 39 states out there.

And that's exactly why you have a Senate Intelligence Committee investigating these issues. It's the reason why we need to have and continue to have congressional committees look into this issue.

Now, realize this is not Election Day, they're not trying -- maybe they were trying to get into systems to affect Election Day tabulations, so forth, but most of those are distributed systems not tied together in the network. What they were going after are the voter files in many instances. Imagine the disruption to our election if you showed up at your polling place and the election system -- the election files had been hacked by the Russians and there was no way to verify that you're a voter. We have people standing in line filling out ballots and temporary ballots. We have people demanding to be allowed to vote who were on the rules. I mean, it could be very problematic. And that's what we've ought to be focused on instead of the baloney that we saw focused on today. I love how your previous guests, my co-debate partner here, used -- tossed out the word obstruction of justice. The president of the United States is not guilty of obstruction of justice. He has the right to fire anybody -- he has the right to fire the FBI director. And there's been no evidence that there's any bit of corruption in his decision to do so. In fact, he said to the FBI director, I want you to go find the satellite in my campaign, the people involved in my campaign and see if they were doing anything involved with the Russians. That's not the mindset of the guy who wants to shut down the rest of the investigation, something entirely different."

You think about the North Koreans trying to put a nuclear missile on top of -- a nuclear warhead on top of a missile, right? They're just going to keep working on it until they figure out how to do that. When you think also the Russians are going to keep working on this until they can figure out how to do it, and can we for a moment not be so blindsided by the fact there's this concerted effort to take down the administration to actually answer that question?"

So I agree with you, we need, without question, to look in to the integrity of our system, we need to see this as a national security threat because that's essentially what it is, it's an attack on our democracy and who we are.

Cosby pleaded not guilty to three charges of aggravated indecent assault, a second-degree felony, if found guilty, he faces up to 30 years in prison.

And also breaking tonight, Fox News confirming the bizarre back story behind controversial comments from a longtime friend of President Trump, indicating or suggesting last night that the president might be, quote, considering firing special counsel Robert Mueller, the man in charge of investigating the president potential ties to Russia, the White House immediately pushed back on these comments.

This may be more of a feeding frenzy than a real substantive controversy because there are no signs here at the White House tonight that President Trump is seriously contemplating firing that special counsel Robert Muller. In fact, today, Republican leaders on the hill, Paul Ryan and Kevin McCarthy, both said the flames of this story were being fanned by, yes, the media. But the New York Times, MSNBC, and others, eagerly piling on because it raised the specter of, yes, more chaos around here, and because it started, as you note, it was a friend of the president, Chris Ruddy of the conservative new site News Max, showing up here at the White House yesterday and then telling PBS the commander-in-chief was, quote, considering perhaps sacking Mueller. Ruddy told me in a subsequent phone interview, quote, while I may not claiming the president said it to me, I am confident of my sourcing, he is definitely considering it as an option. We should note that Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary did not directly deny that firing Mueller was an option when he said, quote, Mr. Ruddy never spoke to the president regarding this issue. With respect to the subject, only the president or his attorneys are authorized to comment. Well, people close to that very legal team told our own John Roberts, they believe Ruddy got this information from watching another Trump lawyer on television over the weekend, talk hypothetically about a Mueller firing. Well, Ruddy went on MSNBC today to say Spicer wanted him to tweet out a clarification that never came."

You know, if you do have prosecutors that have connections with one political party, the opposing political party, that's legitimate to raise. But I don't see really a basis to challenge Mueller or his team because they've given money, he didn't, but these other people did, to the Democrats or their associations with the Clintons. I'm surprised quite frankly that he didn't try to pick a team that didn't have those connections. You're investigating potentially the president of the United States. It seems to me that it's worth really sanitizing the team and having no such connections. But, at the end of the day, I don't think this is going to matter a great deal."

He said, you know, I don't want to basically breach my confidentiality with the president, and since he hasn't weighed in on whether or not he's going to invoke executive privilege on these issues, I feel I should not speak about them here. Appropriate, legal, what's your take?"

The Democrats were right procedurally, there should have been a letter from the White House counsel saying we are going to invoke executive privilege, here's the scope of those questions, and we'll try to accommodate you to the extent we can get you the information directly. But I think General Sessions was right constitutionally. When he was claiming executive privilege over was in fact well within the scope of past administrations. And so, it sounded a lot like a giant Claude Raines conference. Everyone was saying we're shocked that you would do this, it happens a great deal, often in hearings a question will come where a high-ranking official will say I don't feel comfortable with answering that. I mean, they were right, he should have anticipated these questions, there should have been that letter, but on the constitution I think it was Sessions that was right."

The danger is that sooner or later your players start to believe this and they don't train hard enough, and they are not diligent enough.

The danger is that Trump starts to believe the stuff that his surrogates and supporters are saying about Mueller and may be that he could fire him, and that Trump might do that. He might actually believe the stuff that they're spitting and then take that action, which would of course be, functionally speaking, the end of his administration."

Because not only -- he wouldn't be able to fire Mueller, he'd have to fire the deputy attorney general until he found an acting deputy attorney general who would act to fire Mueller, it becomes a total catastrophe, everybody walks away, you'll have mass resignations, everybody in the senate turns their back on him, and it's a disaster. But if he believes the spin that his spin doctors are putting out, he might not understand that."

But now, the fear is that he may never fully come home. A live report as we wait for his arrival tonight in our country at any hour. And 19-year-old Timothy Piazza died in a hazing incident at Penn State, and his family says his fraternity brothers treated their court date today like another fraternity party. The family's powerful words about what happened in the courtroom straight ahead."

And during yesterday's hearing to decide if there was enough evidence to move forward in this case against the fraternity brothers that you see on the left-hand side of your screen, James Piazza, Timothy's father, explains the shocking scenes that he saw in yesterday's courtroom, telling Fox News, quote, following the hearing, most but not all, of the fraternity brothers and their families got together, laughed, patted each other on the back, and hugged as if it were just another fraternity get together. We are highly offended by the insensitivity displayed given the severity of the crimes committed and ultimate outcome. The judge ordered a continuance after a nearly ten hour hearing. We will stay on top of that story and bring you the latest. Also breaking tonight, American college student Otto Warmbier is now on his way home after being detained in North Korea since January of 2016. But his parents have now revealed the disturbing news that Otto has been in a coma for the past 15 months. For more, we go to Trace Gallagher in our West Coast newsroom. Trace."

Fox News has confirmed, as you said, Warmbier has been in a coma since last March of 2016, rather, when he was sentenced to 15 years hard labor. North Korea claims the University of Virginia college student stole a political banner from his hotel at the behest of the CIA, and then while he was imprisoned the North claim Warmbier contracted botulism, took a sleeping pill and slipped into a coma. The U.S. has not accepted that explanation, nor have Warmbier's parents who say their son was terrorize and brutalize by a pariah regime. It wasn't until last month that members of the Swedish consulate were finally allowed to visit Warmbier and three other Americans also being held, and when the state department learned about Otto Warmbier's condition, President Trump and secretary of state Rex Tillerson began some rare diplomatic negotiations which resulted a few days ago with Tillerson organizing an airplane and medical team to go to Pyongyang and evacuate Warmbier. And the secretary of state says the effort is not over. Listen."

Here's the final stabbing scene which apparently got a standing ovation. Like Caesar, we live in divisive times, so here's the quote of the night, there's a tide in the affairs of men which taken at the flood leads to fortune. Admitted, all the voyage of their life is bound in shallows and miseries of such a full sea, we are now afloat. We must take the current when it serves or lose our ventures. A good night, everybody.
