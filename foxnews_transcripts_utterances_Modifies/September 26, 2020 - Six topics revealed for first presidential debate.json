      "sentences": "Today's lesson is a contrast in delusions and reality. The delusions are actually nightmares concocted daily by the media and Democrats forever predicting the end of days whenever Trump predicts better times.   So Trump looks to the heavens and sees the beauty of creation. Dems look to the heavens and ask why Trump is inviting meteor strikes. The reality, actual daily violence is real, preserved by Dems and their killer parrots whose dismissal of rioting and looting keeps it alive.  That's the contrast, one evil never occurs, but is promised; another one occurs daily, but deemed acceptable. There is a connection.  The predictions of the apocalypse are used to justify the degradations on the street. By doing so, you have actual media dopes, blaming Trump for violence. I call it the circle of death.    Number one, gin up the anti-Trump panic. Number two, let the rage unfold. Number three, then blame the carnage on Donald Trump and four, use that to gin up more rage. Rinse and repeat. The Supreme Court Justice pick is one more conduit for this lunacy. Once the seat went vacant, the same hysterics went hysterical again. Trump made his pick, the confirmation process is next. The endless hearings, the gratuitous grandstanding. You know that's going to be a circus of exploding heads. And Lemon's head already did.",

At FOX, it's obvious, you know, I'm commentary and Hemmer is news. You know, Tucker is commentary and Brett is news. You know, Jesse is -- well, we don't know what Jesse is. But we've sent his hair to a lab for tests.  But at CNN, what's a Lemon? What's a Cuomo? If you did a nutritional analysis, how much of what they produce is news? How much is commentary? And how much is raw sewage?  It's a media mullet. They got a little bit of news up front, but a whole lot of smelly opinion in the back, and here's how that recipe plays out.  Up front, today, COVID death stands at 200,000. In the back, thank you, Donald Trump for killing each and every person and also for running over my dog when I was five.    It's why these doom merchants can't be labeled. Their only standard is, make money for Jeff Zucker, which calls for conflict. It's just as bad at MSNBC.

And Venus just discovered life on Tyrus. My massive sidekick and host of \"Nuff Said\" on FOX Nation, Tyrus. All right, Walter, isn't it a bit hypocritical to say the least for people who couldn't accept an election in 2016, to be so worried that Trump will leave office four years later? WALTER KIRN, NOVELIST/LITERARY CRITIC: Well, first of all, it's a psychological trick. They're wanting him to admit that he might lose and advance and to accept that and to get other people to accept it, and it's such a transparent trick that I'm surprised he even bothers to answer the question at all. The other problem for me though, is these revolutionaries on the news like Don Lemon. I mean, they are the most well paid Bolsheviks in history, and they talk about things like blowing up the Electoral College. The Electoral College is not a campus, it does not have, you know, a student union. It's not Penn State.  We're talking about the Constitution here and you don't blow it up, you amend it, but the talk on these other cable channels is, you know, it's rivaling everything that FOX was once accused of doing.

Let me share a little number with you that's disturbing that backs up your argument, Greg, and that is that Gallup and the Knight Foundation did a poll just a couple of weeks ago that showed that 84 percent of the country say the media bears the blame for divide in this country, 84 percent thinks that. It's not just a Republican conservative thing. It's also Democrats. And it always wasn't like this back in 1976, seven in 10 Americans actually approved and trusted the media. It's completely been turned on its head.  So when you hear like a Don Lemon, who again is labeled an anchor on CNN, and even its media reporter insists that it's a news program and not an opinion show, he says this, \"We're going to have to blow up the entire system.\" Who is we exactly? Because no Republicans are calling for the Electoral College to go. So that's either media, Democrats, or basically it's anonymous at this point. Both -- so who is we.

You know, when I was in my wrestling career, whenever someone asked me, what are you going to do if you lose? I typically would give them a ridiculously stupid answer. I'd say, well, I'm going to cheat, so I won't.

Look, I'm really just kind of stuck on how funny it is for Don Lemon to be talking about blowing up the system. While he is also so often talking about how we need to vote for the guy who has been a politician for 47 years. Do you realize how long that is? That is more than 19 percent of the time that America has been a country. That's like he is the system, okay? And I think that we do need to change the system in the sense that people who are in government have too much power. And I think that this whole Supreme Court battle is a perfect example of that. Because think about it, what if, instead of having to have mass -- people have massive meltdowns over a single Supreme Court Justice dying? Power wasn't so concentrated, so much power among just a handful of people? What if we had enough agency over our own lives or would it be something that people are freaking out about so much. And it's been interesting to me, because this time, of course, it's people on the left, mostly, who are freaking out that RBG died, their rights are going to be taken away. But then in the same breath, they talk about packing the courts. So they want to essentially set a precedent for giving the government more power and control over our lives for partisan reasons. How about instead, we start to talk about the individual rights and taking control of our own lives or in the immortal words of Mace, I do what works for me, you do what works for you.",

So when Chris Wallace, who is a moderator here, obviously on Tuesday night, he is going to be asking him some questions that Biden hasn't heard at all, especially during that CNN beach ball Town Hall last week. It wasn't even a softball, it was probably a beach ball, because in that debate, 16 questions asked Greg, three by Republicans, 13 by Democrats, you think that's getting Joe Biden ready for this?

And \"Chasing Cars\" I don't know by Snow Patrol. These are all like bands I don't listen to.

The delusions are actually nightmares concocted daily by the media and Democrats forever predicting the end of days whenever Trump predicts better times. So Trump looks to the heavens and sees the beauty of creation. Dems look to the heavens and ask why Trump is inviting meteor strikes. The reality, actual daily violence is real, preserved by Dems and their killer parrots whose dismissal of rioting and looting keeps it alive. That's the contrast, one evil never occurs, but is promised; another one occurs daily, but deemed acceptable. There is a connection. The predictions of the apocalypse are used to justify the degradations on the street. By doing so, you have actual media dopes, blaming Trump for violence. I call it the circle of death. Number one, gin up the anti-Trump panic. Number two, let the rage unfold. Number three, then blame the carnage on Donald Trump and four, use that to gin up more rage. Rinse and repeat. The Supreme Court Justice pick is one more conduit for this lunacy. Once the seat went vacant, the same hysterics went hysterical again. Trump made his pick, the confirmation process is next.

All right, Walter, isn't it a bit hypocritical to say the least for people who couldn't accept an election in 2016, to be so worried that Trump will leave office four years later? WALTER KIRN, NOVELIST/LITERARY CRITIC: Well, first of all, it's a psychological trick. They're wanting him to admit that he might lose and advance and to accept that and to get other people to accept it, and it's such a transparent trick that I'm surprised he even bothers to answer the question at all. The other problem for me though, is these revolutionaries on the news like Don Lemon. I mean, they are the most well paid Bolsheviks in history, and they talk about things like blowing up the Electoral College. The Electoral College is not a campus, it does not have, you know, a student union. It's not Penn State. We're talking about the Constitution here and you don't blow it up, you amend it, but the talk on these other cable channels is, you know, it's rivaling everything that FOX was once accused of doing.

It's not just a Republican conservative thing. It's also Democrats. And it always wasn't like this back in 1976, seven in 10 Americans actually approved and trusted the media. It's completely been turned on its head. So when you hear like a Don Lemon, who again is labeled an anchor on CNN, and even its media reporter insists that it's a news program and not an opinion show, he says this, \"We're going to have to blow up the entire system.\" Who is we exactly? Because no Republicans are calling for the Electoral College to go. So that's either media, Democrats, or basically it's anonymous at this point. Both -- so who is we. It's not even journalism anymore. It's activism and it is painfully apparent."

I'd say, well, I'm going to cheat, so I won't.

Look, I'm really just kind of stuck on how funny it is for Don Lemon to be talking about blowing up the system. While he is also so often talking about how we need to vote for the guy who has been a politician for 47 years. Do you realize how long that is? That is more than 19 percent of the time that America has been a country. That's like he is the system, okay? And I think that we do need to change the system in the sense that people who are in government have too much power. And I think that this whole Supreme Court battle is a perfect example of that. Because think about it, what if, instead of having to have mass -- people have massive meltdowns over a single Supreme Court Justice dying? Power wasn't so concentrated, so much power among just a handful of people? What if we had enough agency over our own lives or would it be something that people are freaking out about so much. And it's been interesting to me, because this time, of course, it's people on the left, mostly, who are freaking out that RBG died, their rights are going to be taken away. But then in the same breath, they talk about packing the courts. So they want to essentially set a precedent for giving the government more power and control over our lives for partisan reasons. How about instead, we start to talk about the individual rights and taking control of our own lives or in the immortal words of Mace, I do what works for me, you do what works for you."

You won't see him, but I can. Moderator and world record holder in the 400-meter freestyle, Chris Wallace will focus on these topics. The Supreme Court battle, coronavirus, the economy and unrest in the cities. Excellent topics. I would have added around debating the best way to steal toilet paper from work. Guess, I'll never be asked to moderate. You've got to wonder how these two are getting ready for Tuesday night. Trump has got a full plate with the Supreme Court and his rallies. But what's Biden doing?"

Well, I'm rubber, you're glue, whatever bounces off for you sticks to me, and then yes -- you know the thing. Let me -- let me just try some \"Come on man's.\" Just a whole series of them. Come on, man. Come on, man. Come on, man. (Talks gibberish). You like that one? My secret weapon. Oh, yes. There we go. Atta boy. The American people love hairy legs. Just not too hairy."

Ten out of 25 days in September, which would be okay for a 77- year-old guy winding down, but we are, you know less than six weeks from an election and he wants to be the leader of the free world, yet he's not even leaving his basement. I am another Joe in my basement, but I do get out once in a while and I'm not even running for President. So look, he's got to do -- and he's not going to do it, but you know, going into this debate, he is going to be in some serious, serious trouble because it's kind of like going into a heavyweight boxing match without training or sparring in any way and he hasn't done one remotely tough interview. So when Chris Wallace, who is a moderator here, obviously on Tuesday night, he is going to be asking him some questions that Biden hasn't heard at all, especially during that CNN beach ball Town Hall last week. It wasn't even a softball, it was probably a beach ball, because in that debate, 16 questions asked Greg, three by Republicans, 13 by Democrats, you think that's getting Joe Biden ready for this? I'm telling you, he's walking into a real buzz saw because he hasn't prepped in the way that you do, the way President Trump does in terms of taking questions every day and sitting down with a guy like Wallace like he didn't July in a 100-degree he in a suit, which couldn't have been fun."

But I don't need to go there because for this, although Mr. Wallace is phenomenal, I'm a little upset that my colleague journalist, Katherine Timpf was not given opportunity as a mediator. We have been pushing this on \"Tyrus and Timpf\" podcast. So the struggle is real. And again, I would be remiss if I did not bring up -- and you know what I'm talking about? I don't think I heard that little \"W\" word, and I was promised. So I've got another word. I'm calling bull [bleep], Greg. It is supposed to be \"With Tyrus.\" You promised. I'm not a guest.

People just already have their minds made up and it is so partisan, that they just sit there and shake and like seethe and like foam at the mouth with hatred for the other side. I guarantee you that the next day, anyone on the left is going to say \"Amazing Biden,\" \"Amazing, amazing.\" And then on the right, it would be this -- it'll be the same thing. I do think that expectations for Joe will probably be a little bit lower. I think if he makes, a lot of people will be impressed with that. The expectations will be lower. I just -- I'm so glad it's happening. I'm thrilled to watch it not just because I'm almost a year into the pandemic and I running out of things to watch. But because I love this and it is so important that it's happening. I think it'll be great.

I'm not sure, you know, the age of American presidential candidates has gotten to be a problem. And at this point, I want heart monitor readouts by both of them, and you know, they should probably hold it in the Critical Care Unit, in fact. I'm not looking forward to the debate because I'm going to probably publicize myself by live tweeting it and that's a way to get yourself in trouble with both sides. I think both sides have decided in advance who won, and they've decided in advance what their storyline is going to be. So it's sort of one of those games that doesn't have to be played that we're going to have to watch anyway, plus the heart monitor on my part."

The four-day hearing will include opening statements, two days of questions, and one day for outside witnesses. A swift information is expected for the conservative that is despite objections by Democrats. Vice Presidential Nominee Senator Kamala Harris and other Democrats say the President and Republicans want to destroy the Affordable Care Act and access to abortion.

So you should have plenty saved in the old savings account. The downside of that is unfortunately, that's not how it works. The farmers were selling it for cents on the dollar. So, they've got all of this extra stuff. So the upsell guys, they're fine. And the farmer once again gets the short end of the stick. So your heart goes out to them. You think we want to say that, we want to go out and say well, movie prices, farmers ain't getting that movie price money. So, you know, that's the cold part, and as far as brains and stuff being sent to the house, I guess my concern is when you have kids going, there's something here for AB Normal. There's an AB Normal brain, is that like -- we just did -- some of the reading is down but at least they're getting their science stuff out. This is the way school is changing now. Now, you're going to have brains and stuff sent to the house and now homeschool just got really cool because your dysfunctional dad is going to have to re-up on his science books and help you with dissection because if you mess it up, you get another one or if you get it confused with your mail and food prep.

It was just us to with somebody signing a piece of paper. I mean, it was less than a civil ceremony. But I actually analyzed the two lists of songs and the songs for the successful marriages are all songs in praise of the woman."

So I guess this is something I don't really have to think about, right? Because it's like virus. If I have one, I will certainly be accused of murdering grandmothers. And I'm just not really vibing with that happening to me right now. So I will probably go to the courthouse actually. So my wedding song will end up being whatever some guy is playing on the street on his trombone for cash, which actually more often than not, is \"When the saints go marching in.\""

I guess I get a little bit of a, pass but honestly, we actually did with our DJ. We had a DJ and a band kind of like having a pool and a pond. Pond had a good view. But we had a DJ and a band, and we told the DJ, okay, you get 50 percent up front. You don't get the other 50 percent until you don't play these songs. In other words, we didn't have a request list. We had a do not playlist, and trust me, I was listening to it closely. Chicken dance, Village People. No way. Because it's at every wedding and it wasn't going to happen at the Concha wedding at the Breakers at the Jersey Shore."
