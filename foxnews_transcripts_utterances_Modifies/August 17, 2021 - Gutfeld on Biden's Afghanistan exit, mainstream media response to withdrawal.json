Turns out surprise, they aren't an enlightened bunch. They're not only stuck in the dark ages, they prefer everyone else joined them there. So they have that in common with the Green New Deal. But it may get worse. Their idea of women's rights is letting her air out her burqa once a year. However, we've been told by the press this is a kinder, gentler Taliban. So what does that mean exactly? They only partially behead you? They only throw gays out of an eight-storey window not a 12-storey one? Did you see how one Taliban leader free from Getmo by then President Obama is back on the job and I don't mean as a tenured professor. We held on to him and then let him go. We probably fed him better than his fellow fighters. He's the only terrorist in the group with type two diabetes. Compared to the hell on earth they created back home, Getmo is a spa weekend on our dime. All that's missing are the conjugal visits from his favorite goat. Felt like the goats going to write letters. And they don't get this in Afghanistan. So you've seen this picture of hordes of evacuating civilians packed into a cargo plane? You're staring at that in disbelief. How is that even possible? Meanwhile, spirit era say, you know, we're getting some ideas here. So, here's an analogy. There's a pack of wolves outside your door waiting for you to leave so they can devour your grandmother. Maybe before you leave you kill the wolves, you don't just go see you, granny, best of luck with the wolves. Unless maybe she stiffed you this year on that $5.00 in your birthday card. But this isn't armchair quarterbacking. I'm not tall enough to be a Q.B. and secondly, what's an armchair? But given it was American blood and treasure lost, we need to hear the truth. Here's one vet unleashing reality on a soggy Brian Williams.",

      "sentences": "Talk about brain dead. They should change the name of the show from Deadline to Flatline. You know, I'm not bashing the decision to leave. It's how the atrocious exit negated so much sacrifice. This is truly a manmade disaster. In Biden's speech yesterday. He defiantly defended his botched to exit as if we were critical of leaving, but we weren't. We were critical of his incompetence in carrying it out. Timing is everything in life, Joe. If anybody should know that it's a man who probably starts his day with five recon at a pot of black coffee. People over 60 get that. My core audience. Imagine if Captain Sully had bailed and let his plane crash into the Hudson. Technically it's still a water landing but only one gets you played by Tom Hanks. But even if I wanted to defend Biden I can't. I mean I do have a nagging question in Joe's defense. If 20 years made no difference on the exit, you think taking another few months would make any difference? But still, it's on Biden. Remember as president, he said that the number one threat to America wasn't the Taliban, al Qaeda or ISIS. It's millions of white voters. So screw him. He didn't see the Taliban resurgence because he was too busy indulging fabricated adversaries in between photo ops of him licking ice cream cones. And as for the Democrats, it's par for the course and Afghanistan just as on the border or in law enforcement. The Dems always embrace what undermines order. They're like a hooker deciding what broad aware. They choose what comes apart the fastest. I got that for Charlie. As for those documenting the horrors of the Taliban, ask yourself this. Would they have supported in all out fast annihilation of Taliban? In a world where every attempt to fight radical terror was met with cries of Islamophobia? You would have been called a monster or worse a Trump supporter to suggest such a thing. Taliban leaders were in the President's palace. One missile would have ended that photo op. But how would the chattering classes take to that? Sorry that swift brutal action should be reserved only for the insurrection is at the Capitol. Over here out F up media focused on plastic straws, mean tweets, racist Halloween costumes, misgendering, refusing a vaccine or appropriating another ethnic groups food in the school cafeteria, and of course social media galvanized mobs to cancel people for bad jokes and bad memes. And entire news networks smeared the police nightly and chose to inflame racial tension for ratings for years. Our priorities as a nation were deliberately undermined. Even as our troops toiled, the war became less the background noise. We spent years letting our attention to Afghanistan grow flabby. To paraphrase Harry Chapin, the war learned to walk while I was away. How the war is now old enough to drink and too old for Anthony Weiner to date. And in all that time we still hadn't prepared for this moment. That's amazing. Imagine you got 20 years to plan on your exit and it's this bad. What were our leaders doing? Too busy destroying this country I guess.",

It's so easy but no, no, they're going to finish out to 35 years go work at Dynacor or wherever they're going to go. They're fine. They're fine. These are -- these are yes men surrounded by yes men. Show me a four-star general, I will show you 15 guys kissing his ass. That's it. He just tells him what he wants to hear. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

It also found that social media pulls moderates to the extreme, while people who are already partisan grew even more so. Basically, social media is a steroid that boosts a-hole behavior. Follow me on Twitter for details. But moral outrage can be good and bad. For instance, the civil rights movement grew out outrage but so did the cancel culture hysteria.

      "utterance": "So within hours of the Taliban season control of Kabul the stories of coolest behavior toward women erupt. They make Andy Cuomo look like Andy Williams. Turns out surprise, they aren't an enlightened bunch. They're not only stuck in the dark ages, they prefer everyone else joined them there. So they have that in common with the Green New Deal. But it may get worse. Their idea of women's rights is letting her air out her burqa once a year. However, we've been told by the press this is a kinder, gentler Taliban. So what does that mean exactly? They only partially behead you? They only throw gays out of an eight-storey window not a 12-storey one? Did you see how one Taliban leader free from Getmo by then President Obama is back on the job and I don't mean as a tenured professor. We held on to him and then let him go. We probably fed him better than his fellow fighters. He's the only terrorist in the group with type two diabetes. Compared to the hell on earth they created back home, Getmo is a spa weekend on our dime. All that's missing are the conjugal visits from his favorite goat. Felt like the goats going to write letters. And they don't get this in Afghanistan. So you've seen this picture of hordes of evacuating civilians packed into a cargo plane? You're staring at that in disbelief. How is that even possible? Meanwhile, spirit era say, you know, we're getting some ideas here. So, here's an analogy. There's a pack of wolves outside your door waiting for you to leave so they can devour your grandmother. Maybe before you leave you kill the wolves, you don't just go see you, granny, best of luck with the wolves. Unless maybe she stiffed you this year on that $5.00 in your birthday card. But this isn't armchair quarterbacking. I'm not tall enough to be a Q.B. and secondly, what's an armchair? But given it was American blood and treasure lost, we need to hear the truth. Here's one vet unleashing reality on a soggy Brian Williams."

It's how the atrocious exit negated so much sacrifice. This is truly a manmade disaster. In Biden's speech yesterday. He defiantly defended his botched to exit as if we were critical of leaving, but we weren't. We were critical of his incompetence in carrying it out. Timing is everything in life, Joe. If anybody should know that it's a man who probably starts his day with five recon at a pot of black coffee. People over 60 get that. My core audience. Imagine if Captain Sully had bailed and let his plane crash into the Hudson. Technically it's still a water landing but only one gets you played by Tom Hanks. But even if I wanted to defend Biden I can't. I mean I do have a nagging question in Joe's defense. If 20 years made no difference on the exit, you think taking another few months would make any difference? But still, it's on Biden. Remember as president, he said that the number one threat to America wasn't the Taliban, al Qaeda or ISIS. It's millions of white voters. So screw him. He didn't see the Taliban resurgence because he was too busy indulging fabricated adversaries in between photo ops of him licking ice cream cones. And as for the Democrats, it's par for the course and Afghanistan just as on the border or in law enforcement. The Dems always embrace what undermines order. They're like a hooker deciding what broad aware. They choose what comes apart the fastest. I got that for Charlie. As for those documenting the horrors of the Taliban, ask yourself this. Would they have supported in all out fast annihilation of Taliban? In a world where every attempt to fight radical terror was met with cries of Islamophobia? You would have been called a monster or worse a Trump supporter to suggest such a thing. Taliban leaders were in the President's palace. One missile would have ended that photo op. But how would the chattering classes take to that? Sorry that swift brutal action should be reserved only for the insurrection is at the Capitol. Over here out F up media focused on plastic straws, mean tweets, racist Halloween costumes, misgendering, refusing a vaccine or appropriating another ethnic groups food in the school cafeteria, and of course social media galvanized mobs to cancel people for bad jokes and bad memes. And entire news networks smeared the police nightly and chose to inflame racial tension for ratings for years. Our priorities as a nation were deliberately undermined. Even as our troops toiled, the war became less the background noise. We spent years letting our attention to Afghanistan grow flabby. To paraphrase Harry Chapin, the war learned to walk while I was away. How the war is now old enough to drink and too old for Anthony Weiner to date. And in all that time we still hadn't prepared for this moment. That's amazing. Imagine you got 20 years to plan on your exit and it's this bad. What were our leaders doing? Too busy destroying this country I guess."

Meanwhile, in New York City, the vaccine mandate had started for restaurants, bars, gyms, museums, movie theaters, sports arenas, bowling alleys, you name. It's now a thing. But according to the latest city data only 33 percent of blacks of all ages are vaccinated, so a huge segment of the population will be banned. And the restaurants can be fined up to $2,000, which will only help businesses already struggling to find workers by drastically decreasing their customer base. But the homeless still need no passport to defecate on your steps or swing a hatchet at your skull. Meanwhile, the Las Vegas Raiders were required vaccinations for home games this season, forever be smirking the devil may care attitude of pillagers everywhere.

It also found that social media pulls moderates to the extreme, while people who are already partisan grew even more so. Basically, social media is a steroid that boosts a-hole behavior. Follow me on Twitter for details. But moral outrage can be good and bad. For instance, the civil rights movement grew out outrage but so did the cancel culture hysteria.

Maybe not, because they're two different people. Al- Qaedas are foreign fighters in Afghanistan, anyway. And I don't think the Taliban has interest attacking us here. They want their valleys, they want their mountains. I want to be optimistic because I think hopefully -- no, and I've could be, I'm probably wrong, but hopefully they just want to keep their country and you know, the press in and then just murder people."
