      "sentences": "See, they're all butts. Our world is run by but-heads. These are people who tell you one thing and then follow up with a but, that contradicts what they just said. They'll start with a panic line, but then condition it with but we still don't know. That way they get to scare your ass but then cover their own. So let's follow the butts and see where these asses take us. According to Axios, the Web site, not by Pilate's instructor. The country's bracing for a terrifying wave of Omicron. But the new variant seems to be much less severe. But Boris Johnson says there's a tidal wave coming. But one of his experts adds only 10 people have been admitted to the hospital with it. But we should have known never believe anything a person says who doesn't own a comb. That was him. Lively crowd tonight. Still, you must get a third dose to bring the level of protection back up because the variant seems to spread among people who've received two jabs. But it's not a big deal for those who get it. Still you got to mask up and get another dose. But this is nothing like the previous strains Compared to Delta you barely notice it. And it's much less powerful. If Alec Baldwin were the first strain, this one is Billy or Danny. Perhaps, Steven. But new data from Europe hint that Omicron is poised to explode in the U.S. True, they said the same thing about the metric system. Thank you, thank you, but the variant is less likely to lead to hospitalizations in adults. So this is the P.G. version of an R-rated film. Like when they cut out all the swearing in boobs from Old Yeller. Fact is more people are hospitalized for putting power tools in their butts. According to emergency rooms located near Home Depots. I did the research. But two doses of Pfizer's vaccine appear to be much less effective against severe disease. But you should still get this booster. Although we haven't seen anyone with severe disease, but hold on, it's coming. Yes, but so was the medical device I ordered online. And I'm still waiting, I had to make my own using an attachment from an old vacuum. But a senior flack told Axios that Omicron will come fast, but it won't be as severe, but there will be hospitalizations. But the analysis of South Africa data said that the risk of hospital admission was 30 percent lower than the first wave. But a new two-dose regimen was 70 percent effective against severe disease requiring hospital admission. But only 33 percent effective against Omicron. So Omicron is less severe, that's good. But it still could overwhelm the healthcare system, even if a small percentage require hospital care. (BLEEP) the case could reach a million a day here in America. Double (BLEEP) but those cases could be asymptomatic and mild. Hurray. But the growth of the cases could double quickly, creating more problems. But it also appears to be already slowing down in other countries. But it's too soon to sell but don't tell but don't panic, but also maybe you should panic. But maybe even in hospitalizations, adults are less thick, sick than previous waves, and thick. But while vaccinations do help infection, but not on transmission. In Denmark, 75 percent of Omicron cases are among fully vaccinated people. But you can't compare countries except when you do but you can't. So Omicron has high transmissibility. But it appears to be mild. But it could lead to a huge projection of cases. But we don't nearly - we don't have nearly enough data to make any firm predictions. So the people who are telling you to do something are the same people who are talking you out of it. These people are sending more mixed messages than a straight hairdresser. You know, so maybe call us when you know what (BLEEP) you're talking about. Because to quote Axios again, there is certainly a strong possibility that a lot of Americans are about to get sick soon. Someone actually wrote that sentence. I mean, imagine if your doctor had that mentality.",

Could be dangerous, but we can't find anyone who died from it. But we don't have enough data. So just in case get a booster and mask up now whether you're vaxxeds or not. But wait, I thought that's why we got vaxxed to stop with the masks. Well, not anymore. Look at Joe Biden. He's got three shots, but he still wears a mask. He's like one giant walking butt. So even if you're alone at your desk, or alone driving a truck or alone having sex, Jesse, mask up. But not if you're a politician, then you could go to bars and parties and gallos and do whatever the hell you want. So these butt-heads cover their asses by temporarily covering their mouths when a camera is near. The problem is how can they tell the two holes apart? You can't go by the smell of their breath. So it turns out the only thing that all these different viruses can't penetrate are the immune systems of habitual liars. But it would be nice if they could. No ifs, ands, or buts.",

By the FBI for attempting to lure minors and not the cold kind, to his Vermont ski house to engage in sexual activity. According to court documents last year, Griffin had a number of online conversations with a purported parents of young girls who ranged in age from nine to 16. In one instance, Griffin allegedly transferred over three grand to the mother of one child so they could fly from Nevada to Boston where he picked him up and drove them to his house, where according to the indictment, that daughter was directed to engage in illegal sexual activity. Now, the court papers reveal a bunch of other disgusting stuff that Griffin said during conversations with the parents and I'm not going to repeat it here. So when you're done smacking him upside the head, you got to save some slabs for those disgusting parents. As for CNN, they released this statement, \"The charges against Mr. Griffin are deeply disturbing. We learned of his arrest Friday afternoon and terminated his employment Monday.\" So, the irony here is that CNN was the network pushing the idea that there was no crime wave. Remember that?

The student teachers union at Columbia University remains committed to severing all ties with the NYPD while they seem to be cool with knife-wielding criminals. This is a sentiment also shared by many undergraduates who continue to push for the removal of cops from their campus. Yes, they want the campus free of cops the same way their brains are free of thought. And this despite the fact that two students in the last two years have been murdered near school property. The most recent happening earlier this month when a 30-year-old grad student from Italy was randomly stabbed to death in the stomach while walking home from soccer practice. Police arrested the alleged perp, a young gang member with a lengthy rap sheet. We've heard that before. During the George Floyd protest, Columbia Student Workers Union called for the university to \"immediately cut ties\" with the NYPD and the New York City Police Foundation, and divest from any funding for police. Banned police from all Columbia campuses and redirect funds towards supporting black and indigenous people. Of course, black and indigenous people suffer more when cops aren't around. To their credit, the NYPD says they beefed up their presence, although using the word beefed probably triggers the vegan students. But despite the recent murder, these students would still rather protect criminals than themselves, proving once more that paying $58,000 a year in tuition usually means you're stupid.",

      "utterance": "See, they're all butts. Our world is run by but-heads. These are people who tell you one thing and then follow up with a but, that contradicts what they just said. They'll start with a panic line, but then condition it with but we still don't know. That way they get to scare your ass but then cover their own. So let's follow the butts and see where these asses take us. According to Axios, the Web site, not by Pilate's instructor. The country's bracing for a terrifying wave of Omicron. But the new variant seems to be much less severe. But Boris Johnson says there's a tidal wave coming. But one of his experts adds only 10 people have been admitted to the hospital with it. But we should have known never believe anything a person says who doesn't own a comb. That was him. Lively crowd tonight. Still, you must get a third dose to bring the level of protection back up because the variant seems to spread among people who've received two jabs. But it's not a big deal for those who get it. Still you got to mask up and get another dose. But this is nothing like the previous strains Compared to Delta you barely notice it. And it's much less powerful. If Alec Baldwin were the first strain, this one is Billy or Danny. Perhaps, Steven. But new data from Europe hint that Omicron is poised to explode in the U.S. True, they said the same thing about the metric system. Thank you, thank you, but the variant is less likely to lead to hospitalizations in adults. So this is the P.G. version of an R-rated film. Like when they cut out all the swearing in boobs from Old Yeller. Fact is more people are hospitalized for putting power tools in their butts. According to emergency rooms located near Home Depots. I did the research. But two doses of Pfizer's vaccine appear to be much less effective against severe disease. But you should still get this booster. Although we haven't seen anyone with severe disease, but hold on, it's coming. Yes, but so was the medical device I ordered online. And I'm still waiting, I had to make my own using an attachment from an old vacuum. But a senior flack told Axios that Omicron will come fast, but it won't be as severe, but there will be hospitalizations. But the analysis of South Africa data said that the risk of hospital admission was 30 percent lower than the first wave. But a new two-dose regimen was 70 percent effective against severe disease requiring hospital admission. But only 33 percent effective against Omicron. So Omicron is less severe, that's good. But it still could overwhelm the healthcare system, even if a small percentage require hospital care. (BLEEP) the case could reach a million a day here in America. Double (BLEEP) but those cases could be asymptomatic and mild. Hurray. But the growth of the cases could double quickly, creating more problems. But it also appears to be already slowing down in other countries. But it's too soon to sell but don't tell but don't panic, but also maybe you should panic. But maybe even in hospitalizations, adults are less thick, sick than previous waves, and thick. But while vaccinations do help infection, but not on transmission. In Denmark, 75 percent of Omicron cases are among fully vaccinated people. But you can't compare countries except when you do but you can't. So Omicron has high transmissibility. But it appears to be mild. But it could lead to a huge projection of cases. But we don't nearly - we don't have nearly enough data to make any firm predictions. So the people who are telling you to do something are the same people who are talking you out of it. These people are sending more mixed messages than a straight hairdresser. You know, so maybe call us when you know what (BLEEP) you're talking about. Because to quote Axios again, there is certainly a strong possibility that a lot of Americans are about to get sick soon. Someone actually wrote that sentence. I mean, imagine if your doctor had that mentality."

Could be dangerous, but we can't find anyone who died from it. But we don't have enough data. So just in case get a booster and mask up now whether you're vaxxeds or not. But wait, I thought that's why we got vaxxed to stop with the masks. Well, not anymore. Look at Joe Biden. He's got three shots, but he still wears a mask. He's like one giant walking butt. So even if you're alone at your desk, or alone driving a truck or alone having sex, Jesse, mask up. But not if you're a politician, then you could go to bars and parties and gallos and do whatever the hell you want. So these butt-heads cover their asses by temporarily covering their mouths when a camera is near. The problem is how can they tell the two holes apart? You can't go by the smell of their breath. So it turns out the only thing that all these different viruses can't penetrate are the immune systems of habitual liars. But it would be nice if they could. No ifs, ands, or buts."

He said there's no private practices anymore. All the big hospitals bought all the private practices up. And the big hospitals are run by the government. And so these big hospitals are basically sucking at the teeth. It's a medical term of big government. And they're run by these Ivy League doctors who want to cozy up to the Washington politicians because they just want to get appointed to agencies and to nice posts. So they do whatever big government tells them to do. So big government says masks mandate, vaccine, they say yes, sir because it's good for business. So I said, Doctor, I don't want to get into HIPAA or anything like that. But I said, Doctor, what do I do? He said, You're going to have to get a booster for the next couple years, but all the mandates are bogus. All right? So I said, OK, and then I was leaving the room.

According to court documents last year, Griffin had a number of online conversations with a purported parents of young girls who ranged in age from nine to 16. In one instance, Griffin allegedly transferred over three grand to the mother of one child so they could fly from Nevada to Boston where he picked him up and drove them to his house, where according to the indictment, that daughter was directed to engage in illegal sexual activity. Now, the court papers reveal a bunch of other disgusting stuff that Griffin said during conversations with the parents and I'm not going to repeat it here. So when you're done smacking him upside the head, you got to save some slabs for those disgusting parents. As for CNN, they released this statement, \"The charges against Mr. Griffin are deeply disturbing. We learned of his arrest Friday afternoon and terminated his employment Monday.\" So, the irony here is that CNN was the network pushing the idea that there was no crime wave. Remember that? And now we know why. Because it was the criminals who were producing their content. Yes, sick burn, Kat."

The student teachers union at Columbia University remains committed to severing all ties with the NYPD while they seem to be cool with knife-wielding criminals. This is a sentiment also shared by many undergraduates who continue to push for the removal of cops from their campus. Yes, they want the campus free of cops the same way their brains are free of thought. And this despite the fact that two students in the last two years have been murdered near school property. The most recent happening earlier this month when a 30-year-old grad student from Italy was randomly stabbed to death in the stomach while walking home from soccer practice. Police arrested the alleged perp, a young gang member with a lengthy rap sheet. We've heard that before. During the George Floyd protest, Columbia Student Workers Union called for the university to \"immediately cut ties\" with the NYPD and the New York City Police Foundation, and divest from any funding for police. Banned police from all Columbia campuses and redirect funds towards supporting black and indigenous people. Of course, black and indigenous people suffer more when cops aren't around. To their credit, the NYPD says they beefed up their presence, although using the word beefed probably triggers the vegan students. But despite the recent murder, these students would still rather protect criminals than themselves, proving once more that paying $58,000 a year in tuition usually means you're stupid."

She says, she was fired for neglecting to share a $4,400 tip with the other servers, which would have left her with only 20 percent of the money. 20 percent, that's the same percentage Geraldo gets from his paycheck after his ex-wives get their cut. Anyway, why not? The tippers in this Arkansas restaurant reportedly found out what the restaurant was trying to do and demanded that all of the cash go to the -- only the two servers who took care of them. But then, the next day the restaurant killed her employment status. The waitress which some call a server, but in New York, we call them actresses, was distraught. The good news, one of the tippers then started a GoFundMe page for her, which has raised more than $10,000, which is enough to now buy CNN.

So, it really proves your communist thing, but what's scary is this story five years ago would have been outrageous. People -- this would have been everywhere talking about it, but because our new administration and the new woke way supports what the store did, because that's what they want. You got all the money you got to share it now. That's Bernie Sanders move. That's, that's the new administration. That's the woke that's the progressive way. So, it's not -- it's a 50/50 story when it never was. It should have been 100 percent. How dare you? That guy should have like an evil mustache and like, went Moo-haha as he took her money away.
