The problems down there are a mess. Inflation's going to reach 10 million percent this year, according to the International Monetary Fund. Food is scarce to get. In fact, it's so hard to get food and supplies of food just for the people of Venezuela to eat and feed their families, the average Venezuelan has lost 24 pounds since when Nicolas Maduro, the president, took office. And the two men that are going to be targeted by President Trump -- and he should be walking out to the stage here any minute now -- are going to be President Nicolas Maduro, as well as opposition leader Juan Guaido. Guaido is whom John Bolton, the national security adviser, just in a speech here, earlier referred to him as the president of Venezuela. This is who the White House recognizes as the legitimate president. They say Maduro is the dictator, a kleptocrat, and needs to step down from power. All of these things will be hammered by the president to a very supportive crowd here today. Got a little applause going on, but still no president just yet. Also, Rubio, Senator Rubio's, went to Colombia with Congressman Mario Diaz- Balart over the weekend. They were in Colombia at the border with Venezuela at one of these bridges where Venezuelans have been carrying all they can carry out on their back and leaving the country. Three million people have left Venezuela in the last couple of years.  Rubio and Diaz-Balart were there with some humanitarian aid shipments, which they say are having difficulty getting into Venezuela because the Venezuelan Maduro regime and military are so far not letting it in -- Charles.",

You have Brazil also assembling a collection of aid. And also that's important. I think one thing Trump is doing here is reinforcing how isolated Maduro is. This isn't just the gringos coming in and telling South Americans what to do. Quite the contrary. This is South Americans saying they want Maduro to go.  And who's on our side?

They're all working to help the people of Venezuela. But, yes, this is a very stark reminder of what socialism can and always does lead to. You have three million people who have left Venezuela.

To the first point there on the 25th Amendment, Andrew McCabe insisted he wasn't involved in any extended conversations regarding a 25th Amendment removal of the president, but he does say that Rod Rosenstein talked to him about it and that Rosenstein appeared to him to be serious about it.  Listen to what McCabe said on \"60 Minutes.\""

It's not about President Trump. It's about the presidency. I mean, it's unthinkable that a small number of people were -- started a counterintelligence investigation which actually the first premise of that was that the president, President Trump, was an agent of Putin. I mean, if that were the case, what is this, \"Manchurian Candidate\"? I mean, they would have gone to the Joint Chiefs. They would have gone to the congressional leadership. I mean, this is just plain scary. I mean, there has to be a predicate, there has to be a procedure. And to go into the issue of wearing a wire, if -- first of all, I don't buy that it's a joke. The deputy attorney general doesn't joke about something like that. And McCabe looked into the camera and he said that Rosenstein said that I will wear a wire. They don't search me when I go into the White House. Well, my God, I mean, you can't make something like that up. And going in because they don't search him is breaching the security, is breaching the trust of the White House. And, I mean, I know what it takes to wear a wire. I have been a prosecutor for a long time. I have been a defense lawyer for a long time. You need a predicate. It's got to be more than, hey, my God, my boss was fired, meaning the firing of Comey, which the president had a right to do. Charles, just let me say, the president's not above the law.

And it was really intended for if a president becomes totally disabled and can't perform his duties. So I don't want to overstate and use hyperbole, but what was this? Was this some kind of a coup? I mean, in this case, President Trump is absolutely right. And let me say one other thing. This was reported in The New York Times about six months ago, and just now it's getting legs. And I have got to get President Trump credit, because I don't know why he didn't fire Rod Rosenstein, because how -- having nothing to do with the Russia investigation -- how can you have a deputy attorney general who is talking about wearing a wire in the Oval Office, even if he's joking?

The problems down there are a mess. Inflation's going to reach 10 million percent this year, according to the International Monetary Fund. Food is scarce to get. In fact, it's so hard to get food and supplies of food just for the people of Venezuela to eat and feed their families, the average Venezuelan has lost 24 pounds since when Nicolas Maduro, the president, took office. And the two men that are going to be targeted by President Trump -- and he should be walking out to the stage here any minute now -- are going to be President Nicolas Maduro, as well as opposition leader Juan Guaido. Guaido is whom John Bolton, the national security adviser, just in a speech here, earlier referred to him as the president of Venezuela. This is who the White House recognizes as the legitimate president. They say Maduro is the dictator, a kleptocrat, and needs to step down from power. All of these things will be hammered by the president to a very supportive crowd here today. Got a little applause going on, but still no president just yet. Also, Rubio, Senator Rubio's, went to Colombia with Congressman Mario Diaz- Balart over the weekend. They were in Colombia at the border with Venezuela at one of these bridges where Venezuelans have been carrying all they can carry out on their back and leaving the country. Three million people have left Venezuela in the last couple of years.  Rubio and Diaz-Balart were there with some humanitarian aid shipments, which they say are having difficulty getting into Venezuela because the Venezuelan Maduro regime and military are so far not letting it in -- Charles."

So if you look at the assembly of aid packages, a large amount of aid coming together in Colombia, near the Venezuelan border, Maduro in the past has stopped this, despite the fact that his people are starving and in bad need of medicine. You have Brazil also assembling a collection of aid. And also that's important. I think one thing Trump is doing here is reinforcing how isolated Maduro is. This isn't just the gringos coming in and telling South Americans what to do. Quite the contrary. This is South Americans saying they want Maduro to go.  And who's on our side? Everyone pretty much is on our side, all of the heavyweights in South America. And this is the product of Trump foreign policy."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAYNE",
      "utterance": "Yes. And at least 50 countries have recognized Guaido, but here's the problem though, Christian. I mean, you talk about these crises. And we know, in these socialist countries, it's always the elites who are -- who are isolated, right? So while ultimately it may force their hand, initially, it makes a desperate situation for the regular Venezuelan even more desperate, doesn't it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WHITON",
      "utterance": "It does, although, again, Maduro has really done that all by himself. It's not any sort of withholding of U.S. support or economics.  It's that country, which has tremendous oil wealth and could easily be the most wealthy country, both net and per capita, in South America who has been pushed through 20 years of socialism, although it's gotten a lot worse lately, to that. So there's always a question if U.S. sanctions and U.S. pressures will actually hurt a freedom movement. But if you talk to people in those movements -- and there are -- cases of this go back to solidarity in Poland at the end of the Cold War -- they always want a lot of outside attention.  And even if they don't love the United States, although many people down there do, even if they don't, they want us to do what we're doing, which is put the spotlight on the dictator."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAYNE",
      "utterance": "Right. You mentioned the police and the military. I remember when Chavez was in charge, routinely, he would raise the pay of the military, perhaps -- perhaps seeing one day where this moment would come, where paying off the military and the police to a degree would be -- would be necessary. Of course, Maduro picked up on that practice. There have been many times when he's elevated their pay substantially, where they live very well.  They haven't lost 24 pounds in the last year. So where's the breaking point for the military? Where's the breaking point for the police? How do we negotiate that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WHITON",
      "utterance": "Well, it is important to signal that people in the military and the police who have not been, say, leaders of atrocities that the average rank and file who are just following orders will not be displaced in a new government. A huge problem, very different situation, but if you look at Iraq, where we dismissed the entire Iraqi military, that was a huge mistake."

      "utterance": "Yes, Colin Powell mentioned that as being one of the biggest mistakes that we made over there. Real quick, finally, Christian, I do want to ask, if all else fails, how far do we go with respect to the use of force?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WHITON",
      "utterance": "You know, I don't think it'll come down to the need for the U.S. to go in. To the extent Maduro conducts extremely -- does very bad things or threatens our national security, it remains an option. I think it's good the president hasn't taken off the table. But these regimes always look very tough and very solid until they're not. And then if you look at long history of regimes like this that have been swept into history's ash heap, I think the people will get it. Again, the combination of U.S. support, international support, everyone coming together, Florida's two senators doing a great job down there themselves and back in Washington, so I think it'll happen without the need for any of U.S. military action."

This as Stockton, California, is rolling out a new program to provide basic income for everyone. Here now to discuss, FOX News political analyst Gianno Caldwell, Democratic strategist Antjuan Seawright, and Washington Examiner senior editor Kelly Jane Torrance. Kelly Jane, let me start with you. It's sort of, the world now knows what's going on in Venezuela. It was -- it had the opportunity to be among the wealthiest countries in the world.  They squandered it, as they have gone down this path of socialism. And now this could be the endgame for all to see."

      "speaker": "KELLY JANE TORRANCE, THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER",
      "utterance": "Yes, Charles, it's a very dramatic few weeks we have had in Venezuela. And it will continue to be. I mean, you had Marco Rubio, the senator, on the border with Colombia over the weekend, showing the humanitarian aid that America and other countries are trying to get in to help the starving people of Venezuela. And I know a lot of critics of the president like to say he doesn't care about people outside America's borders. Well, he certainly does, and I think he is going to be showing that in his speech today. He also, of course, is going to be showing that he's not isolated from the international community. They're all working to help the people of Venezuela. But, yes, this is a very stark reminder of what socialism can and always does lead to. You have three million people who have left Venezuela. The people are starving. You have Democratic economists here saying, we can pay for the Green New Deal by just printing money. Well, Venezuela has a 130 percent million percent inflation. I think we can see where that leads to."

      "speaker": "PAYNE",

It's been tried all over the world. And yet it's being used again to -- they say to fight poverty."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GIANNO CALDWELL, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST",
      "utterance": "Yes, you know what, Charles?  I grew up in poverty. I understand it very well. And having been in a family where we depended on welfare programs for essentially everything, I think welfare is a good thing for a temporary measure to lift you out of poverty. But the truth of the matter is, any government that can give you everything can also take it away. And with the facts being that there's over 80-plus welfare programs throughout this country -- that's just for the federal level -- we have the support that we need to lift ourselves out. But there has to be conditions around it. That's why I have an issue with any particular town that is just looking at give money away without some restrictions. People should be like the '96 welfare reform. They should have to work. They should have to go to school."

      "speaker": "PAYNE",
      "utterance": "Yes, Antjuan, this same program was tried in Finland over a two- year period with a lot more people, over 100,000 people. They spent $23 million. The initial results have not been that great. They say they will keep examining, if they really changed anyone's lives.  In the meantime, they are -- they're going to do something where people can get help, but they have to show that they're learning a skill, that they're trying to work, something more akin to maybe work welfare that Bill Clinton brought in. What are your thoughts on your party lurching towards this idea that some equate to socialism?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ANTJUAN SEAWRIGHT, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST",
      "utterance": "Well, I don't know if this is the sentiment or the feelings of the entire party. Look, I'm a small business owner myself. Like Gianno, my family depended on government programs. I'm a beneficiary of some of them. And so I understand the importance of having a bootstrap program, but I also understand the importance of being able to do it on your own and work hard and at least try to find your way. And so while I may not agree with some of the policy positions with those of my party, at the end of the day, I don't think we should brand the Democratic Party as a whole because of the ideas of a few or the thoughts of a few."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAYNE",
      "utterance": "Well, we will see that hashed out, right, between now and 2020. But it is interesting, Antjuan, that a lot of the leading -- the announced so far Democratic candidates have been OK with a lot of these ideas, and they say they're on board with them."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SEAWRIGHT",
      "utterance": "Well, I think what you heard from a lot of the candidates is, you heard framework or positions to talk from. And you know as well as I know, on the campaign trail, how you campaign and how you govern, Charles, is totally different. And I think that if we don't have some of these goal, policy discussions of trying to fix health care, trying to fix education, trying to deal with infrastructure, trying to deal with the problems of our day, then we will never have a starting place to start from. And so when you hear the candidates talk about or take policy positions, I haven't heard much drilled-down detail. I have heard 90,000-foot thoughts.  And I don't think anything's wrong with that. We see that in on both sides of the aisle."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAYNE",
      "utterance": "You know, Kelly Jane, it is interesting that these ideas are being presented as a solution to problems where it feels like we have solutions. In other words, in four of the last five months, we have seen non- supervisory wages not just outpace supervisor wages, but grow more than 3 percent. That hasn't happened in well over a decade -- 7.3 million job openings in America, 300,000 jobs created in the last month. This -- so the promises that we're hearing from these programs are actually happening in real time. And yet there's a major, major attraction to these to these ideas."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TORRANCE",
      "utterance": "Yes, I have to say the idea that it's good to have these big ideas, maybe, maybe not. I mean, what if those ideas are encouraging people in the idea that you can get something for free, which I think is all of these things that have come? We heard about Medicare for all. We're hearing about the Green New Deal. And people aren't talking about how we're going to pay for them. And, of course, it goes beyond paying for those programs directly. You're talking about how great the economy is, Charles. Well, that is going to change if these big idea policies get in, because it's going to affect regulation, it's going to affect economic growth. And I think it could create far more problems than they aim to solve. And you're right. I mean, what are the problems that they're aiming to solve?  I think, in some ways, these are just sort of pie-in-the-sky ideas without real details and real money attached to them."
    },

    {
      "speaker": "PAYNE",
      "utterance": "They may be pie-in-the-sky, but, Gianno, there's a Fox News poll, 57 percent of Americans have a favorable opinion of capitalism, 59 percent have an unfavorable opinion of socialism. But when you drill down and ask, how has capitalism changed your lives, there's still almost 50 percent of Americans, well over 40 percent, who still aren't sure it's helping them specifically."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CALDWELL",
      "utterance": "And they may not know the real definition the capitalism. To Antjuan's point from earlier, he said we can't allow the voices of a few to really brand the Democratic Party. And where he's coming from is place of being a moderate Democrat. At least, that's what I believe. The truth of the matter is, the moderates don't really have a voice anymore. It's the extreme liberal left..."

      "speaker": "CALDWELL",
      "utterance": "They really don't. It's the extreme liberal left. It's the AOCs of the world and the Bernie Sanders that are creating this framework in which you referred to earlier. And this is what we're discussing now. So, with that being the case, that's why it's going to be so difficult for folks to run to the left, all the way to the left in the primary, and try to come back to the middle in the general, because they continue to control the conversation, the AOCs of the world."

In the meantime, he also -- President Trump will focus on the dangers of socialism. We are -- we see it firsthand in our neighbor to the south.  And yet it's remarkable how popular it's becoming in this country, particularly amongst young people and young voters in this country.

And then we get a system comes in where cronies and corruption take all of the goods, take all of the money, and leave the majority of the people dirt poor, and, as we have seen, in desperate situation right now.
