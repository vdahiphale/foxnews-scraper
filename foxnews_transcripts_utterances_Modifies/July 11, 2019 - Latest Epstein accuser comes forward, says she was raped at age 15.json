But interestingly, the attorney general this week left an opening for the former special counsel. Saying, if he doesn't choose to appear, the DOJ will back him up on that choice. And now, Democrats are battling over who will get to speak at the hearing for how long each will get to speak and they're reportedly watching old Mueller testimony.

That's pretty much something that we see consistently frankly on their side of the aisle, a lack of a willingness to recognize what the nation went through, the worst attack in our history, and the fact that we put the Department of Homeland Security together to help ensure the security of the homeland.

Well, hey, you're not going to learn anything new next Wednesday anyway. One of the -- one of the House members you've just played a clip from, I can't help but that's one of the most ludicrous arguments I've ever heard. There are 435 members of the House. 90 percent of whom are not on Intel or Judiciary. They're not going to be able to ask any questions on Mueller. So, the fact that you've been elected to the House does not mean you get to question Bob Mueller. And don't even mean you get to be on the Judiciary Committee or the Intel Committee."

I think as my fellow South Carolinians who vote in the Democratic primary get to know Senator Harris and Senator Warren and Tulsi Gabbard and others. His numbers will come down, but look, people like him. I'm not going to vote for him but people like him. And likability still matters in politics. You put your finger on it, you have to do well with communities of color and the Democrat primary in South Carolina. But he was the vice president to the most popular politician of color the country has ever known, in Barack Obama. And you better believe he will remind people of that.

You have a situation where you've got this very radical wing of the House Democrats and the Speaker has attempted many times to try to sort of keep everybody under control by -- in the past moving very far left and you see now that that's not working for her. But what you do have is a situation where the Democratic Party both here in the House, as well as the candidates that they've put up for president, has become a party of socialists. They become a party they're advocating this far left set of positions. And you know, I think on some level Speaker Pelosi knows that those are not positions that the vast majority of the American people agree with. She knows that the vast majority of American people do not want to give free government-provided health care to all illegal immigrants. But we know that is what the Democrats in the House, many of them want to do. We know it's where the Democratic presidential candidates want to do. And so she's in a very difficult situation but she's dealing with a situation where they've just -- she's being dragged, the whole party is being dragged very far to the radical left fringe."

And here is Representative Jayapal who backs Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. She says we women of color have faced this for such a long time. We're in a body of mainly old white men, you don't get to be here without having dealt with that most people. What do you make of that?"

We all have the responsibility to debate based on standing up for facts. And I think that falling back into identity politics too often is an excuse for not standing up for facts and substance. On the Republican side, you will see us make sure and I can tell you this is the Republican Conference chair, someone who's responsible for a large part of our messaging that we're going to be having these debates based on substance. We know that the American people do not want this to be a socialist nation. The problem on the Democratic side is a lot of them do want it to be a socialist nation. They don't understand fundamentally that when you give government the amount of power they want to give the federal government, you're taking people's freedom away. We won't let that happen on our side of the aisle."

She obviously believes that they have had policies that she finds very disturbing in terms of the way that families are being treated on the border. They have pushed back strongly on that notion in terms of how they're doing their job down there. But she then said that she thought that the creation of DHS in the early 2000s, and she doesn't mention 9/11 when she talks about this, but she says that it was an egregious mistake on the part of the Bush administration. What's your response to that?"

They have hugely important cybersecurity responsibilities, intelligence security responsibilities, the Coast Guard, the Secret Service, FEMA, all of those are part of the Department of Homeland Security and part of the hugely important mission that department has, and the hundreds of thousands of professionals who staff that department. I did note that when Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez talked about its creation, she failed to mention 9/11. That's pretty much something that we see consistently frankly on their side of the aisle, a lack of a willingness to recognize what the nation went through, the worst attack in our history, and the fact that we put the Department of Homeland Security together to help ensure the security of the homeland. It was one thing when they were out there saying they were going to abolish ICE. That in and of itself is absurd and irresponsible enough. But now for congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez who frankly seems to be emerging is one of the intellectual leaders of their party in the House and I think that tells you that it's a pretty low bar, but that she has been in a situation where she's now saying we should just abolish DHS.

You know, to summon the courage to put yourself in front of cameras and tell a story like that, it is an unbelievable thing. And you know, she is emotionally exhausted from it but she is mostly really proud of herself and really, really thankful that she had the courage to do it because she's now sees herself as a role model for others. Not just other Epstein victims, which is important, but just victims of child sex abuse, generally. So, it's been freeing for her in that respect to come forward and tell a story."

She dropped out of the school that she loved, which was a performing arts school, but it was too close to his house so she removed yourself from the situation. Here she is talking about the part that I find almost as appalling in all of this. These women who recruited these young girls. Watch this."

I mean, she knows generally that the recruiter was in her early 20's, brunette, that's her memory. Remember, you know, when you -- to follow up with what you just said, we all know that Mr. Epstein is an evil guy, right, we can all agree on that. But there were a network of adults around Mr. Epstein that enabled this from the very powerful, who were able to, because of their political connections and money, were able to protect him. But from the not so powerful. The secretaries, the recruiters, the people in his life that knew full well what was going on and they facilitated this abuse. So, while it's clear that Mr. Epstein needs to be held responsible, there's culpability for all of those around him as well."

I mean, you know, there's this our civil (Ph) litigation, and part of our civil (Ph) litigation is to attempt to identify some of these individuals by name and we intend to hold them accountable civilly, as best we can. There is obviously the Southern District of New York criminal prosecution, I'm sure they are looking to identify these individuals as well. But, you know, that's the -- you know, that's what we have to look at as a community. You know, guys like this are able to do what they do because there is a community around them that are -- that is facilitating this kind of abuse. And so, you know, that's the story that still needs to be told, and I hope that Jennifer's case, the accompanied criminal cases are able to tell that story because they need to be held accountable as well."

In San Francisco, it is up to 17 percent. These images are from Los Angeles, and the San Francisco numbers since 2017 up 17 percent. Here now is an exclusive on “The Story,” is Housing and Urban Development Secretary, Ben Carson, who has today been touring local programs across the country as the Trump administration works to end homelessness in America. Great to have you with us, Secretary Carson this evening. Tell us what you've seen --"

      "speaker": "CARSON",
      "utterance": "Well, I actually saw some very positive things on the street today. I was in Salt Lake City at Welfare Square, which is something that is sponsored by the Mormon Church and they provide all kinds of wraparound services to help people to be able to accelerate and to be successful. Clothing, food, job opportunities, all those kinds of things. The kinds of things that we really should be concentrating on. But you know, when we get to this issue of homelessness, where we are seeing the most homelessness are in places that have the most regulation. You know, as a physician, I like to go directly to the source of the problem and not just treat the symptoms. A lot of the things that we complain about are the symptoms, but what is the root cause? And the places where we see the most homelessness have the largest numbers of regulatory barriers, zoning restrictions and things like that. Now the good thing is that a lot of places are willing to recognize that and to start working towards solutions."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

    {
      "speaker": "CARSON",
      "utterance": "You know, Seattle for instance, has instituted a block program where they put in tiny houses. Mayor Garcetti has recently relax the restrictions on accessory dwelling. But you know, these are small steps but they are beginning at least to recognize what the problem is."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Right. You know, why do you, what's the reason, I think a lot of people say the economy is doing so well, unemployment is so low, and the overall homeless numbers in the country over the last several years are fairly -- are fairly static. But these certain cities are seeing this tremendous increase in the number of people who are sleeping on their streets. So why is that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARSON",
      "utterance": "Yes. Well, recognize that the zoning restrictions, for instance, in Los Angeles, 80 percent of the land is zoned for single-family housing, and then you throw on top of that the other regulatory barriers, the latest of which is they have to have solar panels. You take something that was affordable and you quickly translate it into something it isn't. When we're talking about single-family new construct, we are talking about 25 to 27 percent increase in the cost. For multifamily you're talking 32.1 percent up to 42 percent in the more expensive areas. Those are things that elevate things completely out of the range of a lot of people. And it's not that we don't have innovation going on in this country, we do. A few weeks ago, on the National Mall, we had many people come in and demonstrate what they are capable of doing in terms of manufactured housing, modular housing, 3D print housing --"

      "utterance": "-- tiny houses."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "-- a good step in the right direction. Before I let you go, what is your understanding of what causes homelessness? You know, what is it that is putting most of these individuals on the street? Is it mental health? Is it drug addiction? Is it, you know, inability to pay their bills? What is driving it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARSON",
      "utterance": "Well, bear in mind that there are a lot of places for people to go who are homeless. We have a tremendous amount of sympathy for them and shelters are available for most people. But there are a lot of people who are suspicious, who don't trust anybody, who have mental health issues, and in some cases, who are not willing to move, you know, from an area that would not be friendly to them in terms of employment. To a place that would be. So, all -- but, here's the key thing. This is a solvable problem. You know, there are cities that are bigger than any city that we have like Tokyo where there is no homelessness. You know, we have to start using much more intelligent strategies and that's exactly what we are trying to do right now."

      "utterance": "Breaking right now, we've got a hurricane warning that has been issued for parts of Louisiana. It's tropical storm Barry threatens the Gulf Coast tonight. Fox News chief meteorologist Rick Reichmuth tracking it for us. Rick, thanks for being here tonight. What are you seeing in all of that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RICK REICHMUTH, METEOROLOGIST",
      "utterance": "You bet. It's such an interesting storm for us. Each tropical system kind of has its own thing that we watch. It's when, obviously, the hurricane warnings are in place, that's interesting and important. But the bigger context for what's going on, you see all that red there, that's the Mississippi River watershed. Any piece of -- any drop of water that falls anywhere in that area, if doesn't evaporate or gets absorbed into the ground eventually exits the Mississippi River right down at the mouth right by Louisiana. Because of that, we have seen record-breaking rain all across that area. We've been talking about flooding for months and months and all that water is still in the Mississippi River. So, the Mississippi River level is at about 16 feet at New Orleans and the level -- the levees are only 20 feet. So, you only about four feet of space of water to go in and we're talking about maybe a three to four feet storm surge there and a lot of water that's going to fall in rain. So, we're not probably talking about a big wind event that we're going to deal with, we are going to talk about a major flooding event from all the rain that we are going to get over the next days, Martha."
