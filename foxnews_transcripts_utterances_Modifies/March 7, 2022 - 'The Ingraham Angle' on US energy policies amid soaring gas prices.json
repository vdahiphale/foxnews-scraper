So, energy prices skyrocketing, experts warning that prices at the grocery store. Have you seen this are only going to keep going up and up? Wheat has hit an all-time high. You see the wheat Futures this morning, that was shocking. And with Russia's role as a major supplier of fertilizer mean everything that grows is going to get more expensive. The administration's reaction to all of this isn't to stop and have at least an honest conversation about the repercussions of all this, but rather to draw us perilously close to conflict. Now yesterday on Face The Nation, our Secretary of State Anthony Blinken revealed the dangerous path we're now on.",

Throughout this night, we have heard significant artillery fire and shells landing closer with inside the city limits. This is important because we've seen the destruction across the rest of this country.   In Chernihiv, in Kharkiv, the second largest city in Ukraine, apartment buildings and residential areas just totally destroyed by these Russian shells and the air campaign that is moving forward as this invasion continues. These are not military targets. These are civilian areas, and they continue to be hit today. You talk about Irpin, just outside of the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv. This is a location we were out on Saturday, and we watched as thousands of people fled this area as Russian forces tried to work their way closer to the capital. While on Sunday, a Russian shell slammed into the pavement, instantly killing four civilians who were just trying to get out of the line of fire. We went back to the city today and the mood was quite tense. There was mortar rounds, mortar rounds coming in around the soldiers, sniper fire in the distance as people tried to get away. And there were far fewer people because there's a real fear after seeing those images. The civilians worry it could be their family next. And still today we heard Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy doubling down saying the people have to come together and he is willing to stay here and fight back against the Russians take a listen to what he had to say.",

There was a third round of peace talks taking place today between the Russians and the Ukrainians. But the reality is the Russians keep saying they aren't going to hit civilians.

We also offered inspection of our ballistic missile defenses, Aegis Ashore in Romania, to verify for the Russians that those are not offensive, but just defensive system. So, I think the United States has done what it can to meet the Russians halfway, but they're just basic red lines that we were unprepared to cross.  And in the end, I think looking back in retrospect, at least over the past several months, the coup de gras probably came in December, when the president in front of rolling cameras on the South Lawn announced that American ground troops would not be heading to Ukraine, that may be a sensible policy, we can debate it, but why on earth we would let Vladimir Putin inside of our calculations is beyond me, he hasn't telegraphed his next moves to us. So, for us doing that to him, I think was a major mistake. And that was the last in a series of mistakes over the past year that like Putin to take this gamble and move into Ukraine.",

      "sentences": "Well, I would say this, Putin constructed his military operation under a faulty political assumptions. He thought that Zelenskyy would prove feckless and weak, and that the Ukrainian people would essentially content themselves with new Russian overlords. And so, he launched an unprotected, quick dash to Kyiv. It proved not to work, Zelenskyy fought back, the Ukrainian people stood up to the Russian attack. And so now I think he's switching gears to a broader, more deadly combined arms military operation. And he's surrounding Kyiv, he's surrounding other cities as your correspondent just noted.  He may attempt to break up through encirclement, the Ukrainian army, but how to rule over rubble after that, I think is a big conundrum. Because the Ukrainian people have shown they're likely to move into an insurgency phase at that point, Putin could attempt to negotiate away his military gains once he has achieved them. But even there, it's hard for me to imagine the Ukrainian government in exile, agreeing to core Russian demands like recognition of those independent republics in the Donbass or the annexation of Crimea.  So, we're likely to move to one of two scenarios either Putin bleeds into this insurgency. Ukraine is essentially leveled and Russia suffers for years as the West supports a fledgling insurgency, or he loudly proclaims victory but silently concedes defeat and moves off of his maximalist gains. But for that to take place, I think we have some time to go because the Ukrainians are feeling rather bullish right now. And the Russians, of course still have a quantitatively, qualitatively superior military and they want to make their military news before they move to any political negotiations.",

And today, the AP revealed that the Biden administration has been considering for some time, easing tough oil sanctions on Venezuela.   Joining me now is Ryan Zinke, former Trump Interior Secretary, former SEAL Team Six Commander and Alaska Senator Dan Sullivan, who sits on the Congress Armed Services Committee.

Biden should have insisted on a realistic assessment of the situation in Ukraine. Instead, his team kept open the prospect of NATO membership for Ukraine, which Putin said he was never going to accept. In retrospect, that was likely a huge, huge, huge mistake. Now, of course, Putin didn't attack Ukraine under Trump, because he knew that America was stronger and more practical under his leadership. Trump was a pro-energy nationalist who wasn't about to get rolled into supporting Russia's natural gas pipeline into Europe. And from day one though, the White House Pelosi, Schumer, they've worked overtime to turn back every policy of Trump's predecessor, Biden's predecessor that worked actually to make America stronger and more powerful here and in Europe. Now, Americans are made to pay a price for Biden's madness. A year ago, who could have imagined $7 a gallon gasoline prices, not even I. As for the media who seemed relieved to be able to change the subject. They don't like the devastation in Ukraine. Of course, they don't. But they also don't seem bothered at all that Americans are hurting in profound ways. Think about how miserable, miserable the White House press corps was, let's say and I don't know kind of the end of 2019. What was happening then? Well, that's when we had energy independence. That's when we had low inflation, rising wages, even for blue collar workers. We also had record low unemployment. We had good trade deals, and we had no new wars. It didn't matter that investor and consumer confidence was at an all-time high, or that optimism was robust all the way around. In fact, that annoyed our media so much.

And if he thinks his 10 minutes of discussing the tragedy in Ukraine is going to help them. He's just wrong again. People will continue to be killed in Ukraine, and it is horrific. But our elites keep pushing the lie that people in Ukraine and here are somehow protected by the rules based international order that's somehow going to fix things. We'd have to go back to that. That is wrong. Under Trump, they were protected by the USA. But once we became too weak under Biden to protect anyone. Well, things started to collapse abroad. When China berated Blinken remember that and Alaska and trashed America that showed us what they were trying to do, it was ugly. And my prediction is Biden will continue to be humiliated by China. As for those who say, talking about China is a dodge, saw that today? Well, it's the only way to realistically assess though, isn't it what's happening in Ukraine because China is a major check on our ability to affect the situation. every bad thing that is happening is only happening now because our elites at some point in time thought it was OK to make China the most powerful country in the world. So now, here we are, it's back to the 1970s. The U.S. is weakened under Biden, we're humiliated by a smaller power, like Russia, we're divided at home, we're burdened with horrific inflation and economic problems. It's all self-inflicted by a White House and a political establishment that has failed the people who pay the bills. They've done it far too many times. But what the Left will not admit yet is that Ukraine shows us in graphic, gory, tragic detail how globalization ultimately fails. Because the elites thought that somehow we could curtail evil with all in again, the international norms, the new global order, the global reset, whatever you want to call it. That wasn't just idealistic. It was dangerous, and it was stupid. The only thing that has kept bad actors in check was an America that was economically strong and culturally cohesive. When we lose, not just one but both of those things, we're not going to just see suffering abroad, we're going to endure plenty of our own here.  The only good news is that elections are now less than eight months away. And that's the angle.

Now, all of Ukraine was under the Moscow Patriarch until 2019, when an ecumenical patriarch said you can be free of him. They created Ukrainian churches, 700 parishes. Guess what our State Department a permitted? They thanked and congratulated the Ukrainian church from splitting off, for basically engaging in schism in the mind of the Russians.

In Chernihiv, in Kharkiv, the second largest city in Ukraine, apartment buildings and residential areas just totally destroyed by these Russian shells and the air campaign that is moving forward as this invasion continues. These are not military targets. These are civilian areas, and they continue to be hit today. You talk about Irpin, just outside of the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv. This is a location we were out on Saturday, and we watched as thousands of people fled this area as Russian forces tried to work their way closer to the capital. While on Sunday, a Russian shell slammed into the pavement, instantly killing four civilians who were just trying to get out of the line of fire. We went back to the city today and the mood was quite tense. There was mortar rounds, mortar rounds coming in around the soldiers, sniper fire in the distance as people tried to get away. And there were far fewer people because there's a real fear after seeing those images. The civilians worry it could be their family next. And still today we heard Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy doubling down saying the people have to come together and he is willing to stay here and fight back against the Russians take a listen to what he had to say."

There was a third round of peace talks taking place today between the Russians and the Ukrainians. But the reality is the Russians keep saying they aren't going to hit civilians. They say they will respect these humanitarian corridors, and then they hit them. So that's the situation for the civilians on the ground here in Ukraine. No place is safe.

Last June, he published an essay called the historical unity of the Ukrainian and Russian peoples. He began with Belarus, and now he's moved on to Ukraine, and I suspect this is where his big battle is to try to unite the Slavic peoples as he sees it, underneath the Russian rule."

      "utterance": "Well, I will say that the Biden administration bent over backwards as they wanted to do to try to offer Vladimir Putin an off ramp, there was a negotiating document leaked to Alpes, a Spanish newspaper that included an American offered to the Russians that we would not put offensive weapon systems into Ukraine. We also offered inspection of our ballistic missile defenses, Aegis Ashore in Romania, to verify for the Russians that those are not offensive, but just defensive system. So, I think the United States has done what it can to meet the Russians halfway, but they're just basic red lines that we were unprepared to cross. And in the end, I think looking back in retrospect, at least over the past several months, the coup de gras probably came in December, when the president in front of rolling cameras on the South Lawn announced that American ground troops would not be heading to Ukraine, that may be a sensible policy, we can debate it, but why on earth we would let Vladimir Putin inside of our calculations is beyond me, he hasn't telegraphed his next moves to us. So, for us doing that to him, I think was a major mistake. And that was the last in a series of mistakes over the past year that like Putin to take this gamble and move into Ukraine."

      "utterance": "Well, I would say this, Putin constructed his military operation under a faulty political assumptions. He thought that Zelenskyy would prove feckless and weak, and that the Ukrainian people would essentially content themselves with new Russian overlords. And so, he launched an unprotected, quick dash to Kyiv. It proved not to work, Zelenskyy fought back, the Ukrainian people stood up to the Russian attack. And so now I think he's switching gears to a broader, more deadly combined arms military operation. And he's surrounding Kyiv, he's surrounding other cities as your correspondent just noted. He may attempt to break up through encirclement, the Ukrainian army, but how to rule over rubble after that, I think is a big conundrum. Because the Ukrainian people have shown they're likely to move into an insurgency phase at that point, Putin could attempt to negotiate away his military gains once he has achieved them. But even there, it's hard for me to imagine the Ukrainian government in exile, agreeing to core Russian demands like recognition of those independent republics in the Donbass or the annexation of Crimea. So, we're likely to move to one of two scenarios either Putin bleeds into this insurgency. Ukraine is essentially leveled and Russia suffers for years as the West supports a fledgling insurgency, or he loudly proclaims victory but silently concedes defeat and moves off of his maximalist gains. But for that to take place, I think we have some time to go because the Ukrainians are feeling rather bullish right now. And the Russians, of course still have a quantitatively, qualitatively superior military and they want to make their military news before they move to any political negotiations."

And today, the AP revealed that the Biden administration has been considering for some time, easing tough oil sanctions on Venezuela. Joining me now is Ryan Zinke, former Trump Interior Secretary, former SEAL Team Six Commander and Alaska Senator Dan Sullivan, who sits on the Congress Armed Services Committee.

I was home in Alaska this week and met with some great energy workers, met with our patriotic Ukrainian American community. There's a feeling that people are being insulted, insulted, they asked me - all these groups asked me why on earth would our own federal government try to shut down the production of energy in Alaska and now are going around the world hat in hand to dictators to buy more oil from them, whether the Iranians, whether the Saudis, whether Venezuela, who by the way, are going to use that money to take action, negative action against Americans, it is an insult in its national security suicide to boot and the American people certainly in my state are recognizing it."

These weapons seem to be preventing Russian forces from taking over the capital in the past 12 days since this invasion began.

Instead, his team kept open the prospect of NATO membership for Ukraine, which Putin said he was never going to accept. In retrospect, that was likely a huge, huge, huge mistake. Now, of course, Putin didn't attack Ukraine under Trump, because he knew that America was stronger and more practical under his leadership. Trump was a pro-energy nationalist who wasn't about to get rolled into supporting Russia's natural gas pipeline into Europe. And from day one though, the White House Pelosi, Schumer, they've worked overtime to turn back every policy of Trump's predecessor, Biden's predecessor that worked actually to make America stronger and more powerful here and in Europe. Now, Americans are made to pay a price for Biden's madness. A year ago, who could have imagined $7 a gallon gasoline prices, not even I. As for the media who seemed relieved to be able to change the subject. They don't like the devastation in Ukraine. Of course, they don't. But they also don't seem bothered at all that Americans are hurting in profound ways. Think about how miserable, miserable the White House press corps was, let's say and I don't know kind of the end of 2019. What was happening then? Well, that's when we had energy independence. That's when we had low inflation, rising wages, even for blue collar workers. We also had record low unemployment. We had good trade deals, and we had no new wars.

And if he thinks his 10 minutes of discussing the tragedy in Ukraine is going to help them. He's just wrong again. People will continue to be killed in Ukraine, and it is horrific. But our elites keep pushing the lie that people in Ukraine and here are somehow protected by the rules based international order that's somehow going to fix things. We'd have to go back to that. That is wrong. Under Trump, they were protected by the USA. But once we became too weak under Biden to protect anyone. Well, things started to collapse abroad. When China berated Blinken remember that and Alaska and trashed America that showed us what they were trying to do, it was ugly. And my prediction is Biden will continue to be humiliated by China. As for those who say, talking about China is a dodge, saw that today? Well, it's the only way to realistically assess though, isn't it what's happening in Ukraine because China is a major check on our ability to affect the situation. every bad thing that is happening is only happening now because our elites at some point in time thought it was OK to make China the most powerful country in the world. So now, here we are, it's back to the 1970s. The U.S. is weakened under Biden, we're humiliated by a smaller power, like Russia, we're divided at home, we're burdened with horrific inflation and economic problems. It's all self-inflicted by a White House and a political establishment that has failed the people who pay the bills. They've done it far too many times. But what the Left will not admit yet is that Ukraine shows us in graphic, gory, tragic detail how globalization ultimately fails. Because the elites thought that somehow we could curtail evil with all in again, the international norms, the new global order, the global reset, whatever you want to call it. That wasn't just idealistic. It was dangerous, and it was stupid. The only thing that has kept bad actors in check was an America that was economically strong and culturally cohesive.

It's also coming out of the Ukrainian side. \"The New York Times\" recently ran an article basically almost admiringly noting that fact and mythmaking are kind of joining hands in the Ukraine narrative. And it's all most like \"The Times\" was admiring the way in which all kinds of lives are being put out by the Ukrainian government and being transmitted by intelligence officials in this country, and then promulgated by the media.

Then there's the feverish reporting that Netflix is suspending service in Russia as a protest -- ooh. The truth is they had to, Laura. The credit card companies that collect their subscription base, they'd already pulled out of the country. And they have probably 100,000 to 1 million customers, so I doubt if the Russians care.

I'm going to take it back to the vision of Putin on the Patriarch Kirill of Moscow. They share one mind that anyone who is ordained -- not ordained -- baptized in the Russian Orthodox Church is de facto a Russian citizen. And the land they stand on is sacred Russian soil. Now, all of Ukraine was under the Moscow Patriarch until 2019, when an ecumenical patriarch said you can be free of him. They created Ukrainian churches, 700 parishes. Guess what our State Department a permitted? They thanked and congratulated the Ukrainian church from splitting off, for basically engaging in schism in the mind of the Russians. Putin and Kirill now have a religious imperative because they feel they have to save the Russian Orthodoxy from the encroachment of the west. And that's what they see happening in Ukraine, a decadent west moving in on what they consider the center of Christianity."

He said I would -- in a world without truth, freedom loses its foundation, and man is exposed to the violence of passion and manipulation. That's what we are seeing here. And if the west -- if America and Europe doesn't recapture that truth and its own faith, it will be powerless to fight this evil distortion of faith coming from Putin on the Russian patriarch.
