I know that he does have staff. I mean, there's no question about that. But for me, I would like to just say -- see Joe Biden come out and speak to it and not engage in what looks like hiding behind the camera because he's just doing a video and throwing the video out there.   You know, to me, the difficulty for Joe Biden is that it opens the door to the Anita Hill question and how he handled Anita Hill. It opens the door to conversations about criminal justice reform that makes him out to be a guy who's just out of touch with the times. And I think that's coming from the left wing of the Democratic Party. But I don't think it's disqualifying which is what Nancy Pelosi, the speaker, said. It's not disqualifying. But at this point, you know, you just feel for Joe. I don't think President Trump's comments in which he said welcome to -- you know, how do you like your life now, Joe? Because I think Trump wants to -- and some Republicans, unfortunately, joining him in this, make this out like this is what happened to President Trump. President Trump grabbing women is assault.

That's a result of childish denial that will make you say anything other than the truth, stuff that borders on the obscene. The border crisis is a long-term problem that makes problem solvers in the short term look like the bad guys. You're the parent threatening to take away the kids avocados. Meanwhile, the Dems and media don't know what a crisis is actually is. They're like a sailor saying his leaking boat works great until it's in the water. That's how they see the border. It works just fine, until someone is crossing it. Now you have thousands crossing daily and the media reverts to its usual amnesia. It's a crisis again, everyone.",

And I think Dana has made the point that he doesn't have a campaign, so he doesn't have a campaign apparatus, a communications shop, a spokesman who could be helping him here. I know that he does have staff. I mean, there's no question about that. But for me, I would like to just say -- see Joe Biden come out and speak to it and not engage in what looks like hiding behind the camera because he's just doing a video and throwing the video out there. You know, to me, the difficulty for Joe Biden is that it opens the door to the Anita Hill question and how he handled Anita Hill. It opens the door to conversations about criminal justice reform that makes him out to be a guy who's just out of touch with the times. And I think that's coming from the left wing of the Democratic Party. But I don't think it's disqualifying which is what Nancy Pelosi, the speaker, said. It's not disqualifying. But at this point, you know, you just feel for Joe. I don't think President Trump's comments in which he said welcome to -- you know, how do you like your life now, Joe? Because I think Trump wants to -- and some Republicans, unfortunately, joining him in this, make this out like this is what happened to President Trump. President Trump grabbing women is assault. What Joe Biden did is just, at best, inappropriate, had nothing to do with sex."

But this is also a known quantity and the president is absolutely right. It's just interesting that some of Joe's foes are playing the touching card this early. You know, obviously, trying to keep him out so he can't land those big- money donors early on because he is at the head of the pack right now. He's the biggest threat not only to the other people in the race but to the progressive people in the race and what they stand for.

But there's been other - - no other like big news that has come out. The big news that people that support Joe Biden are waiting for -- or even people waiting to run against him is his big announcement. So I think the video thing today, maybe that helps put it to bed a little bit. But see -- I also -- absolutely think this is calculated and coordinated because what's the headline this morning, two more women came out. And then tomorrow would be two more. This is what they did to President Trump, and I can see why he was like, well, you know, how you like it now?"

Maybe there's other reasons for that, name idea, etcetera. But he hasn't taken that many wax. We'll see what this -- what else does this done.

But the Democrats shouldn't be trying to destroy him either simply because he's in the way. They're willing to destroy kind of a lasting memory of who this person is because they just don't want this old white guy around anymore. And they're willing push him aside when he was out -- this was all known. Didn't that matter now, now it matters now. So for me, he shouldn't be doing it but it would be nice for this attack not to work because to your point it's definitely being run by a pro. This drip, drip, drip, who's next? It's got that media matters feel to it where it might be a conjoined orchestration between like the Sanders' group and media matters because it's such a calculated take-out. And it's a point where, like, both parties could unite and say do you think maybe it's time to stop this crap? That we're just -- we're just basically ruining people's lives over politics. Meanwhile, you look over at Virginia, you still have -- you know, we still didn't know who was in blackface. The governor is still there. There's some sexual assault claims that are pretty disturbing. That -- where the Democrats priorities on that? So it's definitely politically calculated, motivated, and maybe --"

The border crisis is a long-term problem that makes problem solvers in the short term look like the bad guys. You're the parent threatening to take away the kids avocados.

So what do they do? They rush for the exits, just like if you are in a concert hall and it catches on fire, you're going to have a stampede and people are going to get hurt.

You want to know why the populist fever in the country isn't breaking, it's because people that are really wealthy continue to do stuff like that that hurt people who actually need extra time on tests or a dog to take them on a plane so that they can get through the experience."

His parents couldn't afford a $20,000 wheelchair. Insurance wouldn't pay for it. So, his dad asked students at his former high school for help and using a power wheels writing toy bicycle parts and advice from the University of Delaware, they built that chariot in just a few weeks.
