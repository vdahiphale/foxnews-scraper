That statement says, in part: \"If we identify an issue that affects safety, the FAA will take immediate and appropriate action.\"  The Boeing 737 MAX 8 is a new design, with bigger, more fuel-efficient engines that previous 737s. Those engines necessitated a redesign of the plane's trim control system. And when you turn the trim control off in the plane, two switches right by your thigh, and you power the plane up, it causes a different reaction than in earlier models the 737.",

Radar data shows that the Ethiopian Air MAX 8 first climbed rapidly, then descended rapidly, continuing its wild oscillations up and down, until it plummeted into the ground, killing everybody on board. In the earlier October 2018 crash of a Lion Air MAX 8 into the Java Sea, there were similar kinds of oscillations. But, in that case, the plane had maintenance issues with gauges that monitor angle of attack, airspeed and altitude.  In yesterday's crash, the plane had no maintenance issues. While Ethiopian, Cayman Airways and also the entire country of China has grounded all MAX 8 flights, neither Boeing and, as you just heard, neither the FAA has done so.",

As you report, Boeing did issue a statement. They say, so far, they don't see any reason there needs to be any change. I will read the statement, just so you have it and you know. \"The investigation,\" says Boeing, \"is in its early stages, but at this point, based on the information available, we do not have any basis to issue new guidance to the operators.\" So that means no groundings.   But China and Indonesia have gone ahead to ground that aircraft. India has issued a directive which says, you must be an experienced pilot if you want to fly that new 737 MAX. You have to have at least 1,000 hours behind the controls of the previous incarnation of the 737. Cayman Airways, Ethiopian Airlines, and Comair, the South African air carrier, have all grounded the flight. Lots of aircraft in the pipeline.  Lots of these aircraft in the pipeline, 5,000-plus orders out there now, and the company has only fulfilled about 350 of these. And specific to the U.S., you wonder why we're out here at Midway Airport.  It's because Southwest flies here. And Southwest is the biggest customer for this aircraft in the world. Southwest has ordered 280 of these, Charles.   They have gotten delivery on about 30 or a few more than 30 perhaps by now, since we have the last numbers. United has also ordered over 100 of these aircraft, as American. So those are continuing to fly. At this point, until we get that airworthiness directive, nothing to change that.

The other big thing is the Pentagon budget going up to $750 billion and the fact that about $165 billion of that will be in what's called the Overseas Contingency Operations Fund, which really is kind of an off-the-books kind of thing that's not subject to spending caps. And there are a lot of people who are worried that the Pentagon -- or the White House, rather, may use some of that money in the OCO budget to backfill money that's being used from the military budget to build a border barrier.

But I think a detriment in something that we're seeing is this budget isn't going to be balanced for 15 years, they're saying. The first budget put forth by the president was 10 years. And, of course, remember on the 2016 campaign trail the president said that he would eliminate the deficit over eight years. And, clearly, this plan isn't doing that.

Radar data shows that the Ethiopian Air MAX 8 first climbed rapidly, then descended rapidly, continuing its wild oscillations up and down, until it plummeted into the ground, killing everybody on board. In the earlier October 2018 crash of a Lion Air MAX 8 into the Java Sea, there were similar kinds of oscillations. But, in that case, the plane had maintenance issues with gauges that monitor angle of attack, airspeed and altitude. In yesterday's crash, the plane had no maintenance issues. While Ethiopian, Cayman Airways and also the entire country of China has grounded all MAX 8 flights, neither Boeing and, as you just heard, neither the FAA has done so."

I tend to be -- I'm a pilot, so I always want to know what happened first.  And I know that's what my friends that the NTSB and the FAA are doing.  From a passenger side, I absolutely understand why people might be concerned. But we just don't know enough to make that decision yet. We hope we will.  But we just don't. And, again, I think the FAA just telling everybody that, look, we're watching this as close as everybody else, as soon as we see anything that looks like it's a problem, they probably will ground these airplanes. But we just don't know yet."

    {
      "speaker": "PAYNE",
      "utterance": "Well, most experts are saying the plane itself is structurally sufficient. It's a great airplane. Many have zeroed in on potential -- the potential problem being the software that sort of fights the pilot and wants to descend when the pilot wants to go up. If you just listened to Doug McKelway, it climbed rapidly, this plane, and then it descended rapidly. And then you had these crazy oscillations, the same sort of narrative that we heard with the Lion Air flight. What should Boeing be doing, what should the FAA be going to convince the American public, the global public, that the software is not interfering with the pilot?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MARK",
      "utterance": "Well, of course, that's an issue for Boeing, in terms of figuring out the software issues. We really haven't heard much out of them since the Lion Air accident. I know there's something about to be released. But, also, pilots are very well-trained. And the story of what happened, what they believe happened in the Lion Air accident, which is that the trim kind of got away from the -- got out of sync with the autopilot, is easy to turn off. And everybody that flies a 73 right now knows, if that happens, that's the first thing I'm going to do is reach over and turn off those switches to deactivate that system. But, again, we don't know that this is not something completely unrelated to that just happens to look similar."

But we have got this airworthiness directive coming up at 5:00 p.m. And my experience with airworthiness directives is generally they are issued with regard to some problem with an aircraft that needs to be corrected, so all eyes on that at 5:00 p.m. We will see where that goes. As you report, Boeing did issue a statement. They say, so far, they don't see any reason there needs to be any change. I will read the statement, just so you have it and you know. \"The investigation,\" says Boeing, \"is in its early stages, but at this point, based on the information available, we do not have any basis to issue new guidance to the operators.\" So that means no groundings. But China and Indonesia have gone ahead to ground that aircraft. India has issued a directive which says, you must be an experienced pilot if you want to fly that new 737 MAX. You have to have at least 1,000 hours behind the controls of the previous incarnation of the 737. Cayman Airways, Ethiopian Airlines, and Comair, the South African air carrier, have all grounded the flight. Lots of aircraft in the pipeline.  Lots of these aircraft in the pipeline, 5,000-plus orders out there now, and the company has only fulfilled about 350 of these. And specific to the U.S., you wonder why we're out here at Midway Airport.  It's because Southwest flies here. And Southwest is the biggest customer for this aircraft in the world. Southwest has ordered 280 of these, Charles. They have gotten delivery on about 30 or a few more than 30 perhaps by now, since we have the last numbers. United has also ordered over 100 of these aircraft, as American. So those are continuing to fly. At this point, until we get that airworthiness directive, nothing to change that.

That money would complete about 722 miles of wall, in addition to the 400 miles of fencing that the president wants to put in with his current budget request and his emergency declaration. The other big thing is the Pentagon budget going up to $750 billion and the fact that about $165 billion of that will be in what's called the Overseas Contingency Operations Fund, which really is kind of an off-the-books kind of thing that's not subject to spending caps.

And once again, President Trump is shown how little he values the health and well-being of families across America.\" The president does plan on cutting $2.7 trillion in spending over 10 years, and $1.9 trillion of that will come out of mandatory spending, like Medicaid and Medicare. But Russell Vought insists it's not going to be cuts to Medicare and Medicaid, it will be savings. And he also said that there will be a new work component for people using federal services. Listen here."

What we are doing is putting forward reforms that lower drug prices, that because Medicare pays a very large share of drug prices in this country, has the impact of finding savings. In terms of what requirements, it is something that we have long viewed as important to be able to say. Take the same principles of reducing dependency that we saw in TANF and then apply them to housing and to food stamps and to Medicaid."

So the question is, how will this all play out? Let's ask Campus Reform editor in chief Lawrence Jones, Democratic strategist Rashad Richey, and Axios White House reporter Alayna Treene. Let me start with you on this, Alayna. This -- obviously, this is sort of a -- this is a big budget, $4.7 trillion. There is a big ask for the border wall. We know there's going to be some political friction there. So what do you make of the plan itself?"

      "speaker": "ALAYNA TREENE, AXIOS",
      "utterance": "Well, the thing I think to keep in mind is that these budgets put forth by the White House are always kind of more symbolic measures. This is dead on arrival, as some democrats had said over the weekend before the document was even released. And so Congress is the one who sets the spending levels, but it does show the White House's priorities for 2020. And I think that a big thing here, we saw massive increases to defense spending, which will play really well with the president's base and something that he's always been touting that he's wanted to see increases in defense spending. But I think a detriment in something that we're seeing is this budget isn't going to be balanced for 15 years, they're saying. The first budget put forth by the president was 10 years. And, of course, remember on the 2016 campaign trail the president said that he would eliminate the deficit over eight years. And, clearly, this plan isn't doing that. It's actually adding a trillion dollars over the next four years. And so I think that's going to be a big thing that Democrats hone in on, at least from a messaging perspective."

And that is simply something that should be corrected for context's sake.  But let's go beyond that to the actual policy that has been presented by the president of the United States. We're talking about a welfare-to-work program. This is a refurbished premise, based on the 1996 plan borrowed from Bill Clinton, a Democratic president.

I tried to watch him with an open mind. I came into this with -- I was a Watergate prosecutor. And I remember John Dean. And John Dean's testimony took down a president. But, boy, was it different. I mean, remember John dean himself was secretly recorded. Michael Cohen, as a lawyer, selectively recorded his own client. I mean, imagine that.  But so I start off with an open mind. And Michael Cohen begins his testimony by name-calling. He calls the president names. Now, anybody who prepares a witness knows that, if you really have something of substance, don't go to name-calling. Just get right down to it and be dispassionate. And he came across as somebody who had an agenda, who was bitter. He went from darkness to light, blind loyalty. Well, the -- he didn't have a cooperation agreement with the Southern District. And the Southern District in their sentencing memo said he just cooperated -- he did this belatedly and he profited to a great deal. But what did he lie about? Or whether or not it's perjury remains to be seen. He misled the Congress. What did he lie about? What did he mislead the Congress about? Number one, give me a break. He didn't want a job in the White House. I mean, that is easily proven. But, more importantly, when he said, clearly, he used the word I never requested, nor would I accept a pardon. Well, never means never. And despite the fact that Lanny Davis tried to do some damage control, where are we? What is the meaning of is? What does is mean? I mean, he wanted a pardon. What's he going to do if he gets a pardon? He is going to say return to sender, I would rather go to jail for three years? I mean, he downright lied. So there goes the value of his testimony.

Unfortunately, elements of the military, the police still seem to be on his side. But there are some indications that that facade is cracking too, with some defectors. And, importantly, you have the Oba -- excuse me -- the Trump administration, the State Department and others, signaling that there will be off-ramps, that, in other words, for people who do defect from Maduro and come over to the right side will be treated well."

And it's -- I think while it's good that the administration has said everything is on the table, it's extremely unlikely that we would do a Panama-style invasion, as we did in 1989, in Venezuela, the logistics very big. But also this is not an interventionist regime. If American citizens were being killed or put in danger at the embassy, something like that, I think you would see things change rapidly. But, really, it would be much better and it seems likely that this regime will go on its own. And that will be -- not to make light of the tremendous privation suffering that's been caused by this regime, but there was the political upside of having the Venezuelan people take control of their own destiny and putting an end to this pink wave that swept Latin America of socialism beginning with Hugo Chavez being elected in 1998 in Venezuela.

Did but just put it out to everybody, or did you put it out to a discrete group of your friends? And can the government become one of your friends?  I say that in quotes. Remember what Ronald Reagan said, the nine most dangerous words in the English language are, I'm from the government and I'm here to help you. Can the government become one of your friends without knowing about it?  Answer, not constitutionally. It does need some suspicion in order to start looking at these things. It can't randomly go through social media. So it could call you in to see if you still appear disabled. And if you -- if you don't come into those meetings, then it can say, ah, something's wrong here, we got to do a little investigation.

But libel plaintiffs very, very rarely prevail, because the libel laws are written, because of the First Amendment, to make it very difficult to interfere with the media's coverage of a public event. The purpose of libel laws is to repair a damaged public reputation. As a matter of law, a 16-year-old child has no public reputation to damage. I will also tell you that the rigors to the plaintiff, here the 16-year-old boy, of libel litigation is so severe, so extreme, I would encourage his parents to think twice about it. Now, where's the $250 million come from? If you ask the jury for money, and it's less than you told the defendant you were going to ask for, you're going to get the lesser of the two.

Siraj, let me ask you about this, because today The Washington Post, the magazine, just releasing an interview with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on the issue of impeaching President Trump where Pelosi is quoted as saying that \"He's just not worth it.\" She does go on to say that appeasement would be too divisive. Again, you have got the younger folks in that party who want impeachment.  She's saying it could -- it could actually hurt the Democrats."

    {
      "speaker": "HASHMI",
      "utterance": "I mean, this is one thing that Speaker Pelosi is probably right on this, that it is more divisive to impeach the president for something that is not bipartisan, because, of course, the Senate is controlled by Mitch Mitch McConnell and the Republicans. They have a 53-vote majority right now. And it is not looking good if they even try to go for impeachment, because it just looks like they still haven't gotten over those wounds from 2016."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HASHMI",
      "utterance": "That's a good question, because AOC does have a lot of -- a lot of power in the Democratic Party. And we have even editorialized that she's becoming kind of like the de facto speaker of the House. But I will say that she doesn't have the gavel. So she -- she might be able to change sentiment, but she's not going to be able to change votes or even bring a vote to the floor."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAYNE",
      "utterance": "A House rules committee meeting moments from now to discuss a resolution that would make special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia report public when it's released. Some Republicans signaling -- signaling, though, that that may not happen.  Should it? Let's ask former federal prosecutor Katie Cherkasky. Katie, should the public get a chance to see this report?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KATIE CHERKASKY, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR",
      "utterance": "Well, the Democrats better really hope that the Mueller report contains something juicy on President Trump, for all the efforts they're exerting into making this report public. And, really, what it comes down to is whether there's going to be a recommendation for an indictment. And that's Department of Justice policy.  Obviously, there have been deviations from that in the past. James Comey released a report on Hillary Clinton to a great extent when there was no indictment, but the policy still remains in place. If there's not a recommendation for indictment, then the policy is that it shouldn't be released. There shouldn't be that information given out about citizens that are not being charged criminally, even including the president."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAYNE",
      "utterance": "Now, the political calculus, of course, from the Republican side is, if it's not released, and there's nothing, essentially that Robert Mueller has come up with a dry whole vis-a-vis Russia collusion, then it might make sense for the Republicans to let the public see this, rather than waiting for innuendo, leaks and other -- sort of to let the media set a narrative that maybe there's still something explosive in that report."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHERKASKY",
      "utterance": "Right. And I think that's a reasonable strategy. And I think that is something that it can be done, because, as I mentioned, it is policy of the Department of Justice to not release these reports, but they're not prohibited from doing that, releasing some or all of the report, depending on how much is sensitive information. Congress can subpoena the report to go through as well to determine if there's a basis for impeachment proceedings and things along those lines.  So there could be a strategic angle for the Republicans to do that. And perhaps it will turn out that President Trump himself would want the report released if there isn't that indictment that comes out of it. So, only time will tell. But as -- right now, it seems a little premature for the Democrats to be pushing so hard to release a report that they really have no idea what's in it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAYNE",
      "utterance": "Yes. And, of course, this House resolution, we're not sure what's going to come of that. I do want you to listen to California Democrat and House Intel Chairman Adam Schiff over the weekend on this Mueller report."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REP. ADAM SCHIFF, D-CALIF.",
      "utterance": "I think it is a mistake. And I have said all along that I don't think Bob Mueller should rely on written answers. When you get written answers from a witness, it's really the lawyers' answers, as much as the client's answer. I also think that the special counsel feels some time pressure to conclude his work, and knowing that the White House would drag out a fight over the subpoena, that may be an issue as well."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAYNE",
      "utterance": "Katie, after two years of building up Mueller's bona fides, his ability to get to the -- to the bottom of everything -- they have built Robert Mueller up -- it seems to me they're now questioning the legitimacy of the report before it is even released."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHERKASKY",
      "utterance": "That's exactly what my thought was when I heard that. It seems like some sort of preemption, just in case the report doesn't contain what they want on President Trump, that there's not good enough answers, because he wasn't forced to testify in person, which he -- there's no obligation or even way for Mueller to force the president to do that. In fact, the receipt of the written answers was something that shows that President Trump was being cooperative. He's the subject of a criminal investigation. He didn't have to provide any of that at all. So this just seems like some sort of preemption of, if it doesn't have what we want, it's because the investment wasn't thorough."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAYNE",
      "utterance": "And then, of course, the idea of let's let the House take care of this, they will do a better job, again, despite the fact that we were promised by Democrats that Robert Mueller was going to do an amazing job, and we'd be shocked at what we discovered."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHERKASKY",
      "utterance": "Right. And so I think the writing might be on the wall. We have seen the indictments that have come out of the Mueller probe at this point, and perhaps they're not pointing in the direction that had originally been hoped by some, that there's no collusion, there's no evidence of collusion, it's coming closer and closer to that conclusion. And so I think now there has to be a point where you try to undermine it before you look like a fool."
