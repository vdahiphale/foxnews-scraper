      "sentences": "All right. Tucker. Thank you. And welcome to \"Hannity.\" Breaking news tonight. A major morning news shakeup, show shakeup at NBC. Long-time \"Today\" anchor Matt Lauer is abruptly fired over an allegation of sexual misconduct.  Plus Variety and the New York Times are both out with explosive new reports where multiple women are now accusing Lauer of sexual misconduct. The details are beyond disturbing. We'll tell you about them.  And former NPR radio host Garrison Keillor, Prairie Home Companion and his relationship with Minnesota public radio is now terminated over accusations of inappropriate behavior. These are just the latest misconduct claims that are rocking the liberal media and the political establishment.  And also tonight, a brand new scandals swirling around one of the most prominent Democrats in Congress and the President today delivers a powerful message on the need for massive tax cuts and reform to boost the economy while you have arrogant, lazy, obstructionist Democrats Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi doing everything they can do to stop this from happening. Now, this all comes as Senate Republicans are now finally moving towards a vote on this tax bill. And the best cry baby story of all time. We will tell you about CNN and the White House. That's coming up. Also tonight, I have a very personal decision to make and I will need your help. That's coming up at the end of the broadcast. We hope you will stick around.  But first tonight's important breaking news opening monologue. All right. Long time \"Today\" show host Matt Lauer has been fired over what the network says is alleged inappropriate sexual behavior. According to NBC, the sexual misconduct allegation was made against Lauer on Monday and it involved accusations during the 2014 Winter Olympics that would continue in the office.  Now tonight, Page Six of The New York Post is reporting that NBC staffers including a young intern are now accusing Lauer of texting them lewd pictures and graphic messages. Now a source told The New York Post that one of the photos is so damning that NBC was forced to act immediately. And if that's not shocking enough, Variety is out with a bombshell report tonight where multiple women are accusing Lauer of sexual harassment. We have to warn you the details are very disturbing.   Now, according to Variety, Lauer allegedly gave a female co-worker a sex toy as a present and included a very graphic note about how he wanted to use it on her. And it gets worse. A different female employee told Variety that Lauer called her into his office and then dropped his pants. He exposed himself. And when the accuser refused his advances, he then yelled at her. And Variety is also reporting that Lauer allegedly would play games where he would tell colleagues which \"Today\" show co-host he would like to sleep with. And by the way, it's not all, it gets worse too. Two women accusing Lauer of sexual harassment also told Variety that he had a secluded office that included a button under the desk that he used to lock the door that gave him privacy to pursue these women. And finally according to Variety, several women say they told NBC management about what was going on with Lauer but they never did anything to stop it. And the Daily Beast is reporting that NBC says current management was never made aware of any harassment allegations.   Also the New York Times reporting tonight that NBC is receiving two new complaints against Matt Lauer. A former female NBC employee told the New York Times that in 2001, Lauer called her into his office and then allegedly had sex with her. And according to The Times, the woman says she felt helpless about what happened and didn't want to speak out for fear of losing her job. Now, we did reach out to Matt Lauer's agent for a comment earlier today. We have not heard back. And also tonight, it's the Christmas tree lighting in New York City. It happened an hour ago. And according to Page Six, New York Post, NBC tried to edit Lauer out of its coverage. Now while these allegations against Matt Lauer may be shocking to you watching at home of course, according to reports Lauer's alleged behavior was an open secret.  There is also a disturbing video that has now surfaced. TMZ obtained a video from 2006 where Lauer appears to be making a lewd comment to one of his female co-hosts. Take a look at it.",

Now, Keillor was fired by Minnesota Public Radio after two staffers made complaints against him and Keillor responded to one of the accusations by telling the Minneapolis Star Tribune, quote, \"I put my hand on a woman's bare back. I meant to pat her back after she told me about her unhappiness and her shirt was open and my hand went up at about six inches. She recoiled. I apologized. I sent her an email of apology later. And she replied that she said had forgiven me and not to think about it. We were friends. We continued to be friendly right up until her lawyer called.\" And finally tonight, the Detroit News is reporting that several members of the Congressional Black Caucus are now urging Democratic Congressman John Conyers to resign following sexual misconduct allegations from three women. Now Conyers' lawyers also refuting a report that the congressman will not seek re-election. The attorney told Fox News that congressman in this case Conyers will continue to serve as in the mindset to fight all these allegations.   Now, we will have more on that bombshell and more about Matt Lauer's firing in just a moment. In other news tonight though, first, our other top story as the president is pressing hard for his massive Reaganesque tax cut and tax reform.

We're also going to eliminate tax breaks and complex loopholes taken advantage of by the wealthy. Who are they? I don't know.  I think my accountants are going crazy right now. It's all right. Hey, look, I'm president. I don't care.  As Hillary said, what difference does it make? It made a difference.   It made a big difference. These massive tax cuts will be rocket fuel.  Little rocket man. Rocket fuel for the American economy. The tax cut will mean more companies moving to America staying in America and hiring American workers right here. So that's so important. Right? This week hopefully the Senate can join the House and take that strong stand for middle class families and for business and for jobs and for competition and for bringing money back. Together, we will give the American people a big, beautiful Christmas present.",

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "sentences": "All right. Now, what the president is doing is simple, he is following the model of President John F. Kennedy and President Ronald Reagan. Kennedy cut taxes, the economy soared. More revenue into the federal government. They love that they love to spend. And Ronald Reagan took up the idea and took it even further. Remember, he slashed the top marginal rate from 70 to 28 percent. Guess what happened? Twenty one million new jobs created after the recessions of the early 1980s. GDP growth peeked at 7.3 percent, 1984. Can you imagine that? Revenues to the government doubled. Longest period of peace time economic growth in history up to that point. This is not rocket science when taxpayers keep more of their hard-earned money, your money, the economy grows, jobs are created, the forgotten men and women get helped out. Now the president is now building on the ideas of Kennedy and Reagan. He wants to cut taxes across the board. He also wants a dramatic corporate tax cuts so we are competitive again. And right now American corporations, they face the highest marginal rate among modern economies in the world. Well, President Trump wants to chop it almost in half to 20 percent and also let multinational corporations repatriate trillions of dollars they hold overseas that they can now bring back at low rate to invest in, let's see, factories and manufacturing centers and give American workers a much-needed raise.  Now, the president's tax cut plan is all about the forgotten men and women. What this election was about. We have already seen record-setting economic response just to the Trump presidency. Look at the stock market, another record today. Third quarter GDP today was revised upward from three to 3.3 percent. By the way, Barack Obama never had a single year in his presidency of three percent GDP growth. Not one. Not one of his eight years. And in October, just 261,000 jobs were created alone, this past month. Unemployment is now at a 17-year low. Consumer confidence a 17-year high. Median existing home prices for all housing types in October 2017 up 8.7 percent from January of 2017. The economy is beginning to boom. Massive tax cuts is only going to make it better, creating jobs, manufacturing centers and of course factories for people that need these jobs. Getting them off of food stamps and getting it back into the workplace and out of poverty. That's what the President was talking about today. That's what Republicans in the House tried to pass. Democrats, they want nothing to do with jump starting this economy. They are doing everything possible to stop it. By the way, don't they care at all about helping the millions of forgotten men and women in this country? By the way, the kill the bill Democrats are deploying the same tired old tactics, class warfare, trying to divide the country. Liberals would rather, what, the economy tank even further because that helps them politically? Playing politics? What about the people of this country? We should put them first.   Now, here's a perfect example from the media. The New York Times, my favorite paper, they take the best pictures of me. They are now using the power of their newspaper, why? To crush the tax bill. Look at the tweet this morning from the New York Times editorial board, tweeting out there to people to urge the Senate to reject the tax bill that is literally, they're saying, hurts the middle class and the nation's fiscal health. Excuse me, the tax bill, the tax policies of Obama that they supported eight years were a disaster. Thirteen million more Americans on food stamps. Eight million more on poverty. Now, that's how the so-called paper of record really feels about the men and women in this country? And since the New York Times is issuing what amounts to a call for action to kill this one bill that will help economic growth, well, we want to issue you our own challenge directly to you, the American people. Lower taxes, tax reform, that's what the president ran on. It's part of the agenda so many of you deplorables like me voted for. If you want lower taxes, you want money in the bank, you want higher wages, you want jobs created, you want people out of poverty and off of food stamps, now is the time to call your senators. And it's up to Republicans to finally get their job done in the U.S. Senate and keep at least one big promise. And earlier today the Senate GOP thankfully, well they voted to begin debate on this tax bill. A huge moment, a huge opportunity. Republicans hopefully will now begin the process of keeping their word. It's time to put up, shut up. And if wishy washy never Trumpers establishment Republicans, if they fail to deliver on this simple principle in this tax bill, they should all resign and get out of the way, because they have been complete and total failures up to this point, betraying you, the American people. All right, now back to our top story. Matt Lauer fired NBC News.  Here with reaction, Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi. From The Hollywood reporter, we have Marisa Guthrie and trial Attorney Rebecca Rose Woodland. Thanks to all of you. I don't even know where to begin. It's like more coming out by the minute about what has really been going on at NBC. And all of it is despicable.",

It's interesting because Democrats were pretty excited when they had Republicans on defense over the Roy Moore allegations now it may be boomeranging, because of the allegations against John Conyers and other Democrats. Specifically, our own Martha MacCallum tonight had a compelling interview with a new accuser against Democrat John Conyers. He has already stepped down as top Democrat on judiciary panel, because of allegations of sexual harassment. Well now the state newspaper in Columbia, South Carolina reporting on this new video of a very prominent Democrat, a leader in congress James Clyburn walking to the elevator with the chair of the congressional black caucus. And when they were asked, why has not Conyers resigned unlike other powerful men, who have been fired like Matt Lauer, Harvey Weinstein? Clyburn said who elected them as if there was a different standard for member of congress. Meanwhile Robert Draper of the \"New York Times\" magazine tweeting quoted also at this morning at this House Democrats Caucus. James Clyburn compared Conyers accusers to the child murderer Susan Mitt who initially claimed a black man had abducted her kids. Clyburn said, these are all white women who have made these charges against Conyers. Now I want to be clear that a Democratic aide is telling Fox tonight that Clyburn did not make that comparison to that racially charge murder case. And Clyburn himself, tweeting a short time ago, quote, this is inaccurate in many regards. That discussion had nothing to do with Conyers. But interesting, they are not shooting down the fact that Clyburn suggested lawmakers maybe should be treated differently. That is coming just days after the top House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi got in to hot water for calling Conyers an icon and raising doubts about his accusers. She has since back pedaled on that under fire as this new Conyers accusers come forward.",

Jennifer Flowers has been vindicated now. We saw his conduct with Monica Lewinski. A lot of lying went on. And I remember Lisa Myers said something.

And they were allowed to invite x number of people to the White House Christmas Party. A lot of times those were distributed to television and media executives and on air talent. What the White House did this year was really go through an arduous process of trying to make sure that the people who worked in the White House media corps, the technicians, the sound people, the lighting individuals, the people who go to the White House day in and day out to work on behalf of these media organizations without the glamour and glitz of being an executive or on air talent got invited and got to bring a spouse or a partner or a son or a daughter. And what CNN's decision to do make sure that these individuals, who really probably look forward to going can't go anymore. You have an organization like Politico that is out there surveying people on whether or not they will take a picture with the president.

Long-time \"Today\" anchor Matt Lauer is abruptly fired over an allegation of sexual misconduct. Plus Variety and the New York Times are both out with explosive new reports where multiple women are now accusing Lauer of sexual misconduct. The details are beyond disturbing. We'll tell you about them. And former NPR radio host Garrison Keillor, Prairie Home Companion and his relationship with Minnesota public radio is now terminated over accusations of inappropriate behavior. These are just the latest misconduct claims that are rocking the liberal media and the political establishment. And also tonight, a brand new scandals swirling around one of the most prominent Democrats in Congress and the President today delivers a powerful message on the need for massive tax cuts and reform to boost the economy while you have arrogant, lazy, obstructionist Democrats Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi doing everything they can do to stop this from happening. Now, this all comes as Senate Republicans are now finally moving towards a vote on this tax bill. And the best cry baby story of all time. We will tell you about CNN and the White House. That's coming up. Also tonight, I have a very personal decision to make and I will need your help. That's coming up at the end of the broadcast. We hope you will stick around. But first tonight's important breaking news opening monologue. All right. Long time \"Today\" show host Matt Lauer has been fired over what the network says is alleged inappropriate sexual behavior. According to NBC, the sexual misconduct allegation was made against Lauer on Monday and it involved accusations during the 2014 Winter Olympics that would continue in the office. Now tonight, Page Six of The New York Post is reporting that NBC staffers including a young intern are now accusing Lauer of texting them lewd pictures and graphic messages. Now a source told The New York Post that one of the photos is so damning that NBC was forced to act immediately. And if that's not shocking enough, Variety is out with a bombshell report tonight where multiple women are accusing Lauer of sexual harassment. We have to warn you the details are very disturbing. Now, according to Variety, Lauer allegedly gave a female co-worker a sex toy as a present and included a very graphic note about how he wanted to use it on her. And it gets worse. A different female employee told Variety that Lauer called her into his office and then dropped his pants. He exposed himself. And when the accuser refused his advances, he then yelled at her. And Variety is also reporting that Lauer allegedly would play games where he would tell colleagues which \"Today\" show co-host he would like to sleep with. And by the way, it's not all, it gets worse too. Two women accusing Lauer of sexual harassment also told Variety that he had a secluded office that included a button under the desk that he used to lock the door that gave him privacy to pursue these women. And finally according to Variety, several women say they told NBC management about what was going on with Lauer but they never did anything to stop it. And the Daily Beast is reporting that NBC says current management was never made aware of any harassment allegations. Also the New York Times reporting tonight that NBC is receiving two new complaints against Matt Lauer. A former female NBC employee told the New York Times that in 2001, Lauer called her into his office and then allegedly had sex with her. And according to The Times, the woman says she felt helpless about what happened and didn't want to speak out for fear of losing her job. Now, we did reach out to Matt Lauer's agent for a comment earlier today. We have not heard back. And also tonight, it's the Christmas tree lighting in New York City. It happened an hour ago. And according to Page Six, New York Post, NBC tried to edit Lauer out of its coverage. Now while these allegations against Matt Lauer may be shocking to you watching at home of course, according to reports Lauer's alleged behavior was an open secret. There is also a disturbing video that has now surfaced. TMZ obtained a video from 2006 where Lauer appears to be making a lewd comment to one of his female co-hosts. Take a look at it."

But he is not the only person who was one fired today over sexual harassment allegations. Former NPR radio talk show host Garrison Keillor, you may remember him, Prairie Home Companion, he is also facing sexual misconduct accusations tonight. Now, Keillor was fired by Minnesota Public Radio after two staffers made complaints against him and Keillor responded to one of the accusations by telling the Minneapolis Star Tribune, quote, \"I put my hand on a woman's bare back. I meant to pat her back after she told me about her unhappiness and her shirt was open and my hand went up at about six inches. She recoiled. I apologized. I sent her an email of apology later. And she replied that she said had forgiven me and not to think about it. We were friends. We continued to be friendly right up until her lawyer called.\" And finally tonight, the Detroit News is reporting that several members of the Congressional Black Caucus are now urging Democratic Congressman John Conyers to resign following sexual misconduct allegations from three women. Now Conyers' lawyers also refuting a report that the congressman will not seek re-election. The attorney told Fox News that congressman in this case Conyers will continue to serve as in the mindset to fight all these allegations. Now, we will have more on that bombshell and more about Matt Lauer's firing in just a moment. In other news tonight though, first, our other top story as the president is pressing hard for his massive Reaganesque tax cut and tax reform. Now, the president took his message directly to you, the American people, earlier today in an event in Missouri. Now, in case you didn't get to watch it, here are some of the highlights."

We're going to cut taxes on American businesses so they will compete for workers. They will raise salaries. The business is going to be happy and the workers are going to be happy and the country is going to be a happy place. We're also going to eliminate tax breaks and complex loopholes taken advantage of by the wealthy. Who are they? I don't know. I think my accountants are going crazy right now. It's all right. Hey, look, I'm president. I don't care. As Hillary said, what difference does it make? It made a difference. It made a big difference. These massive tax cuts will be rocket fuel. Little rocket man. Rocket fuel for the American economy. The tax cut will mean more companies moving to America staying in America and hiring American workers right here. So that's so important. Right? This week hopefully the Senate can join the House and take that strong stand for middle class families and for business and for jobs and for competition and for bringing money back. Together, we will give the American people a big, beautiful Christmas present."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "All right. Now, what the president is doing is simple, he is following the model of President John F. Kennedy and President Ronald Reagan. Kennedy cut taxes, the economy soared. More revenue into the federal government. They love that they love to spend. And Ronald Reagan took up the idea and took it even further. Remember, he slashed the top marginal rate from 70 to 28 percent. Guess what happened? Twenty one million new jobs created after the recessions of the early 1980s. GDP growth peeked at 7.3 percent, 1984. Can you imagine that? Revenues to the government doubled. Longest period of peace time economic growth in history up to that point. This is not rocket science when taxpayers keep more of their hard-earned money, your money, the economy grows, jobs are created, the forgotten men and women get helped out. Now the president is now building on the ideas of Kennedy and Reagan. He wants to cut taxes across the board. He also wants a dramatic corporate tax cuts so we are competitive again. And right now American corporations, they face the highest marginal rate among modern economies in the world. Well, President Trump wants to chop it almost in half to 20 percent and also let multinational corporations repatriate trillions of dollars they hold overseas that they can now bring back at low rate to invest in, let's see, factories and manufacturing centers and give American workers a much-needed raise. Now, the president's tax cut plan is all about the forgotten men and women. What this election was about. We have already seen record-setting economic response just to the Trump presidency. Look at the stock market, another record today. Third quarter GDP today was revised upward from three to 3.3 percent. By the way, Barack Obama never had a single year in his presidency of three percent GDP growth. Not one. Not one of his eight years. And in October, just 261,000 jobs were created alone, this past month. Unemployment is now at a 17-year low. Consumer confidence a 17-year high. Median existing home prices for all housing types in October 2017 up 8.7 percent from January of 2017. The economy is beginning to boom. Massive tax cuts is only going to make it better, creating jobs, manufacturing centers and of course factories for people that need these jobs. Getting them off of food stamps and getting it back into the workplace and out of poverty. That's what the President was talking about today. That's what Republicans in the House tried to pass. Democrats, they want nothing to do with jump starting this economy. They are doing everything possible to stop it. By the way, don't they care at all about helping the millions of forgotten men and women in this country? By the way, the kill the bill Democrats are deploying the same tired old tactics, class warfare, trying to divide the country. Liberals would rather, what, the economy tank even further because that helps them politically? Playing politics? What about the people of this country? We should put them first. Now, here's a perfect example from the media. The New York Times, my favorite paper, they take the best pictures of me. They are now using the power of their newspaper, why? To crush the tax bill. Look at the tweet this morning from the New York Times editorial board, tweeting out there to people to urge the Senate to reject the tax bill that is literally, they're saying, hurts the middle class and the nation's fiscal health. Excuse me, the tax bill, the tax policies of Obama that they supported eight years were a disaster. Thirteen million more Americans on food stamps. Eight million more on poverty. Now, that's how the so-called paper of record really feels about the men and women in this country? And since the New York Times is issuing what amounts to a call for action to kill this one bill that will help economic growth, well, we want to issue you our own challenge directly to you, the American people. Lower taxes, tax reform, that's what the president ran on. It's part of the agenda so many of you deplorables like me voted for. If you want lower taxes, you want money in the bank, you want higher wages, you want jobs created, you want people out of poverty and off of food stamps, now is the time to call your senators. And it's up to Republicans to finally get their job done in the U.S. Senate and keep at least one big promise. And earlier today the Senate GOP thankfully, well they voted to begin debate on this tax bill. A huge moment, a huge opportunity. Republicans hopefully will now begin the process of keeping their word. It's time to put up, shut up. And if wishy washy never Trumpers establishment Republicans, if they fail to deliver on this simple principle in this tax bill, they should all resign and get out of the way, because they have been complete and total failures up to this point, betraying you, the American people. All right, now back to our top story. Matt Lauer fired NBC News. Here with reaction, Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi. From The Hollywood reporter, we have Marisa Guthrie and trial Attorney Rebecca Rose Woodland. Thanks to all of you. I don't even know where to begin. It's like more coming out by the minute about what has really been going on at NBC. And all of it is despicable."

I expect they will release some sort of statement. But, yes, the entitlement of Matt Lauer, Charlie Rose, Harvey Weinstein and the fact that what all of these have in common is the behavior was an open secret. An open secret.

But, Sean, I think there are also maybe a lot of liability on the part of Andy Lack. I think he is going to have to have a lot of explaining to do. As a prosecutor, Sean, I always look at a time line. Look at the time line here. \"Variety\" and the \"New York Times\" have been investigating this, they said, for two months. So, that takes us back to September. Then on November 8th, NBC announces mysteriously that Matt Lauer is no longer going to the Olympics, it's going to be Megyn Kelly and congratulations to her for that. Then on November 27th, two days ago, Andy Lack says that that's the first time that they have heard about these allegations against Matt Lauer? So I think Andy Lack is going to have a lot of answers that he is going to have to be responding to his superiors and let me make myself clear, these women are heroes for coming forward."

And I think all women will for anyone who comes out around this country. Whether it's an icon in Hollywood or whether if someone huge in the media industry.

If that's true then their identity by law will be protected. No one can reveal their identity. And they deserve to be protected as victims of a sexual assault, if that is the case. But we do not know that yet. And, of course, anyone is innocent until proven guilty but you can't take it further unless women continue to come forward. So very important."

We already have a task force around Harvey Weinstein in New York, in California possibly. This task force will increase its scope for Matt Lauer, or whomever else at NBC may happen upon. There may be more here. You know, his booker was fired. Mr. Zimmerman was fired already for inappropriate sexual conduct. Now this is someone who was with Matt Lauer throughout the course of his time at NBC. I find that questionable. I find that odd that he was fired. Now Matt Lauer has been let go apparently. Only as a result of something NBC found out on Monday. I agree with Pam Bondi that that sounds questionable as well."

Zero tolerance for who? Apparently not for Democrats. It's a never ending sea of tolerance for Democrats. We got Al Franken, we got John Conyers. These are credible allegations. And one other thing on this Sean, this is what frustrates the heck out of me about Democrats. What's the standard for Republicans, allegations are made, just allegations. You are supposed to immediately resign if you are a Republican.

      "utterance": "Really remarkable comments tonight, Sean. It's interesting because Democrats were pretty excited when they had Republicans on defense over the Roy Moore allegations now it may be boomeranging, because of the allegations against John Conyers and other Democrats. Specifically, our own Martha MacCallum tonight had a compelling interview with a new accuser against Democrat John Conyers. He has already stepped down as top Democrat on judiciary panel, because of allegations of sexual harassment. Well now the state newspaper in Columbia, South Carolina reporting on this new video of a very prominent Democrat, a leader in congress James Clyburn walking to the elevator with the chair of the congressional black caucus. And when they were asked, why has not Conyers resigned unlike other powerful men, who have been fired like Matt Lauer, Harvey Weinstein? Clyburn said who elected them as if there was a different standard for member of congress. Meanwhile Robert Draper of the \"New York Times\" magazine tweeting quoted also at this morning at this House Democrats Caucus. James Clyburn compared Conyers accusers to the child murderer Susan Mitt who initially claimed a black man had abducted her kids. Clyburn said, these are all white women who have made these charges against Conyers. Now I want to be clear that a Democratic aide is telling Fox tonight that Clyburn did not make that comparison to that racially charge murder case. And Clyburn himself, tweeting a short time ago, quote, this is inaccurate in many regards. That discussion had nothing to do with Conyers. But interesting, they are not shooting down the fact that Clyburn suggested lawmakers maybe should be treated differently. That is coming just days after the top House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi got in to hot water for calling Conyers an icon and raising doubts about his accusers. She has since back pedaled on that under fire as this new Conyers accusers come forward."

Jennifer Flowers has been vindicated now. We saw his conduct with Monica Lewinski. A lot of lying went on. And I remember Lisa Myers said something.

And it was about two weeks later and Lisa called and she said well, they are still doing more investigating. Mr. Lack wants to have more investigating done. And it was disappointing to me, because I had just been gone through the ringer. Ok. She said well, there is a problem. There is good news and there is bad news. And I said yes? She said the good news is you're credible. And I said, what's the bad news? She said you are very credible. How do you take something like that?

All these years later, it is so important. 30 years later it is so important to revisit history if we are going to learn for our future generations of our daughters and of our sons, of our grandchildren. If we don't learn from Bill Clinton and what he did to these poor women, and the exercise of power and abuse of these women, how are we going to teach our sons how to behave appropriately?

I understand that Conyers has left the District of Columbia. He has flown back on Coach, by the way, to Michigan to his home state. But Al Franken seems to think, he just waits this storm out that it will all pass. But we haven't forgotten. I will not forget Kathleen won't forget. All of these women.

First lady and her team did a marvelous job decorating it the video is out there for all to see. What I think is interesting, Sean, and for people who don't understand, traditionally in the last several years from what I understand, invitations were given to bureaus. And they were allowed to invite x number of people to the White House Christmas Party. A lot of times those were distributed to television and media executives and on air talent. What the White House did this year was really go through an arduous process of trying to make sure that the people who worked in the White House media corps, the technicians, the sound people, the lighting individuals, the people who go to the White House day in and day out to work on behalf of these media organizations without the glamour and glitz of being an executive or on air talent got invited and got to bring a spouse or a partner or a son or a daughter. And what CNN's decision to do make sure that these individuals, who really probably look forward to going can't go anymore. You have an organization like Politico that is out there surveying people on whether or not they will take a picture with the president. Yet, some of that same organization has reporters asking the White House if they can get invited or bring a guest and so it is these media types, CNN and Politico that are doing a disservice to the gracious act that the President and the first lady have offered so many of these individuals. Not just the on air talent and the executives. Those technicians that really work hard and labor on behalf of those organizations to get the news and the broadcast out."
