Anthony Scaramucci, the president's new Communications Director gave a profanity-filled interview to the New Yorker Magazine unleashing attacks on two senior White House officials. He called White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus a \"expletive paranoid schizophrenic and a paranoiac\" and also used vulgar language to describe President Trump's chief strategist Steve Bannon.  Scaramucci took to Twitter following the publication saying, \"I sometimes use colorful language. I will refrain in this arena but not give up the passionate fight for Donald Trump's agenda.\" And this one just then, he just tweeted, \"I made a mistake in trusting a reporter. It won't happen again.\" No word yet from that reporter.  White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders weighed in earlier.",

So much has happened since then. He is supposed to be the incoming White House communications Director, trying to sharpen the message back on the president's big agenda. Jobs, health care, which obviously playing out in the senate tonight, a very important moment for the president's agenda, as well as infrastructure and all the big national security issues he's dealing with. Instead, what it's spilling out is what is clearly a feud between Scaramucci and the White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus.   Remember, at the podium last Friday, Scaramucci claimed they were brothers, they have fight sometimes, it gets messy, but deep down, they deeply liked each other. At the time, we reported that a lot of other people in the building behind me did not believe that they got along and in fact it is becoming more and more clearer that that is the case. You see Steve Bannon there, Scaramucci training his fire on him, as well claiming that the president's Chief Strategist here at the White House is all about himself, not about the president, not about the people, not about the president's agenda. All of this in the New Yorker interview following an extraordinary interview on CNN, where Scaramucci said this --",

I won't say the other people who were there because they weren't outed as being present.  But it was a very nice dinner, wonderful time, great food, probably ate too much, you know me. But other than that, I mean the president was in very good mood, very, very good, very happy, really feel like things were on the right course, that his policies and agendas are going to be implemented.

The other day, Scaramucci said he is not of backstabber, he's a frontstabber. And I think Reince right now is pulling the knife out of his chest. Yes. I think here's what's going on. Trump is trying to encourage weakness and disloyalty from his team. So he taps Mooch. He's got a great head of hair, a very sharp tongue and he's coming here with a flame thrower and just kind of mowing down everybody that's weak and he's firing disloyalty people, he's mishandling people on television, and then throwing some fast balls right at Reince's head.   Now, how Reince reacts, I think in the next couple of weeks, is going to determine whether or not Mooch is going to slide in and take that chief of staff job. I'm not really sure how it's going to play out. Is the language a little over-the-top? Yes. Do we all have virgin ears? No. I'm not that worried about that. But Trump doesn't hire yes-men, like Obama did. He's hiring people with sharp elbows, people with very sharp tongues who come in and compete and are very passionate, and they're all from different walks of what. So I think we have to get used to this. A little perspective here, vets are not dying in secret wetlands (ph). Ambassadors are not being left behind to die on the anniversary of 9/11.

Anthony Scaramucci, the president's new Communications Director gave a profanity-filled interview to the New Yorker Magazine unleashing attacks on two senior White House officials. He called White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus a \"expletive paranoid schizophrenic and a paranoiac\" and also used vulgar language to describe President Trump's chief strategist Steve Bannon. Scaramucci took to Twitter following the publication saying, \"I sometimes use colorful language. I will refrain in this arena but not give up the passionate fight for Donald Trump's agenda.\" And this one just then, he just tweeted, \"I made a mistake in trusting a reporter. It won't happen again.\" No word yet from that reporter. White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders weighed in earlier."

So much has happened since then. He is supposed to be the incoming White House communications Director, trying to sharpen the message back on the president's big agenda. Jobs, health care, which obviously playing out in the senate tonight, a very important moment for the president's agenda, as well as infrastructure and all the big national security issues he's dealing with. Instead, what it's spilling out is what is clearly a feud between Scaramucci and the White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus. Remember, at the podium last Friday, Scaramucci claimed they were brothers, they have fight sometimes, it gets messy, but deep down, they deeply liked each other. At the time, we reported that a lot of other people in the building behind me did not believe that they got along and in fact it is becoming more and more clearer that that is the case. You see Steve Bannon there, Scaramucci training his fire on him, as well claiming that the president's Chief Strategist here at the White House is all about himself, not about the president, not about the people, not about the president's agenda. All of this in the New Yorker interview following an extraordinary interview on CNN, where Scaramucci said this --"

Some brothers are like Cain and Abel. Other brothers can fight with each other and get along. I don't know if this is repairable or not, that will be up to the president. When I put out a tweet and I put Reince's name in the tweets, they are all making the assumption that it's him because journalists know who the leakers are. So if Reince wants to explain that he's not a leaker, let him do that."

Instead, it wasn't really a leak. It was a form that reporters are able to get this public information. He had the sort of back pedal from that charge against Priebus.

I won't say the other people who were there because they weren't outed as being present. But it was a very nice dinner, wonderful time, great food, probably ate too much, you know me. But other than that, I mean the president was in very good mood, very, very good, very happy, really feel like things were on the right course, that his policies and agendas are going to be implemented.

The other day, Scaramucci said he is not of backstabber, he's a frontstabber. And I think Reince right now is pulling the knife out of his chest. Yes. I think here's what's going on. Trump is trying to encourage weakness and disloyalty from his team. So he taps Mooch. He's got a great head of hair, a very sharp tongue and he's coming here with a flame thrower and just kind of mowing down everybody that's weak and he's firing disloyalty people, he's mishandling people on television, and then throwing some fast balls right at Reince's head. Now, how Reince reacts, I think in the next couple of weeks, is going to determine whether or not Mooch is going to slide in and take that chief of staff job. I'm not really sure how it's going to play out. Is the language a little over-the-top? Yes. Do we all have virgin ears? No. I'm not that worried about that. But Trump doesn't hire yes-men, like Obama did. He's hiring people with sharp elbows, people with very sharp tongues who come in and compete and are very passionate, and they're all from different walks of what. So I think we have to get used to this. A little perspective here, vets are not dying in secret wetlands (ph). Ambassadors are not being left behind to die on the anniversary of 9/11. And border patrol agents aren't dying at the hands of Mexican drug cartels."

Now, six months in, has it worked out very smoothly under Reince's leadership as chief of staff? You can say the travel-ban roll out wasn't that smooth. The Obamacare deal has not gone smoothly at all. The messaging has sometimes been off.

And an attorney general who does not follow the law is not very effective in leading the Department of Justice. So I think with 15 years in the department, having served in that great department, knowing the integrity that's required of the attorney general, I believe I made the right decision."

      "speaker": "GUILFOYLE",

Dana, so when I think about this and I look the optics and I see the attorney general there, he's out in the fields doing the job and there's been an incredible progress in numbers as it relates to MS-13, which has the former gang prosecutor, to me, that says something. That's a very good objective that's been attained in terms of putting those priorities of violent street gangs, et cetera, and making the prosecutions there. And so he's in the field trying to do that, which I think is good for the president."

Well, there was this public humiliation of him for the last couple of weeks. And yesterday, we talked about frontstabbers and how that's a great thing. I just -- I thought about that all day and it bothers me. I think that if you have a disagreement with somebody that you are friends with or that works with you, expressing it in private and dealing with that there is much better than basically disparaging him in front of the world. And that it's very important that he -- people of the justice department that work there, the career officials know, the attorney general has the confidence of the president and is able to go for it and do the things like he's doing down in El Salvador."

Trump is also venting. He's venting and I understand that. He's also may be lighting a fire under Jeff Sessions to motivate Jeff Sessions and to show the country and to the rest of the cabinet that he demands loyalty. But I don't think getting rid of Jeff Sessions is a good idea. I think Jeff Sessions is implementing the president's policy agenda on immigration beautifully. He's probably the most effective executor of the agenda the president has of any cabinet official. And it's just funny to look at the media who called the sky a racist for the last year and now all of a sudden very sympathetic towards Jeff Sessions. The height of hypocrisy."

We're right to the man where buck stops and he goes after his attorney general. Now, in response to what you said, Jesse, you heard Jeff Sessions say himself, he went to the people at the justice department, they reviewed his involvement in the campaign, the fact that he had not disclosed contact with the Russian ambassador and suggested to him that the proper step to take for the attorney general, the nation's top law enforcement officer was to recuse himself.

Now you heard in the last few days from Chick Schumer, the Democrat leader in the senate, the Democrats try to rebrand themselves and if you have an opponent whose percentage of approval is about 40 percent, and you lose, you can't blame anyone but yourself. You heard David Axelrod who ran Obama campaign saying billions blown by that Clinton campaign.

And the Republicans were sent to have full control, the White House, senate, congress, to deliver. And they are not delivering. If they can't deliver on something they promised to deliver for how many years this has been? They don't deserve the majority. Get your act together. Or move on to tax cuts, because I'm sick of it and I think the American people are sick of it. The American people need help from Obamacare. It's failing and it hurts people.

I don't understand why John McCain thinks that when Paul Ryan says we are willing to go to conference to negotiate, he says that is not good enough and he needs more reassurance. I don't know what else they will need. Obviously they will have to go to conference. I think there's a little bit of a problem on the CBO score.
