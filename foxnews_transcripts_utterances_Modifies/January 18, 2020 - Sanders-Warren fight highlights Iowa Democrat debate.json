Earlier House impeachment managers filed their own brief in which they accuse the President of abandoning his oath to faithfully execute the laws and betraying the public trust. A massive winter storm system impacting millions of Americans with snow and fierce winds from the plains to the east coast tonight. Blizzard conditions slamming the Dakotas and Upper Midwest with wind gusts over 50 miles per hour, as snow spreads across portions of the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast with freezing temperatures. Road conditions remain treacherous at this hour while airports from Chicago to New York are seeing major delays. Buckingham Palace says Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan will know that longer use the titles Royal Highnesses or receive public funding for their work under a new deal that allows them to step aside as senior Royals. The new arrangements take effect this spring, but Queen Elizabeth said, \"Harry, Meghan and Archie will always be much loved members of my family.\" And the U.S. taking action as a deadly virus from Central China spreads to other countries in Asia.

Blizzard conditions slamming the Dakotas and Upper Midwest with wind gusts over 50 miles per hour, as snow spreads across portions of the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast with freezing temperatures. Road conditions remain treacherous at this hour while airports from Chicago to New York are seeing major delays. Buckingham Palace says Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan will know that longer use the titles Royal Highnesses or receive public funding for their work under a new deal that allows them to step aside as senior Royals. The new arrangements take effect this spring, but Queen Elizabeth said, \"Harry, Meghan and Archie will always be much loved members of my family.\" And the U.S. taking action as a deadly virus from Central China spreads to other countries in Asia.

Quite a handsome fella actually, and that Greg guy is, too. Speaking of handsome fellas, Bill Hemmer has got a new show. It's called \"Bill Hemmer Reports,\" and it starts Monday, three o'clock eastern. You don't want to miss that. Thanks to David Angelo, Lawrence Jones, Kat Timpf, Tyrus, studio audience.
