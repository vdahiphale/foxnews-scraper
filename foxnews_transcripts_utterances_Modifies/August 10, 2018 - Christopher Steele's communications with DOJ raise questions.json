The culture wars are back on and ahead we are going to discuss rapper Kanye West's late night defense of his pro-Trump views.  And the kneeling debate once again, rolling the NFL, of course.  Plus, how the left purposefully manipulates the words of our 40th president, Ronald Reagan. Cabinet member Bill Bennett and Reagan biographer, Craig Shirley will explain.  And a can't-miss interview coming up later in the hour. The Philadelphia U.S. attorney standing up to the Philadelphia district attorney. The issue, the city's sanctuary policy. Stay with us for this one. You're going to love it. Plus, we begin tonight with the new details of contact between officials at the highest level of the Obama era Justice Department and that former British spy. Long after the FBI cut ties with this Christopher Steele character and the Trump dossier author, well, what happened? Bruce Ohr, who was at the time a senior Justice Department official continued to maintain extensive contact with Steele. He wasn't supposed to.  This according to new e-mails Fox News has obtained. Bruce Ohr's new connection to this whole sordid affair is only made worse when you consider the connection of his wife Nellie. Now Fox News has already confirmed that she worked for that outfit, Fusion GPS during the 2016 election. Explicitly hired to help investigate Trump and Russia related subjects. And if you think the Trump legal team isn't following all of this, well think again. Here is counsel to the president Jay Sekulow.",

That's one aspect of it that's troublesome. The other is to go back to the FISA warrant. The FISA warrant said, \"we, the FBI, speculate that maybe this was a politically motivated dossier\" and they swear off that Christopher Steele knew that.  I just don't understand how Steele could be having these meetings with Bruce, with Bruce's connection to Fusion GPS and not likely know there was a Hillary Clinton campaign source for the funding of the dossier.

There is one point where Judge Ellis thinks that Greg Andres, who of course is one of the lawyers for Mueller, is not looking at him. And so the judge says, \"I'm here Mr. Andres,\" like I'm here from the bench. Andres says, \"I'm sorry, judge, I'm listening. And Ellis says, \"I know but when you look down, it's as if to say, you know, that's BS. I don't want to listen to you -- any more from you.\" Andres says, \"Judge you continue to interpret our reactions in some way. We don't do that to you and we're not being disrespectful in any way. Ellis says, \"Alright, then look at me.\"  And he kind of -- I mean, James, he kind of apologized, I guess was it yesterday saying, you know, well things get kind of out of hand I guess. But what do you make of all of this? It's this kind of normal back and forth?

You take it up to a higher court and you say we didn't get a fair trial because he was making us look like an idiot in front of the jury. If you are a prosecutor and the case goes on and gets to be an acquittal, then you have no recourse. You can't go back and say we got an unfair trial. So your recourse is either you take it or you file something or find some way to address it with the court.  And I think they just hit a critical mass where they said we're going to have to take this on more publicly, not a sidebar, tell the judge hey, here is a couple of instances where you're demonstratively wrong, which he was, and try to get him to kind of step back a little bit.

They had like a sidebar, then it was recess, no one -- it was not explained. Then they re-adjourned after 2:00 and then they started talking about how Rick Gates took out a loan I guess for $200,000 for, you know, sports tickets.

The culture wars are back on and ahead we are going to discuss rapper Kanye West's late night defense of his pro-Trump views. And the kneeling debate once again, rolling the NFL, of course. Plus, how the left purposefully manipulates the words of our 40th president, Ronald Reagan. Cabinet member Bill Bennett and Reagan biographer, Craig Shirley will explain. And a can't-miss interview coming up later in the hour. The Philadelphia U.S. attorney standing up to the Philadelphia district attorney. The issue, the city's sanctuary policy. Stay with us for this one. You're going to love it. Plus, we begin tonight with the new details of contact between officials at the highest level of the Obama era Justice Department and that former British spy. Long after the FBI cut ties with this Christopher Steele character and the Trump dossier author, well, what happened? Bruce Ohr, who was at the time a senior Justice Department official continued to maintain extensive contact with Steele. He wasn't supposed to. This according to new e-mails Fox News has obtained. Bruce Ohr's new connection to this whole sordid affair is only made worse when you consider the connection of his wife Nellie. Now Fox News has already confirmed that she worked for that outfit, Fusion GPS during the 2016 election. Explicitly hired to help investigate Trump and Russia related subjects. And if you think the Trump legal team isn't following all of this, well think again. Here is counsel to the president Jay Sekulow."

In Miami, Guy Lewis, a former U.S. attorney, in South Carolina, James Trusty, former DOJ attorney in the criminal division, and here with me in studio, Robert Driscoll, a former the deputy assistant attorney general. Welcome to all of you. Robert, let's start with this new information.

Some people, you know, maintain contact with colleagues even after they're cut off or something like that, but where his wife had an interest in the Fusion GPS research getting pushed, the fact that Ohr is the one that was involved in this is a little bit disturbing.

It seems like getting information, key pieces of information out of the Justice Department, is -- I mean, pulling teeth, pulling taffy, whatever you want. It's really difficult.

They shouldn't have anything to do -- they shouldn't have had anything to do with this investigation, with this case, any submissions to the FISA court, any of this business. And they know this. That's my problem. And I don't understand -- I hope Congress continues to -- look I love the Justice Department. I'm a product of the Justice Department, but Congress needs to continue to beat them over the head for more transparency -- more transparency. That's what this case needs."

And I can't for the life of me figure out any good explanation for why Bruce, who I know, was sitting down with a decommissioned informant. And then to add to that, that the FBI had people there writing up 302 reports. I mean, it sounds like they had decommissioned this informant and is fully intended to keep using him. That's one aspect of it that's troublesome. The other is to go back to the FISA warrant. The FISA warrant said, \"we, the FBI, speculate that maybe this was a politically motivated dossier\" and they swear off that Christopher Steele knew that. I just don't understand how Steele could be having these meetings with Bruce, with Bruce's connection to Fusion GPS and not likely know there was a Hillary Clinton campaign source for the funding of the dossier. So again, big questions, still a lot to unravel, but absolutely red flags in terms of this process."

And this is -- remember, the FBI specifically instructed Steele he could no longer operate or obtain any intelligence whatsoever. Yet Steele asks Ohr in this exchange if he could continue to help feed information to the FBI saying, \"just want to check you are OK, still in the situ -- situation -- and able to help locally as discussed along with your bureau colleagues.\" \"I'm still here to help as discussed, or texted back. I'll let you know if that changes.\" Steele replies, \"If you end up though, I really need another bureau contact, point number who is briefed. We can't allow our guy to be forced to go back home. It would be disastrous.\" Now, investigators, Robert, are trying to figure out who our guy is? Again, this is Steele, who is not to have contact with the FBI, in contact with Bruce Ohr whose wife works for Fusion GPS."

I mean, you would like to give people the benefit of the doubt and say, OK, maybe they were texting about baseball or something after the fact. There is some contact, but those e-mails again are pretty damning."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Text has changed, I mean, that -- I've got to go -- I got to go to you in this -- I find this to be another amazing development this week. There's been a lot of drama in the Paul Manafort trial. I know you've been following the ins and outs of what's happening with Judge Ellis. The special counsel Bob Mueller's team filing a formal complaint against the courtroom behavior of Judge Ellis. The prosecution writing, quote, \"The court's reprimand of government counsel suggested to the injury -- incorrectly -- that the government had acted improperly and in contravention of court rules. This could prejudice -- this prejudice should be cured.\" Let's go to you, Guy, about this. I mean I've known Judge Ellis just casually. I mean, he's a cantankerous kind of old style judge. But there seems to be a real effort in my view to kind of smear him now because he's been tough on the Mueller team. What's your take here?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LEWIS",
      "utterance": "No, I agree, Laura. Look, you clerked for the Second Circuit. You clerked for Justice Thomas. You do not -- prosecutors, you don't win fights with federal judges. And you don't try to pick fights with federal judges. Look, I don't mind that the prosecutors are being aggressive, that they're standing up for their position. I don't know if I would have filed something like that and instead probably would have asked for a sidebar and said, hey judge, you know, you told the injury, you said something yesterday. I'm not sure it was correct. Could you remind the jury that what you say is not evidence and you don't have an opinion in this case? That's probably how I would have handled it as the prosecutor."

    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "James, one of the uncomfortable exchanges and there are many during the past few days. I'm sorry, but some of it is just entertaining, let' just say that. There is one point where Judge Ellis thinks that Greg Andres, who of course is one of the lawyers for Mueller, is not looking at him. And so the judge says, \"I'm here Mr. Andres,\" like I'm here from the bench. Andres says, \"I'm sorry, judge, I'm listening. And Ellis says, \"I know but when you look down, it's as if to say, you know, that's BS. I don't want to listen to you -- any more from you.\" Andres says, \"Judge you continue to interpret our reactions in some way. We don't do that to you and we're not being disrespectful in any way. Ellis says, \"Alright, then look at me.\" And he kind of -- I mean, James, he kind of apologized, I guess was it yesterday saying, you know, well things get kind of out of hand I guess. But what do you make of all of this? It's this kind of normal back and forth? I mean, I certainly, when I was pressing cases I would not have taken the judge to task for reprimanding, not in the way they did, but they kind of feel like they have, you know, they have a head of steam against the judge."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TRUSTY",
      "utterance": "Well they've had a tough go at it. He's been very intrusive, He's been very opinionated. I mean, it's starting to sound like he's going to send Greg to bed with no dinner at this point, but the bottom line is, you have to keep in mind procedurally if you're a defense attorney and you're getting heckled from the bench during the trial, you actually have a remedy someday. You take it up to a higher court and you say we didn't get a fair trial because he was making us look like an idiot in front of the jury. If you are a prosecutor and the case goes on and gets to be an acquittal, then you have no recourse. You can't go back and say we got an unfair trial. So your recourse is either you take it or you file something or find some way to address it with the court. And I think they just hit a critical mass where they said we're going to have to take this on more publicly, not a sidebar, tell the judge hey, here is a couple of instances where you're demonstratively wrong, which he was, and try to get him to kind of step back a little bit. So, it's a tough spot for a litigant to be in, but I'm not really critical of the fact they filed a motion because it's now or never."
    },

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "I mean, didn't he kind of make that poor Greg Andres cry? I mean, I'm sorry, but you have to have your big boy pants on when you're before Judge Ellis. He's a tough judge. Also, nothing happened today and Robert, I want to get your take on this. There was a mysterious recess this morning at about -- I think it was like 10:50 or so. They had like a sidebar, then it was recess, no one -- it was not explained. Then they re-adjourned after 2:00 and then they started talking about how Rick Gates took out a loan I guess for $200,000 for, you know, sports tickets. I mean, is that normal to have -- you start in the morning, you have a recess for four hours and you come back? Maybe Ellis just wanted to cool things down?"

He went in the same direction as the jury box or the jury room. So, there may have been a jury issue that he was talking to them about, either someone read a newspaper or someone, you know what I mean. We don't know."

I was like, wait a second it stopped. I need this to keep going. It's very -- I wish I was in the courtroom. It's actually really fascinating. Al right, finally guys, I want to get everyone's thoughts on whether President Trump will actually finally sit down for an interview with Mueller's team or whether Mueller will have to issue a subpoena and everything that that entails. Let's go to you Robert on this. Oh, sorry Robert, I'm going to go to James. I just went to you. James, go ahead."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TRUSTY",
      "utterance": "Alright. Well, look, I don't think Mueller himself feels like he has that strong a hand to issue a subpoena here or at least to get the kind of compliance he wants."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Why?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TRUSTY",
      "utterance": "There's a lot of layers -- well, there's a lot of layers of why the president shouldn't have to face a subpoena while in office, but you know, executive privilege kicks in. And frankly, the fact that they've called the president a subject makes it very tough for me to understand how they could ask questions about obstruction because the obstruction angle is purely target. So, I think what they're looking at is what are our chances if we actually subpoena him? We were going to get a motion to quash. What's it going to read like? And I think a motion to quash filed by the White House would be pretty damning and pretty powerful in terms of addressing everything they want to complain about when it comes to the Mueller probe up until, you know, calling him a subject and treating him like a target."

      "utterance": "Laura, not in a million years. The president will never sit down voluntarily and speak to these guys. He would be crazy to. The special counsel, I think, Bob is tough as a nail. He's hard as a rock. He will issue the grand jury subpoena and then they'll file their motion to quash and it will make its way up through the Supreme Court.

I'd get kicked out of the black community because blacks -- we're supposed to have a monolithic thought we can only like -- we can only be Democrats, you know. What it represented to me is not about policies because I'm not a politician like that, but it represented overcoming fear and doing what you felt no matter what anyone said and saying you can't bully me.

I mean, a long time ago he stood up on national T.V. and said George Bush didn't care about black people. So, he's always had a free thinking on himself. What he's trying to do right now is really cater to both sides of the fence. He wants to maintain the fact he does support Trump but he wants to do it in such a way that could possibly apiece his followers who may not support Trump. So really it seems like more of a tactical marketing skill on his behalf rather than some instances of bullying. I mean, he's a multimillionaire.

A handful of players took knees or raised their fists during the anthem. Now, the president, like it's not surprisingly, tweeted out today in part, quote, \"numerous players from different teams wanted to show their outrage at something that most of them are unable to define. They make a fortune doing what they love. Find another way to protest.\" Eric, your reaction to that because, you know, you have Kenny Stills out there saying, \"Look at my twitter feed. Look at my twitter feed. I explained why I'm doing what I'm doing. Look at my social media. It's not just a whim. I mean this.\" And he's sticking up for his right to do what he does."

The players have been very adamant over and over it is not about the military, some of them have fathers, uncles, brothers, mothers, sisters who have served in the military. It is about bringing attention to the racial injustices that have been systematically done by the police and other instruments of government in this case. Now, I do agree that there maybe a need for their method of protest to transform to a more economic and more political base similar to what we just saw happen in St. Louis where the prosecutor was defeated by a democratic, more progressive opponent.

If they know that the rule of law is going to be respected, the broader community, therefore, believe that law enforcement is doing their job.

He said about your statement linking this rape by this Juan Ramon Vasquez who was released, ended up raping a member of his own family, a five-year-old child, he said, well, that's very dramatic to somehow link the sanctuary status to this rape. \"The Trump administration has made it so that immigrant children can get raped because they're afraid to call the police due to its policies of deporting people who are victims.\" So they're linking Trump to you, the deportation of actual victims of domestic violence, and you're seeing this bubble up with the judge versus Jeff Sessions yesterday. So how do you respond to that? He's hitting you hard, saying you're basically, this is typical Trump administration stuff from you."

I am doing my best as a law enforcement officer to enforce the law in a neutral, non-partisan, apolitical manner. And when you are a proponent of sanctuary cities, again, you're politicizing law enforcement. I think that the D.C. in Philadelphia unfortunately takes a political approach to a lot of issues in law enforcement. And what I'm saying is that respect for the rule of raw is a non-partisan, neutral --"

    {
      "speaker": "MCSWAIN",
      "utterance": "Well, the fundamental problem, again, is that not only are sanctuary cities, in my view, wrong, but they're essentially un-American. Let me explain that a little bit. When you come before the law in America, it's not supposed to matter who you are or where you're from, who your parents are or the like. Everybody is supposed to be treated equally. So if you politicize the law and you say we're not going to enforce the law against a certain group of people. We're only going to enforce it against others, you're essentially doing something that I believe is un-American because you're not respecting the rule of law."

      "utterance": "It's not equal justice under the law. Juan Ramon Vasquez, let's get back to that case. In 2014 he was arrested on an aggravated assault. He was released, illegal immigrant. A year and-a-half later he was found to have raped a member of his own family, a five-year-old little girl. And then of course when he's released in 2014, that was sanctuary city time, and they say, well, making that leap from his release to the rape and sanctuary policies, that's unfair. Do you squarely -- obviously it's his fault for doing the rape, he's liable, but did the sanctuary city policy facilitate the rape of this little girl?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCSWAIN",
      "utterance": "It not only facilitated it, it's 100 percent responsible for it. And that is non-controversial. What happened in the timeline was Mr. Vasquez was deported in 2009. He then illegally reentered the country. He was arrested for assault in 2014, and we placed a detainer on him which is a request that if he's released from local custody to give the feds a heads up, we take him to federal custody and we deport him. Unfortunately, Philadelphia, because they're a sanctuary city, do not respect detainers. So when Mr. Vasquez was released in 2014 we didn't know about it. The Philadelphia prison officials didn't tell us about it. And instead of him coming into federal custody where he would have been deported to Honduras and had no further opportunity to commit any further crimes in Philadelphia, instead he went into the community and, as you said, he raped a five year old."

    {
      "speaker": "MCSWAIN",
      "utterance": "Correct. And one of the larger issues that is at stake here is in the post 9/11 world it's very, very important that all levels of law enforcement, state, local, federal, that they're talking to each other."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "I thought that was the point. I thought after 9/11 everyone is supposed to talk to each other, obviously FBI, CIA. But aren't we all supposed to be working together as Americans to keep our communities, our countries safe? I really do not understand the sanctuary stuff. I don't. I don't get it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCSWAIN",
      "utterance": "The problem is prior to 9/11 a lot of law enforcement were in siloes. They weren't talking to each other. They weren't communicating. We've made a lot of progress since then. And I think that having, for example, a sanctuary city policy where the locals are now communicating with the federal authorities and are in fact defying federal law is a step backwards. And we do that at our own peril."

    {
      "speaker": "MCSWAIN",

      "speaker": "MCSWAIN",
      "utterance": "Well, first of all, on that sanctuary city's case that you mentioned earlier, the last word hasn't been written on that. There was a case in the eastern district of Pennsylvania, my district, that was ruled on. But there are lots of these cases going on around the country. And they all sort of percolate their way up through the court system."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "They're supposed to. There shouldn't be a nationwide injunction with one district court, or shouldn't there be."

      "speaker": "MCSWAIN",
      "utterance": "No, there shouldn't. And what you want is you want several courts to look at an issue, have the benefit of all their analysis, and eventually these things hopefully make their way to the Supreme Court which will have the final word."
