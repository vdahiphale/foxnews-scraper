If you have a bad name everyone's afraid you and I think that eventually wears on you. And you don't want to be treated as what your stats say. You want to be treated as the person. And you know, in dealing with that throughout my career and you know, facing that battle, that's been ongoing. I think I finally came to that climax in St. Louis were after that season I lost the joy of the game. I need to step back a little bit and ultimately I decided that I was going to step away from the game. I thought that's what was the best and it's the best thing to just take a breath and breathe and then, you know, I was really facing the fear going back to the game because it sort of entrapped me. I didn't want to touch a football. I didn't want to play again. And you know, a Texas boy saying that to grew up, you know, touching football the first day is boring, it's really hard. So you love something your entire life and all of a sudden you lose it. But, you know, the joy came back. I prayed about it with my wife and, you know, a lot of tears I said. But I play for Andy Reid, his entire staff and that came to see a team helped me get the joy and love of the game back.",

Never for that. I know that what I'm going through trials God is always trying to teach me something and allow me to grow.

A bipartisan group spent weeks working hard on a bill that offered 25 billion dollars in investment in border security to see the president midway on getting DREAMers that path to citizenship. That was the bipartisan bill. It got 54 votes here in the Senate but it only failed because the president personally lobbied against it the day that it came to the floor. We've had some challenges negotiating with the president, because he'll initially say, \"I will accept a bipartisan bill that does A, B, and C.\" And then, we -- when we get that bill to him because I don't know -- I rejected if it doesn't have EFA."

And then, in the health committee with Senator Rubio, Republican of Florida, a bill to help improve savings for college for American families, and in particular, first-generation college attending students.

You have the shooting of Steve Scalise last year. We're in a tinderbox and I think that you can't be too careful. I mean, I'm all for passion, I'm all for commitment to your principles and in debate and discourse.

And I would imagine it's going to be quickly followed suit by the travel ban issue. Can members of Congress get together and come up with something that makes our borders safe and also allows -- you know, perhaps, the number that the president suggested DACA children to be able to stay here. Why isn't there some way to solve this immigration problem once and for all so that there's a process that works at the border?"

And maybe if we took these at a slice at a time and said, you know we all tend to agree that we need border security. We need more boots on the ground, we need -- we need a fence in places, we need border technology, we need to end the diversity lottery.

Here's a quote from Sharyl Attkisson who wrote a column about it in The Hill today entitled What Did Peter Strzok do? And she writes the earth-shattering finding on Strzok confirms a citizenry's worst fears. A high-ranking government intel officials allegedly conspired to affect the outcome of a U.S. presidential election. And here's the chilling part. If it weren't for the I.G.'s investigation requested by Congress he would likely still be helping lead the Special Counsel's investigation of Trump today. Your thoughts on that Jonathan."

I challenge anyone to say that you know, with a fair reading of that report that everything is fine. That being said there is no evidence that he liked -- the missing piece is what actions he took as an investigator to put his thumb on the scale.

It's like an insurance policy in the unlikely event that you die before you're 40. So you know the question is what did he -- how did he act on that. And the Inspector General found that he could not draw a straight line between those comments and the action that the FBI took. But I think one of the interesting things, Jonathan, is going to be the questions that go around, how did you treat the two investigations differently because he was central in the Hillary e- mail investigation as well as being central in the Trump Russia investigation and the treatment appears to be very different?"

The two of you created the most compelling case I have heard for why this hearing should be open to the public rather than behind closed doors. It is our representatives seeking the truth about our election in 2016 and we have the right to know how this guy defends what appears to be indefensible. He's not a dope. He's a very smart guy.

Once a person is on our soil, no matter how they got here they're entitled to protection. What can he do about it? He can ship judges from New Jersey and North Dakota -- my friends on the bench are not going to be happy at the suggestion -- down to the border and they can start these hearings which are not full-blown jury trials that take months.

This former agent's name is Mark Wauck.

I think Brennan has shown a dislike for the president that questions whether or not he actually was fair as the CIA director. You've got to remember that the people that we're looking at here hated Trump and I think they were all in the tank for Clinton and we will see what Mr. Mueller says, but I do know this. The primary investigator when it comes to the Russian-Trump connection early on was Mr. Strzok, who was clearly in the tank for Clinton and hated Trump. I understand why Mueller fired him. I understand why he would fire other people given their behavior regarding the Trump campaign. So we will see what Mr. Mueller does. But I'm shocked that nobody in your business really outside of Fox News seems to give a damn that the head investigator for the FBI wanted to stop Trump and basically baste diced an investigation of Clinton, had a bias that was beyond belief and started the Russia investigation."

You've talked a lot about the fact that you spent seven months in prison for tax evasion. I know that you feel that that conviction was -- that you were railroaded, that it was unjust. But when you look at it from a political perspective, Don Blankenship had a similar experience, he spent some time in jail, felt that it was completely wrong.

No one does constituent services the way I did whether it was super storm Sandy or rebuilding the marina, bringing money home for hospitals, people got to know me on a personal level and I don't think they liked the, you know, the political corruption getting into our justice system. You have to understand I have three delivery boys off the books at a restaurant. In the entire history of the city of New York everyone else was given a civil fine by the Department of Labor. I'm the only one in history that was actually criminally charged for that and people are rejecting that. They don't like that."

      "speaker": "GRIMM",
      "utterance": "well, I think that's obvious. I mean, if there's a tremendous amount of pressure put on a president by the establishment that controls the House, leadership and so on. They don't want the president going against their incumbents and ultimately the president needs the team that's in office now to pass his agenda. So it would be very difficult for the president I think to go against the sitting incumbents unless there was an extremely good reason. So, that, to me, it's really not a surprise at all."

Right now I think -- I really think the left is only playing this up because it looks like it hurts our president. But the fact is how about the other 10,000 that came by themselves? How about when they were ripped out of their mother's arms in Guatemala or Honduras or wherever they came from and then stuffed in a trunk, some of them, to cross the desert by smugglers and coyotes. So I think if we want to care about children we have to close our borders once and for all so that they never make that journey in the first place because that journey, which is so dangerous and often ends in rape and being sold through human trafficking and other egregious things, if we really care about them then we have to close our borders once and for all so they never make that horrific journey."

They have a primary tonight and the last time I checked we still have well over an hour left before the polls close so we don't know who the Democrat is going to be. But whoever it is I'm going to run exactly the way I've always ran. You got to understand I won four elections for one reason, because I worked my tail off. I'm relentless, I go out there, I meet the people, I talk about the issues. I get to know them and make sure they get to know me.

I mean, in this day and age it's hard to count anybody out to primary, hard to pull, anything can happen so we'll have to wait and see.

He obviously he's running tonight because he didn't get the state, 60 percent at the state party convention which is a bit of a bump in the road for him but it looks like he's poised to win tonight and that would have obviously make him almost assure him of being the next senator from Utah. I don't think Mitt has any presidential aspirations but Mitt might be right that someone might run against Trump. Mitt is probably also right that it's likely a suicide mission because Trump has a real grip on the party right now and high standing among Republican voters."

      "utterance": "Yes, I was there. And I have to say when you guys walked out you could feel the energy. You could feel how pumped up you guys were and I was worried from the very first second of the game. I've got to ask you this, you know, Tom Brady try to catch a pass and run it in for a touchdown. He failed. Shortly later you try to do the same thing and you succeeded. Did you do that to kind of rub it in a little bit?"

And I know that, you know, Eagles fans will probably use it, but no, honestly we had the filling special in the game plan weeks prior and we were going to use it in the Super Bowl one way or the other and it just so happened that they tried to play a couple plays before we did. And you know, if anything it reminded me make sure I look at all the way in and you know, once we executed it the filling special came to life."

    {
      "speaker": "FOLES",
      "utterance": "You know, I was so into the game, we played against so many DBs. I've never really worried about the BD's too much. Butler is a great player. He is very physical with the line. he's got a great skill set. So I mean, I guess you are a little bit surprised but at the same time I'm not really focused on that. I mean, I'm not worried about what they are doing. I'm just going to go out there play. I recognize their coverage and trust my receivers to, you know, beat the DBs, and beat them off the balls, beat them in the rows and I've got to expect to put the ball on the money every single time and that was my mind- set in the game. I wasn't drawn on him not playing though. You know, he's a tremendous player and watching him on film, he was going to be a great matchup."

You almost quit the game a couple of years before you won the Super Bowl. So how do you get there? You say there's two Nick Foles and you needed to separate them. What does that mean?"

      "speaker": "FOLES",

I think my identity as an athlete, you are treated based on how you play. So if you have a good game, you know, sometimes you are treated better. If you have a bad name everyone's afraid you and I think that eventually wears on you. And you don't want to be treated as what your stats say. You want to be treated as the person. And you know, in dealing with that throughout my career and you know, facing that battle, that's been ongoing. I think I finally came to that climax in St. Louis were after that season I lost the joy of the game. I need to step back a little bit and ultimately I decided that I was going to step away from the game. I thought that's what was the best and it's the best thing to just take a breath and breathe and then, you know, I was really facing the fear going back to the game because it sort of entrapped me. I didn't want to touch a football. I didn't want to play again. And you know, a Texas boy saying that to grew up, you know, touching football the first day is boring, it's really hard. So you love something your entire life and all of a sudden you lose it. But, you know, the joy came back. I prayed about it with my wife and, you know, a lot of tears I said. But I play for Andy Reid, his entire staff and that came to see a team helped me get the joy and love of the game back."

Until basically I have my shoulder repaired, I was at Michigan State, you know, thousands of miles away from home from Texas and it was going through a lot with football once again and just being in school and college and everything that goes along with it and I would say that through that the trials, through the ups and downs, just leaning on Christ, leaning on God's word through prayer, you know, never for prosperity. Never for that. I know that what I'm going through trials God is always trying to teach me something and allow me to grow. And I can tell you that through ups and downs my heart continues to shape even more so. You know, a big thing throughout my career was my wife getting sick with this POTS. POTS Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome. So that's been a trial that's been in our life but it has grown us closer together. She's resilient, she's amazing and now she's got a platform to really spread awareness for POTS."
