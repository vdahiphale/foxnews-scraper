In a letter to the president, Chairman Nadler issued a Friday deadline for the White House to declare whether counsel intends to participate in the hearings and to specify if counsel will cross-examine witnesses or present evidence. That's two days after lawmakers expect to hear testimony from four scholars on the constitutional grounds for impeachment, a process already being criticized by ranking member Doug Collins who wrote the committee asking that the witness list be expanded, noting that it's less than a quarter of those called to testify during the Clinton impeachment. Collins' letter is just the latest example of the political and process tug of war playing out on Capitol Hill as the inquiry shifts to the Judiciary Committee from the Intelligence Committee, whose members will be able to review a draft of their impeachment report on Monday before voting to forward their findings on to Chairman Nadler Tuesday. For President Trump, the resumption of the hearings might seem a cold reality following a warm welcome by U.S. service personnel during his surprise visit to Afghanistan on Thanksgiving. A brief respite from the war on terror to visit with the commander-in-chief and just ahead of his trip to the NATO summit in London where two were killed and three were injured in an ISIS-claimed attack on Friday. Speaking of that trip to London, the president said on Twitter he'll be there representing our country while Democrats will be back here conducting the most \"ridiculous impeachment in history.\" Chris.",

It's easy to hide behind a gavel and intelligence committees behind closed door hearings, but it's going to be one -- another thing to actually get up and have to answer questions about what his staff knew, how he knew, what he did about the whistleblower report, his interactions that he's had with Ukraine, the other things that he's had over time in this process and also why he has still not released documents to our committee and reports to our committee that we need to actually proceed in our committee of judiciary committee, which is the committee of impeachment. I have a question. Why are they hiding this stuff from us? If they think they have such a case, give us all the materials and don't let Jerry Nadler write a crazy letter that says on the 6th let us know who your witnesses are.

We've already had constitutional scholars in the committee talking about from the Mueller report and others is there an impeachable offense? This is a complete American waste of time right here. The problem is is Jerry Nadler and the rest of them have already got in their mind they're writing the articles of impeachment whether they have fairness or process or all. So, if the White House participates with a bunch of constitutional scholars, which by the way, I wrote a letter to Chairman Nadler, why are we doing this on a normal three-to-one ratio?

So, we're rushing this, Chris. I don't think the American people -- even if they support an impeachment inquiry, or even trying to remove and overturn the votes of these 63 million people for this president -- they don't think this is fair. And I've talked to Democrats who do not believe this is fair. If the Judiciary Committee simply has a constitutional scholar hearing, and then they have a presentation of a report by Adam Schiff, and we go straight to a mark-up, that is a failure on Chairman Nadler of ultimate proportion, because this is a failure of the Judiciary Committee to be able to talk to fact witnesses, to be able to talk to the people that have actually been a part of this, and actually have the president viably participate in his own defense, which he's not had the opportunity to do now.",

We asked you for questions for the panel and on this issue of whether the president should send a lawyer to participate in the impeachment hearings we got this on Facebook from Greta Kraft, she writes, \"Since the president and Republicans have consistently expressed concerns about due process, doesn't it behoove the president's counsel to attend these hearings and participate to their full ability?\" Congressman Chaffetz, how do you answer Greta?

But the other part of the political spin is that with Trump it seemed, and I think this is why you had the thought, I certainly had it, that it looks like a photo op. Remember, he hadn't gone to visit any war zone until last year. He was criticized for it. This is his first visit to Afghanistan, our longest war, 2,000-plus Americans dead. He had no preparation. He talked about a cease fire but his military people said we know nothing about any ceasefire with the Taliban and the Taliban said they know nothing about a ceasefire. He then talked about negotiations with the Taliban and again his own diplomats said we know nothing about any ongoing talks with the Taliban. The president canceled talks with the Taliban last September, if you'll recall, after they were engaged in a violent incident.

In a letter to the president, Chairman Nadler issued a Friday deadline for the White House to declare whether counsel intends to participate in the hearings and to specify if counsel will cross-examine witnesses or present evidence. That's two days after lawmakers expect to hear testimony from four scholars on the constitutional grounds for impeachment, a process already being criticized by ranking member Doug Collins who wrote the committee asking that the witness list be expanded, noting that it's less than a quarter of those called to testify during the Clinton impeachment. Collins' letter is just the latest example of the political and process tug of war playing out on Capitol Hill as the inquiry shifts to the Judiciary Committee from the Intelligence Committee, whose members will be able to review a draft of their impeachment report on Monday before voting to forward their findings on to Chairman Nadler Tuesday. For President Trump, the resumption of the hearings might seem a cold reality following a warm welcome by U.S. service personnel during his surprise visit to Afghanistan on Thanksgiving. A brief respite from the war on terror to visit with the commander-in-chief and just ahead of his trip to the NATO summit in London where two were killed and three were injured in an ISIS-claimed attack on Friday. Speaking of that trip to London, the president said on Twitter he'll be there representing our country while Democrats will be back here conducting the most \"ridiculous impeachment in history.\" Chris."

Chairman Nadler sent a letter asking us by Friday to present this list and present all the things that we would like to do. However, we're not even going to see the Schiff report, as it's going to be known, out of committee until Tuesday night, possibly even Wednesday morning before we get to see it. There's a lot of problems here that we have to investigate here. As an attorney if you have a case going forward you want to know exactly what you're facing and Chairman Nadler is simply asking for an arbitrary deadline because we've not seen the Schiff report. We've not seen any -- we've not even heard from him what he actually wants to have for hearings. This is just another example, I think, of him being told I need to do something and we go from there. This is a problematic part for us to have to go forward with."

Adam Schiff has been the author of many things, a lot of them found to be false over the past couple of years. But he's going to be the author of this report. He's compared himself in the past to a special counsel. This is what he said he was doing. Well, if we go back to Clinton and even back to Nixon, but in Clinton, Ken Starr was the special counsel, he presented a report that we're going to get his judiciary. He actually came and sat and testified under oath and took questions from all sides, including the White House. My first and foremost witness is Adam Schiff."

      "utterance": "He needs to be. He's put himself into that position. If he chooses not to then I really question his veracity and what he's putting in his report. I question his, you know, the motives of why he's doing it. It's easy to hide behind a report. It's easy to hide behind a gavel and intelligence committees behind closed door hearings, but it's going to be one -- another thing to actually get up and have to answer questions about what his staff knew, how he knew, what he did about the whistleblower report, his interactions that he's had with Ukraine, the other things that he's had over time in this process and also why he has still not released documents to our committee and reports to our committee that we need to actually proceed in our committee of judiciary committee, which is the committee of impeachment. I have a question. Why are they hiding this stuff from us? If they think they have such a case, give us all the materials and don't let Jerry Nadler write a crazy letter that says on the 6th let us know who your witnesses are. We don't even have the information from the intel committee yet. This is why this is a problematic exercise and simply a made-for-TV event coming on Wednesday."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "Okay. Chairman Nadler has also written to the White House asking if they want to have a lawyer to represent them at Wednesday's hearing which is going to be with constitutional scholars and to actually mount a defense of the president the next week, a week from Monday. Do you know whether the White House is going to participate?"

    {

We're back, by the way, in rerun season here in the Judiciary Committee. We've already had constitutional scholars in the committee talking about from the Mueller report and others is there an impeachable offense? This is a complete American waste of time right here. The problem is is Jerry Nadler and the rest of them have already got in their mind they're writing the articles of impeachment whether they have fairness or process or all. So, if the White House participates with a bunch of constitutional scholars, which by the way, I wrote a letter to Chairman Nadler, why are we doing this on a normal three-to-one ratio? If it's so important like we did in Clinton where we had almost four times as many of these witnesses, why don't we at least get two-for-two? Why don't we at least have more witnesses in this process?"

    {
      "speaker": "COLLINS",
      "utterance": "That's exactly right. That's what we're seeing here. And look, I think the problem is here is they're on a timeframe. It's an internal kind of timeframe to try and finish this out by the end of the year, because they want to get at this president right now, before the -- before everybody completely sees through the process sham of the elections for next year. So, we're rushing this, Chris. I don't think the American people -- even if they support an impeachment inquiry, or even trying to remove and overturn the votes of these 63 million people for this president -- they don't think this is fair. And I've talked to Democrats who do not believe this is fair. If the Judiciary Committee simply has a constitutional scholar hearing, and then they have a presentation of a report by Adam Schiff, and we go straight to a mark-up, that is a failure on Chairman Nadler of ultimate proportion, because this is a failure of the Judiciary Committee to be able to talk to fact witnesses, to be able to talk to the people that have actually been a part of this, and actually have the president viably participate in his own defense, which he's not had the opportunity to do now."

So, if you want to show one side, then also show the other side as we go along with this. President Trump has always been concerned about foreign aid.

Madison indicated that the House should serve as a rival to the executive branch because the Founders didn't want a king, they didn't want a dictator, they didn't want a monarch. They wanted a democracy. So, we do have a responsibility to defend our democracy. We're here at this moment right now because the president decided to pressure a foreign government to target an American citizen for political gain, and at the same time withhold $391 million in military aid from a very vulnerable Ukraine, which is an ally to the United States and is still at war with Russian-backed separatists in Crimea. That's why we are at this moment, Chris,"

You just finished 30 hours of televised hearings, 12 witnesses, and the public apparently isn't buying it at this point. I want to put up a recent poll. Back in early October, people approved of impeaching and removing the president by a margin of 52 percent to 46. Now, after you have presented your evidence, it's 48 percent for and 50 percent against. And, you know, while you could argue that those are well within the margin of error, it's clear that there is none of the bipartisan support that Speaker Pelosi said for months was essential to impeachment."

More significantly, I think 70 percent of the American people indicated that the president did something wrong. That said, our job is to follow the facts, apply the law, be guided by the U.S. Constitution, and present the truth to the American people no matter where it leads, because no one is above the law.

He said that there was no legitimate national security reason for withholding the aid, no legitimate public policy reason, no legitimate substantive reason.

I think one of the problems is there are three committees involved instead of just one committee, which was the case in both the Nixon and the Clinton impeachments. I was a member of the House during the Clinton impeachment and it's a very tough and miserable process and the people pushing it paid a severe price. So, what do I think now? I think the names of the Democratic witnesses should be public this minute. And I think the White House, I agree with Jason, should participate.

Mick Mulvaney, the acting chief of staff, Rudy Giuliani, any of these people, because it might take, you know, another two months or so. And I think a lot of the process arguments at the moment will be forgotten in the fullness of time but the fact that they're sending a flagrantly incomplete factual record to the Senate on this most, you know, consequential constitutional process, that will be remembered and I think that's why history will look dimly on this process.

But remember, Clinton's travels didn't stop Newt Gingrich from impeaching President Clinton. So, it doesn't -- it's not, you know, determinative. But it has this political spin that you put to it. But the other part of the political spin is that with Trump it seemed, and I think this is why you had the thought, I certainly had it, that it looks like a photo op. Remember, he hadn't gone to visit any war zone until last year. He was criticized for it. This is his first visit to Afghanistan, our longest war, 2,000-plus Americans dead. He had no preparation. He talked about a cease fire but his military people said we know nothing about any ceasefire with the Taliban and the Taliban said they know nothing about a ceasefire. He then talked about negotiations with the Taliban and again his own diplomats said we know nothing about any ongoing talks with the Taliban. The president canceled talks with the Taliban last September, if you'll recall, after they were engaged in a violent incident. So, it seems to me that if you come back home and say because this picks up on what you were talking about with Congressman Jeffries, why don't we get things done?

So, he's never going to fully adopt the Bill Clinton strategy. And Juan, on these witnesses, no White House aids in its own impeachment, and there's at least a colorable case that there are legitimate privilege claims for these witnesses. The courts should decide, but Democrats don't want to wait because they're on a political timetable. So, they're going to have a partisan impeachment vote on a political timetable."

So, let's look at the national Quinnipiac poll that came out this week. Joe Biden is solidly in first place, as you can see. But the news is what happened behind him. Buttigieg went from fourth to second in the last month in this national poll, while Warren went from first to third -- and, as you can see, went all the way from 28 to 14 and lost fully half of her support. Juan, what happened to Warren? And how seriously do you think we should take Buttigieg as a potential Democratic presidential nominee?"

But he's a leader in terms of fundraising, which is a surprise to many people, because he's clearly not a leader in the polls, even though he's been rising. I think Warren is the one that came as a shock to me, Chris, as you said, losing 50 percent of her support, principally among white, educated Democrats who previously were tremendous boosters for her. So, the other thing that strikes me as the headline --"

I have a way to deal with this issue.\" And when people were asking her, \"How do you plan to pay for this?\" people found it unacceptable. They did not like the plan. And so, I think that undermined her thesis, if you will."

A video surfaced in the last few days of him making a speech last year in which he seemed -- I don't think seemed; he did -- favor regressive taxes, taxes that hit the poor more harshly, especially on issues like cigarettes and sugary drinks. Take a look."

      "speaker": "LOWRY",
      "utterance": "I don't think well. [laughter] And this is not a gaffe in the sense of misspeaking; this is something he legitimately believes. It's rank paternalism and goes to how there's something to dislike about the Bloomberg candidacy for everyone. Republicans don't like the taxes. Democrats don't like the taxes on the poor. And pretty much everyone likes soda. So, I just think this campaign is preposterous. The idea he's going to wait out the first four contests, and then swoop in, you know, on a $100 million ad buy, I just think, is ridiculous and is going nowhere."

The man in the foreground is walking away with the knife. Some bystanders subdued the attacker. But when police told them to back off, the man flashed a suicide vest, which turned out to be fake, and the police -- and we froze it there -- shot and killed him. And there was another attack in which a man in the Netherlands stabbed three teenagers. They're all going to be okay. Congresswoman Harman, while all this is going on, ISIS put out --"

I think our policies are making it more like that ISIS will reemerge in Europe, and I think that copycat attacks can happen, which is why let's not denigrate the intelligence community, which is trying to get ahead of this. Let's not do things with the Navy that make the Pentagon really question whether the commander-in-chief is making good decisions, and let's please reinstate our relations with allies who are the ones who are going to keep us safe, and let's confirm if we can all these vacancies at the Homeland Security department."

We need to keep our boot on its neck in the Middle East, and Trump's reflex is to liquidate our presence in the broader Middle East, where we actually figured out in recent years a way with minimal forces to defeat the caliphate and to keep ISIS on the run.
