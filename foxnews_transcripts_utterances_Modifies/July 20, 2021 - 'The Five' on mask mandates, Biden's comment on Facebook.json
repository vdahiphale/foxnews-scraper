But I wrote down a few things when I started just thinking about how this all has unfolded. They filibuster in Texas, yet they go to Washington encouraging the Dems to eliminate the filibuster. They want everyone in masks on airplanes, you have to wear a mask when you get on an airplane, and sometimes you have to wear it indoors now even if you are vaccinated, yet they didn't wear them on these private planes. They fly on their private planes to D.C., and they stay in hotels with laundry service, yet they claim hardships. They say sacrifices when they have to wash and hang their wet clothes, sometimes their underwear, in the bathrooms, and they tweet about it. Kamala Harris says if you're exposed you need to quarantine. She met with them on Tuesday, some of them were testing positive at the end of the week. Yet, when the Democrats asked her, when the media asked her, are you going to quarantine? Her spokesperson said she didn't need to do it. I'm looking at polling right now. According to the Convention of State Action and Trafalgar survey, pulling for her is so low, you all. She has 60 percent of the voters think she's not ready to be president and 43 percent of them are Democrats. And where is the media outrage, Greg?",

The media won't cover the story anymore, and every single thing that the Republicans want head after negotiating with them for months is going to be drafted in this bill. So, the question is, where do we go from here? They've got to run on this now. I mean, they already in. The Democratic National Committee is already invested in this. But it was never about Texas, about H.R. 1. It's about better lives in this. They're going to say, look, we tried to fight back in Texas. Even though Politico gave us four Pinocchio's, just like Georgia. We tried to fight. And this is why we have to run on this in the next election. That it has to be a federalized election system.

Now where I think we lie -- well, herein lies the problem. There are Democrats, Joe Manchin and others, that are actually trying to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. Now the John Lewis Voting Rights Act as a rename of the 1965 Voting Rights Act that was passed by LBJ, that was re- passed by Ronald Reagan, that was signed by George H.W. Bush, that was signed by George W. Bush. It is a very basic piece of law that was -- that has been bipartisan ever since. What it says, in states where there is actual voter suppression, a history of voter suppression, that there should be preclearance by the Justice Department for new voter rules. This bill can get passed. Right? This bill has bipartisan support in the Senate, it needs 10 votes. It's very close to getting that. I think the story creates a mass.

I said this, I think it was two weeks ago, I said crime doesn't matter until the people removed from it experience the reality firsthand. And now CNN realized it, and you finally covered crime. After mocking us every single day when we were talking about crime, and Don Lemon and Chris Cuomo, mocking us for caring about black on black crime, and joking about it. Actually, joking about it. And then finally admitting it had a political ramification. Not a moral one. So now, now you have it happening at a baseball game, where the press are, and that was shocking. And their families got scared, and it's a terrible experience. But now they are reacting because it hurt them intimately and now, they understand how other people feel. The problem with the press right now, and how they deal with crime, is that they are so divorced from it. On Canal Street on Saturday, at 10.30 in the morning, the Asian mother and her son were thrown down a flight of stairs. She's in critical condition, her head is bashed in. The guy is still on the loose. The press doesn't really cover it, they don't care because you know what. They don't know them. They don't know them. But they know the professional athletes. They have tickets to that game, so that's why that was so important to them. I really think the reason why people aren't covering this stuff, it's this demonization by association. If we come out against crime, they can be on our side. So they have to step away and go, hold on, you know, maybe this is racist. Right?

Five Texas state lawmakers, so far, have tested positive for COVID after fleeing their state and posing for selfies, maskless on private planes, the group going on around D.C. last week meeting with top Democrats like Chuck Schumer, having a powwow with Liz Warren that's not tasteful and potentially exposing Kamala Harris to the virus. The V.P. even made a trip to Walter Reed Medical Center yesterday, but the White House is calling that visit a routine appointment. And Jen Psaki doesn't seem to be concerned in the least bit."

They want everyone in masks on airplanes, you have to wear a mask when you get on an airplane, and sometimes you have to wear it indoors now even if you are vaccinated, yet they didn't wear them on these private planes. They fly on their private planes to D.C., and they stay in hotels with laundry service, yet they claim hardships. They say sacrifices when they have to wash and hang their wet clothes, sometimes their underwear, in the bathrooms, and they tweet about it. Kamala Harris says if you're exposed you need to quarantine. She met with them on Tuesday, some of them were testing positive at the end of the week. Yet, when the Democrats asked her, when the media asked her, are you going to quarantine? Her spokesperson said she didn't need to do it. I'm looking at polling right now. According to the Convention of State Action and Trafalgar survey, pulling for her is so low, you all. She has 60 percent of the voters think she's not ready to be president and 43 percent of them are Democrats. And where is the media outrage, Greg?"

The media won't cover the story anymore, and every single thing that the Republicans want head after negotiating with them for months is going to be drafted in this bill. So, the question is, where do we go from here? They've got to run on this now. I mean, they already in. The Democratic National Committee is already invested in this. But it was never about Texas, about H.R. 1. It's about better lives in this. They're going to say, look, we tried to fight back in Texas. Even though Politico gave us four Pinocchio's, just like Georgia. We tried to fight. And this is why we have to run on this in the next election. That it has to be a federalized election system. And then that's when you're going to see the voters push back, because if you know anything about southern states, especially the state of Texas, we don't like the feds being involved in our election system.

Now where I think we lie -- well, herein lies the problem. There are Democrats, Joe Manchin and others, that are actually trying to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. Now the John Lewis Voting Rights Act as a rename of the 1965 Voting Rights Act that was passed by LBJ, that was re- passed by Ronald Reagan, that was signed by George H.W. Bush, that was signed by George W. Bush. It is a very basic piece of law that was -- that has been bipartisan ever since. What it says, in states where there is actual voter suppression, a history of voter suppression, that there should be preclearance by the Justice Department for new voter rules. This bill can get passed. Right? This bill has bipartisan support in the Senate, it needs 10 votes. It's very close to getting that. I think the story creates a mass.

Her grandmother came on Fox & Friends this morning and said, I hope whoever shot her will go to sleep for the rest of her lives and always think about her, and think about her when they wake up in the morning, and turn themselves in.

After mocking us every single day when we were talking about crime, and Don Lemon and Chris Cuomo, mocking us for caring about black on black crime, and joking about it. Actually, joking about it. And then finally admitting it had a political ramification. Not a moral one. So now, now you have it happening at a baseball game, where the press are, and that was shocking. And their families got scared, and it's a terrible experience. But now they are reacting because it hurt them intimately and now, they understand how other people feel. The problem with the press right now, and how they deal with crime, is that they are so divorced from it. On Canal Street on Saturday, at 10.30 in the morning, the Asian mother and her son were thrown down a flight of stairs. She's in critical condition, her head is bashed in. The guy is still on the loose. The press doesn't really cover it, they don't care because you know what. They don't know them. They don't know them. But they know the professional athletes. They have tickets to that game, so that's why that was so important to them. I really think the reason why people aren't covering this stuff, it's this demonization by association. If we come out against crime, they can be on our side. So they have to step away and go, hold on, you know, maybe this is racist. Right?

Biden and company and all the liberal lemmings they are neither your friend nor your ally. They want to control you, and they will, if you don't get on board with what they are doing, they will call you a murderer, in essence. I know that Biden walked that back, but this is essentially what Jen Psaki said last week, oh, if you're bothered by the White House trampling on the Constitution, the First Amendment, censoring speech online, government overreach, well then somehow you want people to die from COVID, that that's the choice. And it's threatening language. It's -- you know, they're trying -- they're doing what all fascists do as Karol Markowicz would say, every fascist always has a great reason why they want to shut down information and speech. It's always for your own good. I will add one last thing. Anybody who wants to talk about the vaccine blame game, let's start with Kamala Harris and her fear-mongering about the vaccine in the kind of anti -- the kind of anti-vax science denier last year talking about the Trump vaccine. Joe Biden did it. Andy Cuomo did it. So, if they're talking about people not getting vaccinated, it is on the Biden administration's shoulders because it started last year."

And like you guys said this morning, Ainsley on the show, you, Steve, and Brian talked about if you have a chance to get this vaccine, please get this vaccine because I don't want to see another American lose their life, whether it be because of misinformation, whether it be because you hate the Democrats, whether it because you hate me, because I'm a Democrat, whether because you don't like your doctor. It really doesn't matter. The information is out there, go to the CDC Web site. Read up on it.

We have the information in front of us. Now it's up to you to decide. I'm OK with Facebook putting everything on there, and then I can flip through all the research, I can print out the articles, and I can make a decision that's best for my family, I can sit down with my doctor. What was best for me was to get the vaccine. I don't know if it's offered to my daughter. I'll have to have conversations with her doctor whether or not that's going to be best for her and what that means for her down the road. But I get to make that decision. And that's what is great about America. They're giving us the information. And listen, there's the lady who's pregnant who says I'm going to wait till after the baby is born because I'm worried. There's the lady that has that rare disease, and her doctor said you are not getting this. And that's their decision. So, I think we have all the information now.

The problem here is the inconsistent messaging here, right? If the vaccine works, it should be in the story. But now, it's become dot, dot, dot variable after variable.

Every time an expert comes up and says there's a new variant, the masks come back on. So, it may not end. The solution is, you know, if you're -- if you want to wear a mask, wear a mask. If you're vaccinated, and you don't want to wear a mask, don't wear a mask. If a store says they don't want you and there, you go, fine, I'm not going to go there. But I know that you know, a year and a half ago, you know, everybody's concerned about facts and information. I'm going to say what I said and I still hold by it, there are two major risk factors, age and weight. You can only control one of those. So, if you -- if you -- if we have a new threat to our lives for the rest of our lives, you have to be responsible about your physical health. You have to look in the mirror and go, well, you know what, maybe it's time that I get on a routine, that I start losing weight, because people -- you know, obesity, when you talk to any doctor, that's up there, right?

Bravo to the 35 graduates. That's my group there. They were great. And so, they are -- they're going to do bright things from all across the country, from California, from Alabama, from Georgia, from Texas. They're from all over and they spent a week with us in Piney Point, Maryland where we train them on everything it takes to be a candidate. They were from both sides of the aisle. It's amazing.
