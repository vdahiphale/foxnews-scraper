For months, we've heard Democrats and a few wimpy Republicans claim that because of this virus, we all have to get used to a new normal. But I don't think they anticipated that there were tens of millions of Americans who liked the old normal, thank you very much and aren't about to lie down to let you take it away from us.",

We're more than capable, were the stars of this party. Laura, this is not the party of John McCain and Mitt Romney anymore. They would never have a convention when people were talking about the opioid crisis or workers in the Midwest, or they need to confront China or hit the immigration challenge head on say these are wonderful immigrants. We're for illegal immigration. It's not illegal immigration. That's a different subject   And so, it's a very different party. It's more of a populace workers party and when -- they didn't get -- I'm for capital gains reduction (INAUDIBLE) privatizing Social Security. But those aren't the issues today. And they're not talking about those things. That's an elite aristocratic party. This is more of a working party. The other thing is that I know there was criticism of Donald Trump, but he was ubiquitous.  His presence is everywhere. He's energy in motion. And when you look in that are contrasted with Joe Biden. And he's not really, he's a virtual candidate in a virtual campaign in a virtual election. He's not really there anymore. There is no there there for Joe Biden, and Trump is trying to emphasize it. Whatever you think of him, he doesn't sleep. He's in motion. He's orchestrating everything, and it makes it strong -- makes a strong parallel, I think.

We're more than capable, were the stars of this party. Laura, this is not the party of John McCain and Mitt Romney anymore. They would never have a convention when people were talking about the opioid crisis or workers in the Midwest, or they need to confront China or hit the immigration challenge head on say these are wonderful immigrants. We're for illegal immigration. It's not illegal immigration. That's a different subject And so, it's a very different party. It's more of a populace workers party and when -- they didn't get -- I'm for capital gains reduction (INAUDIBLE) privatizing Social Security. But those aren't the issues today. And they're not talking about those things. That's an elite aristocratic party. This is more of a working party. The other thing is that I know there was criticism of Donald Trump, but he was ubiquitous. His presence is everywhere. He's energy in motion. And when you look in that are contrasted with Joe Biden. And he's not really, he's a virtual candidate in a virtual campaign in a virtual election. He's not really there anymore. There is no there there for Joe Biden, and Trump is trying to emphasize it. Whatever you think of him, he doesn't sleep. He's in motion. He's orchestrating everything, and it makes it strong -- makes a strong parallel, I think.

But Abby Johnson, formerly with Planned Parenthood. Tonight, watch."

You think of Ralph Northam saying, the governor of Virginia saying, oh, we'll keep them comfortable if the baby's born alive. And then you heard her testimony. Would the Bush's or Mitt Romney have given such a prominent platform to that message, Sara?"

This is a party that cares about the American people, about the American worker, about the principles and the values of life. That is drastically different than the Republican Party that was hijacked for so long, by the Bush's, by the McCain's, by others. They didn't focus in on these issues of the American worker, the American people, the right to life. Here's the first president, the first president who has stood up and stood up proudly for the right to life for our children that are dying. And the first president that has pointed out, that has pointed out that children have been dying by the thousands, particularly in minority communities from abortion. I think that we need to stop being so silent and I think that the first -- these first two days of convention that this idea of silent majority no longer exists. I feel Americans are unsilent now and we're just -- we're being able to speak out and move forward."

And I can tell you that we had a death struggle at the convention four years ago. And yesterday when we -- when we did our nomination, it was smooth as silk. This is the new party and it's an energetic party. It's a different party.

No gang of thugs should ever be allowed to burn American buildings, destroy our history, or threaten American citizens. But you all should be able to go to a restaurant without some punk getting an inch from your face screaming demands, whatever the demands. The Democrats do have big plans for America, which are going to force you all to your knees, begging for government help. Maybe you'll try to call the police but they won't be there anymore. All you want is to live your life in freedom and safety. But until the Democrats stop and delve, the left's obsession with socialism, violence, intimidation and you bet intolerance, they cannot be trusted to govern this country. Joining me now, Rudy Giuliani, Former New York City Mayor. Rudy -- Kenosha, Wisconsin, another democrat city being put to the torch by Black Lives Matter-inspired protesters. They're not protesters. These people are criminals who are lighting, businesses on fire. You see people crying in tears. This would not have happened in a city that you were mayor of, or if Scott Walker was still Governor of Wisconsin, I don't think it would be happening. What are Democrat officials doing tonight to stop this?"

The image of Democratic officials bending their knee to Black Lives Matter is a very, very powerful image and it's correct. I can't think of a single democratic mayor or governor that's taken this on. I mean, their cities are being destroyed. New York is being destroyed. Portland is being destroyed. Chicago has been destroyed for the last 10 years. I mean, you just don't have a city when you have 70 or 80 shootings a weekend. And these are all democrat cities. Philadelphia has become number two in murders in the country. Baltimore. Unbelievable. I interviewed Kimberly (INAUDIBLE) --"

These are all Democrat cities because of Democrat policies. I know that because I took over a Democrat City, and I reversed the policies in 30 years. And the problem with this is if you let it go too far, New York City got to 1000 murders in 1968. It took 30 years to get below that and we went way up to 2400. So, you let this go too long, it's going to set in and it's beginning to go to the suburbs. The confrontation with the McCloskeys is in the suburbs. The last three nights in Portland, they've moved out into the suburbs. So, they come in, and it's in their plan to do that. So, I really think this is a critical election, in terms of is this country going to go back to high crime, tremendous violence, challenging who we are and what we are, trying to destroy our way of life, or are we going to make reaffirmation of who we are as Americans in a new way, a new generation. I agree with your panelists. I think the speakers tonight and last night -- I remember last night, you know, Vernon Jones, and Kimberly, and now, tonight, and Senator Scott Cameron tonight, and then remarkably young people, Natalie Hart. Just think of all the young people that we have in our party. All you saw in their party of people that have been in office, you know, Pelosi has been in office since before George Washington. And I mean it's, it's ridiculous they got a bunch of people who are worn out, out there. They don't even have their own solutions anymore. They've gone to Socialism."

You, Fox News, whatever it is, it's never solutions. It's always demonization. Rudy, thank you so much for your analysis. Thank you always. And you know, those roving mobs that are terrorizing the country that the media, they pretend they don't exist, right? Well, the voters are watching, but they're not buying what the media is hiding from them. They see what's really going on. Next, we talked to a Kenosha, Wisconsin man whose friend was beaten and whose charity destroyed by BLM anarchists just last night, stay there."

The latest manifestation of all of this is in Kenosha, Wisconsin, where Black Lives Matter anarchists aren't just targeting businesses, they're now targeting and I kid you not, charities. Rioters burned down a lodge belonging to the Danish Brotherhood Charitable Group, but not before one of the Brotherhood's members was brutally beaten trying to defend it."

Your reaction to that very quickly."

There's plenty of residents, especially in Kenosha at this time that are definitely -- they're very much disappointed to him. I know some pretty ardent Democrats that even mentioned that they would never, never support him again in any election."

It's been happening all over the country. And not doing this, not having a clear statement puts lives at risk. Congressman Steve Scalise joins me now, also with me, Raymond Arroyo Fox News Contributor. All right, Congressman, you've seen firsthand what ignoring violent actions can lead to. Your reaction tonight seeing these pictures."

Again, that is not a peaceful protest, despite what some in the media want to say. I mean, there's a way to protest. And then there's people that just have no respect for, for others or for personal property. And, and the fact that some of these democrat mayors continue to let their own cities be burned down. For goodness sake, I mean, this is something that President Trump doesn't tolerate. Joe Biden sits on the sidelines. They never addressed this at the Democratic Convention last week, because they're afraid to stand up to these mobs. And, like I think most people are fed up with that. It's got to end and at least we've got a president who actually respects safety and security of people that want to, you know, want to just make sure that they can be safe in their own homes."

There was only one pool report, it said that Biden was out riding his bike. We've seen that earlier in the month. This time he had a helmet on that was the big news of the day. There's nothing being said. The beautiful thing about what we saw tonight, maybe groundbreaking was a familiarity and comfort with faith that ran from the Jon Voight film cleared through to John Ponder, the man who reformed his life after prison right through the end with Melania Trump. A comfort with faith and the linking that to tradition and heritage and protecting your city and the statues and the things that you reflect what we love about America. That was at the heart of tonight's man."

Now, Michelle said it's the people's house too, but the fact that she made that point now."

      "utterance": "I do. I mean, look, what you're seeing is, is the, you know, those of us that have been speaking in the message in general, has been just boldly embracing what conservatism is, you know, in the Ronald Reagan era of being proud to be a conservative and fighting for the values and belief of this country. Look, Melania Trump fled communism and socialism. God help us if they try to bring that here. You know, she left a country like so many others did, to come to a place where freedom is cherished. And there's some people that want to take those freedoms away. That's what this election is about in November. We've got to talk about it. The fact that they literally want to kill a baby who's born alive outside the womb and call it abortion. It's murder, Laura, and that's what the Born Alive Act is about. And by the way, almost every single Democrat in Congress has voted to allow that baby to be murdered. I mean, that's where their party is. They're no longer the party that wants abortion to be rare but legal. They literally want taxpayer funding of abortion on demand, including when the baby's born alive. Their party is not anything like your grandfather or your father, or Joe Biden's Democratic Party."

Sorry, it's so short tonight.

Horace Cooper, Project 21, Co-Chair, Author of \"How Trump is Making Black AMERICA Great Again,\" and Niger Innis, Chairman of the Congress of Racial Equality. Niger, explain why you think there is that potential for Donald Trump?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "NIGER INNIS, CHAIRMAN, CONGRESS OF RACIAL EQUALITY",
      "utterance": "Well, before the COVID crisis, there was some polls showing that Trump could get as high as 30 percent of the black vote. Now, I think that was a little, little far- fetched. But I think the fact that he could double his percentage from eight to 15 percent, that is very much within the realm of possibility with the type of convention and the type of efforts that he's making in the African American community. That Ponder moment, when Ponder got pardoned and started to break down and cry. That is -- it has so much resonance in urban America all across the country. So, I do think that the black Hispanic gains that Trump is going to make is going to offset the loss with white educated voters, if indeed there is one."

We had a very diverse group of Americans just speaking from the heart about their own experiences. Does this diversity bust the media narrative about the GOP as a white-only party? HORACE COOPER, CO-CHAIR, PROJECT 21: Well, absolutely it does. And it's precisely because in a nation of more than 300 million people, it's easy to get millions of excited people who happen to be black. Now, I actually am a lot more excited about the prospects coming into this election than my good friend, Niger. I think we are on track to see record-breaking levels of support and that's because of school choice. That's because of pro-life, that's because people love the idea of a president standing up for hardworking Americans. That's good with blacks, whites and browns."
