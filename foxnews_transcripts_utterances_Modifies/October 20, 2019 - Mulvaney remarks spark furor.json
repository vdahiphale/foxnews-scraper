Now, the video shown at the American Prosperity (ph) Conference at Trump's Miami Golf Club was created and promoted by conservative online provocateurs with ties to the White House, one said it was clearly satirical.

Apparently, there was this quick exchange with Joe Biden where he said, you know, I hope you know what you're doing. Yes, I think he knew what he was doing. He was cashing in on who his father was at the time. And I just think that from the media perspective we went through this whole charade when Hillary Clinton was running in 2016 that some of the stuff with the Clinton Foundation didn't look -- again, there's a difference between ethical and what's illegal -- it didn't look preposterous. Bill Clinton getting these checks from different foreign entities while he's supposed to be running a charity, and then the donations completely collapsed in 2016.

Now, just a personal note, I was here late the other night covering the Democratic debate going on the air, but I had another TV going, and it had the Washington Nationals game. And I was watching as the Nats beat the Cardinals to get into the World Series, and I got to say, at times the game packed a lot more punch than the three-hour CNN debate. I kept turning off the sound, turning on the sound. Don't tell anybody. But the reason this is such a big deal when I moved to D.C., there was no baseball team. There was no baseball team here for 33 years. The last time there was a Washington franchise in the World Series, 1933. You know who threw out the first ball? FDR. So, it's been a long time coming and I was watching Chris Wallace's show \"Fox News Sunday,\" and he had a special guest come out. You see Teddy Roosevelt; he is one of the four presidents who make the rounds at the Nationals game. So, World Series fever here at the nation's capital. Forget about all this other stuff.

We do so whether it's the grant-making process, whether it's things that have gone through the congressional process and others. But the real core of this question is about the president doing that connected to his own political domestic experience here and wanting to get something out of Ukraine that would benefit him politically, not the broader concerns that have been existent across multiple administrations about the level of corruption that we've seen historically in Ukraine."

And by the way, there are all these leaks now about, oh, President Trump is considering replacing him, this is what happens when you get in trouble. Let me move on to the media going completely and totally bonkers, Sharyl, over Donald Trump's decision to hold next year's G-7 at the Doral Country Club near Miami, your home state, calling itself dealing. He has now pulled the plug. He actually put out a tweet saying that he was reversing his decision based on both media and Democrat crazed and irrational hostility. This was pretty widely condemned.

There's more to it than just the fact that President Trump is obviously wrong. Sometimes maybe he is, but there's more to it. But I do think there is a school of thought -- I'm not saying this is the case -- that President Trump knows how to throw hand grenades into the mix to get a discussion about something else going a certain way. And he knew that the media and the public's head would spin off its body once this was announced, and indeed it did."

This is not something that should surprise us at this point. And, frankly, you know, the degradation of this relationship has been a long time coming.

I think the frustrating thing is that the country's leaders can't even have a civil meeting about Syria, that was the topic of the meeting, without it degenerating into -- certainly, there were some insults and mutual charges of meltdown. So let us talk a little bit about the impeachment coverage. Ben, this week, we had testimony where John Bolton was quoted by another diplomat as having called Rudy Giuliani a hand grenade when it came to Ukraine. Ambassador Gordon Sondland, who was Trump's guy and was defending him, told the House he was disappointed when Trump told him to work with Giuliani on Ukraine. His own people have caused the president some damage. But what about republican complaints that the Democrats are doing all this behind closed doors, confidential, and then leaking out selected tidbits to make the other side look bad?"

      "speaker": "DOMENECH",

And one of the things that we're seeing right now, obviously, in polled evidence is that the impeachment number is settling around the same number of whether you approve of the president or not. That's something that I think if Democrats really wanted to change that, if they wanted to see that shift in a way that would favor impeachment, they need to come forward with this stuff. They need to be able to be more transparent, have these conversations in public. And frankly, they're not talking about evidence -- there's no evidence that they're talking about things that need to be classified, that need to be behind closed doors."

You're caught between a lot of different moving parts. And yet the opinion on this all generally that you see going in one direction. And I find that to be really troubling in this day and age that we haven't taken a step back from the last two decades of activity in the Middle East, which clearly the American people have soured on and maybe injected some additional opinions into the mix, opinions that would be more representative of what we see from American people and less just the conventional approach that Washington Republicans have had for years."

So, to say there was no wrong here, there was no wrongdoing is just not in keeping with the facts. And I think that's where you see CNN trying to help effectively make this go away with for the person who's the Democrat front-runner still which that, I do actually find surprising. But Hunter Biden took this job, or got this job, I should say, knowing that it's because of who his father was. The same thing with the job he got in China which, by the way, he just stepped down from that board. And for the media to try to make this go away on behalf of Hunter Biden just adds to the narrative that they're playing favorites and that any resistance era they're not trying to be neutral parties, which I don't think they are."

Apparently, there was this quick exchange with Joe Biden where he said, you know, I hope you know what you're doing. Yes, I think he knew what he was doing. He was cashing in on who his father was at the time. And I just think that from the media perspective we went through this whole charade when Hillary Clinton was running in 2016 that some of the stuff with the Clinton Foundation didn't look -- again, there's a difference between ethical and what's illegal -- it didn't look preposterous. Bill Clinton getting these checks from different foreign entities while he's supposed to be running a charity, and then the donations completely collapsed in 2016.

You know, he'd worked for her at the State Department and after reporting that it felt like a gut punch that Hillary Clinton's people tried to pressure him to stand down against Weinstein who, of course, was one of her big donors.

I think people see this and they, you know, may have experienced something similar in the workplace or they know someone who has experienced something similar in the workplace. And again, because of NDAs. I think one of the issues with NDAs is that it actually prevents the people who know the most about this issue, unfortunately knowing about it because they've been through it, from being able to speak about it. So, I think that there's a lot missing from the conversation. I think these things are shocking because they're being talked about, but they're not really as shocking as many people might think."

Some of them with Lauer accusers. And NBC has been vague about this saying, well, they're just the severance agreements but we don't know like how much money was paid out to these women. And unlike when similar -- when Fox News and CBS and other media analysts grappled with similar problems with misconduct by executives and others here and there, there's been no outside investigation by NBC."

I mean, when people do things that are wrong often times they'll say, not me, I didn't do that. And that's why you do need an outside investigation. I think that if NBC really didn't know, then why not vindicate itself with that outside investigation? But the fact that there's never been one speaks volumes."

      "utterance": "I think that every morning Mark Zuckerberg wakes up, and he has so many problems that he has to deal with, and the perception that the company is biased against conservatives has certainly been something that he had to deal with. You know, back in 2016, you know, one of the things he talks about is part of the response, the dealing with the perceived bias against conservatives was they changed out the whole news tab. And it cost them $100 billion in one day. And he said it was worth it because they really needed to make a change. Sometimes that is a problem. I do think that he takes it very seriously because he knows that a lot of conservatives are on Facebook and --"

But about a month ago, Facebook put out a policy that said we are going to take a stand and make a policy that politicians should be able to put out their information and that we are not going to decide what is true and what is false.

So, for example, are they going to get into a situation where every time Senator Warren puts out an ad about Medicare for all and she describes how she would pay for it and let's say somebody from the Trump campaign says that's not true, you should take that ad down, I mean, this would be a never ending saga. And I think what Mark Zuckerberg is saying is let's take a step back. Bigger picture. Is America for free speech? Is that one of our greatest values?"

    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "Well, I think anybody who has a company doesn't want it to be broken up, they don't want to be called a monopoly and they will try to make arguments against it. Mark Zuckerberg says he absolutely will try to do that. I think for some people you'd think, well, why would you break up Facebook? Like, are a hundred more Facebooks is that going to be better? is that going to be better for competition? Possibly. But I think they're going to have a really hard time making that argument unless President Trump decides to get behind it because there could be bipartisan support for it."

You don't see him very often. It's not his natural habitat. He's very polite. He is so thoughtful. He is a genius. But going out and doing media interviews is not something that he likes to do, so we really appreciated that he gave Fox News an exclusive interview and so much time in order to ask him lots of -- lots of different questions."

Now, just a personal note, I was here late the other night covering the Democratic debate going on the air, but I had another TV going, and it had the Washington Nationals game. And I was watching as the Nats beat the Cardinals to get into the World Series, and I got to say, at times the game packed a lot more punch than the three-hour CNN debate. I kept turning off the sound, turning on the sound. Don't tell anybody. But the reason this is such a big deal when I moved to D.C., there was no baseball team. There was no baseball team here for 33 years. The last time there was a Washington franchise in the World Series, 1933. You know who threw out the first ball? FDR. So, it's been a long time coming and I was watching Chris Wallace's show \"Fox News Sunday,\" and he had a special guest come out. You see Teddy Roosevelt; he is one of the four presidents who make the rounds at the Nationals game. So, World Series fever here at the nation's capital. Forget about all this other stuff. I'll be back here next Sunday morning. We hope you'll join us 11 Eastern. See you then with the latest Buzz. Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
