And the Senate is coming up with a great plan. And they're going to be put together, and something is going to come out of that, that will be, I think, really, really something very special.   NEIL CAVUTO, \"YOUR WORLD\" HOST: All right, the president referring to the official release tomorrow of the House Ways and Means plan that will finally put numbers and brackets and levels to those brackets on the tax cut that he says will be the biggest ever in American history. That is, of course, in the eye of the beholder. It will certainly be the biggest we have seen in a generation here.  To South Dakota Republican Senator John Thune, a member of the Senate Finance Committee. Senator, we're already told that the rich might have to gulp a little bit and look at their rates staying the same. Are you OK with that?",
