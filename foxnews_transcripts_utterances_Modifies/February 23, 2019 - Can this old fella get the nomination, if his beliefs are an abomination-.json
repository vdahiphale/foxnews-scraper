Thanks for the card, Aunt Edna and the $10.00, but Smollett was the perfect victim for a media that wanted this so badly to be true. So why are these hoaxes so common? Here's my thinking. All of those folks who went to college in the last decade or so are now employed in the media, and they brought with them the victimhood virus they were infected with on campus. The virus makes you stupid, na<ve, gullible, did I say stupid? Yes, I did. Anyway, some people are sad Smollett was a hoax. Not me, I'm always thrilled when a hate crime turns out to be false.  Which means I'm thrilled a lot. It means that we aren't as racist as the media wants us to be. And we live in a country where hate crimes have to be made up because the demand for hate crimes exceeds the supply. But if you're still sad, this was a hoax, it is only because it exposes how your activist bias set you up as a willing stooge. The media owns this story. It's like they took a course on it.",

Thanks for the card, Aunt Edna and the $10.00, but Smollett was the perfect victim for a media that wanted this so badly to be true. So why are these hoaxes so common? Here's my thinking. All of those folks who went to college in the last decade or so are now employed in the media, and they brought with them the victimhood virus they were infected with on campus. The virus makes you stupid, na<ve, gullible, did I say stupid? Yes, I did. Anyway, some people are sad Smollett was a hoax. Not me, I'm always thrilled when a hate crime turns out to be false. Which means I'm thrilled a lot. It means that we aren't as racist as the media wants us to be. And we live in a country where hate crimes have to be made up because the demand for hate crimes exceeds the supply. But if you're still sad, this was a hoax, it is only because it exposes how your activist bias set you up as a willing stooge. The media owns this story. It's like they took a course on it."

      "utterance": "I love it. I think it's great. Fencing is like an old guard. The sport has kind of fallen back into like, like, really, really rich people do to their brat kids they don't want to see. So I think it's cool. I think it opens up. I wouldn't mind seeing lightsabers at the Olympics. Why not?"

      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "Right. Yes, so there's a nerd Olympics now, essentially, where all these nerds can just poke at each other with their nerd sticks and that's a sport. Okay, I guess there's one good thing about this and that is that all these Star Wars super fans will finally have a reason to come out of their mom's basements. However, I'm a little concerned about all the Cheeto dust that's going get on all the equipment because these people do not eat anything that does not come out of a vending machine."

      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "Like somebody who has seen \"Star Wars.\" I've never seen \"Star Wars.\" I'm far too cool."

      "utterance": "Sure."

      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "Yes, exactly. Everybody can invent sports. I invented a sport called Greg ball. That's where I have a ball and you pay me $100.00 and I give it to you. It's also stickball and racquetball, but it's the same concept with the racket or the stick. I'm going to shut up now because frankly, I'm boring myself. Don't forget the \"Gutfeld Monologues Live,\" it continues next weekend in Florida. Tickets are still available for Sunday, March 3rd in West Palm Beach. Go to ggutfeld.com for ticket info. \"Final Thoughts\" are next."
