      "sentences": "All right, Tucker. Great show as always. Welcome to “Hannity.”  Breaking tonight, there was no collusion. Where is the media? A bipartisan committee of Senate Democrats and Republicans found zero evidence of wrongdoing by the Trump campaign. We are going to bring you all the details coming up along with several other important deep state updates, including now, criminal referrals, finally, for FISA abuse. Oh, and other people on the left actually lied it to Congress, too, what will they be getting predawn raids with 27 people, and amphibious vehicles, full on gear?  But, first, we need to tackle what is the garbage, new, compromise, supposedly, surrounding border security. And tonight's HANNITY watch on building the wall and keeping the government open.  So, we have a bipartisan congressional committee. They have agreed to allocate a whopping oh, $1.375 billion for new border wall construction. That pales in comparison to the president's request for a $5.7 billion, but funding approximately 55 miles of new wall, construction on a border that is 2,000 miles long. And we haven't seen the language, nor has the White House, sources telling me it is still being worked out. But if Democrats going to put a lot of restrictions on wall construction, in other words, it is not really wall money, this is not a bill the president will be able to sign. He will need a clean CR.  Earlier today, here's how the president responded to the initial details of this new budget deal. Take a look.",

It's very simple. So, I can tell you that, am I happy at first glance? I just got to see it. The answer is no. I'm not. I'm not happy.",

      "sentences": "I'm not happy either. Nobody should be happy. The president has every right to be angry. The so-called compromise is typical of the D.C. sewer and swamp, and his level of funding for security and safety of the American people is pathetic. It's almost as if lawmakers in Washington, from the comfort of their own, oh, walled homes, they don't realize the horrors of sex trafficking, even young girls put into prostitution, human trafficking, the drug trafficking, 90 percent of our heroin comes across the southern border. It occurs every single day of every week of every month of every year. It's almost as if they just don't care.  In the past two years alone, criminal, illegal, aliens have been responsible for 100,000 assault charges, 30,000 sexual assault crimes, and 4,000 murders and homicides. It's as if they don't care.   And that yesterday, by the way, 330 illegal immigrants, including many unaccompanied minors, were apprehended west of El Paso, where there's no border wall. It is almost as if they don't care about the Angel Moms and Dads that we have interviewed on this very show, children, their kids, senselessly taken by people who crossed of these borders illegally. Have any Democrats actually called any of the families of these victims? Now, it would be perfectly reasonable for President Trump to reject this bill.  Now, there is another solution, maybe even a better solution. I'm not as concerned or some other conservatives if the president signs the bill, but there are a couple of ifs. Step one, the president decides he wants to sign the compromise, which would guarantee the $1.375 billion down payment for the wall, OK, that money can be used immediately. Now, if he takes step two, which is the president utilizing money he has identified, some $900 million, for additional construction, that is already available for the administration's discretion. That would be about $2.3 billion, but the important third step needs to happen simultaneously. And that would be the president would need to declare a national emergency. This is the time. That is a necessity.  And the president, I think I know him very well, telegraphed that very thing just today. He just heard him indicate a common plan that he would find the other monies, on top of whatever Congress gives him. That would allow the administration to access to billions more in wall funding.  By the way, the national emergency would be challenged, as we always see with the Democrats, a little judge shopping in California or Oregon or Hawaii, and then they'll go to the Ninth Circuit, and then because of all of the constitutional issues involved, being number one in emergency, separation of powers, the president's role as our commander-in-chief, I think the president is on very firm legal grounds given the national security risks that are stemming from a poor southern border. Additionally, the president has even further authority, which the Supreme Court, I'm sure, would look at, and that would be a real law. Ten USC 284, that gives the president, in other words, the executive branch, the authority for the construction of roads and fences and the installation of lighting to block drug smuggling corridors across international boundaries of the United States. Now, despite what the haters on both sides of the aisle are telling you, remember before 2015, I always shoot straight with you, I have known this president for over two decades, and I told everybody, went out on a limb, and said he is going to keep his promises. And that he'd govern as a conservative and that he worked tirelessly to improve the country paired the biggest tax cuts, ending burdens of regulation, he is two originalists on the Supreme Court. Yes, I was right, the haters, the never-Trumpers are wrong. And that's exactly what he's done.  And I'm telling you right now, it's not going to be any different with securing our nation's borders. He is tenacious, and he will fight to get that wall build. And guess what? The vast majority of the American people, look at the CBS News poll, they support him, 72 percent of Americans agree with the president and his policies on immigration.   And by the way, some good news breaking also tonight. The president just tweeted, quote: was just presented the concept and parameters of the border security deal. We'll be getting almost $23 billion for border security, regardless of what they give us -- meaning Congress -- wall money. It is being built as we speak. Let me interpret that for embers of Congress on the hate-Trump media. It sounds like a national emergency is going to be declared, but I have no insider information. So, Democrats have agreed to over $1.3 billion, and billions, by the way, more for border security, and Democrats are now agreeing to fund something, by the way -- this is amazing, because they were referring to building walls as immoral just a short time ago. Now they are funding these immoral behaviors. Watch this.",

You know, for the Democrats, this is all one big political game, life and death, safety security.

Nothing Trumps hating Trump. The president fighting a life-and-death battle, the Democrats fighting for virtually nothing here, except that which they supported a couple of years ago. The president now has rightly made protecting our nation's borders and preserving American life his number one priority. We all know the statistics. Radical socialist Democrats, they are calling walls immoral. They now advocate even for infanticide during the birth process, nine months into pregnancy, calling for a ban of most forms of electricity, the lifeblood of our economy, fossil fuels, pushing an end to the consumption of meat because cows' flatulence, and yes, being associated with some of the most bigoted, hateful anti-Semites in the country.   This party, Democratic extreme radical socialist party, is a real-life dumpster fire, unfolding before our eyes. I told you this would happen.

And let's not forget, 2020 candidate, Senator Spartacus himself, Cory Booker, quickly threw her support behind socialist Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's absurd Green New Deal, which called for an end to all fossil fuels. Oh, we're going to eliminate airplanes, and we're going to have high-speed rail. How are we going to get to Europe? Australia, New Zealand? Trucks, even banning cows. OK, they have lost their minds. And, Booker, by the way, who is an admitted vegan, get this -- I don't make the stuff up, either -- he is trying to justify this insanity, this platform, telling a vegan magazine, this world cannot sustain people eating meat, only rich people he talks about eating meat. Are Democrats really trying to take a White House on a platform of banning meat, airplanes, fossil fuels -- oh, and rebuilding every house in America? The same party that is now for infanticide. At the same party that won't stand up to what happened, I believe -- oh, even sexual assault allegations and rape allegation, if it is a member of their own party, many won't say I believe now.  I don't take my work for it in the case of Booker. He recently compared tackling the scourge of cow flatulence and other forms of carbon pollutants to our efforts during World War II. This would be a joke, but they are serious. So lock your freezers, save your meat now. You may need it. It will be very valuable, a great investment for years to come.  And now, even Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell rightly planning to put other Democrats on record. He wants a vote on the Green New Deal. Good going, Mitch, I want to see if it passes. Let's see what the Democrats vote here, because it will tell you everything, on paper, just how radical and extreme the socialist party have now become. Rampant socialism, which guarantees, oh, a job, a vacation, housing, health care -- oh, it will take away your private insurance. And everything else that it promises to do, whether you are willing or unwilling to work, is not only concerning ideology and the rise of the Democratic Party, now another scary form of extremism is not going away. That is the rise of anti-Semitism in the halls of Congress. Recently, far left Democratic Congresswoman Omar made a series of anti- Semitic tweets while spreading an anti-Israel conspiracy theory, apologizing only for that one, fending Jewish people, but she is retaining her position, get this, on the Foreign Affairs Committee. President Trump to not calling her to resign.  But known anti-Semite Linda Sarsour, remember her? She is rushing to Congresswoman Omar's defense, no surprise there. Linda Sarsour is a friend of Kirsten Gillibrand, running for president. We will keep you focused on the bigotry of the left every single night, and hold these people accountable and we'll have our HANNITY Watch regularly. Now, we turn to some other breaking news tonight, President Trump tweeted a big thank you to conspiracy theory TV MSNBC, who was forced to come clean about their Russian collusion conspiracy theories, which they have been peddling for two straight years.

A bipartisan committee of Senate Democrats and Republicans found zero evidence of wrongdoing by the Trump campaign. We are going to bring you all the details coming up along with several other important deep state updates, including now, criminal referrals, finally, for FISA abuse. Oh, and other people on the left actually lied it to Congress, too, what will they be getting predawn raids with 27 people, and amphibious vehicles, full on gear? But, first, we need to tackle what is the garbage, new, compromise, supposedly, surrounding border security. And tonight's HANNITY watch on building the wall and keeping the government open. So, we have a bipartisan congressional committee. They have agreed to allocate a whopping oh, $1.375 billion for new border wall construction. That pales in comparison to the president's request for a $5.7 billion, but funding approximately 55 miles of new wall, construction on a border that is 2,000 miles long. And we haven't seen the language, nor has the White House, sources telling me it is still being worked out. But if Democrats going to put a lot of restrictions on wall construction, in other words, it is not really wall money, this is not a bill the president will be able to sign. He will need a clean CR. Earlier today, here's how the president responded to the initial details of this new budget deal. Take a look."

But I'm adding things to it, and when you add whatever I have to add, it's all -- it's all going to happen, we are going to build a beautiful, big, strong wall that's not going to let criminals and traffickers and drug dealers and drugs into our country. It's very simple. So, I can tell you that, am I happy at first glance? I just got to see it. The answer is no. I'm not. I'm not happy."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "I'm not happy either. Nobody should be happy. The president has every right to be angry. The so-called compromise is typical of the D.C. sewer and swamp, and his level of funding for security and safety of the American people is pathetic. It's almost as if lawmakers in Washington, from the comfort of their own, oh, walled homes, they don't realize the horrors of sex trafficking, even young girls put into prostitution, human trafficking, the drug trafficking, 90 percent of our heroin comes across the southern border. It occurs every single day of every week of every month of every year. It's almost as if they just don't care. In the past two years alone, criminal, illegal, aliens have been responsible for 100,000 assault charges, 30,000 sexual assault crimes, and 4,000 murders and homicides. It's as if they don't care. And that yesterday, by the way, 330 illegal immigrants, including many unaccompanied minors, were apprehended west of El Paso, where there's no border wall. It is almost as if they don't care about the Angel Moms and Dads that we have interviewed on this very show, children, their kids, senselessly taken by people who crossed of these borders illegally. Have any Democrats actually called any of the families of these victims? Now, it would be perfectly reasonable for President Trump to reject this bill. Now, there is another solution, maybe even a better solution. I'm not as concerned or some other conservatives if the president signs the bill, but there are a couple of ifs. Step one, the president decides he wants to sign the compromise, which would guarantee the $1.375 billion down payment for the wall, OK, that money can be used immediately. Now, if he takes step two, which is the president utilizing money he has identified, some $900 million, for additional construction, that is already available for the administration's discretion. That would be about $2.3 billion, but the important third step needs to happen simultaneously. And that would be the president would need to declare a national emergency. This is the time. That is a necessity. And the president, I think I know him very well, telegraphed that very thing just today. He just heard him indicate a common plan that he would find the other monies, on top of whatever Congress gives him. That would allow the administration to access to billions more in wall funding. By the way, the national emergency would be challenged, as we always see with the Democrats, a little judge shopping in California or Oregon or Hawaii, and then they'll go to the Ninth Circuit, and then because of all of the constitutional issues involved, being number one in emergency, separation of powers, the president's role as our commander-in-chief, I think the president is on very firm legal grounds given the national security risks that are stemming from a poor southern border. Additionally, the president has even further authority, which the Supreme Court, I'm sure, would look at, and that would be a real law. Ten USC 284, that gives the president, in other words, the executive branch, the authority for the construction of roads and fences and the installation of lighting to block drug smuggling corridors across international boundaries of the United States. Now, despite what the haters on both sides of the aisle are telling you, remember before 2015, I always shoot straight with you, I have known this president for over two decades, and I told everybody, went out on a limb, and said he is going to keep his promises. And that he'd govern as a conservative and that he worked tirelessly to improve the country paired the biggest tax cuts, ending burdens of regulation, he is two originalists on the Supreme Court. Yes, I was right, the haters, the never-Trumpers are wrong. And that's exactly what he's done. And I'm telling you right now, it's not going to be any different with securing our nation's borders. He is tenacious, and he will fight to get that wall build. And guess what? The vast majority of the American people, look at the CBS News poll, they support him, 72 percent of Americans agree with the president and his policies on immigration."

We'll be getting almost $23 billion for border security, regardless of what they give us -- meaning Congress -- wall money. It is being built as we speak. Let me interpret that for embers of Congress on the hate-Trump media. It sounds like a national emergency is going to be declared, but I have no insider information. So, Democrats have agreed to over $1.3 billion, and billions, by the way, more for border security, and Democrats are now agreeing to fund something, by the way -- this is amazing, because they were referring to building walls as immoral just a short time ago.

And let's not forget, 2020 candidate, Senator Spartacus himself, Cory Booker, quickly threw her support behind socialist Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's absurd Green New Deal, which called for an end to all fossil fuels. Oh, we're going to eliminate airplanes, and we're going to have high-speed rail. How are we going to get to Europe? Australia, New Zealand? Trucks, even banning cows. OK, they have lost their minds. And, Booker, by the way, who is an admitted vegan, get this -- I don't make the stuff up, either -- he is trying to justify this insanity, this platform, telling a vegan magazine, this world cannot sustain people eating meat, only rich people he talks about eating meat. Are Democrats really trying to take a White House on a platform of banning meat, airplanes, fossil fuels -- oh, and rebuilding every house in America? The same party that is now for infanticide. At the same party that won't stand up to what happened, I believe -- oh, even sexual assault allegations and rape allegation, if it is a member of their own party, many won't say I believe now. I don't take my work for it in the case of Booker. He recently compared tackling the scourge of cow flatulence and other forms of carbon pollutants to our efforts during World War II. This would be a joke, but they are serious. So lock your freezers, save your meat now. You may need it. It will be very valuable, a great investment for years to come. And now, even Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell rightly planning to put other Democrats on record. He wants a vote on the Green New Deal. Good going, Mitch, I want to see if it passes. Let's see what the Democrats vote here, because it will tell you everything, on paper, just how radical and extreme the socialist party have now become. Rampant socialism, which guarantees, oh, a job, a vacation, housing, health care -- oh, it will take away your private insurance. And everything else that it promises to do, whether you are willing or unwilling to work, is not only concerning ideology and the rise of the Democratic Party, now another scary form of extremism is not going away. That is the rise of anti-Semitism in the halls of Congress. Recently, far left Democratic Congresswoman Omar made a series of anti- Semitic tweets while spreading an anti-Israel conspiracy theory, apologizing only for that one, fending Jewish people, but she is retaining her position, get this, on the Foreign Affairs Committee. President Trump to not calling her to resign. But known anti-Semite Linda Sarsour, remember her? She is rushing to Congresswoman Omar's defense, no surprise there. Linda Sarsour is a friend of Kirsten Gillibrand, running for president. We will keep you focused on the bigotry of the left every single night, and hold these people accountable and we'll have our HANNITY Watch regularly. Now, we turn to some other breaking news tonight, President Trump tweeted a big thank you to conspiracy theory TV MSNBC, who was forced to come clean about their Russian collusion conspiracy theories, which they have been peddling for two straight years. When is that apology coming? Take a look."

But this will stop, hopefully, the influx of heroin, fentanyl, gangs, cartels, those that come here and do commit murder and sexual assaults, and violent assaults, and the Democrats don't seem to care, and the president that I know pretty well, I'm reading him tonight saying, sure, give me the $1.375 million, I have a another 900 million over here, and I'm going to declare a national emergency, and that's it.

The wall is a moral issue, it's immoral to build a wall. Then they offered this $1.375 billion -- whatever it is, that is now a negotiation. It's not a moral issue now. Now, it's a fiscal, financial negotiation. I think the president has already won, and he'll find the money, whether it's in the Defense Department, whether it is in FEMA, wherever he can, he will find the money, already 84 miles of wall being built from the last March's appropriation, now the 55 miles being built with this new money, I think that --"

He keeps his promises. He means what he is saying. I went out on a limb when I said that. I also know him, if he takes this money, he is also going in the back door like he says he is.

Listen, we need the wall. At the wall were expired but primarily bothers me about this conversation about the wall amongst the liberals and some others out there, the RINO class, is they kept saying really dumb talking points. Well, it's all technology. Well, you know, police is old technology, but it's effective, that is why we still use police. It is an obstruction, OK? That's what it's designed to do. It's not a perfect solution. It's a passive security mechanism that obstructs people from just randomly walking into the country. And, Sean, they have never explained how technology is going to supersede that. What is -- let me ask you a simple question, Sean, or, Geraldo, if you have the answer, I love to hear too.

Congressman, this is a big deal, and also on FISA abuse and a lot of other issues, what specifically are you looking at?"

So, we're going to work with the Judiciary Committee and the Oversight Committee, Sean, to ensure that this investigation into FISA abuse and other matters continues. The good thing is that we got through about 15 interviews last year, the task force did, you've covered it extensively on your show. We're going to continue to call people in for interviews. Just last week, the new Chairman of the Committee said that he's going to reopen the Russian investigation. We offered about a dozen subpoenas of people that we wanted to subpoena. We don't expect for them to subpoena the people that we want, but at every attempt that we can, at every opportunity that we get, we will make attempts to subpoena these people to come in and speak. We will also ask for people to voluntarily come in and speak. Look, we need the new Attorney General to get in there and then we will be making criminal referrals on many people who lied to Congress and did other bad things."

As you know, the Trump campaign was so small, it would have been almost impossible for them to collude anyway, even if they wanted to collude. But what is frustrating I think, and we brought this up last week, when Adam Schiff reopened his investigation into the Trump campaign, we said, great are you going to open up the investigation into the Hillary Clinton campaign? Because there we already know that the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic Party were colluding with Russians. They were getting information from Russians, dirt on Trump, that they could then spread throughout the media. That's exactly what they were looking at the Trump campaign supposedly for."

We now know that Bruce Ohr warned everybody at the DoJ and the FBI, and by the way including Andrew Weissmann, Mueller's pitbull, that it was - that it was put together by a Trump hater Christopher Steele, eventually fired for lying and leaking, and Hillary paid for it and it's unverified and uncorroborated, not corroborated. So, the question is, it was used four times and signed off. What about all those people that signed off on a document that they never verified?"

But really, if there's not reforms done to the FISA process, if accountability is not delivered in this matter, I think it's going to be very hard for Americans who don't want to be less secure, right. We Republicans have supported these programs for many, many years. However, I doubt right now that you'd find very many votes to support the continuation of FISA programs, if there's - if it's going to be political, and there's got to be some guarantees that this process is not going to be political in the future and that those people who--"

It's not just that they used the dossier, it's not just that the dossier made up most of the FISA, it's also everything else that they did. So, it's how they lied, it's how they obstructed our investigation, and then it's - and how they - if you remember, people forget about this. People went out and said, well the dossier didn't have anything to do with it, there was all this other stuff. We went out and looked at all that other stuff and that's what we've been asking the President to declassify, because we believe that what is - that makes up that so-called other stuff is also equally as bad as using political dirt."

This unsurprising news comes as newly released emails show the FBI was scrambling how to respond to Hillary Clinton's lawyer amid the Weiner laptop review, raising questions, direct questions about a quid pro quo about declassifying classified documents.

And the FBI knew about it; it's in the emails from Lisa page to this Under Secretary of State, and she sends a copy to Peter Strzok and James Comey and everybody else in the FBI. What do the FBI do? Nothing."
