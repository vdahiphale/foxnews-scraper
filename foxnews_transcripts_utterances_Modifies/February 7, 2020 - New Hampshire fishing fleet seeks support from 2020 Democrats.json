He comes into New Hampshire with some growing momentum.

Well, former Vice President Joe Biden took some time off the campaign trail to prep for a critical chance to win back support after a lackluster performance in the Iowa caucuses. Biden acknowledged Iowa was a gut punch and tonight in a pre-debate call, campaign officials talked fund raising concerns, strategy on the debate stage and in the primary states. And also, a staff shakeup his campaign reorganizing its leadership, elevating within the team.   A former Obama White House Communications Director. It's an important move especially for donors. Biden started the year with a smaller war chest than any of his main rivals. He also faces pressure ahead from mega billionaire candidate Michael Bloomberg who pitches himself as a Biden alternative and begins his campaign in earnest Super Tuesday. Tonight, Biden will try to wrestle the spotlight away from Senator Bernie Sanders and former Mayor Pete Buttigieg who are locked in a virtual tie both declaring victory after the Iowa caucuses separated by only a tenth of a percentage point. Buttigieg in a fundraising email touted his surge of new donors and has seen a recent spike in New Hampshire polls. But Biden like his rivals will also have to pitch himself as the best choice for America against a positive job report out this morning. A good reflection on President Trump. In January, employers added 225,000 jobs more than analysts expected.  A senior Biden official said tonight debate watchers can expect a fiery defiant Biden trying to remind voters that he is the best candidate in a match up against President Trump and also that he is more experienced than Pete Buttigieg and less radical than Bernie Sanders.

Of course, we all know a lot more about Hunter Biden than we would have if Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff had not started this investigation. We also know a lot more about Gordon Sondland and we learned a lot more about Colonel Vindman. For example, Tim Morrison, who was a senior official to Lieutenant Colonel Vindman at the NSC said that Vindman frequently used poor judgment and that he often couldn't trust the conclusions that he came to that information was ripe into a higher degree because of the impeachment. And I think if you looked at Gordon Sondland, no one really viewed him as central to the delivery of U.S. policy. I think we'll still be able to get by in the delivery of United States foreign policy, absent Gordon.  Sondland, he was viewed as a inter meddler and you often heard people talk about how the Gordon problem would emerge as he was outside of the normal work of an EU Ambassador.

Well, former Vice President Joe Biden took some time off the campaign trail to prep for a critical chance to win back support after a lackluster performance in the Iowa caucuses. Biden acknowledged Iowa was a gut punch and tonight in a pre-debate call, campaign officials talked fund raising concerns, strategy on the debate stage and in the primary states. And also, a staff shakeup his campaign reorganizing its leadership, elevating within the team. A former Obama White House Communications Director. It's an important move especially for donors. Biden started the year with a smaller war chest than any of his main rivals. He also faces pressure ahead from mega billionaire candidate Michael Bloomberg who pitches himself as a Biden alternative and begins his campaign in earnest Super Tuesday. Tonight, Biden will try to wrestle the spotlight away from Senator Bernie Sanders and former Mayor Pete Buttigieg who are locked in a virtual tie both declaring victory after the Iowa caucuses separated by only a tenth of a percentage point. Buttigieg in a fundraising email touted his surge of new donors and has seen a recent spike in New Hampshire polls. But Biden like his rivals will also have to pitch himself as the best choice for America against a positive job report out this morning. A good reflection on President Trump. In January, employers added 225,000 jobs more than analysts expected. A senior Biden official said tonight debate watchers can expect a fiery defiant Biden trying to remind voters that he is the best candidate in a match up against President Trump and also that he is more experienced than Pete Buttigieg and less radical than Bernie Sanders.

We believe that we will be very competitive on Tuesday night, but we also believe that Iowa and New Hampshire are part of a package of the first four states and the first four states should be judged together.

The reality is that this isn't - we took some lumps in Iowa. Yes. But this is not the first time Vice President Biden has had to fight. It's not the first time he's been knocked down. I mean he's used to fighting for the things that he wants. So, tonight on the debate stage, you can expect Vice President Biden to draw contrasts between himself and the other candidates on the stage. When it comes to health care, when it comes to experience, when it comes to who's ready to lead on day one. And look, we think voters need to get real about this election. If anybody watched the State of the Union the other night, there are two things that came out of that. One, Donald Trump is going to be really hard to beat actually. But also, number two, we've got to beat Donald Trump. So, we can't take a risk in this election by nominating folks who are not battle tested and there's one thing about Joe Biden, he has been through the ringer. He is battle tested."

You saw him in the morning very fiery and forceful, talking about the need to fight, talking about the contrast between himself and the other candidates. But you also saw him that evening at a town hall for another network where you saw the empathy the Joe Biden that connects with people, the Joe Biden that speaks very passionately and knowledgeably about everything from health care to cancer initiatives, that is the Joe Biden people love and now Ambassador Joe Biden is on the campaign trail this week."

Of course, we all know a lot more about Hunter Biden than we would have if Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff had not started this investigation. We also know a lot more about Gordon Sondland and we learned a lot more about Colonel Vindman. For example, Tim Morrison, who was a senior official to Lieutenant Colonel Vindman at the NSC said that Vindman frequently used poor judgment and that he often couldn't trust the conclusions that he came to that information was ripe into a higher degree because of the impeachment. And I think if you looked at Gordon Sondland, no one really viewed him as central to the delivery of U.S. policy. I think we'll still be able to get by in the delivery of United States foreign policy, absent Gordon. Sondland, he was viewed as a inter meddler and you often heard people talk about how the Gordon problem would emerge as he was outside of the normal work of an EU Ambassador. So, the President has the authority to remove these folks if he chooses to and I think that largely the impeachment--"

I don't think he came out of the impeachment looking like some great diplomat. So, I don't think it's a surprise to see the President choose to make a change there and also Lieutenant Colonel Vindman."

But as that they had some pretty deep policy differences in terms of the way that things should be carried out in Ukraine. And although, Vindman has expressed his sadness at being pushed out of his position tonight, you wonder why he would want to work for the President if he had such deep disagreements with him and thought the way he was handling it was wrong."

      "speaker": "GAETZ",
      "utterance": "Many of the eruptions that gave rise to this impeachment were rooted in policy disagreement, a different approach, a different style, at times even a different outcome for various elements of the Ukraine policy and I can't imagine we would outside of the world of impeachment have the opportunity to really, I think kind of tease at those divisions more than in this impeachment. And so, in this world, I think we were able to see disagreement perhaps some discord between Lieutenant Colonel Vindman and others at the NSC who held a different view. And now we're going to move forward. If you look also at what Mr. O'Brien has done at the NSC. There have been a lot of changes there. It very well may have been the case that Vindman could have been out before impeachment but obviously during impeachment you don't want to make a change like that to make it look like retribution and now, with a lot of changes at the NSC, I think we'll have a better crew."

But I think that you want a President or National Security Adviser that have full confidence in the NSC, if freshening up that team going into this new post-impeachment era is helpful to the country, then I'm all for it. I will say the delivery of U.S. foreign policy is going pretty well. I'm so proud of the President for taking out the al-Qaeda leader in Yemen. That group in Yemen had claimed responsibility for killing my constituents in Pensacola. So, when you look at the foreign policy outcomes, it sure is a great thing."

That's a strong case for the President to make. And he does make it and every rally that he attends.

And by the way, it's not just impeachment. When you listen to the President, he is bitter about the way he has been treated by the Democrats and by the intelligence community throughout his presidency going back before that. I mean he really brings up crossfire hurricane. The investigation, the FBI started into his campaign at the end of July 2016 and it goes on from there to the appointment of Robert Mueller, his firing of James Comey and all of that. So, the President really views this as one big campaign to drive him from office. So, you really saw a lot of the bitterness about that coming out yesterday."

So, certainly wasn't fired, he's not losing his job or anything like that, but he is leaving the National Security Council at the White House, going back to the Pentagon. And a lot of Republicans and this is true inside the White House believe that Lieutenant Colonel Vindman was part of this kind of back channel effort that ended up in the effort to bring down the President.

But perhaps more surprising is New York Times columnist Paul Krugman who predicted a global recession under President Trump now admitted in a piece that, yes, the economy is strong, writing, quote, \"it is needed a strong economy. It is indeed a strong economy, I should say, but if we ask what lies beneath that strength the main answer is an explosion in the federal budget deficit which exceeded one trillion last year. And the story of how that happened, he writes, has deeply disturbing implications for the future of U.S. politics.

Never. He said that they would be devastated for years and years to come. And of course, in the last few years, the Dow Jones Industrial average is up about 50 percent, Andy."

And it's really no surprise that he now tries to credit government spending for economic growth because he's been known as the albeit (Ph) interpreter of John Maynard Keynes, the man side economist where the government spends more than economic growth. It's a terrible system supply-side economics is much better, what President Trump did with tax cuts, deregulation, and a focus on domestic energy. But you have to remember during President Obama's term, the deficit went from about 11 trillion to 20 trillion. So, it almost doubled. And we didn't get the kind of dynamic labor market or economic growth that we're seeing with President Trump. That's because President Trump's economic policies, a reversal of Obama's, a reversal of what Krugman wanted, again with the tax cuts, deregulation, and a focus on domestic energy. That's what's really driving this economic growth, it's not what Krugman says. He's a one economist who is very -- always confident and almost always wrong."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "And I would also point out in that piece he says that he thought that President Obama's stimulus was woefully weak. That it was not nearly large enough. He wanted the government to spend a lot more on that renewal project than it actually did. But he does bring up this issue of the deficits and says that, if we continue at the rate we're at right now, in 10 years the GDP, the debt to GDP ratio would be at 98 percent of GDP, Andy. And I think that, you know, that the deficit does concern a lot of people even fiscal conservatives. Are we going to see any, anything done about that if there is a second term for President Trump?"

      "speaker": "PUZDER",

We had, you know, five, six years under President Obama where the military was neglected. Our planes didn't fly, we didn't have proper protection for our troops. He had to rebuild the military. He did. It's been rebuilt. So that's an expense that's basically behind us. We need to maintain it, but the rebuild is done. And secondly, what we need to control is nondiscretionary spending. We need to control the government programs where the costs go up no matter what the budget says, no matter what Congress or the president does. We need to revise those programs. That will actually take some unity of action between Congress and the presidency."

And I'm not saying we should reduce government benefits but if we were more efficient about them, more practical, maybe something like the earned income tax credit you're trying to replace a lot of these programs, we could cut our spending.

Then there's an aspiring actress Jessica Mann who testified the movie producer raped her twice during an abusive relationship. And Miriam Mimi Haleyi who claims Weinstein forced oral sex on her in 2006. Haleyi says Weinstein invited her to his Manhattan apartment and made a move on her while she sat on his couch, and though she rejected him he kept pulling him toward him before he backed her into bedroom, pushed her on the bed and held her down.

Great to see you in Cannes.\" The letter goes on to talk about an idea Haleyi had for a project a few years prior and the note ends with Haleyi writing, quote, \"lots of love, Miriam.\" Meantime, the New York Times is reporting that in the 90s Weinstein admitted to a former Miramax employee who also accused him of sexual misconduct that he didn't always know when the sex was consensual. Quoting here, \"Things confusing for me too. You may not believe that. Sometimes don't know when it's consensual. Trying to learn.

But by the same token, you know, just, you are the defense, you are on her behalf, and the defense attorneys are claiming that a lot of the evidence in this case shows that she continually went back to this relationship. And their argument is that she was essentially transactional in her relationship with Harvey. He was paying for flights to her back and forth to London, she has notes in her diary, you know, her journal for work, call Harvey about the tickets that turned out to be plane tickets. She then says that she was totally bummed that she missed seeing Harvey and the assistant when they were all in London, and then in '08, she reaches out as Trace had in his story there, to say that I'm, you know, she wanted to see the Cannes film festival but was sorry that it didn't work out, you know. So, all of these interactions suggest, this is what the defense -- his defense is saying that they had a strange, you know, horrific relationship in many aspects, but that it was -- it was transactional between the two of them.

This is not about a stranger assaulting a woman, raping her in a dark alley, where you never expect to speak again.
