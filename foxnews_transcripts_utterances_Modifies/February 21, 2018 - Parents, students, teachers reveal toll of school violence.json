Many people there in attendance had either been at a school shooting or they lost their loved ones in the school shootings. One of the great powers of the presidency is the power to convene. And this is something we have not seen before, especially on this issue, where you had such raw emotion, outpourings of grief. The president listening super intently to all of them, asking about ideas. It was a very emotional and moving day.  But it also gave you some hope that there could be some achievement going forward. The president said he's going to have them back and that they would be coming back in a much better light, meaning that hopefully that their grief would hopefully subside because the government, the president says, is going to act.  Let me take it around the table here. And Jesse Watters, I'll start with you for your thoughts.",

      "sentences": "America has reached a tipping point on school violence. Some of us were tearing up watching the exchanges. It was really a raw and organic and powerful moment. The president, we know, takes in information verbally. That's how he takes his briefings. You know he was very impacted when he saw the pictures of the Syrian children gassed. And this was, I think, a moment for him to really take it all in and listen.  He talks about being a protector. Protecting the border, protecting jobs, and it's now up to him to do whatever he can to protect the schools. And a lot of politicians are all talk and no action. And he's not one of them. I believe. But he wants to take action that's going to have an impact, not just empty action that's not going to solve any problems.  He talked about making America great again, but when I interviewed him, he talked about making America safe again. And one of the things that needs to be addressed is school safety.   The best moment, I believe, Andrew Pollack, who stood up. I believe he lost his daughter Meadow, said forget about the gun issue right now. Let's focus first on making schools safe. And there were some great exchanges of ideas: arming teachers at schools, mental institutions, enhanced background checks. I mean, this kid has been suspended how many times? No one really intervene. My father ran a school out in Long Island. After Sandy Hook, they built fences around the school, because you can't have people just wandering into a school. A lot of the teachers and administrators from some of the urban areas, they have metal detectors and checkpoints which are extremely effective. So that's something to look at, too.   And another great moment, I thought, was when a guy, I believe from Sandy Hook, one of the fathers said we stopped relying on Washington to fix everything, and we did it ourselves. And we really trained teachers to intervene when they saw students with problems and then take action aggressively. The best moment I think, though, too, at the end, the guy just said, listen, we've lost our connections as humans, as Americans. We don't recognize people anymore. We don't see things. We miss signs. And that's the bottom line. When you see something, say something. Americans, we're all one nation. And you just have to care for one another. And I think this is really a starting point for some strong action.",

Because you've got a bunch of different opinions and a bunch of people sitting there who know the topic and know the topic intimately and expressed suggestions, practical solutions about a horrible problem.   And my advice always stands. The biggest obstacle in this debate is trust. The loudest voices do not trust each other. Those were not the loudest voices. Those were the voices that you had to listen to. And what you found there were people who disagreed, but they disagreed civilly. And you know, I was just moved. I thought that this was probably one of the most valuable things I've seen in this administration.  I also, to Jesse's point, the thing that got to me was Darrell Scott talking, his daughter died in Columbine.",

Every single one of these school shootings have been from young men who are disconnected.

      "sentences": "So I think today is a wonderful day in terms of people hearing voices. Earlier today, you had the students from Parkland who went to Tallahassee to the state capital in Florida. They are arguing there that, again, we need action. They're tired of the status quo. And it an amazing turnout. In fact, I was struck by the idea that these are people who are 15, 16 years old. Most of them were not seniors. In fact, some of them were high school freshman, but they spoke with such passion, some of them choking back tears to try to express not only their fears but, you know, what they had lost. And similarly, I think at the White House meeting, the ability to hear from young people really strikes me as what's different. It changes the conversation, because you can say, \"Oh, well, these young people don't have any really concrete ideas or better ideas.\" But I think that they are touching something in the American spirit and saying that we have to find a solution.   So when you listen to what was being said, for example, at the White House meeting. Which, you know, I think it certainly has its publicity angle. I don't think that's where you really get solutions. I think what you hear there is that this goes beyond schools. That people who are saying, you know, my kid's walking home from school or my kid's walking over to an A.P. program or my kid's waiting at the bus stop. And there are just so many guns around. So how do we deal with that? How do you stop that? That's the challenge.  But as someone said, we have tons of ideas for solutions. The American people, gun owners and non-gun owners, NRA and non-NRA, agreed basically on background checks, limiting weapons that become weapons of mass destruction. People agree on arguments about gun safety and preparedness and waiting periods. These are all very concrete ideas that are there. On the mental health side, I think that woman who stood up and said very quickly most people who have mental health issues are not the ones who are shooting up the place. And that is really a dodge from the difficult issue of dealing with the fact that we have a proliferation of guns, more guns than people in our country. It's crazy.",

When I listened today to the students expressing themselves so passionately and eloquently, saying that they wanted to do something about this, that it was the passion and cause of their life, that they weren't going to forget it so that students can go into schools safe.  We owe that to the children, the students of America, to make sure that when they go through the school doors in the morning and the bell rings to go sit and pay attention in class, that they're able to pay attention to the lesson and not worry about a gunman coming through the door to kill them. And I want to take a moment to honor the lives of those that were lost and those that gave their lives trying to save others. And in particular, yes, we talked a lot about the coach who was incredible and all the people that showed incredible valor in the face of tremendous adversity. And instead of cowering in fear, they ran towards to try to save lives, like the junior ROTC members that were absolutely so incredible. Peter Wang, 15 years of age. Alaina Petty, 14 years of age. And Martin Duquesne, also 14.   Imagine being that young and having the presence of mind and selflessness to say that \"I'm going to stand in the way so that others may live.\" That I think...",

Architecturally, there's usually one or two doors to go in and out. So those checkpoints make sense to put a metal detector in. In a -- maybe a rural school or something in the middle of Florida, you have a sprawling campus with lots of different entrances in different buildings. That's not a solution there. Maybe a solution there is to have an armed security guard or an armed head coach to intervene. And I think the intervention thing here is the key. Is this kid should have been flagged. In freshman year, he should have been flagged. If you're suspended that many times, and you've had a mobile crisis unit called to the school to say this guy might hurt himself or somebody else. I don't know if he was suspended or expelled or transferred to another at- risk school. There are so many red flags here.

Many people there in attendance had either been at a school shooting or they lost their loved ones in the school shootings. One of the great powers of the presidency is the power to convene. And this is something we have not seen before, especially on this issue, where you had such raw emotion, outpourings of grief. The president listening super intently to all of them, asking about ideas. It was a very emotional and moving day. But it also gave you some hope that there could be some achievement going forward. The president said he's going to have them back and that they would be coming back in a much better light, meaning that hopefully that their grief would hopefully subside because the government, the president says, is going to act. Let me take it around the table here. And Jesse Watters, I'll start with you for your thoughts."

      "utterance": "America has reached a tipping point on school violence. Some of us were tearing up watching the exchanges. It was really a raw and organic and powerful moment. The president, we know, takes in information verbally. That's how he takes his briefings. You know he was very impacted when he saw the pictures of the Syrian children gassed. And this was, I think, a moment for him to really take it all in and listen. He talks about being a protector. Protecting the border, protecting jobs, and it's now up to him to do whatever he can to protect the schools. And a lot of politicians are all talk and no action. And he's not one of them. I believe. But he wants to take action that's going to have an impact, not just empty action that's not going to solve any problems. He talked about making America great again, but when I interviewed him, he talked about making America safe again. And one of the things that needs to be addressed is school safety. The best moment, I believe, Andrew Pollack, who stood up. I believe he lost his daughter Meadow, said forget about the gun issue right now. Let's focus first on making schools safe."

My father ran a school out in Long Island. After Sandy Hook, they built fences around the school, because you can't have people just wandering into a school. A lot of the teachers and administrators from some of the urban areas, they have metal detectors and checkpoints which are extremely effective. So that's something to look at, too. And another great moment, I thought, was when a guy, I believe from Sandy Hook, one of the fathers said we stopped relying on Washington to fix everything, and we did it ourselves. And we really trained teachers to intervene when they saw students with problems and then take action aggressively. The best moment I think, though, too, at the end, the guy just said, listen, we've lost our connections as humans, as Americans. We don't recognize people anymore. We don't see things. We miss signs. And that's the bottom line. When you see something, say something. Americans, we're all one nation. And you just have to care for one another. And I think this is really a starting point for some strong action."

I mean, the interesting thing for me, not just the suggestions but the tone and tenor of this conversation is incredibly important, because you know, we make jokes about the president viewing his administration as a talk show. Well, so what? That was one hell of a talk show. Because you've got a bunch of different opinions and a bunch of people sitting there who know the topic and know the topic intimately and expressed suggestions, practical solutions about a horrible problem. And my advice always stands. The biggest obstacle in this debate is trust. The loudest voices do not trust each other. Those were not the loudest voices. Those were the voices that you had to listen to. And what you found there were people who disagreed, but they disagreed civilly. And you know, I was just moved. I thought that this was probably one of the most valuable things I've seen in this administration. I also, to Jesse's point, the thing that got to me was Darrell Scott talking, his daughter died in Columbine."

We connect in broadband. That's not the real thing. We have community. And the thing is community means interaction between police and the people they police. It's a community. It's at sporting events, it's at schools. People need to know who's in their community and need to be confident enough. And I think that there was -- there was a binder full of practical solutions there that could be acted upon.

And it comes from something you said last week in your speech. And it was that we must create a culture of connectedness. We must create a culture in which our classmates become our friends. Every single one of these school shootings have been from young men who are disconnected. And we talk a lot about the mental health issues, but it actually goes deeper than that, because there's a lot of mentally ill children that are kind and compassionate.

      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "So I think today is a wonderful day in terms of people hearing voices. Earlier today, you had the students from Parkland who went to Tallahassee to the state capital in Florida. They are arguing there that, again, we need action. They're tired of the status quo. And it an amazing turnout. In fact, I was struck by the idea that these are people who are 15, 16 years old. Most of them were not seniors. In fact, some of them were high school freshman, but they spoke with such passion, some of them choking back tears to try to express not only their fears but, you know, what they had lost. And similarly, I think at the White House meeting, the ability to hear from young people really strikes me as what's different. It changes the conversation, because you can say, \"Oh, well, these young people don't have any really concrete ideas or better ideas.\" But I think that they are touching something in the American spirit and saying that we have to find a solution. So when you listen to what was being said, for example, at the White House meeting. Which, you know, I think it certainly has its publicity angle. I don't think that's where you really get solutions. I think what you hear there is that this goes beyond schools. That people who are saying, you know, my kid's walking home from school or my kid's walking over to an A.P. program or my kid's waiting at the bus stop. And there are just so many guns around. So how do we deal with that? How do you stop that? That's the challenge. But as someone said, we have tons of ideas for solutions. The American people, gun owners and non-gun owners, NRA and non-NRA, agreed basically on background checks, limiting weapons that become weapons of mass destruction. People agree on arguments about gun safety and preparedness and waiting periods. These are all very concrete ideas that are there. On the mental health side, I think that woman who stood up and said very quickly most people who have mental health issues are not the ones who are shooting up the place. And that is really a dodge from the difficult issue of dealing with the fact that we have a proliferation of guns, more guns than people in our country. It's crazy."

When I listened today to the students expressing themselves so passionately and eloquently, saying that they wanted to do something about this, that it was the passion and cause of their life, that they weren't going to forget it so that students can go into schools safe. We owe that to the children, the students of America, to make sure that when they go through the school doors in the morning and the bell rings to go sit and pay attention in class, that they're able to pay attention to the lesson and not worry about a gunman coming through the door to kill them. And I want to take a moment to honor the lives of those that were lost and those that gave their lives trying to save others. And in particular, yes, we talked a lot about the coach who was incredible and all the people that showed incredible valor in the face of tremendous adversity. And instead of cowering in fear, they ran towards to try to save lives, like the junior ROTC members that were absolutely so incredible. Peter Wang, 15 years of age. Alaina Petty, 14 years of age. And Martin Duquesne, also 14. Imagine being that young and having the presence of mind and selflessness to say that \"I'm going to stand in the way so that others may live.\" That I think..."

It was the second attack on the World Trade Center. They went back and they planned. They tried it once and then they came back and they did it again. As long as there's evil in the world, there will be these incidents, and we can't expect them to disappear like that. However, I will say this.

And like Greg said, earlier, they're not going to completely ever prevent another shooting at a school. But in inner cities, you know, you have these big, big school buildings. Architecturally, there's usually one or two doors to go in and out. So those checkpoints make sense to put a metal detector in. In a -- maybe a rural school or something in the middle of Florida, you have a sprawling campus with lots of different entrances in different buildings. That's not a solution there. Maybe a solution there is to have an armed security guard or an armed head coach to intervene. And I think the intervention thing here is the key. Is this kid should have been flagged. In freshman year, he should have been flagged. If you're suspended that many times, and you've had a mobile crisis unit called to the school to say this guy might hurt himself or somebody else. I don't know if he was suspended or expelled or transferred to another at- risk school. There are so many red flags here. You have to put it into a centralized database and you have to make sure it gets into the FBI background check system, because this guy's threat matrix was through the roof.

It's used in rural communities for targets, for big game, for small game, for sport, everything. And people like it, because it's stylish. You can customize it, personalize it. And it's very accurate. If you ban an 18-year-old from getting an AR-15, what's going to stop him from going in with a shotgun or a long rifle? I mean, it's not -- it's not the perfect solution, but I'm definitely open to the idea of raising the limit to 21."

So how could we -- what steps could we have taken -- could we have taken to prevent that young man from legally obtaining a gun? Illegal guns is another issue but let's just start with that."

The offensive -- the offensive strategy is to tag the perp so he doesn't get the gun, and that's where you look, where you have school officials, you have police, you have students. There's a database. There's a person there that's a problem. They go into the database; they don't get a gun. That's an offensive strategy that leaves law-abiding gun owners alone..."

      "utterance": "Right. Kimberly, I want to ask you, just from a law enforcement standpoint, so for the kid, the shooter, flagged several times. Is there a point you think, is it a federal law or is it a state and local law that would allow law enforcement to intervene earlier?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUILFOYLE",
      "utterance": "I think you have to probably have both, as you see. Because there has to be some control and autonomy at a local, a state level. Local ordinances to make sure that they have the tools that they're equipped with. Look, I think there should be metal detectors at school. Why not? Look at the schools that have the metal detectors. I mean, this isn't that difficult to figure out. And it's not just about making sure that guns don't get in the wrong hands. It's about protecting the environment. It's about saying that how many times you have to learn the same lesson over and over and over again. Schools are a target. Why? Because we have continued to allow them to be. We have not allowed the schools to equip themselves and protect themselves and protect the students. Why not? I can go and fly on a plane tonight and go through TSA and go through all kinds of stuff, but a child goes to school and there are no protections in so many places. And I think it's unacceptable. Because believe me, if somebody is hell-bent on going in and killing and taking lives, they will find a way and a means to do it. And you can focus and get hypersensitive about the AR-15, or you can talk about how we can prevent this from happening in general. And it is really multifaceted in terms of the approach and the platform that is needed. So if you are just focusing on \"Oh, we need to ban guns. We need to do this,\" then you are really missing a large part of the problem here."

A lot of false positives, walking back and through it. It slows you down. That's why people say they don't want metal detectors at subway stops."

      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "I don't know. I think technology as it helps us advance also hurts us. When drones are married to other kinds of agents, that is going to be an issue in the future. Not simply just for the mass shooter aspect. For terrorism in general. So I think that it's a double-edged sword, and that is no pun intended."
