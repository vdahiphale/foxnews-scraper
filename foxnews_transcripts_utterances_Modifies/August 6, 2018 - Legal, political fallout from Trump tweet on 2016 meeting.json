Amid all of President Trump's many tweets, this is remarkable because it's unprecedented for a commander-in-chief in the middle of a criminal investigation to acknowledge he himself had not told the truth basically about the focus of such a critical meeting.  The president acknowledging, again, as you said, the real purpose was not discussing Russian adoptions but getting dirt on Hillary Clinton from a Russian lawyer with ties to the Kremlin at that 2016 meeting with Donald Trump Junior, Jared Kushner, and then, campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who, of course, is now on trial for separate bank and tax fraud charges.   A significant tweet as the president's legal team closes in on a decision about whether or not to do an interview with Special Counsel Robert Mueller. But as you noted, what most of the media is ignoring is another critical fact which is this is not really a new development. The president had already made this admission about the true purpose of the Trump Tower meeting more than a year ago at a news conference with the French president where he noted gathering oppo research is hardly a big deal.",

Since it doesn't exist, you can't -- you can't analyze it. So, here's what the statute prohibits. Federal law prohibits the receipt by people running a campaign of information or anything of value from a foreign person entity or government. It prohibits soliciting that and it prohibits agreeing to solicit it. The agreement is called a conspiracy, an agreement to do something wrong. So, there's three potential crimes here, soliciting the information, receiving the information, or agreeing to receive the information.",

What actual crimes were violated? Right now, we don't have any evidence that the president violated any crimes. But I do think that Don Jr. is in significant trouble. I also think that this tweet that the president put out, you're right, it's kind of old news, but it does underscore the fact that this White House, this president lied for a very long time about the nature of the meeting, the existence of the meeting.   And now all of a sudden, he's sort of taken the O.J. position was -- you know -- you know, I -- if I didn't do it, but if I did, it's no sort of -- it's no big deal.

To be clear, all the video we were just showing, it was yours. You saw a little credit up in the top corner. You were standing in the middle of all this. What did you see? FORD FISCHER, CO-FOUNDER, NEWS2SHARE: Right. So basically, I started at Martin Luther King Park which was where the actual no to Marxism event was taking place. And there were a number of counterdemonstrators, not all of them Antifa but broadly along the left wing who were -- who were arguing with them and getting into some small scuffles. But a really large group of hundreds of kind of as you described Antifa type people using a black bloc tactic where they all dress uniformly in black made their way over to this and police were attempting to repel them with flash grenades and the like. And so, when I went to follow this, most of the other media basically was retreating from it because the police couldn't get to where the Antifa were. They were actually moving fences from a construction site to block off the police and they were moving very fast kind of destroying property along the way. And so, from across the street, I was able to film and zoom in really tight as they did get proceed to smash a Marine Corps Recruiting Office. And then after that, somebody threw a lit torch into a dumpster basically trying to create a dumpster fire. When that happened, when I filmed that one individual called on a walkie-talkie to bring over five other Antifa people and they basically confronted me and said get out of here.

The president acknowledging, again, as you said, the real purpose was not discussing Russian adoptions but getting dirt on Hillary Clinton from a Russian lawyer with ties to the Kremlin at that 2016 meeting with Donald Trump Junior, Jared Kushner, and then, campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who, of course, is now on trial for separate bank and tax fraud charges. A significant tweet as the president's legal team closes in on a decision about whether or not to do an interview with Special Counsel Robert Mueller. But as you noted, what most of the media is ignoring is another critical fact which is this is not really a new development. The president had already made this admission about the true purpose of the Trump Tower meeting more than a year ago at a news conference with the French president where he noted gathering oppo research is hardly a big deal."

Steele's work, remember was paid for by Clinton's presidential campaign and the DNC. That means, a paid agent of the Clinton camp, approached Russian officials for damaging material on Trump.\" Now, Thiessen added that of Michael Cohen or another Trump associate had hired Christopher Steele to dig up dirt that it's unlikely that pundits here in Washington would be giving President Trump, a pass, a double standard that may explain why the Trump legal team doesn't want him to sit with Robert Mueller, Sandra?"

So, when someone says collusion is not a crime, and therefore, nobody involved in the -- in the Trump Tower meeting committed a crime, that's a false premise because it presumes that collusion is worth investigating. Since it doesn't exist, you can't -- you can't analyze it. So, here's what the statute prohibits. Federal law prohibits the receipt by people running a campaign of information or anything of value from a foreign person entity or government. It prohibits soliciting that and it prohibits agreeing to solicit it. The agreement is called a conspiracy, an agreement to do something wrong. So, there's three potential crimes here, soliciting the information, receiving the information, or agreeing to receive the information."

So, if the people in Trump Tower agreed to receive dirt on Hillary from Russian person's entities, or the Russian government, it doesn't matter if they never received it because the agreement is what is the crime. And I suggest to you that is what Bob Mueller is looking at, and that's the problem. Not so much for the president but for his son and for the others who participated within that meeting."

If the president admits that he knew about the meeting, then the president did something that both Ken Starr and the Nixon prosecutors Archibald Cox, says was an impeachable offense. And that is using the instruments of the government to lie to the American public. The instruments of the government would be Air Force One, where he was when he dictated the statement saying it was just about Russian adoptions.

I think that the collusion cuts both ways in -- for the -- in President Trump's favor and against him because it's not a legal term, right? Because it is not a crime, I think that this meeting does qualify as collusion. But therefore, what, right? You then have to actually say, OK, well, it was collusion. But, to what end? What actual crimes were violated? Right now, we don't have any evidence that the president violated any crimes. But I do think that Don Jr. is in significant trouble. I also think that this tweet that the president put out, you're right, it's kind of old news, but it does underscore the fact that this White House, this president lied for a very long time about the nature of the meeting, the existence of the meeting. And now all of a sudden, he's sort of taken the O.J. position was -- you know -- you know, I -- if I didn't do it, but if I did, it's no sort of -- it's no big deal. Or at least, the Clinton position on that kind of thing. And I think that this constricts the zone of plausible arguments that the president can make. And it undermines his credibility and it probably, is gives Mueller more stuff to chew on rather than that."

It kind of frightened me a little bit and I wasn't really in favor of all this communication by Twitter. But you know, as it comes around, he's done a tremendous amount of work and the tremendous a lot of good has come out of his tweet on other topics. I'll tell you when he did this a year ago --"

And certainly, so close to really what amounts to the only meeting where senior officials actually had contact with someone who was representing the Russian government in a -- in a campaign conversation. You know, this was probably not a very good meeting to have in a -- in a well-staffed presidential campaign. This request would have been bucked to the general counsel's office, or maybe the opposition research office. But certainly not to the candidates so, on, or daughter, or wife. So, we're in a place we are, because the campaign was small and lean and mean. But we don't -- I think, need to be talking about it as much. And we need to see this thing investigated more fully.

And now, the thing is, \"Yes, I did it, but it happens all of the time.\" That is not great messaging for the president. I'm sure that Rudy Giuliani spends big chunks of his days chained smoking cigarettes, white knuckling it, just hoping that another tweet doesn't show up. Because it constrains the amount of -- it constrains the kinds of arguments that he can make. And yet, the press goes crazy, the media goes nuts.

The standoff itself pitted a group of proton conservatives calling themselves anti-Marxist against a much larger group of anti-fascists better known as the radical leftist group Antifa.

To be clear, all the video we were just showing, it was yours. You saw a little credit up in the top corner. You were standing in the middle of all this. What did you see? FORD FISCHER, CO-FOUNDER, NEWS2SHARE: Right. So basically, I started at Martin Luther King Park which was where the actual no to Marxism event was taking place. And there were a number of counterdemonstrators, not all of them Antifa but broadly along the left wing who were -- who were arguing with them and getting into some small scuffles. But a really large group of hundreds of kind of as you described Antifa type people using a black bloc tactic where they all dress uniformly in black made their way over to this and police were attempting to repel them with flash grenades and the like. And so, when I went to follow this, most of the other media basically was retreating from it because the police couldn't get to where the Antifa were. They were actually moving fences from a construction site to block off the police and they were moving very fast kind of destroying property along the way. And so, from across the street, I was able to film and zoom in really tight as they did get proceed to smash a Marine Corps Recruiting Office. And then after that, somebody threw a lit torch into a dumpster basically trying to create a dumpster fire. When that happened, when I filmed that one individual called on a walkie-talkie to bring over five other Antifa people and they basically confronted me and said get out of here. The police aren't here so they can't help you."

Now when he did that march he didn't have Richard Jay Daley sanctioned, he didn't have the police chief strategizing with him, he did it will because it was the right thing to do. And what that was, is that, we must have awaken our other brothers and sisters in the city and let them know there are people here that are desperate that are hurting that are broking. In other words, we have to redistribute the pain, make others uncomfortable, redistribute the anguish, and also redistribute the dormant hope. Our task in having these marches and these demonstrations, first of all, before people can do anything we have to inspire the uninspired, we have to reignite them, reignite them because as long as they are just dormant and they're dead in their consciousness, you know, they are not going to do anything."

And as a reporter just mentioned, Sandra, it's the suburbs of Columbus, Franklin County that's where third of the vote is going to be cast of was cast in 2016, and that's the area where Balderson - - or President Trump did the worst, right? It's well-educated suburbanites who used to vote Republican who switch and voted for Clinton in the last election. And that's where he needs to -- Democrats need to turn that power if they want Danny O'Connor to win, and that's where Balderson has to really -- he needs a rural vote obviously but he needs to have votes in that area as well if he wants to pull the race out. It's going to be very, very close."

      "speaker": "BEVAN",
      "utterance": "Well, look, I mean, the typical caveat is not to read too much into special elections because they are special, but this one given its proximity to the general election, we're less than 100 days out now, given that the history of this district, which as a reporter just mentioned has not been won by a Democrat in decades. And given President Trump's appearance over the weekend and him putting his clout on the line as sort of a general election setting now, it makes it that much more important. And I think of Republicans lose this seat it will confirm that they are in a boatload of trouble come November and they should batten down the hatches because it will probably signal that a Democratic wave is coming if not already there."

    {
      "speaker": "SMITH",
      "utterance": "The president has indicated perhaps it's a red wave that is coming. He sounds rather optimistic. What is the turnout of this race which we very well could have the results of this race this time tomorrow evening. What does that say about President Trump's influence, less than 100 days out from the midterm elections?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BEVAN",
      "utterance": "Well, I mean, that remains to be seen. I mean, Trump has done a good job moving the needle in primaries for certain candidates, but, in general election settings like Pennsylvania's special election, Pennsylvania 18 earlier, where Conor Lamb the Democrat defeated Rick Saccone, the Republicans. Trump won to that district. He campaigned for Saccone and it didn't work out. So Trump is not having -- this is the conundrum for Trump. He has this bond, he fires up his supporters but can he fire them up to turn out for an average Republican, a generic Republican whoever is running in a certain district. That's the question. So far he hasn't been able to do it, and if he's not able to do it here in this district that does not bode well for all these Republicans that are running in swing districts in November."

    {
      "speaker": "SMITH",
      "utterance": "And how important is it that the president stays on what many members of the GOP see as the winning message for their party and that is the economy?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BEVAN",
      "utterance": "Well, certainly I think Republicans would like to see Trump hammering the economy. He does that, I mean, he sporadically goes off message and tweets about Robert Mueller and other things which I think makes them nervous. But the economy is, look, it's a double-edged sword for Republicans. On one hand it's great, and that's the message they want to see. On the other hand because the economy is so good, voters can turn to different things like education and health care where they don't have an advantage. So it cut both ways. But at the bottom line, at the end of the day, this is about Democrats being energized against -- going out and turning out and voting against Trump and the question is whether the Republicans can match that energy and enthusiasm. And so far they haven't been unable -- it doesn't seem like they've been able to do it but that's the big question."

      "speaker": "BEVAN",
      "utterance": "Well, we have two polls i last week. One has Balderson up one point and one has O'Connor up at one point. So I think that indicates how close this is going to be."

As we await those sanctions to be re-imposed at midnight, Governor, what effect will they have?"

      "speaker": "FORMER GOV. MIKE HUCKABEE, R-ARK.",
      "utterance": "I think they will have a profound effect. Already the Iranian people are suffering under this regime and they have since 1979 when the radicals overthrew the shah and staged a coup d'etat. Since that time there has been very little other than sponsor of terrorism from this government. They are a rogue regime, they killed Americans, they kidnapped Americans, they've sponsored terrorism around the world. And it's time for them to be accountable for that and pay the price. That's what I'm hoping it will happen."

    {
      "speaker": "SMITH",
      "utterance": "The Iranian foreign minister, the Islamic Republic of Iran, I should say, Zarif, he has responded to the administration's move here, Governor and tweeted this. \"The Trump administration wants the world to believe it's concerned about the Iranian people. Yet the very first sanctions it re-imposed have cancelled licenses for sales of 200 plus passengers jets under absurd pretext endangering ordinary Iranians. U.S. hypocrisy knows no bounds.\" The president says he doesn't want to cripple the regime, he wants to change the rogue regime. Is that possible?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HUCKABEE",
      "utterance": "Probably not in the long run. I think the administration's position is to right diplomatic move to say we're not trying to change the regime but trying to change the behavior. But the truth is unless the regime is changed, the behavior won't change. But the proper avenue to see that change is not for the U.S. to go in and over intervene and overthrow the government, it's for the people to do it. And they almost did in 2009. The Green movement was an uprising, and they were looking for just a little bit of encouragement for the United States and President Obama was absolutely stone cold silent, didn't say a word as a 20-year-old women were bleeding in the streets from gunshot wounds to the head. That's why this regime is embolden. And I think we have to always separate the Iranian people from the Iranian government. The Persian culture is one of the most advanced and wonderful and just a beautiful culture from centuries. But this bunch of thugs have gone into and they destroyed the antiquities, they've tried to erase the culture and they've absolutely done nothing other than try to take these people back to the seventh century. And it is a sad, sad commentary on what's happened in Iran."

One thing they've been as consistent, Sandra, since 1979 when they took over the nation. They have not kept one promise, not one that they have made. So I don't think we could expect them to start being good guys after all these years of being really, really bad guys."

I just wonder if maybe Bob Mueller is knocking on Rand Paul's door tonight. It's an interesting concept to take it to a legislative level rather than just the two heads of state.
