The other reason why I went was to meet and work with Americans from around the country that were involved in a lot of different social issues. I think that over the past 20 years, my involvement in Cuba has centered on health care and promoting democracy.  Do I know an awful lot more now? Do I understand that the Castro regime did not have the same freedoms as we do in the United States, was a brutal regime? They don't have freedom of press, freedom of protest -- which was kind of ironic because when I went in my youth, the majority of us that were there were antiwar activists. We were protesting against police abuse and understood then and now that the Cuban people did not have the same freedoms. But what I also believe is that the best way to deal with change is to have relations. And so, I support what President Obama and Vice President Biden did in opening up relations with the island of Cuba, that's 90 miles away. In fact, one time when I went to visit Cuba, I visited the U.S. political prisoner actually with one of your panelists that's going to be on a little later, Donna Brazile. We went and visited Alan Gross. For the last eight years, I've served on the board of National Endowment for Democracy, which funds democratic activists on the island of Cuba. So my perspective has definitely developed over time. I am interested in two products that the Cubans have -- one to address diabetes, the other to address lung cancer. And I'm hoping that both of those products will be tested and marketed in the United States if they are safe.",

And it's time now for our Sunday group. Co-founder of \"The Federalist,\" Ben Domenech, former DNC Chair Donna Brazile, and Lanhee Chen from The Hoover Institution. Well, Ben, why do you think that President Trump suddenly raised this issue of delaying the election and why do you think he is arguing so fiercely, and you heard this campaign senior advisor, Jason Miller, just now arguing so fiercely against an expansion of mail in voting. BEN DOMENECH, CO-FOUNDER, \"THE FEDERALIST\": Well, I think the president was trying to make a point about mail-in voting, something that is based on the terrible experience that we've seen in a couple of different instances here where the American U.S. Postal Service had a real problem with handling the level of mail-in ballots. Chris, speaking purely anecdotally, the level of drop-off that we've seen in recent months, given the sending of packages and the like that has overburdened the USPS has been significant. And there's a \"Washington Post\" report from yesterday that doubled down on that. I do think that there's some challenges with mail-in voting and that this could extend, potentially, the counting of ballots. The president was maybe trying to highlight that, but I think he did it in a pretty sloppy way. One that could be -- I think Republicans should concede is indicative of an approach to this election that maybe scares some folks who feel like the president drifts towards this kind of authoritarian, you know, I'm not going to leave office kind of thing. But this is a situation that I think does deserve some respect for the fact that mail-in voting could be a challenge in the fall.",

There's always going to be some element of that candidate, whether it's the record, whether it's their geography, what other factors that might come into play that's going to make them less- than-perfect. And so what it really does come down to, beyond the vetting, beyond the issues you've got to catch in that process is really that relationship that will develop between the presidential nominee and the VP nominee.

Senator, let's start with the most important question for anybody who's being considered to being a vice presidential running mate, especially given the fact that Joe Biden, if he is elected, will be 78 on Inauguration Day. Are you prepared to step in and become President of the United States?"

But I can tell you this, that I will do everything I can to support Joe Biden to get elected no matter where he thinks I should -- what position I should plan on the team. We need real leadership and Joe Biden is the kind of empathetic, resilient person that we need to really lead this country out of the crises that we're in."

I will tell you that he is being very careful about who he selects, but again, all of the women whose name have been mentioned so far are just wonderful and I've worked with each and every one of them and anyone of us can step up and do the job. It's about bringing the country together, Chris. It's about getting a real response to this pandemic that President Trump has so miserably failed at. It's about standing up to the Russians for putting bounties on U.S. Troops heads in Afghanistan. It's about reopening our economy and, you know, we have a team that's going to move forward in a systematic way to do that and really I'm happy to be in any position on team Biden."

    {
      "speaker": "SENATOR DUCKWORTH",
      "utterance": "Well, the one-week extension is not enough, Chris. Americans across this country are hurting right now. There are families who don't know if they're going to be able to pay their rent. Today is the beginning of the month in August and many families just missed the first rent payment or their first mortgage payment. So many families are not going to know if within two weeks their kids are going to go hungry. What Democrats want is to extend the $600 payment more than just one week, well into the future, as long as we're still fighting this pandemic. And then we need to get this pandemic under control. This president has failed to respond to the pandemic. He's failed to pull the Republican Party together. The reason we can't come to an agreement is because there's infighting within the Republican Party. Mitch McConnell has no control over his caucus and they can't come to an agreement. Democrats are united in saying we need to have the $600 a week payment extended well into the future."

The question I have for you is do you think a sizable percentage of President Trump's supporters are racists?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SENATOR DUCKWORTH",
      "utterance": "I think that -- of course not, Chris. Of course not. I think that President Trump is trying to divide us as a nation. We need to come together as a nation. We need to unite. I think most Americans agree that we need sensible immigration reform. We need a way for those who are here illegally to pay fines and go to the end of the line and work their way towards citizenship. We need to be able to bring all of those folks that are in hiding out of hiding and then we need to make sure that we grow our economy. Many, many groups have said that if we had sensible immigration reform, that is doable, that is humane, that is fair, that we could actually grow our economy by as much as $1 trillion over 10 years and, you know, we can't let President Trump continue to divide us. There are ways to come to the middle on this and many, many people have come forward with very good ideas that we can work on it, instead of trying to divide us the way President Trump has."

You obviously love America, you have given up more for this country than any of us can even imagine, but I want to ask you about the protests, the violent protests, that are happening now across the country. Not the peaceful part of it, but there has been violence. Statues torn down, more than eight weeks of attacks on a federal building in Portland and yet you seem to have been primarily interested and critical of the federal officers defending that building in Portland. And my question, Senator, is shouldn't you be focusing on the violence from some of those protesters?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SENATOR DUCKWORTH",
      "utterance": "I think violence is wrong. I absolutely condemn the violent protesters. That is wrong. I fully support the rights of people to express their First Amendment right peacefully. It's why I spent 23 years in the military. I don't always agree with people when they come out and express their opinions but I will defend to my death their right to express themselves peacefully. If President Trump truly wants to go after violence in our country, he should call Mitch McConnell right now and ask for a sensible vote on uniform background checks. That is, let's get rid of those gun show loopholes. There is so much that could be done between the Federal Government and local law enforcement working together in order to allow people to express themselves in a peaceful way without federal troops coming in in unmarked vehicles and kidnapping peaceful protesters off the streets, throwing them into an unmarked van and driving off in the middle of the night."

We have to leave you because we want to bring in another vice presidential contender and that is Congresswoman Karen Bass, Head of the Congressional Black Caucus. Congresswoman, thanks for being with us. I want to start with the same first question that I asked Senator Duckworth, because it is the threshold question for someone potentially in your position. Are you prepared? Why are you -- would you say that you are prepared to step in and become president of the United States?"

When I served as speaker of the House of the nation -- of the world's fifth largest economy, managing its worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, served in the emergency room, have had life-and-death experience, the issues that are going on in our country in this particular historical moment around race and the division, the 10 years that I have sat on the Foreign Affairs Committee working primarily in Africa -- yes, I would be prepared. I know that as I've read about it, everyone has said, whoever has been in the Oval Office, that you could never be 100 percent prepared. But absolutely, I do feel that I could do the job."

But I believe specifically is that we need to repair the damage that was done and has been done over the last ten years to the Affordable Care Act. We need to repair the damage, we need to expand that. And then over time, we need to figure as a nation, how do we make health care as a right for everyone?"

By every estimate, this year, it's going to be many times that 33 million. Isn't it legitimate to question whether or not the system can handle that?"

      "speaker": "BASS",

You know, the state of Oregon has had vote at home elections for over the last 20 years. They have perfect -- perfected a system, I would suggest that we look at what they are doing. But I really believe though that the reason why the president said this, and you remember this, he said this a few hours after the economic news that said that our economy has tanked, tanked more than it has ever in U.S. history. I think that he is a master at diversion and I think that's the main reason he did that. He knows he can't delay the election."

But, Congresswoman, what many people may not know is that in fact he visited Cuba eight times during the 1970s. What was it about Castro and Cuba that you found so appealing at that time? And do you now regret your involvement and considerable time spent in a communist dictatorship?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BASS",
      "utterance": "So, let me tell you that, first of all, when I went to Cuba over 40 years ago when I was in my teens and early 20s, I went to help the Cuban people, we were building houses. The other reason why I went was to meet and work with Americans from around the country that were involved in a lot of different social issues. I think that over the past 20 years, my involvement in Cuba has centered on health care and promoting democracy. Do I know an awful lot more now? Do I understand that the Castro regime did not have the same freedoms as we do in the United States, was a brutal regime? They don't have freedom of press, freedom of protest -- which was kind of ironic because when I went in my youth, the majority of us that were there were antiwar activists. We were protesting against police abuse and understood then and now that the Cuban people did not have the same freedoms. But what I also believe is that the best way to deal with change is to have relations. And so, I support what President Obama and Vice President Biden did in opening up relations with the island of Cuba, that's 90 miles away. In fact, one time when I went to visit Cuba, I visited the U.S. political prisoner actually with one of your panelists that's going to be on a little later, Donna Brazile. We went and visited Alan Gross. For the last eight years, I've served on the board of National Endowment for Democracy, which funds democratic activists on the island of Cuba. So my perspective has definitely developed over time. I am interested in two products that the Cubans have -- one to address diabetes, the other to address lung cancer. And I'm hoping that both of those products will be tested and marketed in the United States if they are safe."

But the power center in this Biden campaign and what a potential Biden presidency would look like is the radical left wing mob. It's Bernie Sanders. It's AOC. It's Ilhan Omar.

We think he's in good position right now. And, in particular, will be back up on the air on Monday, have two great, new ads that are definitely going to leave a mark. And I think this is a stark contrast to where Joe Biden isn't pushing for bigger tax hikes and his own version of a green new deal. It's, this is the fundamental question, do people want to keep going and improve, get back to the greatest economy that President Trump built, order do they want to put in the u-turn and go back to higher taxes?

With universal mail-in voting, not absentee voting, which is good, 2020 will be the most inaccurate and fraudulent election in history.

Let's take Nevada, Chris. In the dark of night on Friday night, this is Assembly Bill Four in Nevada, they went and passed universal vote by mail. That's where they're sending out these ballots to everybody. They're sending out universal vote by mail. And listen to the craziness in this. They want to keep it open after November 3rd for another week if it has a postmark, but even if there's no postmark on this universal vote by mail, they want to keep it open by another three days.

Congress should be back in right now, both the House and the Senate, taking care of these unemployment benefits, but I guess they've already decided to go home for their vacation. So Congress can come back and give more. But, Chris, the thing that you're missing is that with 90 days to go before a general election, for states who have never done this universal mail-in voting, it will be a disaster. We've seen the examples, whether it be in Paterson, New Jersey, where we had 20 percent usage of fraud. We still know who won the 12th congressional district of New York. There are 100,000 ballots in California that didn't get counted in the primaries earlier. The fraud and the waste and people being disenfranchise and unable to vote is all around us."

There are a half-dozen or so states that are vote by mail and they have that in place. But this universal mail-in voting that they're trying to change it to -- and the other thing, even with Nevada, they want to leave the polls open, some of the polls open, in addition to the vote by mail, which we've already seen from examples in Philadelphia and other places, you're going to get double voting.

Let's put them up on the screen. Prohibit overtime pay. Shutdown sorting machines early. Require letter carriers to leave mail behind. And the result is that there is a delay in mail being delivered.

And it's time now for our Sunday group. Co-founder of \"The Federalist,\" Ben Domenech, former DNC Chair Donna Brazile, and Lanhee Chen from The Hoover Institution. Well, Ben, why do you think that President Trump suddenly raised this issue of delaying the election and why do you think he is arguing so fiercely, and you heard this campaign senior advisor, Jason Miller, just now arguing so fiercely against an expansion of mail in voting. BEN DOMENECH, CO-FOUNDER, \"THE FEDERALIST\": Well, I think the president was trying to make a point about mail-in voting, something that is based on the terrible experience that we've seen in a couple of different instances here where the American U.S. Postal Service had a real problem with handling the level of mail-in ballots. Chris, speaking purely anecdotally, the level of drop-off that we've seen in recent months, given the sending of packages and the like that has overburdened the USPS has been significant. And there's a \"Washington Post\" report from yesterday that doubled down on that. I do think that there's some challenges with mail-in voting and that this could extend, potentially, the counting of ballots. The president was maybe trying to highlight that, but I think he did it in a pretty sloppy way. One that could be -- I think Republicans should concede is indicative of an approach to this election that maybe scares some folks who feel like the president drifts towards this kind of authoritarian, you know, I'm not going to leave office kind of thing. But this is a situation that I think does deserve some respect for the fact that mail-in voting could be a challenge in the fall."

The integrity of our democracy is at stake and there's no reason to sow confusion into a process that has been underway now for many, many years in so many states.

And that's why these one-on-one meetings coming up this week are really going to be so important. What I saw in 2012 was that bond that Mitt Romney had with Paul Ryan. That really was the decisive factor because you're never going to have a perfect vice presidential pick. There's always going to be some element of that candidate, whether it's the record, whether it's their geography, what other factors that might come into play that's going to make them less- than-perfect. And so what it really does come down to, beyond the vetting, beyond the issues you've got to catch in that process is really that relationship that will develop between the presidential nominee and the VP nominee. Is there trust there? Does the presidential nominee know the VP nominee is going to be out there on message making the right case? I think that's going to be the most important factor.

      "utterance": "White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer agreeing after talks yesterday they made some headway on a new coronavirus relief bill, but tough negotiations will resume tomorrow. And we're back now with the panel. Ben, which side do you think runs a greater risk from the continued stalemate, the continued failure to pass a coronavirus relief bill, House Democrats, who passed a $3 trillion bill back in May and are pretty much insisting on something close to that, or Senate Republicans who had just offered their plan this last week, but are offering a one-week extension of the $600 unemployment benefit?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DOMENECH",
      "utterance": "Well, I think pretty obviously the Senate Republicans are running into a more difficult, political situation given that, you know, frankly, I think everybody agrees that Republicans are behind at this point, that they need to try to get this economy moving again in order to have the type of optimism that would elevate them and the chances of President Trump in the fall. But I do think that this is a situation where Republicans shouldn't be so willing to give up so much in terms of the leftist agenda that the House Democrats have advanced, trying to take advantage of the situation to achieve things that have nothing to do with coronavirus relief or anything else related to that. So, I mean, it is a challenge in this moment and I do think that you're going to have to see this type of negotiating play out in -- in a typical Washington way, sloppy, not actually connected with what people need and divorced from the reality that we all face."

    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",

      "speaker": "BRAZILE",
      "utterance": "Absolutely not, Chris. For the 19th straight week, over 1 million Americans have filed for unemployment. Millions of Americans are now on the verge of losing their homes or their apartments and it's time -- and -- and, of course, millions more are food insecure. So how do you overplay your hand when there's so much pain, so much uncertainty in the middle of a pandemic. The Republicans are nickel --"

    {
      "speaker": "BRAZILE",
      "utterance": "Well, because -- because we -- because -- Chris, they introduced and passed this bill on May 15th. Give the American people an opportunity, not just a one-week extension on -- on the so-called unemployment benefits, which is very important, $600, but also, what about the rent? What about the eviction notices? The moratorium needs to be extended as well. We don't want to give the Republicans one week and they go back to, you know, filing more judges and go home when the American people are hurting. The American people are hurting, not just Democrats, every American out there --"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "Let -- let me -- let me pick up on that with you, Lanhee, because all of this comes amid some new economic numbers. Second quarter GDP contracted at an annualized rate of 33 percent. As Donna points out, another 1.4 million people filed for new unemployment claims. To the degree that -- that the -- the bill is put off and the new stimulus is put off, doesn't that endanger a fragile economy even further?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHEN",
      "utterance": "Yes, I do think it does endanger the economy. I mean the challenge with the economy now is that as the restart or the reopening of the economy has stalled in some states because of the coronavirus and because of the continuing numbers, it's going to be difficult for this economy to get going whether we have a stimulus package or not, quite frankly. So I think a lot of what happens with the economy is so closely tied with what happens with coronavirus, yes, we do need a relief package, yes, it's got to come soon, but, ultimately, the economy is not going to get going until we get this virus better under control in more parts of the country."

      "speaker": "WALLACE",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "DOMENECH",
      "utterance": "You've given me the rare moment of self-deprecation on the part of the president, Chris, as something to react to. I do think -- I do think that in this instance, you know, we -- we do see the president frustrated by the fact that the way that the media has framed this story is often divorced from the results in various situations. I think in particular of Governor Andrew Cuomo, who has, you know, frankly, done a terrible job in handling this at any kind of database measure and yet has seen his performance levels and his polling numbers spike, you know, even as things have gone so horribly in New York. The president is frustrated by that. He feels like that he should be getting more credit for things. But he's not going to get credit for things because the media is, frankly, in -- you know, out to get him. And -- and it's not going to give him any credit for anything that he does right and is not going to give him, you know, any kind of lack of attention for anything that he does wrong."
