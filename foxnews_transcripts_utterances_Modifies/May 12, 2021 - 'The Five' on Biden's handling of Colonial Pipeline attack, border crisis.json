But first I just want to pre-but what Juan is going to say. I don't want to hear about approval ratings, Juan. The guy is a Democrat. He's in his honeymoon period. The corrupt media has his back. If he were a Republican with this portfolio of problems, he'd already be deemed an incompetent failure. If you think about it this way, and I'm going to cover him objectively as I said I would, he was handed a recovering economy, a vaccine and a distribution plan that was humming along, a secure border, low gas prices and no inflation. And right now, the jobless rate just ticked up, we have a border mess, we have inflation back, high gas prices and the J&J pause destroyed vaccine confidence and the vaccination rates plummeted.   I'm not even talking about the rise in homicides or shootings, the concern over school re-openings. I'm not talking about the cost of living that's gone up, these are just domestic issues. Think about internationally, too. He unfroze the aid to the Palestinians gave him a quarter billion which they use on weapons to attack Israel. We got hacked by Russians, they took down our pipeline. They restarted the Nord Stream pipeline and they kicked us out of the Black Sea. I'm not saying all of this is Joe's fault, I'm saying he had a hand and a lot of this and this isn't stuff, like, you know, your skin color, or what the weather is going to be like in 100 years. This is immediate stuff that affects families, schools, illegal immigration, crime and the cost of living.  And instead of addressing these things, he's denying them. There is no border crisis, there's no labor shortage, there is no fuel problems, he just denies it. He gets away with that but as the summer comes along it's going to get hot and all of these things are going to get exacerbated.  We elected a president to solve problems. Joe Biden is now creating problems. And it's ironic, Greg, you touch on this with the media, we've got Joe in the office because we didn't want any drama in the White House.",

JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS CO-HOST & POLITICAL ANALYST: I'll keep it -- I do but I will keep his butt out of it, Greg. I think -- I am listening with a music with I can see that Republicans are having a desperate time going after this popular president.  I mean, let's start with, you know, gas lines, right? Because I live in Washington, D.C., so right here next door is Virginia, and there been gas lines today. And I see what's going on, I think everybody is talking about the fact that there was a Russian criminal syndicate that hacked into the Colonial Pipeline and that created this temporary problem. Nobody blames Joe Biden, they blame the Russian criminal syndicate and know that according to the people who run the pipeline, this problem will be done shortly. And I mean, you think about inflation, right now you have higher costs on used cars, things like lumber. Why? Because the economy is taking off, it's heating up and some of the leftover problems from the pandemic are still with us and so there are going to be blips but they are going to be temporary blips.  And as far as foreign policy, Israel and the Arabs, my gosh, how many presidents have had to deal with flareups and hatred between Palestinians and the Israelis? I think that goes back to Eisenhower, doesn't it? I think what's going on here, Greg, you touched on it. What's going on here is a big attempt by Republicans to distract from what's going on in their own ranks. Today they canceled Liz Cheney. And why did they cancel her? Because she told the truth about the big lie. You say, people don't like Trump.   No, people know about the big lie, they know about the insurrection and they know about the damage done to democracy and they want to have this kind of thing rooted out but the Republican Party is having trouble reconstituting itself. Instead, it's the only thing that seems to bring them together in coalition is cult-like like affection for Donald Trump.",

I mean, that's not leadership, what we are seeing now is not leadership on a day when there are multiple crises and multiple fires to put out, both domestically and on the floor in front, the national security front. Joe Biden goes to the lectern and walks away and then says I'm going to get in trouble for answering your questions. He's the president of the United States. If there's any day when he should be answering questions it's today. And then when he's asked what Americans can expect about gas lines and the idea that there are multiple cities, major cities on the East Coast that are now out of gas as a result of an attack on the pipeline, he didn't have an answer for them.   He said, well, we need more education. That's not a solution to the problem that's happening right now. And all of this is a big test. The State Department is in -- is in Vienna negotiating with the Iranians to talk about getting back into a nuclear deal, giving them more money to do exactly what they are doing with Hamas against Israel. There is a lot of Americans who live in Israel. Israel is an ally of ours.  And if this is a Russian attack as the administration has said in one way or another, what is the response? Was this an act of war? How is America going to stand up and show strength at a time when they are testing this president on day 112 and you get, this is where we are. So, weakness is very clear and the White House is doing nothing to stand up for the strength of America at a time when everybody is watching.",

And yet, what happens when the evil Twitter leaves, you get inflation, Middle East unrest, joblessness, a relentless crime wave. Historians might call it a malaise. And so now you see the insidious trade-off from Morning Joe to Don Lemon, they never cared about the deeds, it was only Trump's hurtful words and they were happy to replace their sleepless nights with your actual material suffering. Well, congrats, media, there are no more mean tweets to keep you up at night, just impending economic doom. Sleep tight, you selfish babies.

But first I just want to pre-but what Juan is going to say. I don't want to hear about approval ratings, Juan. The guy is a Democrat. He's in his honeymoon period. The corrupt media has his back. If he were a Republican with this portfolio of problems, he'd already be deemed an incompetent failure. If you think about it this way, and I'm going to cover him objectively as I said I would, he was handed a recovering economy, a vaccine and a distribution plan that was humming along, a secure border, low gas prices and no inflation. And right now, the jobless rate just ticked up, we have a border mess, we have inflation back, high gas prices and the J&J pause destroyed vaccine confidence and the vaccination rates plummeted. I'm not even talking about the rise in homicides or shootings, the concern over school re-openings. I'm not talking about the cost of living that's gone up, these are just domestic issues. Think about internationally, too. He unfroze the aid to the Palestinians gave him a quarter billion which they use on weapons to attack Israel. We got hacked by Russians, they took down our pipeline. They restarted the Nord Stream pipeline and they kicked us out of the Black Sea. I'm not saying all of this is Joe's fault, I'm saying he had a hand and a lot of this and this isn't stuff, like, you know, your skin color, or what the weather is going to be like in 100 years. This is immediate stuff that affects families, schools, illegal immigration, crime and the cost of living. And instead of addressing these things, he's denying them. There is no border crisis, there's no labor shortage, there is no fuel problems, he just denies it. He gets away with that but as the summer comes along it's going to get hot and all of these things are going to get exacerbated. We elected a president to solve problems. Joe Biden is now creating problems. And it's ironic, Greg, you touch on this with the media, we've got Joe in the office because we didn't want any drama in the White House."

JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS CO-HOST & POLITICAL ANALYST: I'll keep it -- I do but I will keep his butt out of it, Greg. I think -- I am listening with a music with I can see that Republicans are having a desperate time going after this popular president. I mean, let's start with, you know, gas lines, right? Because I live in Washington, D.C., so right here next door is Virginia, and there been gas lines today. And I see what's going on, I think everybody is talking about the fact that there was a Russian criminal syndicate that hacked into the Colonial Pipeline and that created this temporary problem. Nobody blames Joe Biden, they blame the Russian criminal syndicate and know that according to the people who run the pipeline, this problem will be done shortly. And I mean, you think about inflation, right now you have higher costs on used cars, things like lumber. Why? Because the economy is taking off, it's heating up and some of the leftover problems from the pandemic are still with us and so there are going to be blips but they are going to be temporary blips. And as far as foreign policy, Israel and the Arabs, my gosh, how many presidents have had to deal with flareups and hatred between Palestinians and the Israelis? I think that goes back to Eisenhower, doesn't it? I think what's going on here, Greg, you touched on it. What's going on here is a big attempt by Republicans to distract from what's going on in their own ranks. Today they canceled Liz Cheney. And why did they cancel her? Because she told the truth about the big lie. You say, people don't like Trump. No, people know about the big lie, they know about the insurrection and they know about the damage done to democracy and they want to have this kind of thing rooted out but the Republican Party is having trouble reconstituting itself. Instead, it's the only thing that seems to bring them together in coalition is cult-like like affection for Donald Trump."

Joe Biden goes to the lectern and walks away and then says I'm going to get in trouble for answering your questions. He's the president of the United States. If there's any day when he should be answering questions it's today. And then when he's asked what Americans can expect about gas lines and the idea that there are multiple cities, major cities on the East Coast that are now out of gas as a result of an attack on the pipeline, he didn't have an answer for them. He said, well, we need more education. That's not a solution to the problem that's happening right now. And all of this is a big test. The State Department is in -- is in Vienna negotiating with the Iranians to talk about getting back into a nuclear deal, giving them more money to do exactly what they are doing with Hamas against Israel. There is a lot of Americans who live in Israel. Israel is an ally of ours. And if this is a Russian attack as the administration has said in one way or another, what is the response? Was this an act of war? How is America going to stand up and show strength at a time when they are testing this president on day 112 and you get, this is where we are.

It means that you can't get to work, right?

Dana brought this up before, just go talk to a small businessman. Today I talked to a restaurant-- restauranteur who owns five in New York City. He can't hire anyone because and he's got all these job openings but no one is taking them because they don't need to take them. So that in itself is an explanation. Right now, you have people who have children minding the store. These are not -- these are not -- these are not smart economic minds. And I want to point out, this gas prices is a foreshadowing of what life might be like if the climate cult got their way. If you didn't -- if you don't have affordable fuel and energy, this is the way it's going to be. It's going to be like this all the time and it's not like the Democrats mind that because remember, they want to reduce your consumption. That is why they really don't care about the gas lines.

But when you're talking about the video, like the videos that we shared and other people say, videos of abandoned children in the mountains, and they say well, that's clearly out of context. I want to know what kind of context would make that video better, were they on a kid's version of outward bound, were they part of a nature hike that we weren't aware of? I don't think there's a context that makes these videos better. And then finally, where is executive action Joe? He can stop all of this right now but he's too scared of his far-left flank.

But what happens when you have thousands of people a day down in New Mexico and Arizona who are paying smugglers to get them into the country without being detected.

You have Democratic mayors even saying, look, we can't handle this influx of people. And Americans are trying to get back to work with everything that's been going on and illegal labor depresses wages for American workers.

That's like 40 percent of the ones we're catching we're letting in. And think about all the other ones that are going around. What you're saying about unaccompanied minors is also not true. We've had two months in a row of all-time highs 18,000 and then 17,000. You're calling that progress?

This is easily solved if he just says we will not allow unaccompanied minors in and fly them back or just remain in Mexico. He can do it right like that, but he's choosing not to."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Our tech addiction is getting worse. A new study says all that staring at smartphones has turned us into \"human snails who ignore friends and family, and that people go home and disappear in theater devices instead of interacting with others in social settings. The researchers warn it's leading to the end of face-to-face interaction. So, Katie, what happens at dinner in your home? Are people allowed to be on the cell phone?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAVLICH",
      "utterance": "It depends on what kind of dinner. If it's a casual dinner and we're still working, then you still got to have your phone. But if it's a Friday night dinner or there are people over, then we'd like to put the phones away. But everything in moderation, right? I think if you live away from your family, that your cell phone can be a great way to communicate with them, to send them photos to keep in touch. So, while some people may be addicted, I think it's also for good use."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Well, Jesse, I was worried about this story because I thought you know, I remember in previous generations, people would complain about kids with boom boxes or Sony Walkman going down the street. And I think you know, are we just now upset that people are walking down the street on their cell phones? What do you think?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Well, I think a long, long time ago you used to sit around your house and you'd have to interact with your family who you hated. And then they invented the television, so they put on a TV show and everyone gets around the television, and that was OK for a while. But no one liked the same thing on TV. So you had to buy a lot of TVs for the house and everybody goes into their own room. And then your mother comes upstairs and she finds out you're watching Road Rules, Real World Challenge while your grandmother's visiting from Connecticut and she's appalled. And she says turn that off and come downstairs and talk to your grandmother. Now, you can be on your phone and you're -- no one has any idea what you're looking at. Looking on your phone can be important. It could be work. It could be an emergency. It can be important communication. But you can't see what someone's doing on their phone, so you don't and you interact and say get off the phone. And that's the problem. Everybody can just go like this and look important."

      "utterance": "Yes. This is old fogies complaint is less about the dinner table because I don't see that too much around here, but I think people walking down the street looking at their cell phones, they walk right into traffic. They don't pay attention to traffic lights or other pedestrians, much less cars. I just think it's crazy."

      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "Where -- what street are you walking around? You're not even -- in New York, people who are up here -- I mean, but also my -- I talked to my family more because of my phone. I am definitely way more in touch with -- including my aunt Patty Sue in Rawlins, Wyoming. You got to check in with APS every day. I'm more concerned about the kids on the electric scooters that almost ran me over on my way to work today. They're on the sidewalk. You should not be on the sidewalk on those things. And when I say kid, I mean grown man in a suit."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "A grown man in a suit. Wow. All right, so Greg, but I think the other side of this is some people would say that these devices, these cell phones and iPads, they help with loneliness, and that you know, people connect. They create social groups and communities, sometimes conspiracies are in there, but do you think it helps with loneliness? Are we approaching this from the wrong direction?"

      "speaker": "GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST",
      "utterance": "Well, I think -- I mean, I think we're involved in the world's largest scientific experiment. This is -- everybody's been given a device that has never existed before. And all the device does is meet every momentary need for interaction and there are benefits in their costs. The benefit is because you've cut out a lot of the legwork for the things that you need, whether it's research or going to a supermarket, you, therefore, have more time to spend with your loved ones. But the cost is you don't spend your -- that time with your loved one, you just spend more time on the phone, so it's this recursive thing. The more time you save the more glued you are to the phone So, what you're seeing is you know, the phone has become in itself an implant. We talked about chip implants. But the phone is -- it's tethered to your body. It's in your head. It's part of you. It may not be in your brain, it doesn't need to be, but it can't be taken from you anymore. We are stuck with it. The tech giants can get us to do anything now."

So, it has -- it cuts -- it cuts both ways and humans have like a threshold of embarrassment and alcohol removes that threshold.

And I mean shot of courage was, you know, a shot of tequila or something. OK. But you know there's a great danger in there, I think.
