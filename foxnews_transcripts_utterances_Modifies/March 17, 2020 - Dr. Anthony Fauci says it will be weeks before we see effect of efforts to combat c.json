Why are there so many unanswered questions at this point? Dr. Anthony Fauci is here from the White House coronavirus task force with some answers. And you have heard the left's claim that Trump got rid of the pandemic response office, I'm sure you've heard that. Well, tonight we have someone who led that very office and he says the left as usual is lying.  Plus the Trump administration has a third stimulus package in the works, where the heck is all those money coming from? Congressman Devin Nunes and Lee Zeldin are here to talk about it. Also we may be facing an imminent nightmare scenario at the border a lot of people aren't talking about this because of this outbreak.  We are going to explain how things are unfolding there tonight and how it could be happening there in a really bad way in the coming weeks? And don't forget that there are 2020 primaries, I just mentioned as to Sean, three states have primaries, polls that closing just moments ago in Arizona, we are going to bring you all the race calls as they come in.  But first, the Coronavirus continues to spread in the U.S. and across the globe. For the latest on this outbreak, let's go to the Fox News West Coast Correspondent Jeff Paul who is live tonight in L.A. Jeff?",

      "sentences": "Jeff thanks so much for that tonight. What we still don't know, that's the focus of tonight's Angle. Beyond the massive health implications, the Wuhan pandemic has upended our lives it has thrown our economy into a complete tailspin. Let's face it.   What's worth quickly reviewing what we know and what we still don't know about the current outbreak? Now for starters, we know that COVID-19 is the latest Coronavirus to infect and kill people across the globe. We know what happened with other Coronavirus outbreaks. In November 2002, SARS - or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome was discovered in Southern China. It affected more than 8,000 people worldwide and had a death rate of 10 percent. No one died in the U.S. and it was largely over by July of 2003.  The first case of MERS or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome occurred in Jordan in April 2012. First thought it was from Saudi Arabia then whistling back to Jordan. It spread believed it or not through contact with camels and close person-to-person interaction such as caring for an infected person. Now more than 2400 were affected globally with over 850 deaths, only two cases were ever found here. Both in health care providers who had traveled to Saudi Arabia. The case fatality rate was approximately 35 percent.  Well, then of course there is the newest viral beast COVID-19. So far, these are the stats the virus is in more than 150 countries and territories with nearly 200,000 infected, nearly an 8,000 deaths.  In the U.S., we are just now ramping up testing thank goodness and so far we have nearly 6300 infections and 105 deaths. We know that most of the victims are elderly or otherwise infirm individuals. But there are many important questions about this virus that remain and the answers are going to tell us whether the mediation actions we have taken you know all the sheltering in place, what we're doing now were right or wrong? Too much or too little.  Number one, the true mortality rate as \"The Guardian\" reported today \"We don't yet know how dangerous the new Coronavirus is and we won't know until more data comes in. Estimates range from below 1 percent to over 14 percent among seniors or the medically compromised\".   Now here in the U.S. it seems that the more we test, the lower the mortality rate that makes everyone feel a little better doesn't it? Well, that graph tells the story. Number two, contagiousness. People are terrified they're going to get the disease by just walking by someone on the street or in the grocery store, going out to get milk and by sitting next to someone in the doctor's office for just 5 minutes. But Dr. Richard Martin Melo and Infectious Disease Specialist at Yale New Haven said there's still so much to learn about how this pathogen is transmitted between individuals. Data is needed not only to better understand when those become ill shed the virus but also which body fluids contain the virus and how those may contaminate surfaces and even the air surrounding them?  There was also an important study conducted by Stanford Researcher on the confirmed instance of the virus spreading person-to-person in the U.S. It was a woman in her 60s who returned to the U.S. from China in mid-January of her 372 trace contacts, a study published in the Lancet found that they have only detected transmission of the specific name of the disease, that is the Coronavirus we are talking about in a single household contact with frequent prolonged interactions with the indexed patient.  That's interesting out of 372 contacts only one person who basically lived with her, her husband got it. Number three, why some people get sick and some don't. We don't know why some of those have infected experience only mild cold like symptoms that resolve on their own, while a significant minority of those infected may have serious symptoms that lead to pneumonia and even death. Now one theory is that the severity of symptoms is linked to the strength of a person's general immune system but that's just one possible explanation. Number four. Patient zero? We still don't know who the first patient was who contracted the virus in China. Now that's a key fact that a lot of researchers say is essential to the analysis of this disease.   Now we first heard that it was like late December, then it was December 1st and now reports to it all the way back to November 17th. This means that the Coronavirus started spreading for weeks before the first cases were officially reported by China and that brings me to the question number five, trusting the Chinese. As soon as word got out about this new potentially deadly virus, the CCP began to crack down on journalists for doing their job. For example \"The New York Times\" reported in January that when a group of Hong Kong journalists went to the Wuhan hospital that took in most Coronavirus patients, the police detained them for a few hours.  They were then asked to delete their TV footage and hand in their phones and cameras for inspection. Today, China announced that it was expelling American journalists from The New York Times, The Washington Post, and The Wall Street Journal.  They cited ideological bias against China, fake news made in the name of press freedom and breaches of ethics in journalism. China's motivation here folks is obvious, it further allows them to deprive us and of their own people of real information, accurate information on what the heck is going on and what happened originally with this Coronavirus.",

      "sentences": "And speaking of saving lives, we still don't know what the fate is of the two citizen journalists who disappeared last month after questioning the government's response to the virus, they are just gone. Question number six, China's relationship with the WHO Remember China is Co-Founder of the World Health Organization and it provides an enormous amount of funding to it, they are now the second largest donor after United States.  But somehow they seem to be pulling all the strings. CNN is reporting the WHO's praise of China's response have led critics to question a relationship between the two entities. Perhaps one of the most overt examples of China's sway over the WHO is its success in blocking Taiwan's access to that body, a position that could have very real consequences for the Taiwanese people if the virus takes hold there.  So when you hear of officials here or journalists even, commentators lauding the Chinese containment of the virus, take that all with a very large grain of salt. Remember, while we are wise to heed expert advice from trusted U.S. sources during this time we should also remember that there is a lot we do not know and a lot of information coming from China that we can't frankly trust.

The degree of the effect and how it's going to impact on that curve will likely take several weeks. That doesn't mean we need to be in the situation we are right now but as we said we put these mitigation strategies in for a 15 day.

Dr. Fauci, another point about how contagious this virus is, in looking at some of the patient zero studies and specifically one done by Lancet which I just highlighted in Angle. It says that actually the patient zero in the state of Illinois only infected one person out of the 372 people she came into contact with which kind of begs the question, if that's the case, are people really getting the right information about how close you have to stand someone?   Or if you walk by someone on the street that is infected, should you be worried about getting it? Because it seems like in some of the studies that I've read to, it really is close continuous contact.",

If you have an individual that you are actually in physical contact with who was actively ill, coughing, you are at a high risk. If you're at an individual who you have just casual contact with who is sick, that might be a medium risk. If someone is asymptomatic but infected and you walk into a room or you just talk to them for a few minutes, that's a very low risk. So we have to be careful we don't just bundle them all in one, there are relative risks depending upon the exposure. And I think it could be a little bit misleading to say one person had contact with these many individuals and he only infected one.  You know that same person who would be in a room in close contact if he was symptomatic, could infect two or three and that's where you get that number that people have been talking about. So we have to be careful we don't get misled to be too complacent, nor misled to feel that there is a higher risk than there is.",

      "sentences": "Well, you know it's an obvious good question. So, first of all as we said in the guidelines yesterday, it's important if you are a person that you just described, that person should essentially hunker down and self isolate. The problem with saying everybody else can go and do whatever they want to do is they get infected it becomes inevitable that they will be at a risk.  They will risk the individuals who are vulnerable because first of all it's almost impossible to have complete lack of any contact with an individual but also you've got to be careful. Just because the vast majority of individuals who are young and healthy don't get seriously ill, some do. So I think as I kind of pleaded at the press conference today, we depend on the young people to both protect themselves but also to assume the responsibility of protecting the vulnerable ones. It's a two part component, it isn't just sequester and isolate to those who are at risk, it's to get the rest of the population to kind of shield them by not getting infected themselves and inadvertently affecting those individuals.",

A pair of injunctions were issued by Obama judicial appointees, and that attempted, and of course it didn't attempt to, it blocked the Trump asylum rule. Those injunctions were upheld by the Ninth Circuit. Then last week, the U.S. Supreme Court overruled the injunctions, meaning asylees will have to stay in Mexico to await their immigration trials.

So Mexico may well have to, finally, and they should do this, seal its southern border. They have to seal it shut to stop the flow of aliens traveling north. During the Supreme Court arguments last week, the solicitor general argued that if the Trump asylum policy were suddenly stopped, some 25,000 individuals sent to Mexico would rush immediately to the United States, and that is even before factoring in the pandemic. Each day about 1,500 people currently cross the southern border outside of the normal border entry points, and that number is going to skyrocket as this crisis goes on. Now, the president does have some options here. The National Emergencies Act gives him the ability to declare an emergency at the border. This is separate, by the way, from what is happening now with the other provisions that he's taking for HHS. There are a lot of different emergency powers he can enact, but he can actually order the border better sealed and these policies to be in place to protect the health of Americans and border agents. So what impact could a prolonged pandemic have on our ability to maintain order and safety at the border? And what should we do next? For answers, we turn to Brandon Judd, president of the National Border Patrol Council and a current Border Patrol agent who has been working on the front lines for 22 years. Brandon, I want to remind everybody, OK, that last year, the Trump administration pushed an executive order that would have prevented individuals from coming into the United States and claiming asylum in between regular border entry points. That makes sense, right? We don't want people to be able to walk across, or swim across the Rio Grande, as we saw when we were in Del Rio, and then claim asylum, because that just causes all sorts of problems. And of course, it was enjoined, as I mentioned, by federal judges all appointed by Obama. It was enjoined, meaning, guess what, now we have to fight this in court.

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Jeff thanks so much for that tonight. What we still don't know, that's the focus of tonight's Angle. Beyond the massive health implications, the Wuhan pandemic has upended our lives it has thrown our economy into a complete tailspin. Let's face it. What's worth quickly reviewing what we know and what we still don't know about the current outbreak? Now for starters, we know that COVID-19 is the latest Coronavirus to infect and kill people across the globe. We know what happened with other Coronavirus outbreaks. In November 2002, SARS - or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome was discovered in Southern China. It affected more than 8,000 people worldwide and had a death rate of 10 percent. No one died in the U.S. and it was largely over by July of 2003. The first case of MERS or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome occurred in Jordan in April 2012. First thought it was from Saudi Arabia then whistling back to Jordan. It spread believed it or not through contact with camels and close person-to-person interaction such as caring for an infected person. Now more than 2400 were affected globally with over 850 deaths, only two cases were ever found here. Both in health care providers who had traveled to Saudi Arabia. The case fatality rate was approximately 35 percent. Well, then of course there is the newest viral beast COVID-19. So far, these are the stats the virus is in more than 150 countries and territories with nearly 200,000 infected, nearly an 8,000 deaths. In the U.S., we are just now ramping up testing thank goodness and so far we have nearly 6300 infections and 105 deaths. We know that most of the victims are elderly or otherwise infirm individuals. But there are many important questions about this virus that remain and the answers are going to tell us whether the mediation actions we have taken you know all the sheltering in place, what we're doing now were right or wrong? Too much or too little. Number one, the true mortality rate as \"The Guardian\" reported today \"We don't yet know how dangerous the new Coronavirus is and we won't know until more data comes in. Estimates range from below 1 percent to over 14 percent among seniors or the medically compromised\". Now here in the U.S. it seems that the more we test, the lower the mortality rate that makes everyone feel a little better doesn't it? Well, that graph tells the story. Number two, contagiousness. People are terrified they're going to get the disease by just walking by someone on the street or in the grocery store, going out to get milk and by sitting next to someone in the doctor's office for just 5 minutes. But Dr. Richard Martin Melo and Infectious Disease Specialist at Yale New Haven said there's still so much to learn about how this pathogen is transmitted between individuals. Data is needed not only to better understand when those become ill shed the virus but also which body fluids contain the virus and how those may contaminate surfaces and even the air surrounding them? There was also an important study conducted by Stanford Researcher on the confirmed instance of the virus spreading person-to-person in the U.S. It was a woman in her 60s who returned to the U.S. from China in mid-January of her 372 trace contacts, a study published in the Lancet found that they have only detected transmission of the specific name of the disease, that is the Coronavirus we are talking about in a single household contact with frequent prolonged interactions with the indexed patient. That's interesting out of 372 contacts only one person who basically lived with her, her husband got it. Number three, why some people get sick and some don't. We don't know why some of those have infected experience only mild cold like symptoms that resolve on their own, while a significant minority of those infected may have serious symptoms that lead to pneumonia and even death. Now one theory is that the severity of symptoms is linked to the strength of a person's general immune system but that's just one possible explanation. Number four. Patient zero? We still don't know who the first patient was who contracted the virus in China. Now that's a key fact that a lot of researchers say is essential to the analysis of this disease. Now we first heard that it was like late December, then it was December 1st and now reports to it all the way back to November 17th. This means that the Coronavirus started spreading for weeks before the first cases were officially reported by China and that brings me to the question number five, trusting the Chinese. As soon as word got out about this new potentially deadly virus, the CCP began to crack down on journalists for doing their job. For example \"The New York Times\" reported in January that when a group of Hong Kong journalists went to the Wuhan hospital that took in most Coronavirus patients, the police detained them for a few hours. They were then asked to delete their TV footage and hand in their phones and cameras for inspection. Today, China announced that it was expelling American journalists from The New York Times, The Washington Post, and The Wall Street Journal. They cited ideological bias against China, fake news made in the name of press freedom and breaches of ethics in journalism. China's motivation here folks is obvious, it further allows them to deprive us and of their own people of real information, accurate information on what the heck is going on and what happened originally with this Coronavirus."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "UNIDENTIFIED MALE",
      "utterance": "I regret China's decision today to further foreclose the world's ability to conduct prepress operations which would be really good for the Chinese people. In these incredibly challenging global times, were more information, more transparency are what will save lives."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "And speaking of saving lives, we still don't know what the fate is of the two citizen journalists who disappeared last month after questioning the government's response to the virus, they are just gone. Question number six, China's relationship with the WHO Remember China is Co-Founder of the World Health Organization and it provides an enormous amount of funding to it, they are now the second largest donor after United States. But somehow they seem to be pulling all the strings. CNN is reporting the WHO's praise of China's response have led critics to question a relationship between the two entities. Perhaps one of the most overt examples of China's sway over the WHO is its success in blocking Taiwan's access to that body, a position that could have very real consequences for the Taiwanese people if the virus takes hold there. So when you hear of officials here or journalists even, commentators lauding the Chinese containment of the virus, take that all with a very large grain of salt. Remember, while we are wise to heed expert advice from trusted U.S. sources during this time we should also remember that there is a lot we do not know and a lot of information coming from China that we can't frankly trust. That's the ANGLE."

All right, Dr. Fauci, it's great to see you, you are working around the clock. First of all we just want to thank you for all of your efforts on behalf of the American people, I know it's an anxious nation and it's a worried nation. But when they heard you mention several weeks before we know whether this social distancing we are all in our houses and businesses are closing does that mean we're going to be behind closed doors for several weeks? Is that what you are saying there?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FAUCI",
      "utterance": "No, I didn't mean that at all Laura. When I was saying the question here, the person who questioned me wanted to know when we would have an absolute idea of what the effect would be. And I can tell you, I mean just projecting about what we know, what containment of mitigation does, we almost certainly are having an effect right now as we speak. The degree of the effect and how it's going to impact on that curve will likely take several weeks. That doesn't mean we need to be in the situation we are right now but as we said we put these mitigation strategies in for a 15 day. We'll likely extend it beyond that but we really do re-evaluate it on a day by day basis."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Yes, I mean parents across the country obviously dealing with children at home and some of them out of work it's hard to see after a few days how after fifteen days people are going to be able to hold it together but maybe everyone is just spoiled. Dr. Fauci, another point about how contagious this virus is, in looking at some of the patient zero studies and specifically one done by Lancet which I just highlighted in Angle. It says that actually the patient zero in the state of Illinois only infected one person out of the 372 people she came into contact with which kind of begs the question, if that's the case, are people really getting the right information about how close you have to stand someone? Or if you walk by someone on the street that is infected, should you be worried about getting it? Because it seems like in some of the studies that I've read to, it really is close continuous contact."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FAUCI",
      "utterance": "Well, yes. I mean, obviously Laura there is low, medium, and high risk. If you have an individual that you are actually in physical contact with who was actively ill, coughing, you are at a high risk. If you're at an individual who you have just casual contact with who is sick, that might be a medium risk. If someone is asymptomatic but infected and you walk into a room or you just talk to them for a few minutes, that's a very low risk. So we have to be careful we don't just bundle them all in one, there are relative risks depending upon the exposure. And I think it could be a little bit misleading to say one person had contact with these many individuals and he only infected one. You know that same person who would be in a room in close contact if he was symptomatic, could infect two or three and that's where you get that number that people have been talking about. So we have to be careful we don't get misled to be too complacent, nor misled to feel that there is a higher risk than there is."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "And Dr. Fauci another question, viewers keep emailing into me is, if we know that the elderly and immune-suppressed are the most vulnerable to the higher mortality rates especially, then why lock down healthy people and young people? They all want to go out tonight same patties there they're obviously most of them are not thankfully. But why not socially distance the most at risk population instead of what we are doing now? I didn't have a good answer to it when I keep getting asked that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FAUCI",
      "utterance": "Well, you know it's an obvious good question. So, first of all as we said in the guidelines yesterday, it's important if you are a person that you just described, that person should essentially hunker down and self isolate. The problem with saying everybody else can go and do whatever they want to do is they get infected it becomes inevitable that they will be at a risk. They will risk the individuals who are vulnerable because first of all it's almost impossible to have complete lack of any contact with an individual but also you've got to be careful. Just because the vast majority of individuals who are young and healthy don't get seriously ill, some do. So I think as I kind of pleaded at the press conference today, we depend on the young people to both protect themselves but also to assume the responsibility of protecting the vulnerable ones. It's a two part component, it isn't just sequester and isolate to those who are at risk, it's to get the rest of the population to kind of shield them by not getting infected themselves and inadvertently affecting those individuals."

      "utterance": "That's not the case, this is a brand-new virus. We don't know how it's going to act Laura. It might, it hit us and then essentially could disappear the way SARS did. It is so infectious that I doubt it's going to be a one off. It's likely it may cycle but we can't say that now. Sooner or later, everyone's going to get infected that is not a true statement."
    },

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "FAUCI",
      "utterance": "Well, there are two things about that, I don't think that we are going to have to go through the same thing as we are going through now, several things will be different. A certain segment of the population will have been infected so you get some degree of background immunity, probably not enough to protect the whole population by any means. By that time, we will have already completed some of the trials on a variety of therapies. We don't know if they work now. Some of them might, if they do we'll make them available. Remember I said the vaccine would be available within the year to a year and a half; we're right now in the first phase one trial. Hopefully we'll get enough information to be able to have that available. So a lot of things can change, and be available next season that we didn't have for us right now."

There was a constant demand signal from the President a constant demand signal from Ambassador Bolton. And frankly I think we should all be proud of the effort that the United States led to conquer Ebola in the Congo, which we did. This is a different kind of epidemic. When we dealt with Ebola in the Congo, we had a government that cooperated with us. We all know that is not the case with the Communist Party of China. They are hiding information from us, they are selling this information, we've seen this playbook from them before. They want us to fear each other, and they want us to distrust each other. They want to undermine our faith in our government. We can get a handle on this virus, listen to Dr. Fauci, listen to Dr. Redfield, listen to the President, the time will come to figure out what we could have done better but I really hope we all stand together and figure out how we can conquer this disease as quickly as possible."

We still don't have good data as to who's getting sick, what are the symptoms of the people who are getting sick, and what are the best ways to treat it? And that is the travesty here. So as we move forward, the question in the macro sense, if we keep people laid off, OK, which we're not right at the beginning of this, and really it's going to depend, Laura, on whether this goes two weeks, a month, or two months.

So China, where this whole thing started, is now kicking our journalists out of their country. And when they're not doing that, they are actually saying that we created this virus. Here's what the government said today \"In response to the U.S. slashing the staff size of Chinese media in the U.S., which is expulsion in all but name, China demands that journalists of U.S. citizenship working with \"The Times,\" \"The Journal,\" and \"The Washington Post\" hand back there press cards within ten calendar days. They will not be allowed to continue working as journalists in the People's Republic of China.\" So they are saying you started it, basically, Congressman Zeldin.

Comparing the people who are essentially operatives of the Communist Party in China who serve here in the U.S., some had to leave, to journalists from some of these American media outlets, that's apples and oranges. And you don't see two different value systems. You don't see the United States government removing people from \"The New York Times\" and \"The Wall Street Journal\" and these others. The president isn't -- you still have a seat inside the press room for Jim Acosta and some of these other personalities who are there and harassing and aren't honestly reporting in many situations. It's two different value systems."

But trusting China in all this? Every time the president says the great work of China, my head blows off my shoulders. But we rely on them for antibiotics so we can't offend China. But this whole situation with China has got to be reexamined. And we shouldn't be shuttering in place. China should be shuttering in place tonight, OK. So that's my word. Gentlemen, that's enough of my rant. Thanks so much for coming on. We appreciate it. And coming up, we are facing a nightmare scenario at our border on top of everything else.

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "While we focus on the COVID-19 pandemic, we may be ignoring a major crisis that's looming on the border. Last year, the Trump administration implemented a policy, we talked about it a lot on THE ANGLE, requiring asylum-seekers to return to Mexico as they awaited trial if they came in in between ports of entry. A pair of injunctions were issued by Obama judicial appointees, and that attempted, and of course it didn't attempt to, it blocked the Trump asylum rule. Those injunctions were upheld by the Ninth Circuit. Then last week, the U.S. Supreme Court overruled the injunctions, meaning asylees will have to stay in Mexico to await their immigration trials. But as the global pandemic spreads, Mexico is going to face its own internal pressures, and cooperation could start breaking down. The president was asked about the situation at the border today."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Let's hope they remain so, but it's not beyond conception that literally thousands will rush into Mexico and then try to get into the United States seeking medical care in the wake of this pandemic, and of course free medical care, because when they come here, they get free care. So Mexico may well have to, finally, and they should do this, seal its southern border. They have to seal it shut to stop the flow of aliens traveling north. During the Supreme Court arguments last week, the solicitor general argued that if the Trump asylum policy were suddenly stopped, some 25,000 individuals sent to Mexico would rush immediately to the United States, and that is even before factoring in the pandemic. Each day about 1,500 people currently cross the southern border outside of the normal border entry points, and that number is going to skyrocket as this crisis goes on. Now, the president does have some options here. The National Emergencies Act gives him the ability to declare an emergency at the border. This is separate, by the way, from what is happening now with the other provisions that he's taking for HHS. There are a lot of different emergency powers he can enact, but he can actually order the border better sealed and these policies to be in place to protect the health of Americans and border agents. So what impact could a prolonged pandemic have on our ability to maintain order and safety at the border? And what should we do next? For answers, we turn to Brandon Judd, president of the National Border Patrol Council and a current Border Patrol agent who has been working on the front lines for 22 years. Brandon, I want to remind everybody, OK, that last year, the Trump administration pushed an executive order that would have prevented individuals from coming into the United States and claiming asylum in between regular border entry points. That makes sense, right? We don't want people to be able to walk across, or swim across the Rio Grande, as we saw when we were in Del Rio, and then claim asylum, because that just causes all sorts of problems. And of course, it was enjoined, as I mentioned, by federal judges all appointed by Obama. It was enjoined, meaning, guess what, now we have to fight this in court. How deleterious were those series of injunctions to the effort to get this border under control?"

All you have to do is go back to the crisis and smugglers bringing in children for sex trafficking and every other of the illegal acts that they make. For judges to enjoin the migrant protection protocols, a groundbreaking deal that any of President Trump's predecessors would have loved to have had, cooperation, finally cooperation from Mexico. And to have two judges enjoin that agreement, it was horrendous for the country, it's horrendous for border security, and it's horrendous for the safety of the American people."

But this would be important for the president to be able to do because I foresee this, Brandon, that as time goes on with the crush we are seeing in Mexico right now, this could put the health of our Border Patrol agents in jeopardy and further work toward a collapse of our health care system, especially in California and Texas and Arizona and Florida.
