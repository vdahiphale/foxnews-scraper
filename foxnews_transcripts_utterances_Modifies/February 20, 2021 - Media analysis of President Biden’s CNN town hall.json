      "sentences": "So, thanks to CNN, we learned a lot of new things about President Biden, A, he likes to build a fire in the Oval Office. B, he uses the fireplace. C, he often throws a log on otherwise known as a John Kerry. D, he likes to read the newspaper on a plane.   This is some crazy [bleep]. So what else will we hope to learn from our fearless press? That Joe puts his socks on one foot at a time, hopefully before he puts on his slippers?  But in all seriousness, this is a great strategy. The more boring Joe appears, the easier it is to slip in those radical policies. It's truly the opposite of Trump who commanded everyone's attention so he was always scrutinized.  But Joe, he just Joes along and the media just smiles and returns to their needlepoint. Next thing you know, you've got the expansion of the welfare state and trillions of dollars for cockamamie climate plans. Yes, I said cockamamie, bleep me.    But hey, everyone knows Joe likes kids better than people.",

Because China's atrocities are balanced out by affordable basketball shoes?   Maybe it's me, but this China First America Last shtick is already getting kind of old.

A terrifying close call for a Colorado suburb after a Hawaii-bound United Airlines flight experienced engine failure. The plane scattered debris including large metal parts across several neighborhoods in Broomfield. It landed safely at Denver International Airport. No injuries were reported, but some property damage was happening and anyone finding debris from the plane is advised not to move it or touch it. Federal investigators are on the scene. Also three people are dead and two others are hurt after a shooting at a New Orleans area gun store. Investigators said gunfire erupted after an argument between the suspect and an employee. The suspect who died at the scene reportedly entered the store with a fully loaded un-holstered gun. The two injured people were taken to the hospital and are stable. I'm Ashley Strohmier.

But now, even Crest says they're reconsidering working with Chris, odd coming from a brand whose entire purpose is to whiten things. In an interview, Harrison spoke out against cancel culture but essence effusively apologized, it was painful, like it matters. Meanwhile, the cancel saga of Gina Carano continues with the cowards at Hasbro announcing they will no longer make action figures of her \"Star Wars\" character from \"The Mandalorian.\" And finally, woke teachers are now going after William Shakespeare over claims that his works promote misogyny, racism and homophobia, among many other things. Nothing makes the woke-ademics feel more alive than canceling a guy who has been dead for 400 years. Why, I'm producing my own version of \"Romeo and Juliet,\" here are my actors rehearsing the balcony scene.",

That Joe puts his socks on one foot at a time, hopefully before he puts on his slippers? But in all seriousness, this is a great strategy. The more boring Joe appears, the easier it is to slip in those radical policies. It's truly the opposite of Trump who commanded everyone's attention so he was always scrutinized. But Joe, he just Joes along and the media just smiles and returns to their needlepoint.

It is because the media is so bias, you can see the political perspective and, you know, President -- former President Trump and the media were like oil and water, but even when he tried to do good things, they would criticize him.

The plane scattered debris including large metal parts across several neighborhoods in Broomfield. It landed safely at Denver International Airport. No injuries were reported, but some property damage was happening and anyone finding debris from the plane is advised not to move it or touch it. Federal investigators are on the scene. Also three people are dead and two others are hurt after a shooting at a New Orleans area gun store. Investigators said gunfire erupted after an argument between the suspect and an employee. The suspect who died at the scene reportedly entered the store with a fully loaded un-holstered gun. The two injured people were taken to the hospital and are stable. I'm Ashley Strohmier.

But when you're going to say that the most, you know, most destruction, most -- highest insurance claims because so much was destroyed in you know, recorded history was a couple of food stands were vandalized, you've lost all credibility at that point. Because a simple Google search would show it's not like this is hidden information. And I had to pour over Excel spreadsheets to figure that out. It's pretty obvious.
