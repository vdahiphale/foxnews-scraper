Iran pushing back, saying there is some mental retardation in the White House, saying that there will not be any talks until there is sanctions relief. It is the topic up on Capitol Hill and here at the White House when it comes to foreign affairs ahead of the G20.  Let's bring in our panel, Byron York, chief political correspondent for the \"Washington Examiner,\" Charles Lane, opinion writer for \"The Washington Post,\" and Guy Benson, political editor at Townhall.com and the host of \"The Guy Benson Show\" on Fox News Radio. Gentlemen, Byron, your thoughts on where we are. BRYON YORK, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, \"WASHINGTON EXAMINER\": First of all, this seems to raise some questions about consistency with the president. Just a few days ago, he canceled this planned retaliation against Iran for the shootdown of the drone because he said it would be disproportionate. Now he's saying any attack on anything American would be met with overwhelming force and possibly obliteration. So that's quite a change.  At the same time, though, he is keeping this maximum pressure campaign and even increasing it with some new sanctions. It is having a devastating effect. And Senator Rubio basically just suggested that we did strike back in some ways that we don't know about. So I think we don't really know the full story of what's going on right now.",

      "sentences": "And Chuck, I guess the question is, this is a different strategy than it was in June of 2009 when the Obama administration did not really respond to the Green Revolution on the ground in Tehran. This is betting that the people on the ground don't have a lot of love for the Ayatollah or the leaders, and they are sanctioning them anyway. CHARLES LANE, OPINION WRITER, \"WASHINGTON POST\": Except that the president also said today we want them to stay when he was referring to leadership, so I have a little bit of similar problem to Byron. The nuances aren't held consistent there. I think the right answer on these sanctions, frankly, is that their impact is mostly symbolic. The people who have been targeted, including the foreign minister, aren't the sort of people who necessarily were going to make a lot of use of the U.S. controlled banking system in the first place.  And it looks to me like the big picture here is no one wants a war. Trump doesn't want a war, his Democratic opponents don't want a war, the Republicans don't want a war, Iran doesn't want a war, Europe doesn't want a war. We came close to one a little while ago, and the president pulled back from the retaliation at the very last minute.   And so this sanction thing I think is a way of showing, yes, I pulled back there, but I'm not finished with you guys. I'm not giving you guys a free pass. And it helps to maybe reset the whole situation, because, frankly, the long-term play for this administration, if it's going to work at all, is to keep squeezing Iran on the oil exports and trying to ground their economy down. And so I think realistically there's been a lot of crazy rhetoric about mental retardation and stuff in the last couple of days, but I think we have wound up back at that place.",

There was a question whether or not unilateral U.S. sanctions could really bring Iran to its knees or hurt them badly. I think the reason they have lashed out recently is because they feel like they are in a place of weakness. They are trying to stir the pot to get some movement because there is a \"Washington Post\" story about the strangulation of Hezbollah because of these sanctions from the Trump administration. And what the president did here, I agree with these other two gentlemen, there were a few mixed messages from the president in the Oval Office today, but overall what he was doing was recognizing these provocations. It is Iran that has been pushing the international community closer and closer to the brink. The president said if we see it, it's not acceptable. Here are some new sanctions and some cyber intrusions. We are not going -- we are taking all of the bait right now, and that's why he used the term proportionality. I think a lot of Americans look at some of the messaging and say, OK, it may not make sense, but they look at the action of the president, and they say that seems pretty sensible.",

      "utterance": "I did a piece on that today and stopped at 26 examples of such statements from Democrats. They have to realize, I think, that they are responsible for some of this stuff. Right now part of the opposition among House Democrats is opposition to the administration deporting people who are here illegally who have had full legal due process and have gotten a deportation order from a judge. That used not to be controversial. It is now with Democrats."

Roper and Sons chapel appealed to the Lincoln community to make sure the unclaimed veteran was given the funeral he deserves since his family could not be located. Hundreds showed up, including Nebraska Senator Ben Sasse and Governor Pete Ricketts. Quick was buried with full military honors. Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight.
