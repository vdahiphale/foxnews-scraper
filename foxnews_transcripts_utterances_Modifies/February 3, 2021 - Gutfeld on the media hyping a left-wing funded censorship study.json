You hear about that big study claiming big tech really doesn't favor liberals? It was funded by a big tech liberal. But you won't find out that fact in any of the mainstream reports but the guy behind it is billionaire Craig Newmark. He also donated millions to fight fake news and a ton to Biden's campaign as well.   He also founded Craigslist, the online bulletin board where I sell my discarded swimwear. But last night, Tucker revealed the study was in fact no study at all.",

There is only one legitimate point of view and it is theirs, and if you don't fall in line with them, if you don't agree with them, you're wrong and now they are so emboldened and aligned with one another, they will also destroy you. You see that with technology, just with the shutting down of Parler.   But we've been here before and ultimately, people turned against the outrage the push back on censorship and cancellation. You saw it with the Red Scare, the House on American activities committee, and McCarthyism. But the scary thing is even if righteousness wins out, there's a lot of carnage before that happens with lives and livelihoods destroyed. Worst-case scenario is that the Dems this kind collective joining in, they went out.

      "sentences": "You know, Juan, studies like this, or when the media covers studies like this, isn't it their responsibility to say who paid for it? When I worked in health journalism there was always a little note at the end of the story, this study on orange juice reducing cholesterol was funded by the orange juice board. It was always kind of, they had to do it.  JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS CO-HOST & POLITICAL ANALYST: I don't think it was hidden, Greg. But I must say I'm struck by what you said in the terms that, you know, usually you and I disagree, and I think this may be an occasion where we meet at the mountaintop but just we come up different sides of the mountain.  Because from my side of the mountain, I think that big tech, with its ability to tell us how to think, you know, what to buy, how to vote, I think that that is too big and they need to be regulated, in some cases may be even broken up, but they certainly need some kind of interface with the publics so that the public understands what's going on and why they do what they do and when they do it. They are too powerful.  But from my side of the mountain, I just wanted to say, I don't -- I don't want conservative thought limited. I don't think it is limited. When I look at these platforms, I see Ben Shapiro, you know, I see Dan Bongino, they've got the leading sites out there, many of them are conservative sites that are the top sites on social media.    So, I don't see that there is any bias against the conservatives. But I think that when you start talking about killing politicians, when you start plotting violent, seditious acts against the capitol of the United States, when you embrace conspiracy theories, when that kind of trash is spread on these sites, I don't think people have a legitimate right to say -- this is damaging to us as a country, to our society, to our ability to have honest discourse and I think that's what's going on. I think that's why you see today in the Congress, you have Republicans like Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader saying that kind of thinking is cancerous and dangerous to not only to the Republican Party but to us as an American people and that's what's going on here. I don't care who paid for the study, I just think that we need to come together and say, you know, this kind of internet sensation is distorting our public discourse is damaging.",

That's how rigged this is. I can't name one liberal who has been flagged or censored on social media. I mean, Juan named Bongino and Shapiro, they have been flagged and censored. I mean, you're telling me the party of the left doesn't lie or push fake news? The Covingtons, the collusions, the Smolletts, the fine people hoaxes, the mailbox hoaxes, the people -- the hands up don't shooters, the people who said the Arctic ice caps were going to melt 20 years ago.  These people? You're going to give one political party a monopoly on the truth? Well in that case, 150 years ago, the Democratic Party's truth commission would have said slavery is great, and they would have called the abolitionists people pushing disinformation.  See what I did there? What this is really about is the legacy media losing their share in the marketplace. Everybody knows they lie, and people on the right, social media, Fox News and podcasts they're starting to gain traction. So instead of competing with them they are conspiring with the state, the Democratic Party and Silicon Valley to slap a danger label on conservative influencers and propping up czars and commissions to shut them down because they can't compete with them.",

Now, we could all say, sure, we should all -- the terms of service, if you would agree to it you should be responsible for it, but that isn't applied evenly from liberals to conservatives. I'll give you an example. Think of Jimmy Kimmel. Their show put up a fake video of Vice President Pike Pence putting empty boxes of PPE out. Now that's clearly against terms of service, you can't manipulate videos. And it took a massive amount of outrage to get Twitter to flag it, take it down.   Contrast that with, just take your pick. There was one time when Donald Trump Jr. put up a video of Biden that was out of context and made it look like he was stumbling over his words but actually, it wasn't that, it wasn't manipulated, but it didn't have full context. It was immediately flagged. So, if things were applied evenly, I think people would have a little bit more confidence.",

He has to then just detain the child and then catch and release the smuggler? This is a coyote's dream. That's why they bring the kids across the border in the first place, and that's why the previous president cut a deal with Mexico, you remain in Mexico while you apply for asylum. Or how about this idea, you apply for asylum in Central America at an embassy where everybody else in the world applies for asylum at.

You hear about that big study claiming big tech really doesn't favor liberals? It was funded by a big tech liberal. But you won't find out that fact in any of the mainstream reports but the guy behind it is billionaire Craig Newmark. He also donated millions to fight fake news and a ton to Biden's campaign as well. He also founded Craigslist, the online bulletin board where I sell my discarded swimwear.

But the, quote, \"research\" is about as a researchy as turning on the lights to your living room to assess the existence of whales. Yes, no whales there. Really, having a big tech lib fund a study on whether big tech is biased, that's like me finding a study on how great I am, or a study saying Jesse has the best hair in cable news and it's funded by the Jesse Watters institute for follicular studies. Or how Juan including that Jasper is indeed America's dog and that's funded by Dana Perino university of dog selfies. And did you know that Juan Williams is right on everything? That research was funded by Juan Williams. So, before you see a study that says there is no massive crime wave, I would check first to see if it was funded by criminals, or worse, CNN. The fact is the great thing about being a rich lib, you can build a case for anything and the media will back you up 100 percent. It's how they lied to you and keep you in the dark, but of course that's all B.S. according to a new story by the people who lie to you and keep you in the dark.

And they don't have opinions, mind you, they're right, they are correct, they are just, and they are moral. There is only one legitimate point of view and it is theirs, and if you don't fall in line with them, if you don't agree with them, you're wrong and now they are so emboldened and aligned with one another, they will also destroy you. You see that with technology, just with the shutting down of Parler. But we've been here before and ultimately, people turned against the outrage the push back on censorship and cancellation. You saw it with the Red Scare, the House on American activities committee, and McCarthyism. But the scary thing is even if righteousness wins out, there's a lot of carnage before that happens with lives and livelihoods destroyed. Worst-case scenario is that the Dems this kind collective joining in, they went out.

      "utterance": "You know, Juan, studies like this, or when the media covers studies like this, isn't it their responsibility to say who paid for it? When I worked in health journalism there was always a little note at the end of the story, this study on orange juice reducing cholesterol was funded by the orange juice board. It was always kind of, they had to do it. JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS CO-HOST & POLITICAL ANALYST: I don't think it was hidden, Greg. But I must say I'm struck by what you said in the terms that, you know, usually you and I disagree, and I think this may be an occasion where we meet at the mountaintop but just we come up different sides of the mountain. Because from my side of the mountain, I think that big tech, with its ability to tell us how to think, you know, what to buy, how to vote, I think that that is too big and they need to be regulated, in some cases may be even broken up, but they certainly need some kind of interface with the publics so that the public understands what's going on and why they do what they do and when they do it. They are too powerful. But from my side of the mountain, I just wanted to say, I don't -- I don't want conservative thought limited. I don't think it is limited. When I look at these platforms, I see Ben Shapiro, you know, I see Dan Bongino, they've got the leading sites out there, many of them are conservative sites that are the top sites on social media. So, I don't see that there is any bias against the conservatives. But I think that when you start talking about killing politicians, when you start plotting violent, seditious acts against the capitol of the United States, when you embrace conspiracy theories, when that kind of trash is spread on these sites, I don't think people have a legitimate right to say -- this is damaging to us as a country, to our society, to our ability to have honest discourse and I think that's what's going on. I think that's why you see today in the Congress, you have Republicans like Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader saying that kind of thinking is cancerous and dangerous to not only to the Republican Party but to us as an American people and that's what's going on here. I don't care who paid for the study, I just think that we need to come together and say, you know, this kind of internet sensation is distorting our public discourse is damaging."

That's how rigged this is. I can't name one liberal who has been flagged or censored on social media. I mean, Juan named Bongino and Shapiro, they have been flagged and censored. I mean, you're telling me the party of the left doesn't lie or push fake news? The Covingtons, the collusions, the Smolletts, the fine people hoaxes, the mailbox hoaxes, the people -- the hands up don't shooters, the people who said the Arctic ice caps were going to melt 20 years ago. These people? You're going to give one political party a monopoly on the truth? Well in that case, 150 years ago, the Democratic Party's truth commission would have said slavery is great, and they would have called the abolitionists people pushing disinformation. See what I did there? What this is really about is the legacy media losing their share in the marketplace. Everybody knows they lie, and people on the right, social media, Fox News and podcasts they're starting to gain traction. So instead of competing with them they are conspiring with the state, the Democratic Party and Silicon Valley to slap a danger label on conservative influencers and propping up czars and commissions to shut them down because they can't compete with them."

Now, we could all say, sure, we should all -- the terms of service, if you would agree to it you should be responsible for it, but that isn't applied evenly from liberals to conservatives. I'll give you an example. Think of Jimmy Kimmel. Their show put up a fake video of Vice President Pike Pence putting empty boxes of PPE out. Now that's clearly against terms of service, you can't manipulate videos. And it took a massive amount of outrage to get Twitter to flag it, take it down. Contrast that with, just take your pick. There was one time when Donald Trump Jr. put up a video of Biden that was out of context and made it look like he was stumbling over his words but actually, it wasn't that, it wasn't manipulated, but it didn't have full context. It was immediately flagged. So, if things were applied evenly, I think people would have a little bit more confidence."

If Joe continues to operate on this lie and demean Americans trying to do their jobs then he should be justifiably attacked for doing the same thing. These policies were there to protect thousands of children from bad people, so why doesn't Joe just keep these 700 or so migrant children they are expecting, just keep them with the people that they are with, right? If separation is so evil, just let them stay with these people, right? Because what did they do? Well maybe they will just go back and leave them in the mountains like they did before. Right? Leave them in the Rio Grande where they are freezing because apparently, separating them, which is for their own good, is evil and immoral and wrong.

What he's saying hey, this is tough stuff and this is the reason you shouldn't try to cross this border, you're going to be separated from your kid, that's what it was intended to do.

It's exactly what we're talking about and Biden triggered the process because he promised all the illegals free vaccines, health insurance, amnesty and asylum, and COVID relief checks. So, what do you expect to happen? You're going to have an adult male illegal come to the border with a 16-year-old girl, no identification, what's the border patrol agent supposed to do? What is he supposed to do, if he can't separate the family and he can't house them and detain them together, because that's against American law, what is he supposed to do, Juan? He has to then just detain the child and then catch and release the smuggler? This is a coyote's dream. That's why they bring the kids across the border in the first place, and that's why the previous president cut a deal with Mexico, you remain in Mexico while you apply for asylum. Or how about this idea, you apply for asylum in Central America at an embassy where everybody else in the world applies for asylum at. But Joe Biden doesn't want to modernize the immigration system, he wants to overwhelm it so he can flip Texas blue and you will never see another Republican at the White House. And I don't want to ever hear again that the wall doesn't work because that's the only thing that works, along with agents and along with the Mexico deal. I just looked at the release, Department of Homeland security where the wall is, human sector crossings down 87 percent. Rio Grande Valley, crossing is down 79 percent. And El Paso, sector crossings down 81 percent. If walls don't work, Juan, then wheels don't work. We know the truth."

The election of President Biden whose party's aligned with Black Lives Matter, who called Antifa an idea, and who cites systemic racism as the major problem facing Black Americans will make the next four years challenging for proponents of effective policing.\" And if you want a perfect example of how Liberals have destroyed a city, just look at Portland. A new report out of there says it used to be one of the most desirable places for real estate investment, but now it's near the bottom of that list. All right, Juan, I think it's clear. If you just look at Portland, policing is probably the most important thing you have in a major metropolitan area.

One of the things that's happening with carjacking is that it's being done by a lot of youth who would be in school except for the teachers union is blocking the return to classroom, so they're not in school. And now what's going to happen. Those young people that get caught, they will now have police records. They might do some jail time. And we know what happens. It's hard to get out of that downward spiral. The second thing, as I talked to a guy that lives in Portland, not too far from downtown. He's about half a mile from there, a businessman. He said that the violence downtown doesn't really affect his day to day life but what has affected a lot is the regulation that has basically forced businesses to decide to leave Oregon. There's no big research university there. They've allowed the city to be able to be taken over by Antifa.

Brand new, can pick up laundry, which is not what it's really going to do, pull a cinderblock, plant trees with its new extra arm. So, you asked me why I bow to our future robot overlords. Because they are evolving and we are not. It took us billions of years to get to Greg Gutfeld. In 50 years, these are going to rule the world. We are god creating our own destroyers I, for one, am on their side."

Also, Trey Gowdy will interview former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley tonight 7:00 p.m. Eastern on \"FOX NEWS PRIMETIME.\" So, you can check that out too."

They're selling these baseball caps. All the profits go to the Barstool Fund. You guys know what that is. They've already raised over $34 million for small businesses. So, go check out the Normal Brand and grab a hat today."

Yes, February is a picture-perfect rectangle of 28 days. There's lots of fun on calendars. Like, remember Inauguration Day, that was 1-20-21. And there's so many other palindromes, a record number this year."
