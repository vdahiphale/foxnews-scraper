Victor Davis Hanson writes that, now that Robert Mueller's 634-day, $30 million-dollar investigation is over, and has failed to find the original goal of its mandate, and now that thousands of once-sealed government documents will likely be released in unredacted form, those who eagerly assumed that the role of the hunters may become the hunted, due to their own zealous violation of the nation's trust and its laws.

So, if James Comey or Andrew McCabe wrote memoirs, they testified under oath at various committees, or James Clapper and John Brennan, or media analyst, and they testified, that would be irrelevant because Trump was going to be impeached. But what they didn't quite, in ironic fashion, realize, they were having a paper -- there's going to be a paper trail of things they did during the 2016 election that will come out, the released documents and their own testimonies are not going to be reconcilable. What I mean by that, Martha, is that three or four people signed those FISA warrants, and they did not tell a judge that it was -- that their evidence was based on the Steele dossier. I don't think all four of them, Rod Rosenstein, Sally Yates, Andrew McCabe or James Comey are going to have the same story about who was culpable in that. And they're going to be leverage for testimonies that are self-serving, the same way that Mueller did with Michael Flynn or his son, or I really don't think when we talk about collusion that Alexander Downer, who was instrumental in facilitating an FBI plant, maybe with some CIA cooperation from John Brennan, is a U.S. citizen. He's a foreign national, as is Christopher Steele. That is collusion. What I'm getting at is that, we have a sense that there's a united front, we're all going to go after Trump, but now, these people are going to be testifying, Samantha Powers is going to say I didn't -- I didn't request those 260 unmasking's, that wasn't in my name, maybe Susan Rice did it.  No, you did it, I didn't do it, and we're going to have that back and forth with a larger and larger cast of characters, some of whom, like McCabe and James Baker, already under criminal referral, then the Democratic Party was, sort of, in suspended animation. So, this was going on, they didn't feel they had to come up with an agenda, a menu, and all of a sudden, it's gone. And Trump is going to be president until 2020. But in the process, they try to outdo each other in revolutionary fear, so we have 90 percent tax rate, wealth tax, green deal, reparations, and fantasized permissible abortion, abolish ICE, abolish college debt, abolish electoral -- all of these issues were not 51 percent issues.

One is the inspector general, Michael Horowitz, at the Department of Justice, who is looking into this. The other is Lindsey Graham, now the head of the Senate Judiciary Committee, who is also overseeing an investigation into this whole side of the equation. Because if it wasn't collusion, and you look at the dossier, and you look at all of these extensive movement on all the parts of these people, the FISA applications, all of it, you know, the George Papadopoulos issue, which you just brought up, why did all of that happen? What started it, what was the catalyst to start all of that? And those are going to be the subjects of those two investigations.

When she was told there was no such event, she apparently got verbally abusive and was escorted off the property and taken into custody. Now court documents say Zhang was carrying four cell phones, a laptop computer, an external hard drive, and a thumb drive containing computer malware, that short for malicious software, often used to steal, encrypt, or delete sensitive data. There is no evidence she had any nefarious motives, but experts say she did have the tools to target certain electronic devices. We should point out, when Zhang was at Mar-a-Lago, the president was off property playing golf at his nearby country club. Separately, the Miami Herald is reporting the trespasser may have been trying to attend an event that was advertised on Cindy Yang's web site. Yang, you'll recall is the owner of that South Florida massage parlor where New England Patriots owner Bob Kraft who was charged with soliciting prostitution. Cindy Yang's web site also allegedly offered Chinese business leaders' access to Mar-a-Lago where they could with the president.

When they were caught, they were quickly returned to Mexico. And that was that. Now the flow is mostly either family units, people pretending to be families or unaccompanied children.

This week, I'm hearing the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee Jerrold Nadler, demand that Bill Barr, again, violate the law with regard to 6(e) information and other information. It's the theater of the absurd. Bill Bar isn't going to comply with the Democrats deadline because he can't comply with it because he'd have to violate the law, he'd have to commit crimes to do that. What he is complying with is the law as it's written. He is complying with the special counsel regulation.

I didn't -- you know, that was not my take away when I read it. It didn't seem like there was a lot of opinion in there. It seemed as if he was summarizing the principal conclusions. He said it's still a work in progress, they were still going through everything. And he laid out the conclusions as I would imagine as Robert Mueller did in the report. Do you think there's concern -- are you concern that when the rest of this report does come out, which I believe it will, that there's going to be a lot of daylight between these two takes?"

      "speaker": "RATCLIFFE",
      "utterance": "I'm not concerned about that at all, because Bill Barr is not going to bet his 40-year legal career on misinforming the public. Bill Barr followed the regulation to a tee. A regulation for the special counsel that ironically, Jerry Nadler, supported. After the Starr investigation, Jerry Nadler was one of the ones that wanted the Independent Counsel statute to expire and to be replaced with this special counsel regulation, which again, Bill Barr has complied with completely and now intends to do more."

The Department of Justice does not ever provide that information. They want it for political gain. They have been promising information on collusion between Donald Trump and the Russians. Bob Mueller's conclusions, as summarized by Bill Barr, reflected that didn't take place. That should be the end of these investigations. To the extent they want to continue them, they're underscoring, Martha, that they're simply politically motivated. That they are trying to get information that they think will be helpful to prevent Donald Trump from being reelected in 2020. That's what this is about."

Victor Davis Hanson writes that, now that Robert Mueller's 634-day, $30 million-dollar investigation is over, and has failed to find the original goal of its mandate, and now that thousands of once-sealed government documents will likely be released in unredacted form, those who eagerly assumed that the role of the hunters may become the hunted, due to their own zealous violation of the nation's trust and its laws. Here now, Victor Davis Hanson, Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution and Author of the Case for Trump, Victor, good to see you tonight, thank you for coming back in and joining us on THE STORY.

So, if James Comey or Andrew McCabe wrote memoirs, they testified under oath at various committees, or James Clapper and John Brennan, or media analyst, and they testified, that would be irrelevant because Trump was going to be impeached. But what they didn't quite, in ironic fashion, realize, they were having a paper -- there's going to be a paper trail of things they did during the 2016 election that will come out, the released documents and their own testimonies are not going to be reconcilable. What I mean by that, Martha, is that three or four people signed those FISA warrants, and they did not tell a judge that it was -- that their evidence was based on the Steele dossier. I don't think all four of them, Rod Rosenstein, Sally Yates, Andrew McCabe or James Comey are going to have the same story about who was culpable in that. And they're going to be leverage for testimonies that are self-serving, the same way that Mueller did with Michael Flynn or his son, or I really don't think when we talk about collusion that Alexander Downer, who was instrumental in facilitating an FBI plant, maybe with some CIA cooperation from John Brennan, is a U.S. citizen. He's a foreign national, as is Christopher Steele. That is collusion. What I'm getting at is that, we have a sense that there's a united front, we're all going to go after Trump, but now, these people are going to be testifying, Samantha Powers is going to say I didn't -- I didn't request those 260 unmasking's, that wasn't in my name, maybe Susan Rice did it. No, you did it, I didn't do it, and we're going to have that back and forth with a larger and larger cast of characters, some of whom, like McCabe and James Baker, already under criminal referral, then the Democratic Party was, sort of, in suspended animation. So, this was going on, they didn't feel they had to come up with an agenda, a menu, and all of a sudden, it's gone. And Trump is going to be president until 2020. But in the process, they try to outdo each other in revolutionary fear, so we have 90 percent tax rate, wealth tax, green deal, reparations, and fantasized permissible abortion, abolish ICE, abolish college debt, abolish electoral -- all of these issues were not 51 percent issues. And then when you add to that toxic mix, the anti-white male, sort of, narrative that you don't want a white male, and then the polls show that your three leading candidates are --"

You mentioned John Brennan, and the possibility of his involvement in this, and I just want to point out that there are two main venues for the kind of turning of the tables that you talk about it. One is the inspector general, Michael Horowitz, at the Department of Justice, who is looking into this. The other is Lindsey Graham, now the head of the Senate Judiciary Committee, who is also overseeing an investigation into this whole side of the equation. Because if it wasn't collusion, and you look at the dossier, and you look at all of these extensive movement on all the parts of these people, the FISA applications, all of it, you know, the George Papadopoulos issue, which you just brought up, why did all of that happen? What started it, what was the catalyst to start all of that? And those are going to be the subjects of those two investigations. But John Brennan really stuck his neck out on this story, and here's an example of what he said right before the report or the Barr letter came out, and right after. Let's play."

But according to Axios, Biden insiders are hopping mad at the Bernie Sanders' campaign. Sanders' campaign, for their part, says it absolutely did not come from them. Biden and Sanders are locked in a tight race for first place, and those are the others, who come right after them. But it's worth remembering that those leads may be short-lived if history is any guide. Listen to the names that were all abuzz, this same week, back in 2015."

The woman who is 32-year-old Yujing Chang, the criminal complaint says that she showed to Secret Service agent two Chinese passports and said she wanted to go to the pool. A Mar-a-Lago club manager thought she was related to a member and allowed her into the main reception area, but when another Secret Service agent approached her, Zhang apparently changed her story saying she has traveled from Shanghai to attend a United Nations friendship event, and that somebody on Chinese social media told her to attend the event and speak with a member of President Trump's family about Chinese-American economic relations. When she was told there was no such event, she apparently got verbally abusive and was escorted off the property and taken into custody. Now court documents say Zhang was carrying four cell phones, a laptop computer, an external hard drive, and a thumb drive containing computer malware, that short for malicious software, often used to steal, encrypt, or delete sensitive data. There is no evidence she had any nefarious motives, but experts say she did have the tools to target certain electronic devices. We should point out, when Zhang was at Mar-a-Lago, the president was off property playing golf at his nearby country club. Separately, the Miami Herald is reporting the trespasser may have been trying to attend an event that was advertised on Cindy Yang's web site. Yang, you'll recall is the owner of that South Florida massage parlor where New England Patriots owner Bob Kraft who was charged with soliciting prostitution. Cindy Yang's web site also allegedly offered Chinese business leaders' access to Mar-a-Lago where they could with the president.

It's a phony crisis, it's a manufactured crisis. And the reason that the Democrats gave was they say the number of people crossing illegally, people who are caught crossing illegally today is far less than it was in the mid-2000s. Back then, as you mention, there were a million, a million, one million, two people coming being apprehended crossing the border illegally every year. The problem now for the Democratic argument is, given that number you just mentioned in March.

But the big issue here is that the nature of the flow of illegal crossers has changed over the years. Back in those years in the Bush years when a million people were coming across every year, most of them were single adult men. They were trying to sneak across the border and avoid being caught. When they were caught, they were quickly returned to Mexico. And that was that. Now the flow is mostly either family units, people pretending to be families or unaccompanied children. They don't try to avoid detection. They actually cross the border with the purpose of giving themselves to the border patrol because they know they cannot be held for very long. They cannot be separated and they cannot be returned. That's a huge incentive to cross illegally into the United States."

      "utterance": "We will find security not through walls, not through militarization, we will find security by focusing on our ports of entry that connect us to the rest of the world so we have a better idea of who and what is coming in here."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "I mean, you know, your reaction to that? Given the fact that even Jeh Johnson said this is a crisis."

      "speaker": "YORK",
      "utterance": "Well, it's half right. First of all, the ports of entry are the place where most of the drugs that are smuggled into the United States from Mexico, most of them are caught, captured at the ports of entry. So even the president, the president has proposed strengthening our detection and abilities and staffing at the ports of entry."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "All right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "YORK",
      "utterance": "But all of these illegal crossings we're talking about are between the ports of entry. And Beto O'Rourke has even advocated removing some of the barriers in those areas."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "All right. I'm just -- sorry. I was distracted for a second here because we're just getting word that that two more women are coming forward now to accuse Joe Biden of inappropriate touching. And the president just talked about Joe Biden a moment ago. Let's quickly play that and then I'll get your thoughts on this whole thing."

      "speaker": "TRUMP",
      "utterance": "Our former vice-president, he's -- I was going to call him, I don't know him well. I was going to say, welcome to the world, Joe. You having a good time, Joe? Are you having a good time?"

    },

      "speaker": "YORK",
      "utterance": "Well, I think the president is having a good time clearly. But this is turning into kind of a classic Washington controversy with new accusers who seem to indicate a pattern of behavior on the part of the vice- president."
