Now last night, we explained why Obama Intel czar Jim Clapper was so testy, gosh he was angry about Attorney General Bill Barr confirming that the Trump campaign had indeed been spied upon. Now he wasn't the only one. And tonight, is Jim Comey's turn in the barrel. Plus, the Democrats congressional hearings this week or a farce from beginning to end. All the embarrassing moments you know you miss them and the hilarious clap backs. All coming up. And Raymond Arroyo is here. So, what's behind Mayor Pete's religious war against Vice President Pence. Don't get it. And screwing Louis Farrakhan forgot what funeral he was attending. All that more in a special holy edition of Friday Follies.  But first in our “Ingraham Angle,” we can review some stories you may have missed. Now, first we hit immigration. Now the left has a very interesting way of approaching this issue. It's not an emergency, is it? When 100,000 people are pouring across our southern border. But when it's reported that President Trump is considering busing illegal immigrant detainees to sanctuary cities. Well, the Democrats totally freak out. The President up the ante today.",

Jorge Rios had been deported two times from the United States before returning illegally a third time. Now Cano worked as a nanny and friends say, she was an incredible woman of strong faith and a beautiful giving heart. But the left doesn't even acknowledge these American tragedies. They're too busy trying to demonize Trump on this and score political points, which brings us to our next story. This week, Democrats continued flailing in the wake of Bob Mueller's no collusion finding. Now I think they're beyond desperate at this point to regain political footing after two years of leveling defamatory and false accusations against the President. Remember he was basically spooning with Vladimir Putin before the election. But they've quickly found a new target, Attorney General Bill Barr.",

This week, Democrats continued flailing in the wake of Bob Mueller's no collusion finding.

That's what we call here, were the guys determined to get something on President Trump both through surveillance and leaking to the media. But now they're spending their time quibbling with the term spying. Now this concern which is all phony over semantics. Of course, it's reeks of desperation. I think the real fear is that Attorney General Barr is extremely serious. He's very judicious, extremely professional and he's on the case. And they also know that the Inspector General Mike Horowitz will not only clean up this mess but hold those who perpetrated this fraud accountable. Here now, Sara Carter and Former Deputy Independent Counsel Sol Wisenberg, both are Fox News contributors. Sol, why do you think now they're worried about surveillance versus spying. When Bill Barr himself said numerous times, I'm not saying it was necessarily impermissible. I'm just saying that's what I'm saying."

But what happens is if you go too far. If you look like you're trying to score political points if you're trying to get yourself elected off the backs of the pain that the American people feel not only don't, they like that but they end up punishing the party who seems to be doing it. In 2002, the Democrats had a six-point generic ballot lead with eight weeks to go and they lost it. In 2010, they had a seven-point lead with 90 days to go and they lost that one as well.

Democrats are now on a two-week recess, a two-week vacation. They go to a resort area and they talk about all the things that they haven't done.

Remember, the Pope only has one functioning lung. Some have praised the humility of this gesture, it's power. Others have questioned it. They say it's an act of submission to political leaders and it could be interpreted by some, particularly Muslims on the ground in Sudan as an act of submission.

And this is what you get. You get priorities, I would say show me your budget, I'll show you your priorities -- $27 million, as you mentioned, for so the-called Dream Act to provide tuition assistance to illegal aliens, people who are here who have broken our immigration laws. And at the same time, they killed this bill which would have expanded access to the families, to the children of fallen servicemembers. If that isn't an inversion of what is right and good, I don't know what is.

      "utterance": "Attorney General Bill Barr, he started this week with a bang, and I'll bet he does the same thing next week. We expect the redacted Mueller report to be dropped either Monday or Tuesday. You know where to come for the best legal analysis. For every detail that matters, right here on “The Ingraham Angle,” we have the best legal experts, Constitutional lawyers, people who have done this before, written these types of reports, so you want to keep it locked right here. And do not forget, get caught up on all my podcasts, you'll love it. Some people are coming up to me on the street, love the podcasts. Very easy. Go to PodcastOne or iTunes. You're going to have a blast. You'll laugh, learn all at the same time. America now and forever. And up next, Shannon Bream and the \"Fox News @ Night\" team, take it all from here.
