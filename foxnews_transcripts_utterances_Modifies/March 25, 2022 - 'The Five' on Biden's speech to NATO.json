When Joe talks to the world you feel a kind of a mild embarrassment like when you go out to dinner with a relative who is not quite all there and you hope that she doesn't snap at the waitress or conk out at the dessert tray. But what you see is what you get. It's not like, it's like you always heard about Trump being different behind the scenes. He was like a -- he was like a presidential mallet in reserve, party in the front, but serious in the back so he would flatter a leader but then get the brass tacks somewhere else. But now there's a story emerging or maybe it's just a theory I made up because it's Friday. You know Putin took Crimea under Obama and invaded Ukraine under Joe. And why is that? Because the administrations are essentially the same and they have the same predictable nature. So what was -- what was that gap in between? It was Trump. Why did Putin hold off? Because Trump's brand is unpredictability. How can anybody deny this? Putin was like, maybe I better not do it while that guy is around because who knows what he is going to do, he might ball my palace. So right now he --Biden is kind of a hood ornament for the Obama administration and knew that he could pull it off. And then he invades which is a clear violation of international law, it causes a lot of brutality because well, he knew he could.",

You are spending money with Russia, they are going to manipulate you and use it as a weapon. They laughed at him and said he is being too harsh and didn't want the alliance to maintain its credibility. When really, he was saying, your decisions in terms with business and who you allow to control your energy sector are going to hold you hostage once things get hot and now that's exactly where we are. On the communication standpoint, miscommunications lead to miscalculations which cause wars. That's how wars start. And then communication from this administration has been so sloppy when it comes to what they say, what they actually mean. And bringing up President Obama in 2014, you know, in Syria the president there called Obama's bluff when he drew a red line and he didn't follow up with it and Russia also called his bluff and they went into Syria and they've been there ever since helping with the civilian annihilation in that country. And now they are doing it in Ukraine knowing that Joe Biden says a lot of things that maybe he doesn't mean or if he's unclear about it. President Trump he said what he meant and they took them seriously. That's not the case in this situation and people who are in the United States military stationed in NATO countries happening right now are very nervous about a misstatement turning into a miscalculation --",

So, I'm old enough to remember that last summer Jen Psaki stood at the White House podium and laughed and mocked the idea that Americans were having their treadmills delayed too late when there was a supply chain crisis. And I said on the show wait until people can't get food to their homes and you're going to have a way more serious problem. Now, now here we are. And it's proving that Americans and people all over the world in their own countries have to start thinking about producing their own country sustaining products, whether it's fertilizer that we're now saying there is a shortage of so food can't be grown. Food that we import from the rest of the world. Energy, antibiotics, medicine, personal protective gear that we saw China take a monopoly of during the pandemic. So it raises this idea that we can always rely on other countries to make sure that we can sustain ourselves here at home. And President Biden says it's going to be a real thing without offering a solution and saying, but don't worry, I have a plan to combat this coming food shortage. And this is what my administration is going to do. he throws it out there it's like a bomb, like, get ready America.

But that just proves that she's not only unconvincing to the American public, but behind closed doors to a body like the Senate where she worked, she's unable to be convincing to her peers. And that was a big part of what her agenda was supposed to be. She completely failed on that aspect. And people wonder why she's taking on these far-left issues like abolishing the filibuster. Well, let's not forget, she was the most far-left member of the Senate, including beating up Bernie Sanders before she was picked to be the Vice President was supposed to be payback for people like AOC.

Chevy gave the teen a new truck upon hearing the story and also donated $50,000 to the American Red Cross for their relief efforts. He was fine.

That's directionally insane because it's running complete 100 miles away from the truth or at least, or maybe that is the truth and maybe we're being lied to, we don't know. When Joe talks to the world you feel a kind of a mild embarrassment like when you go out to dinner with a relative who is not quite all there and you hope that she doesn't snap at the waitress or conk out at the dessert tray. But what you see is what you get. It's not like, it's like you always heard about Trump being different behind the scenes. He was like a -- he was like a presidential mallet in reserve, party in the front, but serious in the back so he would flatter a leader but then get the brass tacks somewhere else. But now there's a story emerging or maybe it's just a theory I made up because it's Friday. You know Putin took Crimea under Obama and invaded Ukraine under Joe. And why is that? Because the administrations are essentially the same and they have the same predictable nature. So what was -- what was that gap in between? It was Trump. Why did Putin hold off? Because Trump's brand is unpredictability. How can anybody deny this? Putin was like, maybe I better not do it while that guy is around because who knows what he is going to do, he might ball my palace. So right now he --Biden is kind of a hood ornament for the Obama administration and knew that he could pull it off. And then he invades which is a clear violation of international law, it causes a lot of brutality because well, he knew he could."

      "utterance": "He is talking about the ban on imports of Russian gas and oil but the sanctions on that don't go in place until June unless and maybe if they even do that. You all remember that Donald Trump, President Donald Trump in 2019 had a very harsh meeting with the head of NATO talking about this exact same thing. You are spending money with Russia, they are going to manipulate you and use it as a weapon. They laughed at him and said he is being too harsh and didn't want the alliance to maintain its credibility. When really, he was saying, your decisions in terms with business and who you allow to control your energy sector are going to hold you hostage once things get hot and now that's exactly where we are. On the communication standpoint, miscommunications lead to miscalculations which cause wars. That's how wars start. And then communication from this administration has been so sloppy when it comes to what they say, what they actually mean. And bringing up President Obama in 2014, you know, in Syria the president there called Obama's bluff when he drew a red line and he didn't follow up with it and Russia also called his bluff and they went into Syria and they've been there ever since helping with the civilian annihilation in that country. And now they are doing it in Ukraine knowing that Joe Biden says a lot of things that maybe he doesn't mean or if he's unclear about it. President Trump he said what he meant and they took them seriously. That's not the case in this situation and people who are in the United States military stationed in NATO countries happening right now are very nervous about a misstatement turning into a miscalculation --"

We just saw that a Saudi refinery got blown up today and the price of oil spiked right back into $113 a barrel, it was down to $96 just a few days ago. There are obviously global factors that's obviously not related to what's going on in Ukraine/Russia at all and that can happen and that can slash our supply.

I don't think that the 82nd Airborne or anyone is confused about what we're doing about troops because he misspoke. I do think that what he was saying was, by being in this region you are going to see the strength of the Ukrainians. They are streaming into Poland right now. Right? Walking across the borders. We hear about mothers walking with three pets and five children picking up kids by the side of the road. I think that's what he was talking about. And it does seem like everybody is unified here. And I would put it to the table, what would our Republican president or someone besides Biden who you think is more confident be doing any differently at this point? Because to my mind, all I see is that your option is that we're putting troops or putting boots on the ground and then we're possibly heading to a nuclear war or we are continuing on this path."

We hear about there was a brigade where Russian troops killed their own commander because they didn't want to fight this war anymore. And that's all very meaningful.

      "utterance": "I mean, it's him telling the truth should be applauded, but the fact that we are in America in the year 2020 with a food shortage should not be applauded as a result of his policies. So, I'm old enough to remember that last summer Jen Psaki stood at the White House podium and laughed and mocked the idea that Americans were having their treadmills delayed too late when there was a supply chain crisis. And I said on the show wait until people can't get food to their homes and you're going to have a way more serious problem. Now, now here we are. And it's proving that Americans and people all over the world in their own countries have to start thinking about producing their own country sustaining products, whether it's fertilizer that we're now saying there is a shortage of so food can't be grown. Food that we import from the rest of the world. Energy, antibiotics, medicine, personal protective gear that we saw China take a monopoly of during the pandemic. So it raises this idea that we can always rely on other countries to make sure that we can sustain ourselves here at home. And President Biden says it's going to be a real thing without offering a solution and saying, but don't worry, I have a plan to combat this coming food shortage. And this is what my administration is going to do. he throws it out there it's like a bomb, like, get ready America. Without some kind of plan to try and, you know, mitigate the disaster that he says is coming."

So that -- that is the cabal that as stated in Time magazine.

And America is not going to be that bad because we have a lot of wheat producers and we ask -- we export a lot of money a lot of wheat. So we're going to have to bail out the farmers, he predicts, throw a lot of money, cut a check to the farmers. And he says every time wheat prices doubles it adds a quarter to a loaf of bread.

But you would think that, you know, we wouldn't -- that we would try to protect whether it's a wheat deal or fertilizer or whatever needs to be protected, recognizing that that is, that can create world chaos and it can create, as you said, you know, governments being overthrown, leaders being overthrown. I mean, we're in for a bit of a mess because this one guy, Putin, this genocidal maniac decided that he wanted to go into a country and just level it and kill everybody. I mean, to me, it's so obvious. I mean, the Russian people can't be in any way be in favor of him. If the Russian people are now starting to say that they are killing their own generals in Ukraine, then you know, he's got to go. It's the only thing."

And just a little something about Joe Manchin who does irritate me from time to time. We wouldn't have anything that we have right now without Joe Manchin. There is no other Democrat on the planet who was winning in West Virginia. He just announced today that he's voting for Judge Jackson. That is her confirmation unless something happens with Kyrsten Sinema. And Joe Manchin outran Donald Trump in West Virginia. That is a feat beyond belief. So, this idea that you can attack him from the left is a wholly ridiculous. Just let people run their own campaigns. Honestly, every -- on the Republican side, too.

But that just proves that she's not only unconvincing to the American public, but behind closed doors to a body like the Senate where she worked, she's unable to be convincing to her peers. And that was a big part of what her agenda was supposed to be. She completely failed on that aspect. And people wonder why she's taking on these far-left issues like abolishing the filibuster. Well, let's not forget, she was the most far-left member of the Senate, including beating up Bernie Sanders before she was picked to be the Vice President was supposed to be payback for people like AOC.

You know, we can laugh, but it's got -- it's probably worse than working under Kilmeade or you know, working with the judge. But she's -- because you know, she's the worst at work because she comes off as somebody who thinks that actual work is beneath her. And then what happens is she ends up having to do more work on the -- on the other side of the incompetence, when in fact, if you just did the actual job, like if you read the -- what do you call it -- the briefing books.

All right, so earlier this week, you probably saw the horrible video of that truck flipping over in the Texas tornado. We now know who was driving that vehicle. It was 16-year-old Riley Leon who's driving home from a job interview when his Chevy Silverado obviously became a play toy for that tornado. It blew that near a three-ton vehicle on its side, spun it around before he flipped back over and calmly drove off He just got his driver's license. It's a pretty good test for him. Chevy gave the teen a new truck upon hearing the story and also donated $50,000 to the American Red Cross for their relief efforts. He was fine. He had a little bit of a cut on his elbow but walked away with a brand new truck and lots of driving experience in that tornado So, congratulations, lion -- Riley Leon for surviving and driving away."
