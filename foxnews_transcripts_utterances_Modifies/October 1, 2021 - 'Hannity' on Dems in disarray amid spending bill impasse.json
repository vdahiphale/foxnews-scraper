      "sentences": "Day 48, the single most preventable event foreign policy disaster in the history of this country. That's Joe Biden abandoning hundreds of Americans, thousands of our allies their families, green card holders, thousands of them, their families. Everybody abandoned by Joe left to wither on the vine in a country ruled by terrorists and Joe Biden's abandonment is nothing but a repulsive disgrace, one of, if not the biggest foreign policy debacle in the history of this great country, this republic. Joe Biden doesn't care, doesn't care if they live or die, doesn't care if they suffer. He hasn't uttered a single word about the people he's abandoned in over a month, 32 days to be exact. Joe Biden is much more worried about his sinking poll numbers. As \"The New York Post\" editorial board put it, it's time to now shoot straight with you the American people. It's not just one debacle, eight months in, Joe Biden's presidency is collapsing and it's collapsing on every front this has gone so bad so fast, I can't believe it. Now, I did predict in my book last year the first book I had written in years because I thought the moment needed it. \"Live Free or Die: America and the World on the Brink\", this is the on the brink part that I was warning about. Border crisis, it's a disaster. Jobs crisis, that's a disaster. Inflation crisis, the highest in 30 years, yep, a disaster. The abandonment of Americans in Afghanistan, that withdrawal, an utter unmitigated failure. Crisis in the Washington swamp, as his fellow socialist Democrats are in a full-on civil war at this hour. And that's why today, he limped over to the Capitol and beg lawmakers to pass his insane $3.5 trillion Build Back Better socialist spending insanity proposal that will bankrupt your kids, your grandkids, and even your great- grandkids. What could go wrong, pretty much everything Joe Biden touches, turns out, oh, just great. And, of course, this is a piece of legislation that allocates billions of dollars, even for illegal immigrants and billions more for government housing and billions more for government paid family leave and government paid child care and government health care. Boy, Obamacare worked out so well and government jobs for young climate warriors out there. Government, government, government, government -- cradle to grave, womb to the tomb. Joe thinks this big government socialist spending extravaganza bill will be a historic political win for him, he doesn't care that it will cause massive inflation, on top of his historic inflation that we're now experiencing. I explained it to you last night, what is inflation? You pay more for everything, that's called the tax in another way. He doesn't care about your grocery bill. That's going to get more expensive, doesn't care that America's energy bills are rising. A buck 50 more a gallon at the gas pump, you pay more to heat and cool your home. He doesn't care about your quality of life. Joe Biden cares about Joe Biden and Democrats, they want to control the country and they think they can run everything. The same people that did a horrific job, they bankrupted Social Security and Medicare, they can't keep cities safe and secure. They don't believe in law and order. They destroyed our public school system. We spend more per capita than any country in the world with the worst results and the same people that said keep your doctor plan and you'll all save money that none of that came true. So, of course, Mr. Unity, Joe Biden, he doesn't give a flying rip about getting one Republican on board. And with the control of the House, the Senate, and the White House, Democrats are attempting to ram through this in the middle of the night with no Republican support. Why 15 Republicans in the Senate went along with raising the debt ceiling one day is beyond any comprehension I have. That shows Republican weakness. The only problem this bill is so radical they can't even get Democrats on board. Care to explain? Let's go to the White House chief propagandist, circle back Jen Psaki.",

When these policies fail, you will be blamed, rightly so. Do you really think the American people are that stupid, Jen? Do you think the Republican Party is just going to sign off on $3.5 trillion in their so-called human infrastructure, socialist spending bill, the Bernie-Biden manifesto, the new Green Deal socialism of AOC? Maybe you're living in an alternate reality, I'm not. Sadly, the answer is that's what you expect. And according to Psaki, illegal immigrants, they don't need to be tested for COVID because they're not going to be here very long. That would be called a lie. According to Psaki, the border is closed. That too would be a lie. According to Psaki, there is no inflation. That is a huge lie. According to Psaki, Joe's $3.5 trillion Build Back Better plan cost zero dollars, it won't cost us a penny. According to Psaki, that Afghan withdrawal, abandoning Americans that just went fabulously. Jen Psaki might be the single most dishonest indignant press secretary in American history, but she's just following her boss. And to her credit, Joe Biden doesn't quite make it easy, does he? Between his cognitive decline, which is so obvious, I mean -- he's a mess, the many naps he takes the long weekends in Delaware his bad temper I'm sure her job's not easy. Now, make no mistake, Joe Biden is fast becoming the single worst president by far in modern American history, if not the history of this great republic.

Anyway, no matter what happens on Capitol Hill, this will not end well for the country. Radical socialists, they're in charge of the Democratic Party. Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi, they all take orders from them. These radical socialists, they want to destroy what makes this country great. It's called liberty and freedom, our Constitution, and capitalism. They want control of your means of production. They want to take away your property rights. They want to abolish the concept of borders. They want full and complete redistribution as well. They want to literally turn the United States of America into their little communist communal wasteland. Believe it or not, you have the power to stop them. It starts at the ballot box with voter integrity measures, you know, voter ID, simple stuff, nothing really complicated. Signature verification, chain of custody controls, you know, updated voter rolls. Oh, and the laws that allow for partisan observers to watch the vote counts start to finish up close.

Okay, you have the ability to get in the weeds because this is what you do every day. But if we look at a buck more a gallon for gas, everything we buy now costs more, costs more to heat and cool our homes, fill our tanks and everything we buy. Okay, inflation that adds to the cost of everything as well because that means our paychecks actually buy less, prices increase or pay more on that front. Then they keep telling us that if you make a year or less, you're not going to pay a penny. Well, we know that's a lie because corporations don't pay taxes, do they, Larry Kudlow?

We have plenty right here at home. The trouble is the Green New Deal and a lot of that's in the budget would stop production. So we haven't moved above million barrels a day. We're capable a couple years ago with Trump, we were at 13.5 million barrels. That difference is the rise in price and gasoline because gasoline is driven by the world oil price. Why go to the Saudis? Somebody needs to tell President Biden we have plenty of oil and that's what is right here.",

So if we went back to the Trump energy plan became energy independent, now we're not -- we're now artificially lowering the supply of energy in the world, okay? Supply and demand crisscross dictates the price, lower supply, that means demand remain constant, that means the price goes up. Simple math. So if Joe Biden would go back to the Trump energy plan of independence, if he would secure our border and not offer everything free to illegal immigrants on top of the pandemic issues that are involved in this, that would save the American taxpayers.

It's real simple, don't get in the way. Trouble with the Biden group is, they believe in government, they believe in big government socialism and they do not believe in the private free enterprise capitalist system that Trump touted and lay unleashed. So sure, let's let nature take its course. Look, the only thing you forgot in your opening, I just wanted to raise this, is they've now nominated this woman from the USSR who got her college degree from Moscow State University on a so-called Lenin scholarship -- I thought everything was free -- and she's going to be the controller of the currency and she wants to take over the entire banking system. So look what you got. They want to nationalize energy. They want to nationalize health care and they want to nationalize the banking system. This is crazy stuff, and it is doomed to fail. And, by the way, Sean, I'm glad Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema is fighting back, some blue dog Democrats. I'm glad.

Reince, let's start with you. You know, the Trump policies on energy, that was a huge accomplishment, energy independence. The lowest number of illegal immigration, immigrants coming into the country in 25 years, Mayorkas -- and we'll get to this later -- is predicting as many as 400,000 plus in the month of October alone. We cannot handle. This bill provides almost everything for free to illegal immigrants.

That's because the base of the Democrat Party still isn't convinced that he's nuts enough for them. The independence thinks that what's happening is nuts so they don't like what they're seeing. What's happening here, Sean, is what you kind of hit on big time in your monologue, it's pure evil. For the past 80 years, the Democrats have been purposely enslaving Americans to with the idea of giving away government programs it makes it much easier to target those voters. This is elective politics. When you give away almost a trillion dollars for free pre-K kindergarten, about a half a trillion dollars for free college, obviously you mentioned amnesty for illegal immigrants -- all of that, number one, is never going to go away, and all of those people are going to be targeted. They're all going to be targeted by the Democrats. They're targeting all of these people on the free -- on free government programs, it's the government welfare state. They're playing with our country, our future, our Constitution. And you're right. When you pour all of this extra money back into the economy, the best way I can describe inflation is, you pour in a lot more money, chasing the same amount of product. And when a lot more money chases the same amount of product, the prices go up, gas goes up, groceries go up, your restaurant bill goes up, and they're going to pay the price.

Failed DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas is now asking whether the department is prepared for the worst case scenario. He is now saying a whopping 400,000 plus illegal immigrants could cross that border illegally in the month of October alone. That would shatter the record that he already sent this summer. And remember, the Biden administration is making it clear many of these illegal immigrants will be released into the interior of the country with no certainty that they will ever show up for their court proceedings. They're not even requiring people to show up they only request would you mind if you have time pretty, pretty pleased with sugar on top will you show up. Where's their vaccine passport? Where's their proof of a negative COVID test? The biggest surge on our border in decades in the middle of a pandemic and now they're predicting it's going to get worse, and they're not sending anybody home. They just process and then they disperse into the rest of the country -- all caused because of Joe Biden's policies and his border neglect, high rate of COVID positivity of illegal immigrants. It's impossible to calculate how many Americans will get COVID as a result of Joe's super spreader of all super spreaders events. Now, remember, it was Mayorkas that said well it might be as high as one in five illegal immigrants that have COVID positivity. But we don't test them. There's no vaccine mandate for them. They get preferential treatment over American citizens. Well, how many Americans might catch COVID from these illegal immigrants they're dispersing without a test or a vaccine all over the country. How many might die. You know, while some Americans are losing their jobs for not getting the mandated vaccine, illegal immigrants stroll right into the country, no vaccine mandate for them, no proof of a negative test, they get preferential treatment. As we told you last night, border patrol agents are now being told get the vaccine by November first or you'll be fired, but they don't test the people that they're dealing with every day. That makes a lot of sense. Preferential treatment to illegal immigrants, it is chaos it's insanity and it's all caused by Joe Biden. Here with the latest on the ground, at the border in South Texas, FOX News investigative reporter Sara Carter, I just can't believe that this is their ultimatum and I can't believe Mayorkas is now -- by the way, he doesn't -- he doesn't admit this publicly.

      "utterance": "Day 48, the single most preventable event foreign policy disaster in the history of this country. That's Joe Biden abandoning hundreds of Americans, thousands of our allies their families, green card holders, thousands of them, their families. Everybody abandoned by Joe left to wither on the vine in a country ruled by terrorists and Joe Biden's abandonment is nothing but a repulsive disgrace, one of, if not the biggest foreign policy debacle in the history of this great country, this republic. Joe Biden doesn't care, doesn't care if they live or die, doesn't care if they suffer. He hasn't uttered a single word about the people he's abandoned in over a month, 32 days to be exact. Joe Biden is much more worried about his sinking poll numbers. As \"The New York Post\" editorial board put it, it's time to now shoot straight with you the American people. It's not just one debacle, eight months in, Joe Biden's presidency is collapsing and it's collapsing on every front this has gone so bad so fast, I can't believe it. Now, I did predict in my book last year the first book I had written in years because I thought the moment needed it. \"Live Free or Die: America and the World on the Brink\", this is the on the brink part that I was warning about. Border crisis, it's a disaster. Jobs crisis, that's a disaster. Inflation crisis, the highest in 30 years, yep, a disaster. The abandonment of Americans in Afghanistan, that withdrawal, an utter unmitigated failure. Crisis in the Washington swamp, as his fellow socialist Democrats are in a full-on civil war at this hour. And that's why today, he limped over to the Capitol and beg lawmakers to pass his insane $3.5 trillion Build Back Better socialist spending insanity proposal that will bankrupt your kids, your grandkids, and even your great- grandkids. What could go wrong, pretty much everything Joe Biden touches, turns out, oh, just great. And, of course, this is a piece of legislation that allocates billions of dollars, even for illegal immigrants and billions more for government housing and billions more for government paid family leave and government paid child care and government health care. Boy, Obamacare worked out so well and government jobs for young climate warriors out there. Government, government, government, government -- cradle to grave, womb to the tomb. Joe thinks this big government socialist spending extravaganza bill will be a historic political win for him, he doesn't care that it will cause massive inflation, on top of his historic inflation that we're now experiencing. I explained it to you last night, what is inflation? You pay more for everything, that's called the tax in another way. He doesn't care about your grocery bill. That's going to get more expensive, doesn't care that America's energy bills are rising. A buck 50 more a gallon at the gas pump, you pay more to heat and cool your home. He doesn't care about your quality of life. Joe Biden cares about Joe Biden and Democrats, they want to control the country and they think they can run everything. The same people that did a horrific job, they bankrupted Social Security and Medicare, they can't keep cities safe and secure. They don't believe in law and order. They destroyed our public school system. We spend more per capita than any country in the world with the worst results and the same people that said keep your doctor plan and you'll all save money that none of that came true. So, of course, Mr. Unity, Joe Biden, he doesn't give a flying rip about getting one Republican on board. And with the control of the House, the Senate, and the White House, Democrats are attempting to ram through this in the middle of the night with no Republican support. Why 15 Republicans in the Senate went along with raising the debt ceiling one day is beyond any comprehension I have. That shows Republican weakness. The only problem this bill is so radical they can't even get Democrats on board. Care to explain? Let's go to the White House chief propagandist, circle back Jen Psaki."

You know, he is making clear that if they partner together, if we work together, we can get this done for the American people and going to their caucus meeting -- something by the way he did in the Senate. It's not -- it's not unheard of. It's something presidents have done in the past is a way for him to go and make the case for his agenda."

You control the House, the Senate, and the White House, that's up to you. That's on you. The debt you want to put on our children and grandchildren, that is on you. When these policies fail, you will be blamed, rightly so. Do you really think the American people are that stupid, Jen? Do you think the Republican Party is just going to sign off on $3.5 trillion in their so-called human infrastructure, socialist spending bill, the Bernie-Biden manifesto, the new Green Deal socialism of AOC? Maybe you're living in an alternate reality, I'm not. Sadly, the answer is that's what you expect. And according to Psaki, illegal immigrants, they don't need to be tested for COVID because they're not going to be here very long. That would be called a lie. According to Psaki, the border is closed. That too would be a lie. According to Psaki, there is no inflation. That is a huge lie. According to Psaki, Joe's $3.5 trillion Build Back Better plan cost zero dollars, it won't cost us a penny. According to Psaki, that Afghan withdrawal, abandoning Americans that just went fabulously. Jen Psaki might be the single most dishonest indignant press secretary in American history, but she's just following her boss. And to her credit, Joe Biden doesn't quite make it easy, does he? Between his cognitive decline, which is so obvious, I mean -- he's a mess, the many naps he takes the long weekends in Delaware his bad temper I'm sure her job's not easy. Now, make no mistake, Joe Biden is fast becoming the single worst president by far in modern American history, if not the history of this great republic. But today on the Hill, Joe Biden is all smiles. I wonder if he knew it was Friday. Anyway, until he wasn't. Take a look."

Anyway, no matter what happens on Capitol Hill, this will not end well for the country. Radical socialists, they're in charge of the Democratic Party. Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi, they all take orders from them. These radical socialists, they want to destroy what makes this country great. It's called liberty and freedom, our Constitution, and capitalism. They want control of your means of production. They want to take away your property rights. They want to abolish the concept of borders. They want full and complete redistribution as well. They want to literally turn the United States of America into their little communist communal wasteland. Believe it or not, you have the power to stop them. It starts at the ballot box with voter integrity measures, you know, voter ID, simple stuff, nothing really complicated. Signature verification, chain of custody controls, you know, updated voter rolls. Oh, and the laws that allow for partisan observers to watch the vote counts start to finish up close.

Okay, you have the ability to get in the weeds because this is what you do every day. But if we look at a buck more a gallon for gas, everything we buy now costs more, costs more to heat and cool our homes, fill our tanks and everything we buy. Okay, inflation that adds to the cost of everything as well because that means our paychecks actually buy less, prices increase or pay more on that front. Then they keep telling us that if you make a year or less, you're not going to pay a penny. Well, we know that's a lie because corporations don't pay taxes, do they, Larry Kudlow?

And by the way, don't take my word for it, the government scorekeepers are saying this. Congressional Budget Office joint tax committee. I mean, look, the inflation thing -- look, part of this is pandemic shortages, OK? I get that. But I think, Sean, a growing part, and this is where the inflation may be picking up steam, not calming down. There's too much government spending, and the Federal Reserve is buying all these government bonds to fund these spending. The Fed is buying like 60 percent of all the bonds. So, they are creating massive amounts of new money."

That actually means the money you make, the amount of money you're taking home, if it stays where it is, you're taking home less. Your dollars are worth less than they were, correct? And prices will go up."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KUDLOW",
      "utterance": "Yeah. The money in your wallets and pocketbooks, it gets smaller. That's when inflation does because the prices go up. Now, the Fed should stop printing new money. The government should stop printing new spending. And somebody should tell President Biden that the United States has oil and natural gas. We don't have to go begging to Saudi Arabia and Russia. We have plenty right here at home. The trouble is the Green New Deal and a lot of that's in the budget would stop production. So we haven't moved above million barrels a day. We're capable a couple years ago with Trump, we were at 13.5 million barrels. That difference is the rise in price and gasoline because gasoline is driven by the world oil price. Why go to the Saudis? Somebody needs to tell President Biden we have plenty of oil and that's what is right here."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Well, Larry, okay, Donald Trump handed him energy independence. We were -- we did -- we did not import a single barrel of oil in the final months of the Trump presidency. He achieved energy independence for the first time in 75 years. So if we went back to the Trump energy plan became energy independent, now we're not -- we're now artificially lowering the supply of energy in the world, okay? Supply and demand crisscross dictates the price, lower supply, that means demand remain constant, that means the price goes up. Simple math. So if Joe Biden would go back to the Trump energy plan of independence, if he would secure our border and not offer everything free to illegal immigrants on top of the pandemic issues that are involved in this, that would save the American taxpayers. And if he just kept taxes at the level they're at, what would that do for the economy those three things?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KUDLOW",
      "utterance": "Actually, the economy would boom. Actually, you should have made the Trump tax cuts permanent. That would have been the single best policy this Congress could do for economic growth, and you should encourage all forms of energy production so we can supply as much fuel to power the economy as businesses and consumers want. It's real simple, don't get in the way. Trouble with the Biden group is, they believe in government, they believe in big government socialism and they do not believe in the private free enterprise capitalist system that Trump touted and lay unleashed. So sure, let's let nature take its course. Look, the only thing you forgot in your opening, I just wanted to raise this, is they've now nominated this woman from the USSR who got her college degree from Moscow State University on a so-called Lenin scholarship -- I thought everything was free -- and she's going to be the controller of the currency and she wants to take over the entire banking system. So look what you got. They want to nationalize energy. They want to nationalize health care and they want to nationalize the banking system. This is crazy stuff, and it is doomed to fail. And, by the way, Sean, I'm glad Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema is fighting back, some blue dog Democrats. I'm glad. They're not perfect, they're not like us, they're not supply-siders, but at least somebody's stepping in front of this train."

Reince, let's start with you. You know, the Trump policies on energy, that was a huge accomplishment, energy independence. The lowest number of illegal immigration, immigrants coming into the country in 25 years, Mayorkas -- and we'll get to this later -- is predicting as many as 400,000 plus in the month of October alone. We cannot handle. This bill provides almost everything for free to illegal immigrants. Now, so we had the border secure, we had energy independence, we had COVID under control, and everything is now a disaster and then you see the Democratic infighting. How does it end?"

That's because the base of the Democrat Party still isn't convinced that he's nuts enough for them. The independence thinks that what's happening is nuts so they don't like what they're seeing. What's happening here, Sean, is what you kind of hit on big time in your monologue, it's pure evil. For the past 80 years, the Democrats have been purposely enslaving Americans to with the idea of giving away government programs it makes it much easier to target those voters. This is elective politics. When you give away almost a trillion dollars for free pre-K kindergarten, about a half a trillion dollars for free college, obviously you mentioned amnesty for illegal immigrants -- all of that, number one, is never going to go away, and all of those people are going to be targeted. They're all going to be targeted by the Democrats. They're targeting all of these people on the free -- on free government programs, it's the government welfare state. They're playing with our country, our future, our Constitution. And you're right. When you pour all of this extra money back into the economy, the best way I can describe inflation is, you pour in a lot more money, chasing the same amount of product. And when a lot more money chases the same amount of product, the prices go up, gas goes up, groceries go up, your restaurant bill goes up, and they're going to pay the price. There will be a price to pay number one hopefully we can survive, but 2022 is coming."

Every state legislature needs to put that in place that's key. But then now we've got to have good candidates. But not only do we have a shot at the House, Jason Chaffetz, you got Florida, you've got Georgia, North and South Carolina. You've got Pennsylvania, you've got New Hampshire, you've got Wisconsin, you've got Ohio, you've got Nevada, you've got Arizona.

The economy will not be going in the direction that it should be going or it could be going. The open borders people understand that law enforcement is going the absolute wrong direction. If Republicans can't put together a winning campaign and a winning message in this atmosphere, you probably won't be able to do it, because the American people I think are fed up with this.

      "utterance": "All right. Now, the Joe Biden open border super spreader event at our southern border is worsening by the hour tonight. Failed DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas is now asking whether the department is prepared for the worst case scenario. He is now saying a whopping 400,000 plus illegal immigrants could cross that border illegally in the month of October alone. That would shatter the record that he already sent this summer. And remember, the Biden administration is making it clear many of these illegal immigrants will be released into the interior of the country with no certainty that they will ever show up for their court proceedings. They're not even requiring people to show up they only request would you mind if you have time pretty, pretty pleased with sugar on top will you show up. Where's their vaccine passport? Where's their proof of a negative COVID test? The biggest surge on our border in decades in the middle of a pandemic and now they're predicting it's going to get worse, and they're not sending anybody home. They just process and then they disperse into the rest of the country -- all caused because of Joe Biden's policies and his border neglect, high rate of COVID positivity of illegal immigrants. It's impossible to calculate how many Americans will get COVID as a result of Joe's super spreader of all super spreaders events. Now, remember, it was Mayorkas that said well it might be as high as one in five illegal immigrants that have COVID positivity. But we don't test them. There's no vaccine mandate for them. They get preferential treatment over American citizens. Well, how many Americans might catch COVID from these illegal immigrants they're dispersing without a test or a vaccine all over the country. How many might die. You know, while some Americans are losing their jobs for not getting the mandated vaccine, illegal immigrants stroll right into the country, no vaccine mandate for them, no proof of a negative test, they get preferential treatment. As we told you last night, border patrol agents are now being told get the vaccine by November first or you'll be fired, but they don't test the people that they're dealing with every day. That makes a lot of sense. Preferential treatment to illegal immigrants, it is chaos it's insanity and it's all caused by Joe Biden. Here with the latest on the ground, at the border in South Texas, FOX News investigative reporter Sara Carter, I just can't believe that this is their ultimatum and I can't believe Mayorkas is now -- by the way, he doesn't -- he doesn't admit this publicly. This was done behind closed doors. We may have as many as 400,000 plus in October alone."

I'm hearing that, I'm here on McAllen, Texas, right behind me is you see is the open border wall. Just before I came on with you, at least 12 people ran through that opening and made their way out in the field. You can see behind me, no border patrol, why? Because the majority of the border patrol agents have been reassigned to Del Rio and other parts to handle the 15,000, remember, that came in of Haitians, that were crossing through the Del Rio sector. We now have about 85,000 Haitians waiting in Panama, in Colombia as well, making their way here towards the United States. And with those 400,000 that are expected to cross this month, the situation is dire.

That's the reason why border patrol agents and officials believe more than 400,000 people could come across the border illegally this October.

I find their concern about the pandemic and mitigating all of this to be complete -- it's a joke. It's absolutely a joke, and the fact that they would say and give an ultimatum to border patrol agents who they couldn't even convince, they can't convince enough people to go out there and patrol this border they treat them horribly, they don't have the backs of our border patrol agents. Our agents are completely overwhelmed because of the lawlessness of the federal government.

We can't have our institutions and have riots and have destruction of property or what happened there. But nor can we have the, what, the over 500-plus riots in the summer of 2020. Where is that committee? Where is Liz Cheney asking for that committee? Where's Nancy Pelosi asking for that committee? You know, investigating Kamala Harris promoting a bail fund for people caught rioting, you know, when they took over city streets, burned police precincts to the ground. You know, the ones that killed dozens of Americans and thousands of police officers pelted with bricks and rocks and bottles and Molotov cocktails that Democrats never talked about and never wanted to identify his riots. By the way, the Wisconsin officer in that video thank God is out of the hospital. Here with reaction, the co-host of \"FOX and Friends Weekend\", Pete Hegseth, and FOX News contributor Leo 2.0 Terrell. You know, Leo, I'm going to start with you. So that all I hear is January 6, January 6, January 6. I've condemned January 6th, so of you, so is Pete. That can't happen in our country. But the 500 and, what, riots where dozens of Americans died, thousands of police officers injured, arson, looting, madness, mayhem, we have no committee to investigate that? Who is going to investigate these shootings? Who knows the names of the 200 cops that have been killed so far this year in the line of duty, Leo?"

But you're not going to get any investigation into those criminals because those criminals represent the Democratic base. I want to be very clear about this. Black Lives Matter, the Biden administration, the Squad, should be in a straightjacket in a room and watch this horrific video. That thug was on a suicide mission to kill. Eighteen times, they told him put his hands up, and you have a police officer begging for his life. This is what -- there is no such thing as a routine traffic stop. This is what the Squad, Black Lives Matter refused to acknowledge. What you saw there are the best and the brightest of law enforcement protecting us 24/7. It's just an outright shame that what happens on the left is to ignore the 98 to 99 percent of police officers who protect us 24/7."

I mean, you see the power and the force. I've been a pistol marksman since I'm 11 years old. This guy got hit. He got hit multiple times and then the guy got out of the car and shot him at point-blank rage. He's lucky he's alive today."

And, Sean, you're right, I've never been a police officer, but I did hold a riot shield for a few nights in Washington, D.C. during those riots, getting a tiny, tiny bit of a glimpse of what police officers not just experienced last summer to which no one was held for account, but what they what they face every single day because you see in that clip, emboldened criminals. You see criminals who believe they will not be held to account, who believe Democrat politicians ultimately will bail them out or not hold them for account or will be on their side, even if they had every opportunity to put their hands in the air and surrender peacefully. When you tolerate a culture of criminality, you get more criminality. And just seeing that one glimpse of what it means to stand on that thin line with other with other men and women of all races and all backgrounds with a shield, you realize how precarious and dangerous that role is. They do it every night and we should do nothing but thank them, pin awards on their chest and honor them for the service they give. Instead, we put them in more vulnerable situations because of the messages our politicians send criminals in this country."

You're looking at Democratic cities with diversity in police department black, white, brown and yellow, and they still -- the Democratic Party still attack the police department claiming lying that it's systemically racism.

It's not about systemic racism, it's about tearing down our country lock stock and barrel out by the roots. It has nothing to do with systemic racism. This is Antifa, Black Lives Matter, Marxist organizations who hate our country."

Remember, he's the guy at the baseball game without a mask last year. Now, ask yourself has Fauci actually ever admitted how many things he's gotten wrong? Has he ever or anybody at the NIH or CDC, have they ever admitted to the mixed messaging, the flipping, flopping, flailing? Now, Fauci was asked about all of this by a friend of this show radio host Hugh Hewitt. And here's what he said. Take a look."

And Fauci said that COVID was going to feast on college football fans because of no masks, because the full stadium, he's 100 percent wrong, Sean. Cases plummeted all over the South and down percent in Florida. Nobody's talking about it. Fauci was wrong again. I've got to tell you, people are living their best lives.

The other thing is, Joe Biden never mentioned monoclonal antibodies until two weeks ago. Now, he wants to ration it, but we don't have a shortage of it. And that means governors like DeSantis have to buy their own. So, now, we are playing politics with one therapeutic that doctors are saying and ask your own doctor is most effective?"

All the NBA players are coming out and realizing they've got a libertarian tendency and they do not think anybody should have the COVID vaccine mandate. We have California mandating it going forward for kids. And all of this is madness and its anti-science and Fauci continues to be wrong. And you know what should happen, Sean, he should resign because we need a new person to be the czar of COVID in the White House with Biden and it shouldn't be Fauci. He's a disaster and he knows it. I'm glad he's getting called on it. And I encourage everybody out there in the NFL stadiums, college stadiums, pack them, burn the masks, let's have a fun time, baby, and get back to normalcy in this country.
