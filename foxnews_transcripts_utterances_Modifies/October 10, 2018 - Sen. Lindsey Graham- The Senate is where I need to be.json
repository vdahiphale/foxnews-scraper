A monster 155 mile an hour Category 4 when it hit directly into Florida's Panhandle just a few hours ago.  So, right now it is a category three as it moves across. Now officially the most powerful hurricane that has hit the continental U.S. in nearly 50 years. So, in the path right now, Alabama and Georgia.  You've got more than 192,000 customers so far without power in Florida.  They're going to be out for some time. That like -- that number is likely to go way up as we move into the next hours. Officials say that about 300,000 people in the zone stayed in their homes. How'd they made out? We just don't know yet, but we're finding out over the course of the next few hours.

The historic and hellacious hurricane day for the Florida Panhandle, and the Big Bend finally has passed as the storm system has moved north into the states you just mentioned, Alabama and Georgia and soon the North Carolina's.  Water street appropriately named below me was under about six feet of water, at least, much of the day. The water is draining, it is subsiding.  The rains have stopped as you can see and the winds are far, far, far from the hurricane strength winds that were battering us all morning and afternoon.   What has yet to happen though is the big reveal. Search and rescue teams with the County Sheriff's Department across the North Florida area are now -- they started to deploy a couple of hours ago. But now, as you can see sunsets fast approaching it's simply too dangerous to be out there. All residents who did not evacuate and stay at home, they still are under order to not even leave their house, stay off the streets. No one knows how much debris is down there, how many live wires are down there. All of this area has no power or electricity. In fact, the latest numbers we got on the Floridians without power at their homes is 385,000. So, nearly 400,000 all across the Panhandle, the Big Bend.   The -- what no one knows really yet until all of these Sheriff's Department and emergency response teams get out of there high-profile vehicles and the low draft boats to make it their way through all these flooded areas, is to see exactly how much destruction there is. How much was destroyed and how much loss of life there undoubtedly will end up being. It's just that monster-sized of the storm, that vicious. The damage has yet to be revealed, but the next day or two are expected to produce some real devastating pictures, and facts, and realities. Martha?",

This set of utility poles here to topple down on Route 98 headed towards the Gulf Coast Beach, as you can see this. Particular pole right here snapped at the base and then busted in half.  And several other poles are leaning down into the street. We've watched traffic here going by. Creeping slowly across those power lines that are down across this major route here.  And beyond that, Martha, you might be able to see one of the many trees that have been knocked down here in this part of Panama City Beach. There are a lot of trees down, and a lot of roof damage, a lot of signed damage. Not as bad perhaps, as some had initially feared but we're hearing that there are other damages in other parts including Panama City itself, that suffered far more extensive damages. Including the main hospital there which suffered extensive damages with windows blown in and that sort of thing.  And we also heard about a rescue here in Bay County that was underway and the possibility of fatalities here in Bay County. We have not yet been able to confirm that, we hope it's not true. But they are just now trying to assess the damages here as the storm has moved through for the most part.  We do know that at least half the people that they tried to evacuate from this particular County, Martha, did not leave. So, the chances that some people may have gotten hurt is pretty strong.",

He's got all -- we've got 3,500 National Guard, ready to be deployed. They're out there they're helping people.

      "sentences": "It's so interesting how every storm has its own kind of characteristic. Florence was flooding from that stalling out of the storm. This one incredibly strengthened so fast and came on shore much faster than we ever predicted.  And I will tell you, we're getting really good at predicting the direction that Florence was three miles away in landfall from where it had been predicted five days before. This one is well, incredibly good at where it's going, not that good still yet on how strong a storm is going to get. And to one of the problems that's why when we say, \"Hey, a Category 2, Category 3, in many ways we're very unsure so yet.   I will tell you, it comes on shore is almost a Cat 5, two more miles an hour would have been a Cat 5, Martha. And it -- if it comes on that strong, it takes a long time for that energy to go down. So what we still have it now, it's a Cat 2 that is up across parts of Georgia.  Came on shore 1:30. Here we are almost six hours later and we still have a Cat 2 hurricane. All the way inland across parts of Georgia. And if you look at the statistics by wind, this is the fourth strongest we've ever seen make landfall in the U.S. By pressure, by the pressure at the very center point of it, the third strongest it's ever had. And it moved over water that's two to five degrees above its average temperature right now. So, the fuel is totally there for this to happen. When most of the wind observations of places that we see those readings all got blown out, so it's hard to get that verification of it. But we had winds at one spot that did record in 30, but planes that were going in it and dropping those pressure things we saw that there was winds at 155 miles an hour.   I will tell you, as this moves over, it's going to go over the Carolinas where that water is just receded from Florence. And so, think about all that ground that's really muddy now, and the wind -- there's so many trees here, and we're going to be seeing winds probably gusting around 60 miles an hour overnight tonight into tomorrow across the Carolinas. And then, it is going to knock over a lot of those trees. They are predicting up to a half a million people without power in the Carolinas from this storm. So, it's going to be a far fetching -- a far- fetched storm. When I tell you one of the thing, it's been so hot across the eastern seaboard, has not felt like fall at all. The same front that is going to pull this storm off towards the north is going to move through. And you take a look at this temps by the time we get towards Friday into the 50s. It's going to feel like its fall but look at those temperatures down across Florida into the 50s and 60s across parts of the Panhandle.  That means if you're at there without power, and everything is wet and you're trying to clean things up, 50 to 60 degrees, is going to feel really chilly there if you don't have any power.",

And I believe in redemption, Martha. And I think Anthony Weiner should run for office again. I think a Weiner-Trump matchup in 2020 is just what this country needs.

A monster 155 mile an hour Category 4 when it hit directly into Florida's Panhandle just a few hours ago. So, right now it is a category three as it moves across. Now officially the most powerful hurricane that has hit the continental U.S. in nearly 50 years. So, in the path right now, Alabama and Georgia. You've got more than 192,000 customers so far without power in Florida.  They're going to be out for some time. That like -- that number is likely to go way up as we move into the next hours. Officials say that about 300,000 people in the zone stayed in their homes. How'd they made out? We just don't know yet, but we're finding out over the course of the next few hours. Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi joins me live in just a moment. Plus, live team coverage. We begin with Phil Keating who has been watching this thing hammer Apalachicola throughout the entire day today, and he joins us tonight. Hi, Phil."

The historic and hellacious hurricane day for the Florida Panhandle, and the Big Bend finally has passed as the storm system has moved north into the states you just mentioned, Alabama and Georgia and soon the North Carolina's. Water street appropriately named below me was under about six feet of water, at least, much of the day. The water is draining, it is subsiding.  The rains have stopped as you can see and the winds are far, far, far from the hurricane strength winds that were battering us all morning and afternoon. What has yet to happen though is the big reveal. Search and rescue teams with the County Sheriff's Department across the North Florida area are now -- they started to deploy a couple of hours ago. But now, as you can see sunsets fast approaching it's simply too dangerous to be out there. All residents who did not evacuate and stay at home, they still are under order to not even leave their house, stay off the streets. No one knows how much debris is down there, how many live wires are down there. All of this area has no power or electricity. In fact, the latest numbers we got on the Floridians without power at their homes is 385,000. So, nearly 400,000 all across the Panhandle, the Big Bend. The -- what no one knows really yet until all of these Sheriff's Department and emergency response teams get out of there high-profile vehicles and the low draft boats to make it their way through all these flooded areas, is to see exactly how much destruction there is. How much was destroyed and how much loss of life there undoubtedly will end up being. It's just that monster-sized of the storm, that vicious. The damage has yet to be revealed, but the next day or two are expected to produce some real devastating pictures, and facts, and realities. Martha?"

Thanks, Phil. So, from Apalachicola to heart -- we head west now to hard-hit Panama City Beach, Florida. Rick Leventhal seeing the system's impact there firsthand.  Good evening, Rick."

      "speaker": "RICK LEVENTHAL, FOX NEWS SENIOR CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Good evening, Martha. 91 percent of the people in this county are without power tonight. We can show you one of the reasons why. This set of utility poles here to topple down on Route 98 headed towards the Gulf Coast Beach, as you can see this. Particular pole right here snapped at the base and then busted in half.  And several other poles are leaning down into the street. We've watched traffic here going by. Creeping slowly across those power lines that are down across this major route here. And beyond that, Martha, you might be able to see one of the many trees that have been knocked down here in this part of Panama City Beach. There are a lot of trees down, and a lot of roof damage, a lot of signed damage. Not as bad perhaps, as some had initially feared but we're hearing that there are other damages in other parts including Panama City itself, that suffered far more extensive damages. Including the main hospital there which suffered extensive damages with windows blown in and that sort of thing. And we also heard about a rescue here in Bay County that was underway and the possibility of fatalities here in Bay County. We have not yet been able to confirm that, we hope it's not true. But they are just now trying to assess the damages here as the storm has moved through for the most part. We do know that at least half the people that they tried to evacuate from this particular County, Martha, did not leave. So, the chances that some people may have gotten hurt is pretty strong."

My next guest is among the many local state and federal officials who are keeping close tabs on the storm. Joining me now is Pam Bondi, Attorney General for the state of Florida. Pam, good to see you this evening.  What's your sense of how bad this was and continues to be tonight?"

Even if you can see from the guys outside there, it looks clear but it's not. There's water everywhere, there are downed power lines. You never know what to expect in standing water. Our bridges aren't yet open, especially in the Panhandle. We have 54 shelters open with people in them. Governor Scott immediately activated 54 shelters with special needs with pats. So, everybody could get there. He did his best to get everybody out of the Panhandle. But, you know, so many didn't heed his warning. So, now the governor were ready to go. He's got all -- we've got 3,500 National Guard, ready to be deployed. They're out there they're helping people. Search and rescue are out there already but as Phil said, it's getting dark and people just have to stay put to stay safe."

So, here now with the Hurricane's projected storm track at this point, Fox News chief meteorologist Rick Reichmuth, who always brings us information that we don't -- we don't get anywhere else. So, when you look at this, what do you see now Rick?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RICK REICHMUTH, FOX NEWS CHIEF METEOROLOGIST",
      "utterance": "It's so interesting how every storm has its own kind of characteristic. Florence was flooding from that stalling out of the storm. This one incredibly strengthened so fast and came on shore much faster than we ever predicted. And I will tell you, we're getting really good at predicting the direction that Florence was three miles away in landfall from where it had been predicted five days before. This one is well, incredibly good at where it's going, not that good still yet on how strong a storm is going to get. And to one of the problems that's why when we say, \"Hey, a Category 2, Category 3, in many ways we're very unsure so yet. I will tell you, it comes on shore is almost a Cat 5, two more miles an hour would have been a Cat 5, Martha. And it -- if it comes on that strong, it takes a long time for that energy to go down. So what we still have it now, it's a Cat 2 that is up across parts of Georgia. Came on shore 1:30. Here we are almost six hours later and we still have a Cat 2 hurricane. All the way inland across parts of Georgia. And if you look at the statistics by wind, this is the fourth strongest we've ever seen make landfall in the U.S. By pressure, by the pressure at the very center point of it, the third strongest it's ever had. And it moved over water that's two to five degrees above its average temperature right now. So, the fuel is totally there for this to happen. When most of the wind observations of places that we see those readings all got blown out, so it's hard to get that verification of it. But we had winds at one spot that did record in 30, but planes that were going in it and dropping those pressure things we saw that there was winds at 155 miles an hour. I will tell you, as this moves over, it's going to go over the Carolinas where that water is just receded from Florence. And so, think about all that ground that's really muddy now, and the wind -- there's so many trees here, and we're going to be seeing winds probably gusting around 60 miles an hour overnight tonight into tomorrow across the Carolinas. And then, it is going to knock over a lot of those trees. They are predicting up to a half a million people without power in the Carolinas from this storm. So, it's going to be a far fetching -- a far- fetched storm. When I tell you one of the thing, it's been so hot across the eastern seaboard, has not felt like fall at all. The same front that is going to pull this storm off towards the north is going to move through. And you take a look at this temps by the time we get towards Friday into the 50s. It's going to feel like its fall but look at those temperatures down across Florida into the 50s and 60s across parts of the Panhandle.  That means if you're at there without power, and everything is wet and you're trying to clean things up, 50 to 60 degrees, is going to feel really chilly there if you don't have any power."

And I think that you know, they've typically done a great job and I know they're all hands are on deck right now. You know. Martha, this was not a storm a week ago people were really paying attention to. Even three or four days ago, we knew that something was happening but the fact that it matured so quickly into a Category Four I think obviously there was a lot of damage that's been done. In terms of the loss of life I think the question is going to be you know how many people didn't heed the calls to evacuate and were they able to hunker down safely or not. And so I know those first responders are going to be on the scene in Panama City Beach and elsewhere trying to save lives."

We converted those into supply drives, so the campaign we rented a U-Haul and we had people come and bring water, non-perishable food, baby supplies, things like that. And so we when loading up the truck, we did one in Tampa, Orlando, Jacksonville. And then what we'll do is once the storm passes people get a sense of what's needed on the ground.

I welcome, Fox News, you and Brett to come down and do one in the general like you did in the primary. I thought that was a very good debate and I would ask Andrew to accept that.

You came out in late September and you said you know, I'm my own man when you were asked about the hurricane response for Puerto Rico. And that was seen as kind of distancing yourself from President Trump. You know, is that the way to go? Do you think that's something that you need to do to win this race?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DESANTIS",

And then if you do anything that's a little bit different, they'll say oh my gosh you're doing that. So I think like the conflict is something that the press tries to do particularly the liberal media. So I wouldn't do that.  I think that as governor, the good thing that I'll be able to deliver for Florida is you know, I have a positive relationship with the president and key people in the administration. Florida has a lot of needs from our military footprint, our transportation, our water resources which been a big problem here, and we need to work constructively with the federal government. Andrew Gilliam is running on impeaching Donald Trump. I don't know what for but I don't think he's going to be able to do anything productively with the federal government and I will be able to do that. And so I think that's a clear distinction in terms of what the voters of Florida would get out of a governor. I'll be able to advance Florida's priorities and I don't think he will."

Let's take a look at the new one from Nevada the only GOP seat that is in a state that is up in a state where Hillary Clinton won, Republican incumbent Dean Heller holds a narrow two-point lead in the newest poll over Democratic challenger Jacky Rosen but still trails in the RealClearPolitics average which you see there.

These two southwestern states that are very different electorally, one is a Trump state, not by a ton but it's a Trump state and the other was a Hillary State, not by a ton but it's a Hillary state. And what's happening now and Kavanaugh was a real intensifier on that but it's that time of year. It's October, voters have tuned in. People are going to their respective corners and the states are acting more like themselves. So that's why in Arizona, Martha McSally has been getting some traction, that Republicans are coming home, the Kavanaugh effect intensifies that but it is -- Arizona is acting like itself. The problem for Dean Heller in Nevada, Nevada is acting like itself too.  And Nevada is a more Democratic state. He's got a tough challenger. In the most recent poll, he was ahead but he is far from 50 which is not where you want to be if you're an incumbent. So he has a tough race on his hand even as just across the border just over there in Arizona you have a Republican who is making ground."

Women do feel like they are being heard in a way they weren't before. That doesn't mean they have to automatically be believed, right? But the statistics show that something like one in four women over their lifetimes will be the victims of sexual assault and for a long time those women didn't feel like they had a voice. And it is very, very difficult, speaking to the evidence question, it is very difficult, these are often he said, she said cases. There's often no evidence. There's often alcohol involved.

So we as a country need to figure out how to talk about these. And I don't want to just say we shouldn't believe women who come out with very compelling stories if there isn't evidence.
