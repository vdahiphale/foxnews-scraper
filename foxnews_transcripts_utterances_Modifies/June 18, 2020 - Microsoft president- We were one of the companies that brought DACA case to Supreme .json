The president is meeting with the governors of Nebraska and Oklahoma and some minority and small business owners just in order to get a sense of where things are going in the great reopening in this economy.  But we are also watching the fallout right now from that John Bolton book that has reverberated throughout the nation's capital and the world.  The administration doing its best to make sure it never sees the light of day, but key allegations in that book have already seen the light of day.  And then, of course, there's that dreamers ruling that goes essentially against the president, and, of course, this book that just rips the president. So much happening at the same time. It's a good thing we have got an hour to dig into it.  Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto, and this is \"Your World.\" John Roberts right now at the White House on how they're taking all of this incoming support and I guess fire as well -- John.",

Here is the issue in the context of the book that is raising some hackles, where the president, supposedly -- again, this is from Bolton -- asked President Xi Jinping of China to help him win the 2020 U.S. election, and in which he told him at a summit dinner last year that increased agricultural purchases by Beijing from American farmers would aid his electoral prospects.   So, in other words, he said that, offered that, didn't think that, didn't imply that.  So what are we to make of that? And, again, almost anyone and everyone around the president right now denying that this was so blunt, even though the goal of more purchases of agricultural goods was the goal all along of everybody at the White House. So are we sorting hairs here?  Andy McCarthy, the former assistant U.S. attorney, FOX News contributor, joining us on the phone. Andy, it's one thing. Sometimes, politicians, in crafting trade deals, they can be helped or hurt politically, but they don't make it that overt. Let's take this to the extreme case here, where the president was overt: This could really help me in these agricultural states, helping the farmers. See if you can make this happen.  How is that different than simply stating what the administration's position was all along, we want you to purchase more farm goods?",

And I try never to get too caught up with whether somebody is being too blunt or not or too -- or not oblique enough. I, frankly, prefer if somebody tells me what they're thinking than tries to play poker face with me. But in terms of like the propriety of it, presidents historically meld their own political interests with the national interests. And whether we think they're prioritizing the wrong one, like, whether we think that, you know, the president thinks first of, here's what's in my electoral interest, and let me make my policy accordingly, or whether they go the other way, and say, what is -- what is the national interest here, and let me line up my political fortunes with that, because what is good for the country should be what's good for me, to me, that's a political determination. It's not a legal one. If Congress thinks that there's a pattern of that, and Bolton seems to suggest this in his book, that there's enough instances where that happened, that, if the House had more broadly charged the president across the board with prioritizing his political interest over the national interest, rather than narrowly targeting Ukraine, they would have had a better case.

But, here, Bolton is arguing it was far more egregious and this is far bigger an issue. On the legal front, is it?

Let's assume, for argument's sake, that the things in his book happened and they're true. I know there's a counterargument.

And I just think that, given the fact that we have this history in our system of presidents kind of conflating their political interests with the national interests, and the fact that we have an election in four months, and people will be able to weigh what they think of the fairly transactional nature of what the president, how he conducts business, it's a political track.

Mr. Bolton claims that Mike Pompeo passed him a note during a summit with President Trump and Kim Jong-un, and that that handwritten note by Secretary Pompeo insulted the president. I find that to be completely implausible, based on my personal relationship and years of history with Mike Pompeo. If it is the case, then Mr. Bolton could presumably produce that note in Mike Pompeo's handwriting, since he is, as everyone knows, a very careful and methodical notetaker and collector of information. And I think that one episode reflects on many of the claims. To cite the one you gave, I'm sure that President Trump repeatedly, in his conversations with Xi Jinping, emphasized that America's farmers have not been getting a fair shake from the Chinese Communist Party for years, and that, in fact, that was one of the main objectives of the president in trying to get better trade terms with China, is to get their markets opened up to our farmers.

If you see a recent poll, 59 percent of Americans say that police departments across this country should be reformed. I'm one of those individuals who says that. In addition, you see people who are really targeting the police. I'm reminded of an incident in a restaurant where somebody put bleach in some drinks that officers were drinking. And it's very, very disappointing, because that's not where we really get true reform. I'm proud to see Senator Tim Scott and what he's doing. I wrote a piece on FOXNews.com that came out today and one the other day where I talked about the Justice Act, and how it is so necessitous to reform the system of police. So, there's some good things in here. We talk about body cameras, funding for body cameras, making lynching a hate crime, training for police. Those are all good things. But there's something that I did point out which I believe should be on the table. And that's the fear of life standard that a lot of officers have invoked in some of these high-profile cases where, objectively, when we look at the video, we can't understand how an officer would fear for his life and use deadly force. People don't understand this, but this came out of the Supreme Court decision Graham v. Connor in 1988, which allowed for officers who believe that it was objectively reasonable to use deadly force to do so, thereby creating an environment where so many officers get off, when they shouldn't get off. Now, when we talk about the Atlanta situation, I think that's a different set of circumstances. It's certainly not George Floyd. I think, with that officer, he was in his rights to use force. I don't think that he handled the situation correctly to begin with. He should have been fired. He should have de-escalated the situation. But there was an individual running away from him who was looking to aim his Taser at him. So I think that's a different set of circumstances. However, in these many other cases, where officers have used this fear of life standard, we have to put that on the table and see what can happen there that we can appropriately use such a standard.",

So I guess it would be a difference to say that and then to take the next leap to say, it would help me out in the next election.

So, in other words, he said that, offered that, didn't think that, didn't imply that. So what are we to make of that? And, again, almost anyone and everyone around the president right now denying that this was so blunt, even though the goal of more purchases of agricultural goods was the goal all along of everybody at the White House. So are we sorting hairs here? Andy McCarthy, the former assistant U.S. attorney, FOX News contributor, joining us on the phone."

And I try never to get too caught up with whether somebody is being too blunt or not or too -- or not oblique enough. I, frankly, prefer if somebody tells me what they're thinking than tries to play poker face with me. But in terms of like the propriety of it, presidents historically meld their own political interests with the national interests. And whether we think they're prioritizing the wrong one, like, whether we think that, you know, the president thinks first of, here's what's in my electoral interest, and let me make my policy accordingly, or whether they go the other way, and say, what is -- what is the national interest here, and let me line up my political fortunes with that, because what is good for the country should be what's good for me, to me, that's a political determination. It's not a legal one. If Congress thinks that there's a pattern of that, and Bolton seems to suggest this in his book, that there's enough instances where that happened, that, if the House had more broadly charged the president across the board with prioritizing his political interest over the national interest, rather than narrowly targeting Ukraine, they would have had a better case. I don't know. But it's a political calculation. It's not really a legal one."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Andy, one of the things that Bolton brings up is this idea that what the president did with Xi Jinping in China is far worse and far more direct and far clearer, black and white, if you will, than whatever was hinted at the Ukraine pressure. The administration denying that aid to that country was held up because of the government's unwillingness to help out with Joe Biden and Hunter Biden and that relationship. I get all that. But, here, Bolton is arguing it was far more egregious and this is far bigger an issue. On the legal front, is it? It just seems like different shades of the same, you can kind of look at it as being maybe not the best thing to do, but strong-arm business tactics, and that's it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCCARTHY",
      "utterance": "Yes. I think, Neil, again, the check on the president is impeachment, right? And, ultimately, impeachment is political, not legal. It's got a legal process to it, but it's still a political calculation, as we saw. And I can understand Bolton's case. Let's assume, for argument's sake, that the things in his book happened and they're true. I know there's a counterargument. But Bolton is saying not only the trade issue, but he says that the president encouraged or endorsed Xi's idea of building what essentially were concentrates camps for the Uyghurs."

      "utterance": "Right."

    {
      "speaker": "MCCARTHY",
      "utterance": "So, he's saying if you look at everything he did in connection with China, this is much worse than Ukraine. Well, maybe it is. You could say Ukraine was bad, and this is awful. And -- but the question is, is it enough, in terms of the ultimate force of it, that you would make a political calculation that the president needs to be removed from office, that it rises to the level of a high crime and misdemeanor, such that two-thirds of the Senate would be moved to remove the president from office? And I just think that, given the fact that we have this history in our system of presidents kind of conflating their political interests with the national interests, and the fact that we have an election in four months, and people will be able to weigh what they think of the fairly transactional nature of what the president, how he conducts business, it's a political track. We will see what happens on Election Day. I don't think it's a legal thing."

So, dreamers in this country are very, very happy. And, by the way, so is the president of Microsoft. He's next. They are, of course, the children of illegals who came here as babies, or not much older, and, through no fault of their own, are kind of in this legal limbo. The Supreme Court effectively said that this is something that's going to have to be sorted out, and it's not necessarily the high court that's going to do that.

But, more than that, it really is based on what you said. These are people who came to this country as kids. They're law-abiding. They came forward and registered with the government. And more than that, they are really talented. They're important to our company. They're important to small and large businesses across the country. They're especially important. Right now, there are 30,000 of them working as nurses, as respiratory therapists. They are treating people across the country if they come down with COVID-19. We need them."

The odd thing about the majority 5-4 ruling out of the Supreme Court was, the judges used the almost identical words to describe his actions to end it. What did you make of that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SMITH",
      "utterance": "Well, I think Chief Justice Roberts, who wrote the opinion for the court today, crafted a narrow and balanced path. They didn't try to issue a sweeping decision that would tie the hands of this administration or another in the future. They did say that this needs to be done carefully and thoughtfully if DACA is going to be changed. I think that's the right thing for us to remember. We need a thoughtful conversation as a country about the right path forward. I think it's even worth remembering that, when President Trump rescinded DACA in the fall of 2017, he did it with a six-month delay because he wanted Congress to act."

Having said that, though, this comes at a time, maybe with the cover of the virus or what have you, that a lot of people say the administration is moving to cut back on those who even want legal entry into the U.S. or back into the U.S., those who have green cards and the like. I know that's a big base of potential workers for you and other technology companies, scores of companies, period. Is that still a worry for you? The administration is arguing, we want to make sure we know exactly who's coming in here and when and what they're up to. But your thoughts?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SMITH",
      "utterance": "Well, I think as a company, we aim to do three things. First of all, most of the people we hire in the United States are, as they should be, American citizens. Second, we're at a particular moment in time when I think we need to invest in more skilling for the American population. We're seeing digital technologies accelerate. As a company, as a country, we need to help people acquire more digital skills. And then there is a role for immigrants who come in lawfully or who have registered properly, say, under DACA. In many cases, they're bringing the skills that the country needs. And we need to put all these three things together, because we need to create a future for people who are born here and, in appropriate cases, for people who come here."

And many have grappled with that and said that they -- this is part of an effort right now to shut down conservative thought, but all of this coming at the same time regulators here and abroad are going after a number of U.S. technology concerns.

And I do think that many of these fires, these hot issues of the day, do affect technology, and they do raise important issues for the tech sector. And you're right to point out, these concerns about technology are not confined to the United States. I do think we're at a moment in time when we in the tech sector need to step up. And, of course, part of the way we need to step up is to ensure that a variety of voices across the political spectrum always have the opportunity to be heard. I think that's really the definition of what we expect in the United States. But, in addition, other countries have been calling on the tech sector to do more to fight terrorism online, to protect children online. So, there are a number of issues that we need to work through. And, in part, that involves the tech sector doing more itself. In part, it requires a new generation of laws. And it's right that the Congress began to focus on these questions."

What they're talking about is the big tech companies that have a big tech bias against conservative thought and Republican thinking in general. They're leading an effort right now to target companies like Google and others who practice political censorship that usually goes after conservative thinking and views, not so much liberal thinking and views.

We got an ultimatum that gave us less than 30 minutes to either censor my own posts or to allow Twitter to permanently lock down my account. They wouldn't put anything in writing. They very carefully avoided putting anything in writing. And when we pointed out some of the policy inconsistencies that they cited to us, then they just came up with new explanations. And, again, if they will do that to a sitting United States senator, what will they do to a regular Web site or to conservative citizens who just want to make their voices heard? That's why, at a minimum, they need to be more transparent and consistent. And if they're not going to offer that kind of transparency and consistency, if they are going to engage in carefully moderating the content they provide, and censoring opinions that they don't like, even when those opinions garner majority support repeatedly at the polls or in surveys, then they ought not to enjoy the extraordinary immunity from liability that the laws have given them."

A lot of liberals have typically gone after these guys who have gotten too big for their britches, so there's an effort to rein them in that way, the same abroad, Senator. But I did want to get your quick thoughts on this Bolton book that is out on the president, more or less saying that he got a little too cozy with China and, through Xi Jinping, was even trying to all but plead that the Chinese buy agricultural goods, that it would help him out in the 2020 election. A, do you believe that? And, B, if he did something like that, Bolton seemed to be intimating that's an impeachable offense. What do you think?"

      "utterance": "Well, so, first, Neil, let me say, I haven't read the book. I have seen some of the media excerpts on it. But, no, I thought many of the claims to be simply implausible. Let's take one about Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Mr. Bolton claims that Mike Pompeo passed him a note during a summit with President Trump and Kim Jong-un, and that that handwritten note by Secretary Pompeo insulted the president. I find that to be completely implausible, based on my personal relationship and years of history with Mike Pompeo. If it is the case, then Mr. Bolton could presumably produce that note in Mike Pompeo's handwriting, since he is, as everyone knows, a very careful and methodical notetaker and collector of information. And I think that one episode reflects on many of the claims. To cite the one you gave, I'm sure that President Trump repeatedly, in his conversations with Xi Jinping, emphasized that America's farmers have not been getting a fair shake from the Chinese Communist Party for years, and that, in fact, that was one of the main objectives of the president in trying to get better trade terms with China, is to get their markets opened up to our farmers. That's a completely appropriate posture for the president to take."

An unspecified number of police did not show up for their shift on Wednesday night. The mayor of Atlanta saying, despite that, the city was still covered.

      "speaker": "CALDWELL",
      "utterance": "You know, I think what we have seen, especially when it comes to the police, we have seen people rightfully call for reform. If you see a recent poll, 59 percent of Americans say that police departments across this country should be reformed. I'm one of those individuals who says that. In addition, you see people who are really targeting the police. I'm reminded of an incident in a restaurant where somebody put bleach in some drinks that officers were drinking. And it's very, very disappointing, because that's not where we really get true reform. I'm proud to see Senator Tim Scott and what he's doing. I wrote a piece on FOXNews.com that came out today and one the other day where I talked about the Justice Act, and how it is so necessitous to reform the system of police. So, there's some good things in here. We talk about body cameras, funding for body cameras, making lynching a hate crime, training for police. Those are all good things. But there's something that I did point out which I believe should be on the table. And that's the fear of life standard that a lot of officers have invoked in some of these high-profile cases where, objectively, when we look at the video, we can't understand how an officer would fear for his life and use deadly force. People don't understand this, but this came out of the Supreme Court decision Graham v. Connor in 1988, which allowed for officers who believe that it was objectively reasonable to use deadly force to do so, thereby creating an environment where so many officers get off, when they shouldn't get off. Now, when we talk about the Atlanta situation, I think that's a different set of circumstances. It's certainly not George Floyd. I think, with that officer, he was in his rights to use force. I don't think that he handled the situation correctly to begin with. He should have been fired. He should have de-escalated the situation. But there was an individual running away from him who was looking to aim his Taser at him. So I think that's a different set of circumstances. However, in these many other cases, where officers have used this fear of life standard, we have to put that on the table and see what can happen there that we can appropriately use such a standard."

And Roy Blunt, the chair of the Senate Rules Committee, when he was asked by Cory Booker today, he noted -- he said, maybe this should have been looked at some time ago. There was no outrage from Democrats before. But this is going to be an issue that's going to continue. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi can't just pull out these statues on her own. That's something that they have to have an agreement with the Senate. And what Congress can do, it's up to the states to send these statues. They decide who the statues are.

And it's a good time to talk about this, Neil, because we -- I would submit -- and I made this point in my article on FOX News -- that, without the brilliance of our high-technology industries, we would not have been able to get through this pandemic. We would have seen millions of potential deaths. People would have -- we wouldn't have been able to have the millions of people working at home. You wouldn't have had -- hospitals wouldn't have been able to function, probably Zoom and all these kinds of technologies that are so new. So, my point is like, it's not broke.
