My instincts told me that the one-on-one setting, the pretense that this was our first discussion about my position meant the dinner was at least in part an effort to have me ask for my job and create some sort of patronage relationship. That concerned me greatly given the FBI's traditionally independent status in the executive branch. A few moments later the presidents aid \"I need loyalty. I expect loyalty.\" Near the end of our dinner the president returned to the subject of my job. He then said \"I need loyalty.\" I replied \"You will always get honesty from me.\" He paused and then said \"That's what I want, honest loyalty.\" I paused, and then said \"You will get that from me.\" Some of the prepared testimony from Jim Comey at tomorrow's Senate hearing. Let's bring our panel: Byron York, chief political correspondent of Washington Examiner; Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at The Federalist; Charles Lane, opinion writer for The Washington Post, and syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer.

This was after Flynn was fired. He confirmed what you were just reading, the loyalty request, although it is something we hear the president has asked almost everybody he's hired.   On the other hand, he did confirm what the president said, which was that Comey told the president on not one, not two, but three occasion that he, Donald Trump, was not under investigation in that. And we've seen a very brief statement from the president's lawyer saying that he now feels completely and totally vindicated by this. My guess is tomorrow what you're going to see is Democrats saying that Comey has just given them dead solid evidence of obstruction, and Republicans saying this makes us feel a lot better.

And just even the details of these meetings paints a picture of Trump going out of his way to talk to Comey, try and work with him. He is told repeatedly that he's not under investigation. He's dealing with an FBI director who for some reason is going on the Hill and making it seem like he is under investigation.

We also concluded that given that it was a one-on-one conversation, there was nothing available to corroborate my account. We concluded it made little sense to report it to Attorney General Sessions who we expected would likely recuse himself from involvement in Russia related investigations. He did so two weeks later.\" This is what he writes at the time, the reason he didn't put it up the chain, Chuck. But I just played that May 3rd sound bite where he suggests at least that he hasn't seen any pressure. And it would be wrong if there was pressure to drop an investigation.",

And what I interpret that statement that you just read to mean is an extremely complicated explanation as to why it would've been more trouble than it was worth to take this up the chain given that it would have been a he-said, he-said situation.  Look, the Comey statement that came out today does not resolve this matter. As Byron said, it's going to be viewed through a partisan lens up on the Hill. I think it is marginally helpful to the president in the sense that it does -- there is no endorsement of an obstruction of justice charge in here anywhere. That's the most helpful part for the president. The part that damages the president is that Comey clearly portrays himself as someone Trump was trying to manipulate and steer into making sort of compromising statements like yes, sir, I will be loyal to you, sir. And of course we have to all view this in the context of what happened later, namely Comey was fired, and he was fired in a situation where the administration offered inconsistent or differing accounts of the rationale for his firing.  So I think if I were on the committee, what I would be asking or trying to get out of these hearings would be, gee, Mr. Comey, in light of everything you say in this, why was it, in your view, that you were fired? Because there is the appearance at least that because Trump didn't get this guaranty of loyalty he felt he had to let him go.",

Trying to get them to relieve the pressure on Mike Flynn over his Russia ties, Flynn's own Russia ties or whatever it was, that was an inappropriate conversation. I'm not willing to say yet that it rises to level of obstruction of justice. But to put that together when then later on firing him, it's just, it's bad conduct.

My instincts told me that the one-on-one setting, the pretense that this was our first discussion about my position meant the dinner was at least in part an effort to have me ask for my job and create some sort of patronage relationship. That concerned me greatly given the FBI's traditionally independent status in the executive branch. A few moments later the presidents aid \"I need loyalty. I expect loyalty.\" Near the end of our dinner the president returned to the subject of my job. He then said \"I need loyalty.\" I replied \"You will always get honesty from me.\" He paused and then said \"That's what I want, honest loyalty.\" I paused, and then said \"You will get that from me.\""

      "utterance": "Well, the first thing he did was he confirmed some of the reports that we've seen that the president asked him if he would consider letting go the Michael Flynn investigation. This was after Flynn was fired. He confirmed what you were just reading, the loyalty request, although it is something we hear the president has asked almost everybody he's hired. On the other hand, he did confirm what the president said, which was that Comey told the president on not one, not two, but three occasion that he, Donald Trump, was not under investigation in that. And we've seen a very brief statement from the president's lawyer saying that he now feels completely and totally vindicated by this. My guess is tomorrow what you're going to see is Democrats saying that Comey has just given them dead solid evidence of obstruction, and Republicans saying this makes us feel a lot better. We think it can all be explained innocently."

      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "On that point, the president obviously talk to Lester Holt with NBC, laid out the different meetings, said that he had been told that he wasn't under investigation. Then we have a series of stories from anonymous sources saying that Comey was not going to say that and it was not true. But Comey does say that in this prepared testimony."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, THE FEDERALIST",
      "utterance": "And a sense, Comey is the most helpful to Trump's case of anyone in the entire scenario. We have had so many anonymously sourced stories claiming that Trump would undermine -- or that Comey would undermine what Trump had said about being told that he wasn't under investigation. And just even the details of these meetings paints a picture of Trump going out of his way to talk to Comey, try and work with him. He is told repeatedly that he's not under investigation. He's dealing with an FBI director who for some reason is going on the Hill and making it seem like he is under investigation. And these stories are actually, I think, pretty favorable to Donald Trump, even if he is very different from a typical politician in this scenario."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Comey says the reason that he didn't express concern that he was very concerned about the Michael Flynn comment was because of the investigation that was ongoing. If you look at testimony one, \"The FBI leadership team agreed with me that it was important not infect the investigative team with the president's request which we did not intend to abide. We also concluded that given that it was a one-on-one conversation, there was nothing available to corroborate my account. We concluded it made little sense to report it to Attorney General Sessions who we expected would likely recuse himself from involvement in Russia related investigations. He did so two weeks later.\" This is what he writes at the time, the reason he didn't put it up the chain, Chuck. But I just played that May 3rd sound bite where he suggests at least that he hasn't seen any pressure. And it would be wrong if there was pressure to drop an investigation."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHARLES LANE, WASHINGTON POST",
      "utterance": "That is probably the hardest question for Comey in this whole business, is, well, wait a minute, if it was so terrible, why didn't you take it up the chain? And what I interpret that statement that you just read to mean is an extremely complicated explanation as to why it would've been more trouble than it was worth to take this up the chain given that it would have been a he-said, he-said situation. Look, the Comey statement that came out today does not resolve this matter. As Byron said, it's going to be viewed through a partisan lens up on the Hill. I think it is marginally helpful to the president in the sense that it does -- there is no endorsement of an obstruction of justice charge in here anywhere. That's the most helpful part for the president. The part that damages the president is that Comey clearly portrays himself as someone Trump was trying to manipulate and steer into making sort of compromising statements like yes, sir, I will be loyal to you, sir. And of course we have to all view this in the context of what happened later, namely Comey was fired, and he was fired in a situation where the administration offered inconsistent or differing accounts of the rationale for his firing. So I think if I were on the committee, what I would be asking or trying to get out of these hearings would be, gee, Mr. Comey, in light of everything you say in this, why was it, in your view, that you were fired? Because there is the appearance at least that because Trump didn't get this guaranty of loyalty he felt he had to let him go."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "But he did get the guarantee of loyalty. In fact there were a lot of words in this statement that Comey put out to actually say -- he gives a lot of set up and he talks about later about he had a different meeting, but in fact he did pledge his loyalty."

Jonathan Turley, who I respect a lot, said he does not see anything that rises to the level obstruction of justice, but, quote, \"The comments are grossly inappropriate.

The president went on to say that if there were some satellite associates of his who did something wrong, it would be good to find that out, but that he hadn't done anything wrong and hoped I would find a way to get it out that we weren't investigating him. Look at it from Trump's point of view. The guy, the head of the FBI has told him three times he's not the subject of an investigation. The press is in a frenzy over what did he do, when did he do it, what did he know. And Comey says we didn't tell the president why we were not going public. It's a plausible reason. He said because if we did, then we would have a duty to undo it to tell the world that he was under investigation if there were a change, the way he did with Hillary."

      "speaker": "BAIER",

    {
      "speaker": "KRAUTHAMMER",
      "utterance": "But from Trump's point of view, I'm the one who is getting pilloried on this. FBI director agrees we me but they won't say it out loud. And I am stuck. And he also says that there are people, satellites, associates, then go get them. This is not obstruction. This is not shutting the investigation down. It could be throwing some of his people under the bus. But it is saying on the big one, was I involved? You're telling me I wasn't. How about letting the world know? That to me is a totally plausible scenario, and it's the one Comey is offering."

At this point the only similarities you have are highly placed intelligence officials leaking to the press. We don't even have anyone who has come forth with a crime yet. And we are still waiting to hear what this crime in which Trump or people might be implicated. And it's far past time for these intelligence officials who have been playing this game and putting out innuendos about Watergate to actually give us some substance on which to hang it. Or they need to just put up or shut up."

And I find it ironic, actually, considering Jim Clapper was in the middle of the last big scandal that was supposed to be worse than Watergate, the thing about the NSA where a lot of people think he wasn't very forthright with Congress. So he's doing some stuff there. But look, what it looks to me like we know so far is the president, in my judgment, had a conversation with Jim Comey he shouldn't have had. Trying to get them to relieve the pressure on Mike Flynn over his Russia ties, Flynn's own Russia ties or whatever it was, that was an inappropriate conversation. I'm not willing to say yet that it rises to level of obstruction of justice. But to put that together when then later on firing him, it's just, it's bad conduct. You can call it whatever you want, but I think that is the stuff of a legitimate congressional investigation. Whether you want to call it Watergate or not is another story."
