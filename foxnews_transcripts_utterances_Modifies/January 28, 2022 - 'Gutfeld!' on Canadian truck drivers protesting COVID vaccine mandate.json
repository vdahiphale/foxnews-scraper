Canadian truckers protested vaccine mandates placed on their industry with a massive convoy that might break the world record set by Democrats vacationing in Florida. Thank you for that laugh. According to organizers, it's 70 kilometers long which is roughly five of Kat's hair extensions tied together. Actually, it's 43.5 miles and that is pretty amazing. It's the best thing that come from Canada since moose. That's where they come from. Canada. Anyway, the freedom convoy as it's called left Sunday from Vancouver for Ottawa places that hockey fans in for me our cities to protest the mandates for cross border truckers took effect on January 15th. It's estimated that roughly 15 percent of truckers in the country are not fully vaccinated, which is about 16,000 truck drivers, or 80 percent of the total Canadian population. True. It's so sparsely populated the social distance requirements is 600 feet. But I enjoy the convoy. Fact is, if you mess with the truckers, you don't get your stuff from my pillows to hockey equipment, beer clothing to 150 illegals from Guatemala. It just takes too long by dog sled. And it's absurd. Mandating vaccines for people who spend more time alone than Kat on prom night. Yes.",

So what are these unacceptable views you jerk? Explain it to us since this fringe helped keep your country going when you couldn't. Seriously just crapped on people who made sure Canadian citizens like him got their toilet paper, their ginger rail, the cheese curds for their butene or whatever they eat in Canada these days during the pandemic. Just like having a dad who was Prime Minister working from home is a privilege. Most don't have. These people work tirelessly, until they were red in the face, as opposed to their P.M. who prefers to only be in blackface. When the only thing black about him is his heart. If he was in Alberta, they'd set -- sell him his oil shale. What an embarrassing virtue signaling imposter. Yes, I wrote this while I was drinking. And those raspberry hard seltzers were delivered by truckers. So God bless him. So hurray to the Canadian truckers, or as Elon Musk said in just three words, Canadian truckers rule. And they do. But you know who else rules? The Danes. You might even say they're great. Nothing dogs. Te people of Denmark or the government of Denmark, they have a government there I hear. Unlike our country today. Anyway, yesterday, Denmark also became heroes by announcing the end of the pandemic. And on what day to day choose you ask? Yes, I answer, February 1st. The date this show pick as the end to the pandemic. Yes. Apparently they watch Gutfeld in between cobbling and smoking mackerel. How amazing is that? According to whatever I read, Denmark is ending all its pandemic measures and virus restrictions on the last day of January. That's Martha McCallum's birthday, by the way. Yes, I know it. I hope she likes the President I got her. Although I forgot to poke holes in the box.",

So this easing of restrictions follows other countries like the .U.K and Ireland as people find out that Omicron is less severe than the sentences handed down for gun crime, where Delta was Charles Manson, Omicron is more like Charles Nelson Reilly. So they realize that no restriction is going to stop the contagious but mild strain. Omicron is like Dana Perino's dog pictures. It's everywhere, but you can handle it. And we don't need the government or Neil Young telling us what to do. Right now Denmark, a nation of six million people has just 44 COVID- 19 patients in ICU. And I'm willing to bet they're older than Stuart Varney and Brit Hume combined. Stop it. So like listening -- so like listening to the couple and then next department having sex. It sounds to me like they know what they're doing. So what about us? What are we doing? February 1st this next week? When are we going to take the lead here and bring this to an end since our leaders won't? Like Hollywood screenwriters, they suck at endings. So let's take inspiration from the Canadian truckers and the Danish cobblers and declare this thing over once and for all.

But just to be sure, Brian, let's assess what happened this week. In just seven days we've had 14 officers shot in the line of duty across the country. And it's not just one state or town, it's everywhere. One was Texas constable Charles Galloway. He was shot and killed during a traffic stop by an illegal alien who had been on the run for 25 years. That's 25 more years than Brian Stelter has ever run. Here in New York, rookie Officer Jason Rivera was murdered while responding to a domestic violence call. The kind of call the left wants to send a social worker to. His partner Wilbert Mora also shot died days later. This is the scene today of the thousands who came out to Rivera's funeral at St. Patrick's Cathedral. And they'll do the same next week for Mora. So I'm wondering, Stelter and the other bald guy, how does this look in your Instagram filter? And it's not just law enforcement who become victims. In San Francisco, there's been an over 500 percent increase in reports of hate crimes against Asian- Americans. And you can't blame Trump because, you know, he's not President. Oh, and remember Cory Bush, the leading to fund the police advocate in Congress who hires her own security? Her car, which he wasn't in at the time, thankfully, was hit by gunfire over the weekend in St. Louis. The media is blaming the shooting. I'm sure on the rise in unoccupied cars.

According to one Ukrainian official, the two presidents disagreed on risk levels surrounding a possible Russian attack. Biden warned that invasion was all but certain and that the U.S. wouldn't offer significantly more military help. So, now, Biden's not the only president (BLEEP) his pants. Zelensky maintain that the situation was dangerous but ambiguous and had urged Joe to calm down the messaging. He also asked for helping renting a u-haul out of Kiev. The White House is pushed back in the description of the phone call saying it was long and serious, but productive, which also describes Joe's last tried a solid bowel movement. They denied that Biden told Zelensky to brace for Russian invasion, adding that he said a Russian invasion was a distinct possibility, not a certainty, and that the United States would respond decisively if Russia invades.

It's the best thing that come from Canada since moose. That's where they come from. Canada. Anyway, the freedom convoy as it's called left Sunday from Vancouver for Ottawa places that hockey fans in for me our cities to protest the mandates for cross border truckers took effect on January 15th. It's estimated that roughly 15 percent of truckers in the country are not fully vaccinated, which is about 16,000 truck drivers, or 80 percent of the total Canadian population. True. It's so sparsely populated the social distance requirements is 600 feet. But I enjoy the convoy. Fact is, if you mess with the truckers, you don't get your stuff from my pillows to hockey equipment, beer clothing to 150 illegals from Guatemala. It just takes too long by dog sled.

Seriously just crapped on people who made sure Canadian citizens like him got their toilet paper, their ginger rail, the cheese curds for their butene or whatever they eat in Canada these days during the pandemic. Just like having a dad who was Prime Minister working from home is a privilege. Most don't have. These people work tirelessly, until they were red in the face, as opposed to their P.M. who prefers to only be in blackface. When the only thing black about him is his heart. If he was in Alberta, they'd set -- sell him his oil shale. What an embarrassing virtue signaling imposter. Yes, I wrote this while I was drinking. And those raspberry hard seltzers were delivered by truckers. So God bless him. So hurray to the Canadian truckers, or as Elon Musk said in just three words, Canadian truckers rule. And they do. But you know who else rules? The Danes. You might even say they're great. Nothing dogs. Te people of Denmark or the government of Denmark, they have a government there I hear. Unlike our country today. Anyway, yesterday, Denmark also became heroes by announcing the end of the pandemic. And on what day to day choose you ask? Yes, I answer, February 1st. The date this show pick as the end to the pandemic. Yes. Apparently they watch Gutfeld in between cobbling and smoking mackerel. How amazing is that? According to whatever I read, Denmark is ending all its pandemic measures and virus restrictions on the last day of January. That's Martha McCallum's birthday, by the way. Yes, I know it. I hope she likes the President I got her. Although I forgot to poke holes in the box."

So this easing of restrictions follows other countries like the .U.K and Ireland as people find out that Omicron is less severe than the sentences handed down for gun crime, where Delta was Charles Manson, Omicron is more like Charles Nelson Reilly. So they realize that no restriction is going to stop the contagious but mild strain. Omicron is like Dana Perino's dog pictures. It's everywhere, but you can handle it. And we don't need the government or Neil Young telling us what to do. Right now Denmark, a nation of six million people has just 44 COVID- 19 patients in ICU. And I'm willing to bet they're older than Stuart Varney and Brit Hume combined. Stop it. So like listening -- so like listening to the couple and then next department having sex. It sounds to me like they know what they're doing. So what about us? What are we doing? February 1st this next week? When are we going to take the lead here and bring this to an end since our leaders won't? Like Hollywood screenwriters, they suck at endings. So let's take inspiration from the Canadian truckers and the Danish cobblers and declare this thing over once and for all.

You have these politicians who are clinging more to the rules of the regulations than ever before.

But just to be sure, Brian, let's assess what happened this week. In just seven days we've had 14 officers shot in the line of duty across the country. And it's not just one state or town, it's everywhere. One was Texas constable Charles Galloway. He was shot and killed during a traffic stop by an illegal alien who had been on the run for 25 years. That's 25 more years than Brian Stelter has ever run. Here in New York, rookie Officer Jason Rivera was murdered while responding to a domestic violence call. The kind of call the left wants to send a social worker to. His partner Wilbert Mora also shot died days later. This is the scene today of the thousands who came out to Rivera's funeral at St. Patrick's Cathedral. And they'll do the same next week for Mora. So I'm wondering, Stelter and the other bald guy, how does this look in your Instagram filter? And it's not just law enforcement who become victims. In San Francisco, there's been an over 500 percent increase in reports of hate crimes against Asian- Americans. And you can't blame Trump because, you know, he's not President. Oh, and remember Cory Bush, the leading to fund the police advocate in Congress who hires her own security? Her car, which he wasn't in at the time, thankfully, was hit by gunfire over the weekend in St. Louis. The media is blaming the shooting. I'm sure on the rise in unoccupied cars. But hey, I guess it's all overblown. But I'd like to thank CNN for sponsoring this segment. This has been."

I cannot believe that just a year and a half ago, people were losing their jobs because they were supporting the police flying a thin blue line flag in their homes because it was considered a hate symbol. We can never get back to that place again. And then one other thing I want to highlight really quickly is that Jason Rivera's funeral, his wife, his widow, she called out the district attorney of Manhattan and said that his policies are awful, they can't happen and he was sitting in the funeral.

As you said, you've been a victim, anyone can be. The woman who was pushed off the subway. She was -- I didn't know her, but she was one of my really good friends, MBA classmate, right? So there's no -- it affects everybody. And there's just this pattern of, listen, there's no supply chain crisis, there's no inflation, and then you go to the grocery store, you can't find half your items. And then it's double the checkout, right? You go fill up gas more expensive. And so there's just this pattern of saying nothing to see here. Whenever the American people can decide for themselves and see something different. You say there's no problem at the border, the American people can turn on the T.V. and see people coming over the border in droves every day. So the American people aren't stupid.

Because when you lose your life or you lose your husband, or you -- or somebody you know, gets pushed in front of a train, it's a really, really important issue. And it's something that affects all of us.

When their crime is committed, there are basically two variables that should matter. The victim and the victimizer. You don't need context. But the moment you get a liberal prosecutor or a progressive media hack involved, what do they do they, they go OK, we have to look at the root causes. That's context. We have to do the current state of society. That's context. Before you know it, the roles are switched. The victimizer is now the victim and the victim is forgotten and that's basically why they can't cover crime because they need -- the context that they offer makes them look absurd.

Biden's phone call yesterday with Ukrainian president Zelensky was a disaster, and not just because Joe had problem working is flip phone. According to one Ukrainian official, the two presidents disagreed on risk levels surrounding a possible Russian attack. Biden warned that invasion was all but certain and that the U.S. wouldn't offer significantly more military help. So, now, Biden's not the only president (BLEEP) his pants. Zelensky maintain that the situation was dangerous but ambiguous and had urged Joe to calm down the messaging. He also asked for helping renting a u-haul out of Kiev. The White House is pushed back in the description of the phone call saying it was long and serious, but productive, which also describes Joe's last tried a solid bowel movement. They denied that Biden told Zelensky to brace for Russian invasion, adding that he said a Russian invasion was a distinct possibility, not a certainty, and that the United States would respond decisively if Russia invades. Meanwhile, Russia continues sending more troops to the Ukrainian border. So, I wonder what Joe has to say now."

Last question to you: where do you see this going? Where do people like you end up? Is there going to be a fissure? Is that the word? I think that sounds medical? Is there going to be a fissure in which, which legacy media pretty much implodes? And then there's it's going to be the Wild West, or is it already happening?"

I'm involved with locals and social media platforms. It's happening now. You're seeing this parallel economy split off. And I say all the time. And I mean it. It's, it's not a good idea. I wish we could have a free market where conservatives and liberals could just buy products and services, right, just because they're valuable? But it's a necessary idea. Because we can't coexist in an ecosystem where liberals think we're bad people with ideas, right? Not people with bad ideas. If they think we're just bad people, why are we going to coexist with them in these spaces? It's just not going to work."
