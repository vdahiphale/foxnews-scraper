We'll play all the low lights of that coming up. And Senator Ted Cruz will join us with a more chilling story about the FBI and January 6. Earlier today, he just brutalized an FBI spokesperson. We'll play you that tape. But first, we begin with Democratic activists Stacey Abrams. As you all know, Stacey Abram still believes that she is the rightful governor of Georgia, that she thinks she won in 2018 after losing a fight by nearly two points in Georgia's gubernatorial race. She never conceded, claiming voter suppression despite new evidence. And now, she's running for what she believes is her reelection. And naturally, the Democrats so-called voting rights legislation is one of her top issues. But today, when Joe Biden and Kamala Harris made a special trip to Stacey Abrams' hometown to tout this new legislation, Stacey Abrams was nowhere to be found. Apparently, it was some kind of scheduling conflict, that's what we'll call it. Take a look.",

Now, is it perhaps that Joe Biden's poll numbers are so bad, Stacey Abrams refused to appear with the president and vice president of the United States or even meet with him behind closed doors and can't even be bothered to come up with a halfway -- well, decent excuse? This is a pretty low point for Joe and Kamala who are officially now toxic even among members in their own party. Make no mistake: Biden's so-called voting rights legislation is also incredibly toxic and unconstitutional. Now, this bill which would federalize elections enables Democrats in Washington to ban voter ID, clear the way for ballot harvesting and for illegal immigrants to participate in elections. You don't believe me, look at New York City. Just this week, they gave the right of illegal immigrants to vote in municipal elections in New York City. Now top Democrats are so passionate about the bill because they believe it is their sure-fire way to stay in power in perpetuity. In other words, just like their court packing idea, just like their ending of the filibuster idea, just like D.C. statehood, Puerto Rico statehood idea. It's all about a power grab and all about rigging the system. It doesn't have anything to do with actual voting rights. And that's why Joe was in Georgia and not Joe's home state of Delaware where voting regulations in his state where he served 575 years are far more restrictive and Georgia's laws are some of the most accessible voting laws in the country. They have 17 days in person early voting. They have drop boxes in every precinct. You don't need an excuse to get an absentee or mail-in ballot. You need a mail-in ballot reason in Delaware. There are no drop boxes. No in-person early voting, and both states require voter ID. So why aren't they going after Delaware? Why did -- why hasn't Joe lifted a finger all these years to make voting more accessible in his home state? Now, today, during his big speech, Joe was very -- well, as usual confused. He referred to Kamala Harris as President Harris. Apparently, Joe believes he was arrested while marching for civil rights in the 1960s. Little fact check, that never happened. Take a look.",

But unfortunately, under Joe Biden, we have seen an incredibly partisan Department of Justice. And both the Department of Justice and the FBI have an arrogance that they are not accountable to anyone, that they can -- they can stonewall. And so, it should be very easy for the FBI to say no, no federal agents participated in violent crimes. No, no federal agents actively incited, encouraged others to commit violent crimes. If they were doing their jobs, those would be very easy questions to answer. They refuse to answer those and there's an element of arrogance. But we got to watch this in light of the last five years where we know that the Department of Justice and the FBI was deeply politicized, that it went after Donald Trump with all of its might, right down to an assistant general counsel at the FBI fabricating a counterfeit document that was submitted to a federal court to try to target and take out President Trump. And given that history of deep, deep politicization that has undermined the integrity of these noble institutions, I think both the FBI and the department of justice have an obligation to be candid and to come clean and in that same hearing, I ask that that FBI official, I asked about one individual in particular, Ray Epps. There have been a lot of videos online of Ray Epps. Ray Epps was there on January 5th, on January 6. There are videos of him urging the crowd saying we should go to the Capitol, but not just go to the Capitol, we must go in the Capitol. In other words urging them to break the law and he keeps saying \"in the Capitol, in the Capitol\", and the entire crowd starts chanting \"Fed, fed, fed, fed\". It's a very puzzling and disturbing video. The next day on January 6, there's video of him talking to one of the people at that rally whispering in his ear. And literally, five seconds later, that person is pushing barricades down. The natural inference being that this individual urged him to break the law. And so, I asked the FBI, is Mr. Epps an agent of the FBI, is an informant of the FBI? And she stonewalled, refused to answer. We know the FBI put him out on the list of people they wanted information about and then magically he disappeared. There needs to be transparency and the Biden administration needs to fess up, is this a politicized law enforcement operation that is targeting the enemies of the president, and did they actively encourage and solicit illegal conduct?",

Then the chain of command goes to Nancy Pelosi and Muriel Bowser. For the troops to be called up, they have to sign off on it. We have a letter showing Muriel Bowser never did. Nancy Pelosi obviously never did. Now, the chairman of the committee says that question is off limits. Pelosi is off limits. And my understanding is neither Pelosi, the sergeant-at- arms, Muriel Bowser, are required to hand over their emails, their texts and their phone conversations for the days leading up that day and the days after. How come -- if we want this not to happen again, don't we need to talk to them?",

The U.S. government shut down the use of arsenic and apples grown by U.S. farmers. That's a good thing because arsenic is toxic. They, of course, did not change what happened in China. Those Chinese farmers kept growing apples with their arsenic. U.S. juice manufacturers imported cheap apples from China. So here's the U.S. government shutting down U.S. apple manufacturers, allowing Chinese farmers to grow their apples, importing that arsenic-laced stuff to this country, giving the apple juice to our kids.

Don't forget that, folks. Back during the campaign when they thought it was politically advantageous for them, they told people, do not trust this vaccine. We don't trust this vaccine. Neither should you.

People do not want the government making a medical decision for them. We would should say, by the way, that the Operation Warp Speed, the vaccination would not be here with Operation Warp Speed, without Donald Trump. It is one of the great achievements of modern history. However, we know that it protects you if you get COVID from getting seriously ill, it doesn't protect you as a CDC director just admitted the other day from actually transmitting COVID, from getting COVID, so why don't we hear more out of this White House about natural immunity? People who like millions of people out there who have copped COVID, recovered from COVID, have immunity, have the antibodies. Therapeutics like you were just talking to Dr. Oz about earlier in their show. If you go into any hospital in America and ask for something like Regeneron, you can't find it anywhere. No one wants to talk about these things. It is just about the unconstitutional vaccine mandate.

We'll play you that tape. But first, we begin with Democratic activists Stacey Abrams. As you all know, Stacey Abram still believes that she is the rightful governor of Georgia, that she thinks she won in 2018 after losing a fight by nearly two points in Georgia's gubernatorial race. She never conceded, claiming voter suppression despite new evidence. And now, she's running for what she believes is her reelection. And naturally, the Democrats so-called voting rights legislation is one of her top issues. But today, when Joe Biden and Kamala Harris made a special trip to Stacey Abrams' hometown to tout this new legislation, Stacey Abrams was nowhere to be found.

Now, this bill which would federalize elections enables Democrats in Washington to ban voter ID, clear the way for ballot harvesting and for illegal immigrants to participate in elections. You don't believe me, look at New York City. Just this week, they gave the right of illegal immigrants to vote in municipal elections in New York City. Now top Democrats are so passionate about the bill because they believe it is their sure-fire way to stay in power in perpetuity. In other words, just like their court packing idea, just like their ending of the filibuster idea, just like D.C. statehood, Puerto Rico statehood idea. It's all about a power grab and all about rigging the system. It doesn't have anything to do with actual voting rights. And that's why Joe was in Georgia and not Joe's home state of Delaware where voting regulations in his state where he served 575 years are far more restrictive and Georgia's laws are some of the most accessible voting laws in the country. They have 17 days in person early voting. They have drop boxes in every precinct. You don't need an excuse to get an absentee or mail-in ballot. You need a mail-in ballot reason in Delaware. There are no drop boxes. No in-person early voting, and both states require voter ID. So why aren't they going after Delaware? Why did -- why hasn't Joe lifted a finger all these years to make voting more accessible in his home state? Now, today, during his big speech, Joe was very -- well, as usual confused. He referred to Kamala Harris as President Harris. Apparently, Joe believes he was arrested while marching for civil rights in the 1960s. Little fact check, that never happened. Take a look."

And as Joe put it he was worried that public schools that his children would grow up in schools that were racial jungles. Joe said that. Now, according to Joe, if you don't support his federal election takeover, you are a domestic enemy of the United States who sides with Jefferson Davis and the Ku Klux Klan.

And breaking tonight, Biden's education secretary is now facing calls to resign after reports that he requested an official letter from the National School Board Association comparing those parents that care about their kids that go to school board meetings which have to be boring as hell to terrorists. Or will the domestic terror unit be squarely focused on those that participated in the January 6 riot? Now, by the way, there were riots in the summer of 2020.

That doesn't prohibit, though, the FBI, Senator, in my mind that they could have said the FBI did nothing illegal, the FBI did nothing unethical, the FBI would never encourage any type of violence or participate and such. That would be a broad sweeping generalization without giving out any sources, any methods or any evidence whatsoever. Why couldn't there be a blanket denial that that's not who we are, that's not the way we act?"

      "utterance": "Well, there should have been and if they were doing their jobs, that was what they would have said. But unfortunately, under Joe Biden, we have seen an incredibly partisan Department of Justice. And both the Department of Justice and the FBI have an arrogance that they are not accountable to anyone, that they can -- they can stonewall. And so, it should be very easy for the FBI to say no, no federal agents participated in violent crimes. No, no federal agents actively incited, encouraged others to commit violent crimes. If they were doing their jobs, those would be very easy questions to answer. They refuse to answer those and there's an element of arrogance. But we got to watch this in light of the last five years where we know that the Department of Justice and the FBI was deeply politicized, that it went after Donald Trump with all of its might, right down to an assistant general counsel at the FBI fabricating a counterfeit document that was submitted to a federal court to try to target and take out President Trump. And given that history of deep, deep politicization that has undermined the integrity of these noble institutions, I think both the FBI and the department of justice have an obligation to be candid and to come clean and in that same hearing, I ask that that FBI official, I asked about one individual in particular, Ray Epps. There have been a lot of videos online of Ray Epps. Ray Epps was there on January 5th, on January 6. There are videos of him urging the crowd saying we should go to the Capitol, but not just go to the Capitol, we must go in the Capitol. In other words urging them to break the law and he keeps saying \"in the Capitol, in the Capitol\", and the entire crowd starts chanting \"Fed, fed, fed, fed\". It's a very puzzling and disturbing video. The next day on January 6, there's video of him talking to one of the people at that rally whispering in his ear. And literally, five seconds later, that person is pushing barricades down. The natural inference being that this individual urged him to break the law. And so, I asked the FBI, is Mr. Epps an agent of the FBI, is an informant of the FBI? And she stonewalled, refused to answer. We know the FBI put him out on the list of people they wanted information about and then magically he disappeared. There needs to be transparency and the Biden administration needs to fess up, is this a politicized law enforcement operation that is targeting the enemies of the president, and did they actively encourage and solicit illegal conduct?"

So I want to know why the attorney general of the United States is looking at Texas's voting law, which is far more accessible, as is Georgia's law, far more accessible, than the very restrictive laws in the state of Delaware where Joe has served I believe now a whopping 577,000 years and he never lifted a finger to change the voting laws.

And in less than a year, he has lit that reputation on fire because what's happened is Merrick Garland has just given in to the political partisans. H hasn't had the strength of courage to tell his own party, no. And you know, you reported on a story that FOX broke earlier today that is a great example of that, which is the shameful instance where the attorney general directed the FBI to target and to prosecute parents -- to prosecute moms and dads as terrorists for going to school boards and expressing their displeasure at critical race theory, at --"

Jim Jordan, I start with you now. If the goal and it would be my goal -- I personally would build a fence that would protect the Capitol, our institutions, every elected official I don't care what your politics are. That is a must in this country. Just like we should protect every city from what the rioting that took place in 2020. My question is this, Donald Trump, if you look at the words of Mark Meadows, the secretary of defense was in the room, the chairman of the joint chiefs was in the room, the defense chief of staff, Kash Patel, was in the room, and he authorized -- as a law requires -- 20,000 National Guardsmen to be called up two days before January 6. Then the chain of command goes to Nancy Pelosi and Muriel Bowser. For the troops to be called up, they have to sign off on it. We have a letter showing Muriel Bowser never did. Nancy Pelosi obviously never did. Now, the chairman of the committee says that question is off limits. Pelosi is off limits. And my understanding is neither Pelosi, the sergeant-at- arms, Muriel Bowser, are required to hand over their emails, their texts and their phone conversations for the days leading up that day and the days after. How come -- if we want this not to happen again, don't we need to talk to them?"

When you spend an entire summer doing that, it's kind of hard then to say, oh, we accept what the president offered and we're going to have the National Guard here on January 6 when we had all these people coming to town. So, that's the concern, when you spend the entire summer doing that. Republicans have been consistent. We condemn the violence that took place on January 6.

The only the teachers unions disagree with that at this point. The mask you brought up the benefits are suspect. So the question then is why, Sean, why is this happening? And I think Fauci is the J. Edgar Hoover of public health. He is a petty tyrant that has organized efforts with media to remove all dissent. And I can tell you, as a physician, there's a lot of doctors who don't like what's going on now, and I've tasted this personally. And I fought back against the U.S. government because there was arsenic in our apple juice. Let me explain for a second. The U.S. government shut down the use of arsenic and apples grown by U.S. farmers. That's a good thing because arsenic is toxic. They, of course, did not change what happened in China. Those Chinese farmers kept growing apples with their arsenic. U.S. juice manufacturers imported cheap apples from China. So here's the U.S. government shutting down U.S. apple manufacturers, allowing Chinese farmers to grow their apples, importing that arsenic-laced stuff to this country, giving the apple juice to our kids. No one's checking. The government came after me the same way Fauci goes after scientists now. They work with media. They actually do conspire and their false narrative around me being a charlatan or snake oil salesman began to prosper. I got a full apology from everybody, but you have to fight, Sean.

If they can silence scientists like me and the other wonderful scientists have raised their heads and said that we're doing the wrong thing with COVID, they can silence any voice.

Why did the chair of this committee say the speaker is off limits? Why did the speaker not allow the information from the sergeant of arms that communication with the speaker?

Don't forget that, folks. Back during the campaign when they thought it was politically advantageous for them, they told people, do not trust this vaccine. We don't trust this vaccine.

People do not want the government making a medical decision for them. We would should say, by the way, that the Operation Warp Speed, the vaccination would not be here with Operation Warp Speed, without Donald Trump. It is one of the great achievements of modern history. However, we know that it protects you if you get COVID from getting seriously ill, it doesn't protect you as a CDC director just admitted the other day from actually transmitting COVID, from getting COVID, so why don't we hear more out of this White House about natural immunity? People who like millions of people out there who have copped COVID, recovered from COVID, have immunity, have the antibodies. Therapeutics like you were just talking to Dr. Oz about earlier in their show. If you go into any hospital in America and ask for something like Regeneron, you can't find it anywhere.
