How do we make sure that we don't take a system that is well-intentioned that becomes badly abused?

If I want to buy my own health insurance, as I should, and I want to pay for it, as I can, then I should be able to do it. I think this was all a scheme going all the way back to, how do we put a system in place that will collapse of its own weight? And that's what we have done."

When I hear cuts and I hear people, liberals espousing this view that we're cutting to smithereens the social safety net, I'm thinking, well, they're wiping it out, when, in fact, I discover with Medicaid and some of these other programs, we're slowing the rate of growth. But that's entered the vernacular, just like the argument that if you're anti-illegal immigration, it morphed into you're anti-immigrant. Ken Langone, what is a cut to you?"

We're going to leave people destitute. We're going to leave them starving. They're going to do this. My point with let's say the food stamp, the SNAP program, if 44 million are getting something off of this program, whether it's for food or not, we have bigger problems than just a budget issue."

      "speaker": "LANGONE",

You let that gap get wide enough, as it did in Cuba, as it did in Argentina, as it did in Venezuela, and people will go for the most likely root to give them what they want. OK? We can't afford -- now, the gap is as much an effect as it is a cause of problems. The effect of it is, it is an effect a bad education in America, public education in America. We're depriving these kids of the chance to compete. I had dinner last night with Dave Cote, the retired chairman of Honeywell."

      "speaker": "LANGONE",
      "utterance": "Yes. You can't do it. It won't work. Look, any time you engage in something that is fundamentally unnatural, expect unnatural results, OK? A good for instance, frankly, is celibacy in the Catholic Church. We're going to have to come to grips, as Catholics, with the notion that we are going to have to think about letting priests get married. By the way, 1,000 years ago, we had a pope that had a family."
