I'm sitting here trying to warm this seat and I'm not going to -- and be able to have a go at it.

Criminal justice experts telling Fox News that support for the Black Lives Matter Movement and related calls to cut funding to the cops has had several unintended consequences all bad. For one thing, the toxic environment has caused thousands of cops to disengage or leave law enforcement altogether. More importantly, there has been an epidemic of urban violence that is unprecedented for recent years. According to statistics from the FBI, since George Floyd, there's been a 32 percent increase in the murders of black Americans mostly by other black Americans. Example, in 2019, nearly 7,500 were killed. A year later by 2020, the number had grown to more than 9,900. According to DOJ statistics, homicide is now the leading cause of death of young black men, and yet, Dana, not a peep from any major civil rights figure or organization.",

Legitimately, when they did research Democrats actually believed that thousands of unarmed Black men were killed by the police. And it was because, very simple, information coming into your head, the videos over and over again. So, then you jump to now, we have this research, it's 32 to 40 some odd percent of increase in murdered Blacks. So, now you do have the thousands. You do have the thousands of dead Black men, not just a few on a video. That's kind of an -- it's a horrible irony that that's almost created that in a way because we drove the rage and the division and everything with those videos to a point where now you have it. It's a very -- and there's another final deeply racist point behind this. The left believes that the rules of law and order that apply to everybody do not apply to Blacks because they're oppressed.

Also, I think practically either he or his people know that if he were to say he's not running at this point that means they'll absolutely get nothing done. I think that when they lose in the midterms that there will be a real reckoning and that you might all of a sudden see a decision about 2024 then. I do wish I had been a fly on the wall when Kamala Harris heard this news because I think she's been sitting there thinking are you kidding me. I'm sitting here trying to warm this seat and I'm not going to -- and be able to have a go at it. But also, let me tell you the -- some of these senators who are up for re-election in 2024, the Democrats who would be on the ballot with Biden. That would be John Tester of Montana, Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, Jackie Rosen in Nevada, Debbie Stabenow in Michigan. And they would probably lose all of those seats. So there's a practicality that's happening there.

She went to Hollywood because she needed to be around people that just are -- just worse than she is and then she kind of looks, okay. Joe told Obama he was running in 2024.

For one thing, the toxic environment has caused thousands of cops to disengage or leave law enforcement altogether. More importantly, there has been an epidemic of urban violence that is unprecedented for recent years. According to statistics from the FBI, since George Floyd, there's been a 32 percent increase in the murders of black Americans mostly by other black Americans. Example, in 2019, nearly 7,500 were killed. A year later by 2020, the number had grown to more than 9,900.

And that starts with the prosecutors as well. I'm sure we'll talk about that. I think that this is showing that just this continued massive expanse between what Democrats in Washington that are really driven by radicals think and what Americans are thinking. Because if you look at any of the polls, always it says that they don't believe that the president understands what they're going through or cares about the things that they care about.

And when we start listening to people like AOC and Cori Bush, these are not experts in law enforcement. They don't know anything about law enforcement.

Let's talk to the people who've been in law enforcement, when crimes have been knocked down, when we took it from the 90's all the way down to making New York City the safest big city in the United States. These people are nothing more than ideologues who are looking to tear down the system at the collateral price to them of killing innocent citizens. And I'm tired of it. I'm tired of them telling us what needs to be done. I don't need to hear from Ilhan Omar on how we should defund police. Every penny taken from the police should be put right back in that budget. Those people were standing in Albany like Andrea Stewart-Cousins, and the other one. He sees preventing a change in the bail law. Their pictures should be all over. People should be marching and protesting them because it is literally the people who have no voice are the ones who are suffering.

So, there's one thing that the police can't deal with, and that's the coverage of these issues. So, when you talk about cops involved in unarmed Black interactions that result in death, it's actually like one dozen to two dozen, then you drill down, and each one is individually different. And so -- and you find out bigger stories, some of them are definitely horrible. Black on Black crime, death is in the thousands. So, there -- this is -- these are two separate problems, and one is far bigger. So -- but you end up with this cause and effect by the coverage which made a small group of cases appear large. How many times did the news replay the George Floyd videos? It was -- it was on a loop nonstop. What was the result? Legitimately, when they did research Democrats actually believed that thousands of unarmed Black men were killed by the police. And it was because, very simple, information coming into your head, the videos over and over again. So, then you jump to now, we have this research, it's 32 to 40 some odd percent of increase in murdered Blacks. So, now you do have the thousands. You do have the thousands of dead Black men, not just a few on a video. That's kind of an -- it's a horrible irony that that's almost created that in a way because we drove the rage and the division and everything with those videos to a point where now you have it. It's a very -- and there's another final deeply racist point behind this. The left believes that the rules of law and order that apply to everybody do not apply to Blacks because they're oppressed. And so, who dies? More Blacks. So, good on you BLM and all you leftists who thought you were doing good for the -- for Blacks, because what you did is you took away what they really needed, which is a civil society which we all want, which we all love, law and order. Taking that away helps no one. It's about freedom."

And the hangover is you pay it off later. It's the debt that you're accruing. It would be a shame if we could get people out of -- out of this track and say, look, trade schools, the military, there's ways to gain experience in life, so you don't end up in six, seven figures in debt.

So, I always encourage people, yes, if you think you want to go to college, you absolutely should pursue it. We talked about immigrants early on, especially Hispanics. Of course, they want their children to go to college, because while there's that study that says that you -- some college graduates make less than $30,000 a year, over the course of your lifetime, if you have a college degree, you are likely to have more wealth. That could change, however, tech companies now they're no longer requiring that four-year Bachelor of Arts degree or Bachelor of Science degree. They're starting to figure this out. And there's a lot of ways you can enhance your life and learn about things that you might learn about in college through other means now, including YouTube podcasts, and just working."

They're on this island for two weeks after the vessel that they were on caught fire in the ocean. And so, what they decided to do was send a message in a bottle. And in the bottle, they said, you know, please let our family know that we're out to sea. We have no food, we have nothing but some rainwater."

Okay, my \"ONE MORE THING.\" This is body cam footage from the Indianapolis Police Department. A fire broke out in an apartment complex at 3:30 in the morning. And the mother was forced to throw her two children out of the building to save them. Bodycam footage shows the police officers catching the two kids. After they were out safely, the mom jumped out as well. Just again going to show all the great work that men do to keep our community safe. Another great example right here."
