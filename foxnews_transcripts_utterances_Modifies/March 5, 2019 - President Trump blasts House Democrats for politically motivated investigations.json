      "sentences": "All right. Welcome to “Hannity.” A lot of breaking news tonight. The 2020 presidential election is officially gearing up and the Democratic Party, they are imploding. Radical extreme far left socialists have now taken over any and any Democratic who doesn't fall in line and support this radical extreme left agenda.  This left-wing vision, if you will, you get thrown down the curb by Ocasio- Cortez. You have a group now, and all of America needs to see this, hyper- partisan freshmen lawmakers. They are now leading the way. They set the agenda. Nancy Pelosi is afraid of all of those freshmen.  Now, the list is led by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Now, according to a report from \"The Washington Post,\" she warned her fellow Democratic lawmakers not to vote with Republicans or she's going to put them on a list to be primaried in the next election. Welcome to Congress.  Now, no surprise there, political intimidation is always a key component of socialism. Now, after all, she needs as much support as she can get for this insane Green New Deal which vows to totally reshape America by putting an end to all fossil fuels, combustion engines, nuclear energy, airplanes, and yes, cows because of flatulence and CO2 gases. It also promises to provide everything is free. You don't have to worry another day in your life. Free government healthy food, free day care for your kids, free housing, free college education. Forget about K-through- 12, free universal health care, free, free. But pro-choice Democrats, they are going to allow -- not allow you to have your private plane anymore. Forget choice.  You get guarantee vacations. You get universal guaranteed income, a guaranteed retirement, even people unwilling to work. But like any other socialist, Ocasio-Cortez, she's really just interested in improving her own quality of life and redistributing the wealth among those in her own inner circle. Look at this, according to a brand-new bombshell FEC complaint, Ocasio- Cortez's chief of staff is now accused of illegally moving nearly a million dollars in campaign contributions to his own private companies, and in doing so, that money could be shielded from all election related reporting. In other words, Ocasio-Cortez under fire tonight, her chief of staff could have used those donations for anything without reporting it, including maybe big payments to themselves, their family, their friends.  Now, we already know based on a separate FEC complaint that Ocasio-Cortez's boyfriend, well, he was funneled thousands of dollars from a political action committee set up by this very same chief of staff. But really, who can blame him for taking the money? After all, it's incredibly expensive to keep up with the jet-setting lifestyle of the freshman socialist congresswoman.   Last night, we first showed you how Ocasio-Cortez, who wants to ban all air travel, but she herself loves flying on airplanes between New York and D.C. Now, there's something called Amtrak. It goes pretty much every hour on the hour between D.C. and New York. And she chooses not to do that. In fact, she chooses to take a plane three times more -- three times more travelers themselves choose Amtrak between the two cities. Not Ocasio-Cortez, she prefers the convenience of flying, especially since you, we, the American people are picking up the bill. It costs more to fly. Now, Fox News producer caught up with Ocasio-Cortez that she was getting off a flight in D.C. today. We asked her about her travel preferences, recent FEC complaints and much more. Take a look.",

That's why she has no problem taking planes over trains, why she prefers that caravan, the gas guzzler, and that service over public transportation.  It's why Ocasio-Cortez probably doesn't want you to know that her very own mother left the great state of New York because of its incredibly high taxes. It's why Bernie and Hillary and Joe Biden and Al Gore, they all take private jets and we catch them all the time.   And get this, even though a climate change apocalypse is on the horizon, recycling -- well, that's just way too much work than Ocasio-Cortez is willing to put in. The hypocrisy is just rampant.

You're going to get rid of your gas-powered cars. You're going to have to stop eating red meat and flying in airplanes. Remember, Ocasio-Cortez fought hard to block Amazon from building their headquarters in New York City. That would have been 30,000, 40,000, 50,000 jobs for New Yorkers. Why? Because of their evil capitalist ways.   Now after so much bad press she is backtracking, her chief of staff is reportedly saying that Amazon's 25,000 jobs might be welcomed in the city, probably too late, under the right conditions, how generous. And keep in mind, socialism, that's only one component of what is now this radical extreme Democratic socialist party and their agenda. In fact, as we were pointing out last night, many of the same far left lawmakers pushing socialist policies were also spreading vile, hateful, rabid anti- Semitic views all throughout the halls of Congress.  Look at Minnesota Congresswoman Omar, once again facing more backlash after yet another anti-Semitic comment on Twitter. First, she proclaims that Israel was evil and hypnotizing the world and then she suggested support for Israel was just because of Jewish money or, as she put it, all about the Benjamins. And most recently, she pushed the longtime anti-Semitic conspiracy theory that her colleagues support Israel because they have a dual allegiance to the country.  Now, for the second time, the House of Representatives has been forced to pass a resolution reminding some Democrats that anti-Semitism is bad and will not be tolerated. Well, that's not stopping Congresswoman Cortez from defending her anti-Semitic colleague on Twitter writing, quote: We called resolutions on sexist statements, a good chunk of Congress will be gone. Jump to the nuclear option every single time? Leaves the room or some corrective action? I'm asking everybody that we practice calling in before calling out. So, I guess socialist, you know, sort of a feather stick together. Birds of a feather? Even when one of them is absolutely obsessed with hating the world's only Jewish state, our closest ally in the region, the only democracy in the region, Israel? And meanwhile, far left anti-Semitic bigot and self-proclaimed women's rights leader, Linda Sarsour, backing up her radical friends on Capitol Hill, slamming Speaker Pelosi's decision to put forth a resolution against anti-Semitism, calling the speaker, quote, a typical white feminist upholding the patriarchy doing the work of power white men. Wow.   And you know what? Nancy Pelosi is afraid to take a stand because that freshman group, they can unseat her pretty quickly. And while some congressional Democrats focus on hating Israel and bizarre socialist eco- state, well, Congresswoman Maxine Waters is back and she's sticking to her own longtime favorite of session, impeaching 45.  And yesterday, she renewed these new fantasies on Twitter, writing that, quote, impeachment is the only answer. Socialism, anti-Semitism, impeachment, unprecedented 24/7, 365 investigations, eight committees into all things Donald Trump, an investigation in search of a crime, any crime, 24/7 abuse of power, try to bloodied, bludgeon the president politically, impeach him. If they can't impeach him, death by a thousand cuts. It is a very scary picture inside this new radical Democratic Party. And as the 2020 primary season kicks into high gear, it has become very clear that it will be a contest to see who can present the single most radical, most extreme, most socialist vision for America's future.  Do you want America to be a socialist country? Bernie Sanders appears to have some early momentum. On the fence candidates like Crazy Uncle Joe Biden, he may be losing before he even starts.  Look at what happened during fake news CNN's Democratic focus group earlier today. I hope Uncle Joe is watching. Take a look.",

      "sentences": "Remember, if Hillary didn't cheat, that nomination would have gone to Bernie Sanders. And while Biden is on the fence deciding whether or not he's going to run, Hillary, wow, huge announcement. She won't try it a third time. And that's not stopping her allies from rehashing old wounds with Sanders in 2016. This intramural Democratic battle is real. Remember last week, former Clinton aide referred to Sanders as, quote, his royal majesty, King Bernie Sanders.   Well, he does have four mansions. We do know that. Apparently, he demands private jet rights while campaigning for Clinton. Apparently, they didn't like that.  It's prompting a former Sanders campaign aide to call the Clinton camp, quote, some of the biggest A-holes in American politics. So, showing no signs of stopping. And as Clinton allies are continuing to snipe at Sanders, well, one former advisor recently tweeting that only half of Bernie's donors were, quote, named Vladimir. Wow.  Now even President Trump weighing in. He's getting on the fun: Crooked Hillary Clinton confirms she will not run in 2020, rules out a third bid for the White House. Aw shucks, does that mean I will get to run against her again? She will be sorely missed. And even without Hillary Clinton, 2020 is shaping up to be a very, very toxic year for the Democrats. Now, their issues are much larger than any of this infighting. This is where it gets serious. The Democrats biggest problem is they are pushing the most radical agenda of any party in this country's history.  By the way, before birth, up to birth, during birth, after birth abortions, that is called infanticide. That is a child living alone outside the womb. That would be called murder. That's the party of the Democrats now, the party telling you it might be reckless to have kids like Ocasio-Cortez? The party that wants to take away all private health care insurance. They want to socialize, nationalize health care.  Now, they are talking about legalizing drugs and prostitution, that's gaining momentum among the 2020 candidates. Reparation is now back by many candidates like Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren. Many are supporting this top marginal tax rate of 70 percent. By the way, after you pay her 70 percent, you get to keep maybe 30, maybe not depending on what state you live in.  Well, if you save some money, then Elizabeth Warren once a wealth tax on top of it. She wants another bite of the Apple. And then, by the way, when you die in the United States of America you've got to pay to die. If you have any money left in your bank account, guess what? They are going to take 40 percent of that. If you live in New York they will take another 10 percent. And, by the way, so they can take care of people that are unwilling to work and of course pay for child care and retirement and government food and health care and college. They are going to illuminate fossil fuels, gas and oil. They're going to destroy the lifeblood of our economy.  They're going to get rid of planes, mandate you rebuild your home. Who's paying for that? The estimates now are as high as $94 trillion in ten years, that's their proposal. Pushing open borders. Remember Bozo O'Rourke actually wants to tear down the border walls, preventing any of us from being safe and secure. That would leave all of us defenseless against cartels and drug traffickers and human traffickers of young women into prostitution, gangs that make this country totally defenseless. The 90 percent of heroine that comes through our southern border, now it gets through even more easily. And don't forget free everything. Health care, college, child care, vacations, free healthy government food. It's a party that is totally fueled by the desire to run your life, take your hard-earned money, give it to someone else and use it to buy power and votes for themselves as they live the lap of luxury. A party committed to destroying the single greatest, best economic system that has let more people out of poverty, that has created more wealth and prosperity. That has created more opportunity than any other economic system in history of man. The Democratic Party with no plan to make your life better -- more safe, more secure, more prosperous for not only you, but for your children and your grandchildren.  They are fueled too by a rage, hate, and obsession with victimhood and identity politics, entitlement, pushing doom and gloom day and night, climate hysteria, indoctrinating your kids into believing the world is ending in 12 years. Just to push the socialist agenda. A party fueled by what can only be described as psychotic, literally unhinged, rage and hatred every second, minute, hour of every day against the duly elected president.  They are not even trying to hide it. Just today, we learned that Shifty Adam Schiff hired former MSNBC legal analyst, collusion experience theorist Daniel Goldman to lead his new witch hunt against the president in the House Intel Committee. Forget the Mueller report, that's not working out the way we want, we will rewrite it. As \"The Daily Caller\" points out, Goldman has already been caught asserting faceless Russia hysteria. Look at the screen. He was promoting a phony Steele dossier, the debunked Steele dossier, even debunked by Michael Cohen, who never went to Prague. And there were no hookers and Donald Trump spat in Moscow. They weren't there.  Now, we have more evidence, endless fishing expeditions have nothing to do with the truth, everything to do with making every working day a public trial against the president. Look at this, even David Axelrod has more sense than this. Former chief strategist for Obama agreeing, writing on Twitter that the Democrats wide-ranging investigations to easily play into the witch hunt meme. Look at that. He's right. And that's because the Democrats are engaging in a witch hunt. All right. Here with reaction as we now are looking at two very distinct paths for the future.

      "utterance": "All right. Welcome to “Hannity.” A lot of breaking news tonight. The 2020 presidential election is officially gearing up and the Democratic Party, they are imploding. Radical extreme far left socialists have now taken over any and any Democratic who doesn't fall in line and support this radical extreme left agenda. This left-wing vision, if you will, you get thrown down the curb by Ocasio- Cortez. You have a group now, and all of America needs to see this, hyper- partisan freshmen lawmakers. They are now leading the way. They set the agenda. Nancy Pelosi is afraid of all of those freshmen. Now, the list is led by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Now, according to a report from \"The Washington Post,\" she warned her fellow Democratic lawmakers not to vote with Republicans or she's going to put them on a list to be primaried in the next election. Welcome to Congress. Now, no surprise there, political intimidation is always a key component of socialism. Now, after all, she needs as much support as she can get for this insane Green New Deal which vows to totally reshape America by putting an end to all fossil fuels, combustion engines, nuclear energy, airplanes, and yes, cows because of flatulence and CO2 gases. It also promises to provide everything is free. You don't have to worry another day in your life. Free government healthy food, free day care for your kids, free housing, free college education. Forget about K-through- 12, free universal health care, free, free. But pro-choice Democrats, they are going to allow -- not allow you to have your private plane anymore. Forget choice. You get guarantee vacations. You get universal guaranteed income, a guaranteed retirement, even people unwilling to work. But like any other socialist, Ocasio-Cortez, she's really just interested in improving her own quality of life and redistributing the wealth among those in her own inner circle. Look at this, according to a brand-new bombshell FEC complaint, Ocasio- Cortez's chief of staff is now accused of illegally moving nearly a million dollars in campaign contributions to his own private companies, and in doing so, that money could be shielded from all election related reporting. In other words, Ocasio-Cortez under fire tonight, her chief of staff could have used those donations for anything without reporting it, including maybe big payments to themselves, their family, their friends. Now, we already know based on a separate FEC complaint that Ocasio-Cortez's boyfriend, well, he was funneled thousands of dollars from a political action committee set up by this very same chief of staff. But really, who can blame him for taking the money? After all, it's incredibly expensive to keep up with the jet-setting lifestyle of the freshman socialist congresswoman. Last night, we first showed you how Ocasio-Cortez, who wants to ban all air travel, but she herself loves flying on airplanes between New York and D.C. Now, there's something called Amtrak. It goes pretty much every hour on the hour between D.C. and New York. And she chooses not to do that. In fact, she chooses to take a plane three times more -- three times more travelers themselves choose Amtrak between the two cities. Not Ocasio-Cortez, she prefers the convenience of flying, especially since you, we, the American people are picking up the bill. It costs more to fly. Now, Fox News producer caught up with Ocasio-Cortez that she was getting off a flight in D.C. today. We asked her about her travel preferences, recent FEC complaints and much more. Take a look."

That's why she has no problem taking planes over trains, why she prefers that caravan, the gas guzzler, and that service over public transportation. It's why Ocasio-Cortez probably doesn't want you to know that her very own mother left the great state of New York because of its incredibly high taxes. It's why Bernie and Hillary and Joe Biden and Al Gore, they all take private jets and we catch them all the time. And get this, even though a climate change apocalypse is on the horizon, recycling -- well, that's just way too much work than Ocasio-Cortez is willing to put in. The hypocrisy is just rampant.

You're going to get rid of your gas-powered cars. You're going to have to stop eating red meat and flying in airplanes. Remember, Ocasio-Cortez fought hard to block Amazon from building their headquarters in New York City. That would have been 30,000, 40,000, 50,000 jobs for New Yorkers. Why? Because of their evil capitalist ways. Now after so much bad press she is backtracking, her chief of staff is reportedly saying that Amazon's 25,000 jobs might be welcomed in the city, probably too late, under the right conditions, how generous. And keep in mind, socialism, that's only one component of what is now this radical extreme Democratic socialist party and their agenda. In fact, as we were pointing out last night, many of the same far left lawmakers pushing socialist policies were also spreading vile, hateful, rabid anti- Semitic views all throughout the halls of Congress. Look at Minnesota Congresswoman Omar, once again facing more backlash after yet another anti-Semitic comment on Twitter. First, she proclaims that Israel was evil and hypnotizing the world and then she suggested support for Israel was just because of Jewish money or, as she put it, all about the Benjamins. And most recently, she pushed the longtime anti-Semitic conspiracy theory that her colleagues support Israel because they have a dual allegiance to the country."

    {
      "speaker": "Now, for the second time, the House of Representatives has been forced to pass a resolution reminding some Democrats that anti-Semitism is bad and will not be tolerated. Well, that's not stopping Congresswoman Cortez from defending her anti-Semitic colleague on Twitter writing, quote",
      "utterance": "We called resolutions on sexist statements, a good chunk of Congress will be gone. Jump to the nuclear option every single time? Leaves the room or some corrective action? I'm asking everybody that we practice calling in before calling out. So, I guess socialist, you know, sort of a feather stick together. Birds of a feather? Even when one of them is absolutely obsessed with hating the world's only Jewish state, our closest ally in the region, the only democracy in the region, Israel? And meanwhile, far left anti-Semitic bigot and self-proclaimed women's rights leader, Linda Sarsour, backing up her radical friends on Capitol Hill, slamming Speaker Pelosi's decision to put forth a resolution against anti-Semitism, calling the speaker, quote, a typical white feminist upholding the patriarchy doing the work of power white men. Wow. And you know what? Nancy Pelosi is afraid to take a stand because that freshman group, they can unseat her pretty quickly. And while some congressional Democrats focus on hating Israel and bizarre socialist eco- state, well, Congresswoman Maxine Waters is back and she's sticking to her own longtime favorite of session, impeaching 45. And yesterday, she renewed these new fantasies on Twitter, writing that, quote, impeachment is the only answer. Socialism, anti-Semitism, impeachment, unprecedented 24/7, 365 investigations, eight committees into all things Donald Trump, an investigation in search of a crime, any crime, 24/7 abuse of power, try to bloodied, bludgeon the president politically, impeach him. If they can't impeach him, death by a thousand cuts. It is a very scary picture inside this new radical Democratic Party. And as the 2020 primary season kicks into high gear, it has become very clear that it will be a contest to see who can present the single most radical, most extreme, most socialist vision for America's future. Do you want America to be a socialist country? Bernie Sanders appears to have some early momentum. On the fence candidates like Crazy Uncle Joe Biden, he may be losing before he even starts. Look at what happened during fake news CNN's Democratic focus group earlier today. I hope Uncle Joe is watching. Take a look."

Apparently, he demands private jet rights while campaigning for Clinton. Apparently, they didn't like that. It's prompting a former Sanders campaign aide to call the Clinton camp, quote, some of the biggest A-holes in American politics. So, showing no signs of stopping.

      "utterance": "Crooked Hillary Clinton confirms she will not run in 2020, rules out a third bid for the White House. Aw shucks, does that mean I will get to run against her again? She will be sorely missed. And even without Hillary Clinton, 2020 is shaping up to be a very, very toxic year for the Democrats. Now, their issues are much larger than any of this infighting. This is where it gets serious. The Democrats biggest problem is they are pushing the most radical agenda of any party in this country's history. By the way, before birth, up to birth, during birth, after birth abortions, that is called infanticide. That is a child living alone outside the womb. That would be called murder. That's the party of the Democrats now, the party telling you it might be reckless to have kids like Ocasio-Cortez? The party that wants to take away all private health care insurance. They want to socialize, nationalize health care. Now, they are talking about legalizing drugs and prostitution, that's gaining momentum among the 2020 candidates. Reparation is now back by many candidates like Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren. Many are supporting this top marginal tax rate of 70 percent. By the way, after you pay her 70 percent, you get to keep maybe 30, maybe not depending on what state you live in. Well, if you save some money, then Elizabeth Warren once a wealth tax on top of it. She wants another bite of the Apple. And then, by the way, when you die in the United States of America you've got to pay to die. If you have any money left in your bank account, guess what? They are going to take 40 percent of that. If you live in New York they will take another 10 percent. And, by the way, so they can take care of people that are unwilling to work and of course pay for child care and retirement and government food and health care and college. They are going to illuminate fossil fuels, gas and oil. They're going to destroy the lifeblood of our economy. They're going to get rid of planes, mandate you rebuild your home. Who's paying for that? The estimates now are as high as $94 trillion in ten years, that's their proposal. Pushing open borders. Remember Bozo O'Rourke actually wants to tear down the border walls, preventing any of us from being safe and secure. That would leave all of us defenseless against cartels and drug traffickers and human traffickers of young women into prostitution, gangs that make this country totally defenseless. The 90 percent of heroine that comes through our southern border, now it gets through even more easily. And don't forget free everything. Health care, college, child care, vacations, free healthy government food. It's a party that is totally fueled by the desire to run your life, take your hard-earned money, give it to someone else and use it to buy power and votes for themselves as they live the lap of luxury. A party committed to destroying the single greatest, best economic system that has let more people out of poverty, that has created more wealth and prosperity. That has created more opportunity than any other economic system in history of man. The Democratic Party with no plan to make your life better -- more safe, more secure, more prosperous for not only you, but for your children and your grandchildren. They are fueled too by a rage, hate, and obsession with victimhood and identity politics, entitlement, pushing doom and gloom day and night, climate hysteria, indoctrinating your kids into believing the world is ending in 12 years. Just to push the socialist agenda. A party fueled by what can only be described as psychotic, literally unhinged, rage and hatred every second, minute, hour of every day against the duly elected president. They are not even trying to hide it. Just today, we learned that Shifty Adam Schiff hired former MSNBC legal analyst, collusion experience theorist Daniel Goldman to lead his new witch hunt against the president in the House Intel Committee. Forget the Mueller report, that's not working out the way we want, we will rewrite it. As \"The Daily Caller\" points out, Goldman has already been caught asserting faceless Russia hysteria. Look at the screen. He was promoting a phony Steele dossier, the debunked Steele dossier, even debunked by Michael Cohen, who never went to Prague. And there were no hookers and Donald Trump spat in Moscow. They weren't there. Now, we have more evidence, endless fishing expeditions have nothing to do with the truth, everything to do with making every working day a public trial against the president. Look at this, even David Axelrod has more sense than this. Former chief strategist for Obama agreeing, writing on Twitter that the Democrats wide-ranging investigations to easily play into the witch hunt meme. Look at that. He's right. And that's because the Democrats are engaging in a witch hunt. All right. Here with reaction as we now are looking at two very distinct paths for the future.

Where is the due process for President Trump, for the 81 people now that they're throwing this wide net out, and for the American people who voted for the President, who have literally been held hostage for two years by the Democrats as they continue to search for a crime? There is something drastically wrong here and I don't think people actually realize how damaging and how dangerous this is. When I hear Alan Dershowitz, he is a voice of reason. I think to myself, this is what they used to think. The libertarians, the Democrats, they used to fight against this abuse of power. What we've seen Sean, and you've listed it out, and we've talked about this over and over again, a weaponization of the intelligence community, the unmasking of Americans. I mean, all see these issues that are so --"

But if that happens, then the first thing we know is that we saw the weaponization of the criminal justice system and the counterintelligence system against Donald Trump. And now you're going to see that sort of criminalization, weaponization of the congressional oversight process to try to keep this narrative going, so that's one thing the President has to deal with. The second thing is, does the Justice Department now say, \"OK, Mueller is done, let's take a look at the Strzoks and the McCabes and the Pages, and all these people that were involved in this and do we hold them accountable? The IG report will come in on FISA abuses. That will inform us a lot. The President has the ability without being accused of obstruction of declassifying the documents --"

      "utterance": "Yes, there is no doubt in my mind. Now let's just take the column, just for one second, just think about what Bill Barr could look at in this circumstance. 20 years ago we had one of the worst spy scandals in American history. Robert Hanssen spied for the Russians, went undetected for 20 years. The After-Action Report said the biggest problem the FBI had was a failure to confront its own people about suspected bad behavior. What happens, two employees come forward and say, \"We think there's an affair going on by Pete Strzok and Lisa Page\". And rather than confront them directly, they shove to the side. They don't take that security risk seriously. Even though they said that -- everyone understood it was a security risk, no one wanted to ask the hard questions. We didn't learn much in the FBI over 20 years from the Hanssen scandal. Those are the sort of things that Bill Barr, the Inspector General, the Senate Judiciary Committee can all look."

Sean, if we don't do this, then what are we? What do we stand on? How can we guarantee that at the next administration this won't happen? We can't. As Americans, we have to demand that, and I hope that President Trump declassifies those documents."

      "utterance": "Yes. And Sean, on his Twitter bio, Saikat Chakrabarti calls himself \"CoS to AOC\" or Chief of Staff to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Chakrabarti is a Harvard educated computer engineer, who before he started working with one of the nation's most famous socialists, did very well as a capitalist, reportedly making tens of millions of dollars in Silicon Valley startups. From there he shifted to activism where he founded an organization to help launch Left-wing candidates into Congress. Chakrabarti reportedly owns homes in Maryland and New York's trendy West Village. He makes $80,000 working for Ocasio-Cortez, which is well below the income level that mandates filing disclosure forms for outside income. And for months, he flew under the radar until a conservative watchdog group filed a complaint to the FEC accusing Chakrabarti and Ocasio-Cortez of violating campaign finance laws by funneling nearly $1 million dollars of donations into political action committees. The complaint states they were trying to illegally dodge laws aimed at tracking campaign expenditures. Today Ocasio-Cortez told Fox News, \"No, no, there is no violation\". Sean?"

As a registered Democrat most of my life I am ashamed for the party and the direction its leaders have taken it\". Another writes, \"Thanks Sean for all you do, in spite of your haters.\" Thank you, there's quite a few, actually they listed pretty long -- most of them in the \"Hate Trump Media\", amazing. But, thankfully, I have support from people like you and you make this program possible, that's the bottom- line. And I'm missing that chip, that's most people care what other people think, it's gone. It's long gone. It disappeared years ago. All right. That's all the time we have left this evening.
