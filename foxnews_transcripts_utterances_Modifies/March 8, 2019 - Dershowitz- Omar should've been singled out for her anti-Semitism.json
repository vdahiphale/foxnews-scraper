      "sentences": "This is a Fox News alert. We are following several major breaking stories this Friday night.  Now, I know so many of you have been very frustrated, so have I, with our system of justice. We've watched Mueller's witch-hunt. That's been playing out for two years, day after day. A lot of people's lives have been ruined over, quote, \"process crimes\" just because of their connection to President Trump. And I know you've been saying to yourself, well, what about all of the people that we know have been abusing power, committing real and serious crimes?  Hillary Clinton's one. We look at people like McCabe and Comey and Strzok and Page and many, many more. What about the FISA abuses, stripping Americans of their constitutional rights? What about the rampant conflicts of interest at some of the highest levels at the DOJ, FBI?  Tonight, we have great news. According to my sources, everything that we have been revealing about the deep state for two years will very soon result in major serious ramifications. We're going to have a complete breakdown of all of this coming up. All right, but first, just breaking a couple of hours ago, Jussie Smollett has been indicted on 16 felony counts for allegedly orchestrating an elaborate, poorly executed hate crime hoax. If found guilty, he could face major prison time. We are going to have more on this breaking news throughout the show.  Also coming up tonight, we have big breaking news and surrounding House Intel chair, known the liar, and known collaborator, collusion himself, involved in, Adam Schiff, and his brand-new best friend, Michael Cohen. Serious charges tonight being made about Adam Schiff. Plus, new developments in the Democrats' new wave of anti-Semitism, bigotry, and hate. We have a “Hannity” expose on crazy Uncle Joe Biden.  But we begin tonight, breaking news out of our “Hannity Watch” of the deep state. What we are about to show you, this is only the beginning. Buckle up. Thanks to a surprise move by one very brave House Republican, we now have damning evidence surrounding the corrupt, unethical, dishonest actions of so many deep state actors of the past three years.   The congressman is from Georgia. His name is Doug Collins, and he released the full transcript of Bruce Ohr's deposition and its contents are shocking. By the way, there is going to be a cascade of these depositions being released. Now, the deep state house of cards, mark my words, it is beginning to tumble down. To give you some background, keep in mind, Bruce Ohr was once the fourth highest ranking member of Obama's Department of Justice. He became a conduit for the federal government Russia collusion investigation. Remember, his wife, Nellie, actually work for Christopher Steele. She was working at Fusion GPS on the Clinton bought and paid for and he dossier, and used her husband's position to proliferate the dossiers content throughout the highest levels of government. That's contained in this deposition. And according to Ohr's testimony, which is now completely public, Bruce Ohr passed along a thumb drive from his wife to the FBI so that Trump-haters like Strzok and Page could have direct access to Hillary Clinton's oppo research.   And we also learned that both the FBI and the Clinton campaign, via Fusion GPS, they were both paying Christopher Steele for this so-called intelligence. And we know that Steele was being paid by Russian oligarch - - we talked about him -- Oleg Deripaska, who had a grievance against Paul Manafort over a business deal gone wrong. Let me recap this so you have to understand this. Steele was getting paid by your FBI, Hillary Clinton, and the DNC, and a Russian oligarch. Pretty good gig if you can get it. But that's not all. Thanks to this transcript, we now know that Bruce Ohr testified under oath about meeting with Fusion GPS founder and Christopher Steele's boss, Glenn Simpson. Now, this occurred during the 2016 campaign. Now, Simpson, he testified that he didn't meet with Bruce Ohr until after the election.  The question is, which one of these two guys is lying? Now, we also learn from this deposition that Ohr testified that he notified the FBI about his contacts with Christopher Steele also during the 2016 election. But according to a statement from Adam Schiff, who I think is the biggest liar in Congress, he claims that Bruce Ohr did not tell the FBI about his contacts with Steele, again, until after the election.   Here we are again. Which one is lying? My money is on Schiff. Now, here's where it gets really important. Bruce Ohr also testifies that he notified the FBI of the dossier's extremely biased source and Christopher Steele's personal mission to stop Trump, a big Trump hater. On page 15 of the October, 2016 FISA application against Carter Page, it reads the following: The FBI was unaware of any derogatory information pertaining to Christopher Steele.  That's right. The problem is, everybody in the FBI knew in August of 2016 the dossier was tainted, that Hillary paid for it, that DNC paid for it, Comey, McCabe, he even briefed Andrew Weissmann, who is Mueller's pit bull, about this bias. So, literally, the special counsel's office has been long aware of the bias origins of the face phony Clinton, DNC and apparently, FBI and Russian oligarch payments to Christopher Steele. This is hugely important. A detail never provided to the FISA court. That is called the conspiracy to commit fraud on a court, to spy on a Trump campaign associate, denying that person his constitutional rights, and this being done at the height of the 2016 election. So in other words, they had purposely withheld to the FISA court conspiracy to commit fraud, plain and simple, information that was so relevant, and it became of the bulk of the FISA application.  Now, it doesn't end there. Christopher Steele testified under oath, in Great Britain, under the threat of perjury, I don't know if any of this dossier is true, maybe 50/50. You know, it's just draw intelligence. In other words, the author of the dossier doesn't stand by the dossier. Raw intelligence, 50/50 does not become the bulk of evidence to deny an American citizen, Carter Page, his constitutional rights and get a FISA warrant.  Now, thankfully, Senator Lindsey Graham has now reopened the Senate investigation into FISA abuse, and we are also waiting for Michael Horowitz, the inspector general's report, on the same. And unlike the Democrats' never ending witch hunt, this investigation centers around real crimes, with real evidence. So what I'm telling you is it's all now beginning to cascade down. It's time to officially now pull the veil off the deep state effort. They tried to steal an election.  They had a favored candidate, Hillary Clinton. They had somebody they didn't like, Donald Trump. And literally, they wanted to alter the will of the American people, both before the election, and then undo the career of a duly elected president. This is abuse of power we have never, ever seen in the history of this country.   We have a lot more coming up. Now, to turn to another breaking news tonight about another deep state bad actor. Do you remember when Congressman Adam Schiff made such a big deal when then-House Intel Committee Chairman Devin Nunes went over to the White House to review documents? Remember this? Take a look.",

He said accidentally. They run into each other in Aspen, Colorado, while Simpson was a key witness in an ongoing House collusion probe.  Now, the pair denied talking about the investigation. They were just socializing. And let's not forget, Ed Henry's reporting from 2017, according to Ed, during a closed-door confidential hearing with Donald Trump Jr., remember, Schiff was spotted going in and out of the hearing room over and over and over again, while at the very same time, fake news CNN was gaining access to what was going on in real time with Don Jr. testimony as it was happening. Care to explain that, Mr. Schiff?

Given the serious conflicts of interest, now allegations of witness tampering, collusion, his constant lying, apparent leaking that needs to be investigated, well, Adam Schiff needs to hold himself to the same standard that he held Devin Nunes. That would be recuse himself from the Intel Committee's investigations immediately. They are now needs to be an ethics investigation into Adam Schiff, and he needs to be held accountable. No wonder he doesn't want to come on this show. His actions over the past two years represent every single thing that is wrong with the sewer of Washington, D.C.   These are now major developments and remember, so much more to come in terms of other depositions, 302s, the FISA warrant, Gang of Eight, it's all coming out, and people will be held accountable.  All right. We continue, by the way, our very important “Hannity Watch” on the rise of anti-Semitism and bigotry inside the Democratic Party. This has been a really revealing and despicable week. As we speak, an elected U.S. member of Congress is sitting on the all powerful Foreign Affairs Committee, even after suggesting, evil Jews are hypnotizing the world, that Jewish money is controlling our government, and that her colleagues have a dual loyalty to Israel, which is anti-Semitism on the most vile level.  This should shock the conscience and alarm every single American. Apparently not those in the Democratic Party. A group of outspoken, radical socialists, they are now pulling the strings in the House of Representatives. Here's Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez, Congresswoman Tlaib, Congresswoman Omar, apparently they are the head of the entire Democratic Party and Nancy Pelosi is just a speaker in name only. The rest of the Democrats are either fear-mongering or total agreement. They had an opportunity to condemn this hate, this bigotry, this anti-Semitism, and they didn't do it this week.  Now by the way, that is why Pelosi is once again making excuses for this bigoted continued behavior of her colleagues. Watch this.",

What? You have that. We have oh, abortion after birth, during the birthing process, a party that leans so far left -- let's see -- no planes, no cows, highest taxes ever, and no cars, oils, or gas.

But the Democrats, by watering it down, it was as if, you know, after the black children were killed in Alabama, back in the civil rights movement, and somebody wanted to introduce a resolution condemning attacks on black children, some southerner said, oh, yes, yes, let's also include attacks on white children. No, that's not the way you do it.

Instead, Schiff told CNN last month he's moving forward with its own House Intel investigation, so that the Russian probe will continue no matter what Mueller finds. So, in case you are wondering if this will be a fair investigation of the president, Fox's Catherine Herridge found out that Schiff's Democratic staff came here to New York four times to meet with former Trump attorney Michael Cohen for over 10 hours ahead of his seven hours of public testimony. Republican Congressman Mike Turner told Fox this clearly shows to him the witness was coached inappropriately. Sources familiar with the Cohen meeting say that the House Intel staffers covered such topics as whether the president inflated some of his assets to insurance companies and his close relationship with head of the \"National Enquirer.\" That raises eyebrows about how that ties in to oversight of intelligence matters, which is what Schiff is supposed to be doing. In fact those topics were among the ones that Cohen ended up discussing in his public testimony that went after the president. So, it is sparking questions tonight about whether Cohen was coached. Now, Schiff's office insists to us, nothing inappropriate happened. They tell us, standard procedures or talk to witnesses about what they previously told Congress and get a preview of what they may now say in public. But, Sean, it's interesting, tonight, the president is tweeting, according on something Congressman Turner said about how he believes the only time Michael Cohen told the truth was when he pled guilty to lying to Congress.",

Why, he only gave Paul Manafort 4 years in jail.

Is there any way you could say hello? She doesn't have Twitter but her name is Shirley. Shirley, thank you, we love you, happy belated birthday. Of course to mom and we wish you all the best. Thank you, you make this show possible. All right, that's all the time we have for tonight. As always, we will never be the hate-Trump media mob. Let not your heart be troubled.

      "utterance": "This is a Fox News alert. We are following several major breaking stories this Friday night. Now, I know so many of you have been very frustrated, so have I, with our system of justice. We've watched Mueller's witch-hunt. That's been playing out for two years, day after day. A lot of people's lives have been ruined over, quote, \"process crimes\" just because of their connection to President Trump. And I know you've been saying to yourself, well, what about all of the people that we know have been abusing power, committing real and serious crimes? Hillary Clinton's one. We look at people like McCabe and Comey and Strzok and Page and many, many more. What about the FISA abuses, stripping Americans of their constitutional rights? What about the rampant conflicts of interest at some of the highest levels at the DOJ, FBI? Tonight, we have great news. According to my sources, everything that we have been revealing about the deep state for two years will very soon result in major serious ramifications. We're going to have a complete breakdown of all of this coming up. All right, but first, just breaking a couple of hours ago, Jussie Smollett has been indicted on 16 felony counts for allegedly orchestrating an elaborate, poorly executed hate crime hoax. If found guilty, he could face major prison time. We are going to have more on this breaking news throughout the show. Also coming up tonight, we have big breaking news and surrounding House Intel chair, known the liar, and known collaborator, collusion himself, involved in, Adam Schiff, and his brand-new best friend, Michael Cohen. Serious charges tonight being made about Adam Schiff. Plus, new developments in the Democrats' new wave of anti-Semitism, bigotry, and hate. We have a “Hannity” expose on crazy Uncle Joe Biden. But we begin tonight, breaking news out of our “Hannity Watch” of the deep state. What we are about to show you, this is only the beginning. Buckle up. Thanks to a surprise move by one very brave House Republican, we now have damning evidence surrounding the corrupt, unethical, dishonest actions of so many deep state actors of the past three years. The congressman is from Georgia. His name is Doug Collins, and he released the full transcript of Bruce Ohr's deposition and its contents are shocking. By the way, there is going to be a cascade of these depositions being released. Now, the deep state house of cards, mark my words, it is beginning to tumble down. To give you some background, keep in mind, Bruce Ohr was once the fourth highest ranking member of Obama's Department of Justice. He became a conduit for the federal government Russia collusion investigation. Remember, his wife, Nellie, actually work for Christopher Steele. She was working at Fusion GPS on the Clinton bought and paid for and he dossier, and used her husband's position to proliferate the dossiers content throughout the highest levels of government. That's contained in this deposition. And according to Ohr's testimony, which is now completely public, Bruce Ohr passed along a thumb drive from his wife to the FBI so that Trump-haters like Strzok and Page could have direct access to Hillary Clinton's oppo research. And we also learned that both the FBI and the Clinton campaign, via Fusion GPS, they were both paying Christopher Steele for this so-called intelligence. And we know that Steele was being paid by Russian oligarch - - we talked about him -- Oleg Deripaska, who had a grievance against Paul Manafort over a business deal gone wrong. Let me recap this so you have to understand this. Steele was getting paid by your FBI, Hillary Clinton, and the DNC, and a Russian oligarch. Pretty good gig if you can get it. But that's not all. Thanks to this transcript, we now know that Bruce Ohr testified under oath about meeting with Fusion GPS founder and Christopher Steele's boss, Glenn Simpson. Now, this occurred during the 2016 campaign. Now, Simpson, he testified that he didn't meet with Bruce Ohr until after the election. The question is, which one of these two guys is lying? Now, we also learn from this deposition that Ohr testified that he notified the FBI about his contacts with Christopher Steele also during the 2016 election. But according to a statement from Adam Schiff, who I think is the biggest liar in Congress, he claims that Bruce Ohr did not tell the FBI about his contacts with Steele, again, until after the election. Here we are again. Which one is lying? My money is on Schiff. Now, here's where it gets really important. Bruce Ohr also testifies that he notified the FBI of the dossier's extremely biased source and Christopher Steele's personal mission to stop Trump, a big Trump hater. On page 15 of the October, 2016 FISA application against Carter Page, it reads the following: The FBI was unaware of any derogatory information pertaining to Christopher Steele. That's right. The problem is, everybody in the FBI knew in August of 2016 the dossier was tainted, that Hillary paid for it, that DNC paid for it, Comey, McCabe, he even briefed Andrew Weissmann, who is Mueller's pit bull, about this bias. So, literally, the special counsel's office has been long aware of the bias origins of the face phony Clinton, DNC and apparently, FBI and Russian oligarch payments to Christopher Steele. This is hugely important. A detail never provided to the FISA court. That is called the conspiracy to commit fraud on a court, to spy on a Trump campaign associate, denying that person his constitutional rights, and this being done at the height of the 2016 election. So in other words, they had purposely withheld to the FISA court conspiracy to commit fraud, plain and simple, information that was so relevant, and it became of the bulk of the FISA application. Now, it doesn't end there. Christopher Steele testified under oath, in Great Britain, under the threat of perjury, I don't know if any of this dossier is true, maybe 50/50. You know, it's just draw intelligence. In other words, the author of the dossier doesn't stand by the dossier. Raw intelligence, 50/50 does not become the bulk of evidence to deny an American citizen, Carter Page, his constitutional rights and get a FISA warrant. Now, thankfully, Senator Lindsey Graham has now reopened the Senate investigation into FISA abuse, and we are also waiting for Michael Horowitz, the inspector general's report, on the same. And unlike the Democrats' never ending witch hunt, this investigation centers around real crimes, with real evidence. So what I'm telling you is it's all now beginning to cascade down. It's time to officially now pull the veil off the deep state effort. They tried to steal an election. They had a favored candidate, Hillary Clinton. They had somebody they didn't like, Donald Trump. And literally, they wanted to alter the will of the American people, both before the election, and then undo the career of a duly elected president. This is abuse of power we have never, ever seen in the history of this country. We have a lot more coming up. Now, to turn to another breaking news tonight about another deep state bad actor. Do you remember when Congressman Adam Schiff made such a big deal when then-House Intel Committee Chairman Devin Nunes went over to the White House to review documents? Remember this? Take a look."

He is in hot water after reportedly -- get this -- sending him as a staff to New York City to meet with Michael Cohen for over ten hours. Remember, he testified only seven hours, prior to his hearings on Capitol Hill. Ten hours! Well, that kind of reminds me of the time Bill Clinton met with Loretta Lynch on the tarmac during the Department of Justice's investigation, they were about to rule on whether to indict Hillary or not. Remember, Cohen also testified that he went over and he reviewed topics with Schiff himself, something that Congress did not deny. Again, one is lying. Which one? Take a look."

What he did with Michael Cohen would be called witness tampering, and it's not a first for Adam Schiff. In July of 2018, Congressman Schiff actually met with Fusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson. He said accidentally. They run into each other in Aspen, Colorado, while Simpson was a key witness in an ongoing House collusion probe. Now, the pair denied talking about the investigation. They were just socializing. And let's not forget, Ed Henry's reporting from 2017, according to Ed, during a closed-door confidential hearing with Donald Trump Jr., remember, Schiff was spotted going in and out of the hearing room over and over and over again, while at the very same time, fake news CNN was gaining access to what was going on in real time with Don Jr. testimony as it was happening. Care to explain that, Mr. Schiff? And who could ever forget the time that Schiff was caught on tape -- yes -- colluding with somebody that he thought was a Russian to get dirt on President Trump so it could impact America's electoral process. The thing that he says he's investigating, we got him on tape doing it! Listen."

      "utterance": "Real collusion with Russia. Naked pictures of Donald Trump. I'll have more flexibility after the election. All right. Given the serious conflicts of interest, now allegations of witness tampering, collusion, his constant lying, apparent leaking that needs to be investigated, well, Adam Schiff needs to hold himself to the same standard that he held Devin Nunes. That would be recuse himself from the Intel Committee's investigations immediately. They are now needs to be an ethics investigation into Adam Schiff, and he needs to be held accountable. No wonder he doesn't want to come on this show. His actions over the past two years represent every single thing that is wrong with the sewer of Washington, D.C. These are now major developments and remember, so much more to come in terms of other depositions, 302s, the FISA warrant, Gang of Eight, it's all coming out, and people will be held accountable. All right. We continue, by the way, our very important “Hannity Watch” on the rise of anti-Semitism and bigotry inside the Democratic Party. This has been a really revealing and despicable week. As we speak, an elected U.S. member of Congress is sitting on the all powerful Foreign Affairs Committee, even after suggesting, evil Jews are hypnotizing the world, that Jewish money is controlling our government, and that her colleagues have a dual loyalty to Israel, which is anti-Semitism on the most vile level. This should shock the conscience and alarm every single American. Apparently not those in the Democratic Party. A group of outspoken, radical socialists, they are now pulling the strings in the House of Representatives. Here's Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez, Congresswoman Tlaib, Congresswoman Omar, apparently they are the head of the entire Democratic Party and Nancy Pelosi is just a speaker in name only. The rest of the Democrats are either fear-mongering or total agreement. They had an opportunity to condemn this hate, this bigotry, this anti-Semitism, and they didn't do it this week. Now by the way, that is why Pelosi is once again making excuses for this bigoted continued behavior of her colleagues. Watch this."

Get this, she actually -- we saw at the beginning of the montage, is fund- raising off of Omar's anti-Semitism, begging for donations because pro- Israel groups are coming after her, Tlaib, and Omar. The new narrative of the Democratic Party is anyone who calls out Congresswoman Omar's anti-Semitism is Islamophobic. This is a disaster. This is really not an issue this country has to deal with. What? You have that. We have oh, abortion after birth, during the birthing process, a party that leans so far left -- let's see -- no planes, no cows, highest taxes ever, and no cars, oils, or gas. President Obama is not liberal enough. Congresswoman Omar actually went after Obama today. Now, we had a big problem in this country. Let me get to our first guest. Joining us, Professor Alan Dershowitz of Harvard. You know, Professor, you and I have a common bond, a love of Israel. And what has now come out on multiple occasions should outrage every American, and the fact that the Democratic Party could not take a stand and name this woman and condemn this and keep her on the committee, to me, is outrageous."

I think that these Democrats, the one the extreme left, are trying to turn the Democratic Party into Britain's Labour Party headed by an overt anti- Semite like Corbyn. Corbyn makes the same arguments. So, it wasn't anti- Semitic, it was just anti-Zionist. But what Omar said is clearly anti-Semitic. And she should have been condemned by name, singled out, anti-Semitism should have been isolated as the real problem that we are confronting, not only in this country come but around the world. But the Democrats, by watering it down, it was as if, you know, after the black children were killed in Alabama, back in the civil rights movement, and somebody wanted to introduce a resolution condemning attacks on black children, some southerner said, oh, yes, yes, let's also include attacks on white children. No, that's not the way you do it. You look at the problem, the problem is anti-Semitism coming from Omar, and others like her, and that has to be condemned and it has to be condemned uniquely and singularly and strongly."

      "utterance": "Well, Sean, it could be just the beginning because Democrat Adam Schiff is on record refusing to even answer if you would accept Robert Mueller's conclusion if the Mueller report did not find Russian collusion. Instead, Schiff told CNN last month he's moving forward with its own House Intel investigation, so that the Russian probe will continue no matter what Mueller finds. So, in case you are wondering if this will be a fair investigation of the president, Fox's Catherine Herridge found out that Schiff's Democratic staff came here to New York four times to meet with former Trump attorney Michael Cohen for over 10 hours ahead of his seven hours of public testimony. Republican Congressman Mike Turner told Fox this clearly shows to him the witness was coached inappropriately. Sources familiar with the Cohen meeting say that the House Intel staffers covered such topics as whether the president inflated some of his assets to insurance companies and his close relationship with head of the \"National Enquirer.\" That raises eyebrows about how that ties in to oversight of intelligence matters, which is what Schiff is supposed to be doing. In fact those topics were among the ones that Cohen ended up discussing in his public testimony that went after the president. So, it is sparking questions tonight about whether Cohen was coached. Now, Schiff's office insists to us, nothing inappropriate happened. They tell us, standard procedures or talk to witnesses about what they previously told Congress and get a preview of what they may now say in public. But, Sean, it's interesting, tonight, the president is tweeting, according on something Congressman Turner said about how he believes the only time Michael Cohen told the truth was when he pled guilty to lying to Congress."

He had a fit over the whole issue that Devin Nunes actually went to the White House and demanded recusal, et cetera, and then investigation. Tell us what you think this is going."

      "utterance": "Well, Sean, this is shocking. When you look at the fact that we learned on the Government Oversight Committee that Cohen had had conversations with Adam Schiff and then we learned from Fox News reporting now and Lanny Davis reporting that four trips to New York totaling over ten hours of meetings, that's not just talking to someone about the logistics of their testimony. That's actually talking about their testimony. That's when coaching can happen, that's when suggesting of answers happens. This is certainly very concerning. It shows orchestration. I think this is a professional investigation, this professional orchestration. And when you look at the comparison between the amount of time the Democrats questioned him at oversight, it was four hours of Democrat questioning that was public testimony and over 10 hours in private preparation for that testimony. That certainly is not appropriate and it's not professional."

And Cohen said, oh, we were going over the question, his testimony. So, we have coaching, literally, Schiff's own collusion on tape, as he thinks he's speaking with the Russian operatives trying to get Russian compromised material on the President for electoral purposes. Then of course, he hired the one guy in the country, the one guy that still believes in this debunked dossier, which its author doesn't even believe in, and we now know in the case he's on tape colluding with Russians. What needs to happen and how big is this, especially with the release of that Ohr transcript?"

I have some reason to believe that Chairman Schiff and his staff have had contacts with people who subsequently stopped cooperating with the Committee. I think that's an important question. If he believes in transparency, like he says, put all of your contacts down to the table, let us know all the witnesses you've been talking to behind the scenes out of view. But a week ago, I said John, I thought Michael Cohen testimony would be a boon to the President. Ten days later, after he made it, here are the facts. We're not talking about what he said, we're talking about the lies, we're talking about prosecution now, we're talking about his lawyer who has a Russian client and representing him after representing Hillary Clinton. And The Hill did a poll, and listen to this poll, back in December when he pled guilty Michael Cohen, 51 percent of Americans said they thought he was credible. After he testified last week, now only 37 percent of Americans think he's credible. The entire Cohen testimony has backfired on the Democrats."

The 302s have yet to be released, they will be released. The actual FISA warrant which we're told the bulk of information is the debunked dossier that Steele doesn't even stand by.

Whether there's national security issues regarding some of the documentation, that can be taken care of before the release, but it has to be transparent. Sean, there's also another issue. I mean we know that Adam Schiff, and I reported on this several weeks ago, has gone as far as hiring a National Security Council personnel that worked in the White House, that had access to executive privilege documents, on to his investigative staff."

Sean, another thing that I think will be coming out is, now with the release of all this testimony, we will be seeing testimony from Loretta Lynch, we saw the testimony from Bruce Ohr, and the enormous contradictions. Look at Glenn Simpson, the enormous lies and contradictions between who's telling the truth, Bruce or Glenn Simpson, about his meetings and his contacts with Christopher Steele, when he spoke to the FBI. Rod Rosenstein, John wrote a great piece on that, and it's another contradiction as to who and when he knew about Nellie Ohr. I mean Rod Rosenstein told lawmakers, he basically said he wouldn't answer any of their questions as to when the Department of Justice knew when Nellie Ohr was actually a conduit, her husband was a conduit for her information, and then later it's discovered in his own testimony that Rod Rosenstein was the man that he met with, was the man that he got the information from. So, everyone here is lying."

Later, Congresswoman Ilhan Omar has the nerve to attack the late John McCain now, in the midst of this anti- Semitism scandal? What does it tell you about her. But more importantly, what a week of exposure for the Democratic Party, bigotry, anti-semitism, they did nothing about it, straight ahead. Live from America's News Headquarters, I'm Trace Gallagher. President Trump traveled to Alabama earlier today to survey damage from Sunday's deadly tornado. The President, along with First Lady Melania Trump, were in Beauregard, the community that was hit the hardest. They met with survivors and those affected by the storm. A moment of silence was also held in an area housing 23 crosses, representing those who were killed. The President has ordered FEMA to give Alabama \"the A+ treatment as it recovers.\" White House Communications Director Bill Shine is leaving his post. Press Secretary Sarah Sanders says Shine gave the President his resignation on Thursday. He will take on a new role as a member of the President's reelection campaign. Bill Shine served as the former co-President of Fox News, before joining the White House last June. If news breaks out, we will break in. I'm Trace Gallagher. Now back to Hannity."

Now, the former Senator has a long political career behind him, which is now coming back to haunt him, even before he officially declares his candidacy, which we hear might be in April. On his time in the Senate, Biden made remarks well he should have been ashamed of at the time, particularly regarding race. Watch this impassioned speech that he delivered on the Senate floor.

And so many people who are defending Omar are saying, well should we able to debate about this issue, shouldn't be people - shouldn't people be free to criticize Israel? Well, yes, of course they are, but that's not what she's saying. She's not saying Israel is violating international law because its presence in the West Bank or Israel's treatments of Arab minority is illegal.
