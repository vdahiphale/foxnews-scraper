That site was the site of a homeless encampment that they were charged with cleaning up. We'll bring you the details on that shocking story also climate - let's where they took to the streets across the country today including here. So we just started to send an actual scientist in the middle of it with a camera let you hear what the answer that he got.  And it's Friday so of course, we have follies for you tonight.

Now this apparently happened on a number of occasions. Now numerous outlets have reported on those potentially troubling Biden family conflicts as well.

Details suggesting that Democrats and pundits of the media may be overreaching again a senior administration official familiar with the transcript of this call between President Trump and his counterpart form Ukraine told me it's overblown to suggest there was any threat to national security any crime discussed.   This top official adding \"The media better be careful with this, there's no there, there. It's in the President's interest to put the transcript of the call out and show that there was no quid pro quo\". Let's go through the time line. May 9th, \"The New York Times\" reports that Rudy Giuliani the President's Attorney was traveling to Ukraine to push for a Biden probe. That trip called off. June 13th, ABC news has an interview they released; it says the President told them he would be willing to listen if a foreign government offered political dirt. July 25th, the President has that call with the President of Ukraine newly sworn in to office. August 12th, the whistle-blower involved here files a complaint a couple weeks after the call.  August 21st, \"The New York Times\" reports Giuliani is pushing again to get Ukraine to investigate Biden. August 28th about a week later, POLITICO reports the White House is slow-walking $250 million in aid to Ukraine but that money was released on September 12th. So the President today said in the Oval Office just like with Justice Brett Kavanaugh, to that story the media is going to wind up looking foolish.",

He has no background in the Ukraine he has no background in energy or natural gas. So the question is what is he being paid for? He's not being paid for his expertise. He has none. His father at this time is the point person on U.S. policy to Ukraine. The same thing is playing, taking place halfway around the world in China.  Donald Trump is right to ask the question and to ask that there be an investigation to see what Hunter Biden was being paid for. Joe Biden has offered no answers. Hunter Biden when he is been asked about his has lied repeatedly and they've been proven lies by ABC news and other outlets. So these are the underlying questions. Look at what the whistle-blower says but the underlying issue here involves corruption at the highest scale. My point is look, if people want to defend the Bidens on this, get used to it because everybody in Washington is going to start cashing in this way.",

The Trump Administration is now getting involved on the EPA level. That's how dangerous this is. Now you have police officers apparently getting sick.

If the toxins that made that police officer ill, were found dumped in the Puget Sound at there in Seattle, all of these people in the streets today would be outraged. But no, no, no, it came from a homeless encampment. So they didn't want to do anything about it. I saw a picture that somebody showed me the other day they have an office in Manhattan. Outside the office was a woman nicely dressed with a bike and a lovely dog and a basket, lovingly wrapped? A few feet away from her this is in the middle of Manhattan with some poor soul sleeping on cardboard. His cloths in rags, his belongings scattered all around him.

Now this apparently happened on a number of occasions. Now numerous outlets have reported on those potentially troubling Biden family conflicts as well.

Details suggesting that Democrats and pundits of the media may be overreaching again a senior administration official familiar with the transcript of this call between President Trump and his counterpart form Ukraine told me it's overblown to suggest there was any threat to national security any crime discussed. This top official adding \"The media better be careful with this, there's no there, there. It's in the President's interest to put the transcript of the call out and show that there was no quid pro quo\". Let's go through the time line. May 9th, \"The New York Times\" reports that Rudy Giuliani the President's Attorney was traveling to Ukraine to push for a Biden probe. That trip called off. June 13th, ABC news has an interview they released; it says the President told them he would be willing to listen if a foreign government offered political dirt. July 25th, the President has that call with the President of Ukraine newly sworn in to office. August 12th, the whistle-blower involved here files a complaint a couple weeks after the call. August 21st, \"The New York Times\" reports Giuliani is pushing again to get Ukraine to investigate Biden. August 28th about a week later, POLITICO reports the White House is slow-walking $250 million in aid to Ukraine but that money was released on September 12th. So the President today said in the Oval Office just like with Justice Brett Kavanaugh, to that story the media is going to wind up looking foolish."

All right, Peter there is a lot bubbling up today and even tonight on this. Now, you think that Trump is right to question Biden's dealings in the Ukraine but tonight what you're hearing is that, well, these conversations included - an implicit quid pro quo or floating the idea of a quid pro quo. Again, we know none of this but that's where you watch the other networks and reading online.

In the case of the Ukraine, he's being paid $83,000 a month by a corrupt Ukrainian oligarch who runs a company called Burisma and he's supposed to be advising them on natural gas regulatory issues. He has no background in the Ukraine he has no background in energy or natural gas. So the question is what is he being paid for? He's not being paid for his expertise. He has none. His father at this time is the point person on U.S. policy to Ukraine. The same thing is playing, taking place halfway around the world in China. Donald Trump is right to ask the question and to ask that there be an investigation to see what Hunter Biden was being paid for. Joe Biden has offered no answers. Hunter Biden when he is been asked about his has lied repeatedly and they've been proven lies by ABC news and other outlets. So these are the underlying questions. Look at what the whistle-blower says but the underlying issue here involves corruption at the highest scale. My point is look, if people want to defend the Bidens on this, get used to it because everybody in Washington is going to start cashing in this way."

So is Biden saying that \"The New York Times\" isn't a credible source now for the underlying concerns about this conflict of interest, Gregg? GREGG JARRETT, AUTHOR, \"WITCH HUNT\": Well, these other liners, oblivious with what \"The New York Times\" and the other news organizations have written about. You know, nobody in the media seems to be talking about the quid pro quo of Joe Biden. He was seen on camera bragging about how he gave the Ukrainian government six hours to fire a prosecutor or he would withhold up to I think it was a billion dollars of American aid to Ukraine. Now that's a quid pro quo. That's okay to the media. But President Trump makes a request or a demand to Ukraine to investigate a corruption there that may be connected to an American political official and with no quid pro quo and that is somehow, you know, an impeachable offense. Look, this whistle-blower in my judgment is not a whistle-blower at all. Forget the fact that he appears to be spying on an - an American spy spying on the President listening in on conversations. But he doesn't qualify as a whistle-blower under the statute. The statute confines these urgent concern complaints to misconduct and maladministration and abuse of power in the intelligence community. The President is not a member of the Intelligence Community in fact, they report to him. So I don't--"

One of the people said at the interview Mr. Trump did not mention a provision of foreign aid to Ukraine on the call said this person who didn't believe Mr. Trump offered the Ukrainian President any quid pro quo for his cooperation on any investigation. Now I imagine that was a White House source who brought that to the journal today. Everyone is trying to put their spin on this story. Going back to my original question to you, Peter, will or could this be a problem for the administration if the Democrats sink their teeth into this and say you were whining about Hillary and Fusion GPS now it looks like you guys are doing what you said they were doing during the 2016 campaign?"

This is a country that has a long history mired in corruption. So I think the way to do this, is the U.S. Department of Justice should work with the Ukrainians authorities to investigate precisely what went on.

Fox News Producers estimated that there were a few thousand in the nation's capitol today. \"The march for life\" back in January, 300,000 according to some estimates I go usually and there's hundreds of thousands every year.

All right, Jeffery, what we saw today is not all that different from what we've reported on in Venice Beach in L.A., Downtown L.A., even in Malibu. We see it in San Francisco. The Trump Administration is now getting involved on the EPA level. That's how dangerous this is. Now you have police officers apparently getting sick. They're concerned about bringing the diseases home to their families at night. What is your reaction to this? In this beautiful city of Seattle, it is such a gorgeous part of the country here. But this is just a heart break. JEFFREY LORD, AUTHOR, \"SWAMP WARS\": It's shocking, Laura. If the toxins that made that police officer ill, were found dumped in the Puget Sound at there in Seattle, all of these people in the streets today would be outraged. But no, no, no, it came from a homeless encampment. So they didn't want to do anything about it. I saw a picture that somebody showed me the other day they have an office in Manhattan. Outside the office was a woman nicely dressed with a bike and a lovely dog and a basket, lovingly wrapped? A few feet away from her this is in the middle of Manhattan with some poor soul sleeping on cardboard. His cloths in rags, his belongings scattered all around him. And the gentleman who showed me the picture said they care more about dogs than they do about people. That is the problem."

It goes on and on. There is a brewing rebellion here. It's the homeless activists and it's like the homeless industrial complex they call it.

That's good, because I think that when we're thinking about incarcerated people, we need to remember that they're just people, and everybody is one bad choice away from incarceration. You know what I'm saying, most people don't make those bad choices, but more and more we're seeing that they do. And if we put them in a box forever, then we're not allowing them to change and grow."

      "speaker": "FLEMING",
      "utterance": "It's really important to me because I feel like it's important to give back, and because I feel like it's important to give back even throughout my time here. I've made it a point to teach classes and do other things that allowed me the opportunity to help others that were in the beginning of their process. And so I know that my success is going to have a huge impact on the women coming in the future, because I'm the pilot program. So all eyes are on the people in the pilot program to see if they succeed. Is this really a zero percent recidivism rate? So it's definitely very important to me to be very successful so that, number one, they know that they can be successful too, and number two, so that society knows these kind of programs are worth investing in. CAR'DAE AVERY, \"THE LAST MILE\" GRADUATE: My name is Char'Dae Avery. I'm here to offer you an opportunity to be part of the next big thing."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "AVERY",
      "utterance": "I believe that they only way to rehabilitate people is if you give them an opportunity. If you put them in prison and you don't give them any opportunity to succeed, they won't succeed, because they don't know how. We need an example like The Last Mile that the Hoosiers provide. I feel like it's easy to fall into the environment around you. But as long as you have something like The Last Mile and you're grounding, you're humble, and your only goal is to become a better person and to make it home, I advise a lot of people to work on their self, work on their inner self, because you came in here by yourself. You're leaving out by yourself as a better person, and that's what we come to do."

      "speaker": "AVERY",
      "utterance": "The biggest misconception for me would be that they believe that we do nothing in here at all, just do our time. But as long as DLC and other people come together and keep providing us the opportunity to become the women that we are led to be before we made a mistake, I think that a lot of misconceptions will change, because we're not just inmates in prison. We are trying to better ourselves. But we do need help."
