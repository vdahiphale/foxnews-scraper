But, the Democratic primary hardcore left-wing voters support all that stuff. So there's a huge disconnect between mainstream consensus American thinking and Democrat primary voters that puts them in a huge bind. Notice how they've tabled their traditional bread and butter, kitchen table issues, like jobs, and wages, and trade, and manufacturing because the Trump economy is so hot. And all of the massive wage growth is taking place amongst the bottom half of wage earners, especially among blacks and Hispanics. It's the bottom up recovery as opposed to the Obama fake recovery what was mostly from the top. Now to Dana's point, the Democrats have not been able to recreate that Obama coalition. Hillary couldn't do it. They're trying to replicate it again. Minorities, young women, millennials, they're just not going to be able to do it.

So, my problem with the lottery is this, it's too consequential of a debate for the Democrats and for the American people to have it left up to chance. They should do it the way they did it last time with the top tier and the bottom tier. It's a good gimmick, but you risk not having two major dynamics.

Democrats don't want a count, an accurate count of illegal immigrants because, precisely, what you said, Juan, the census counts everybody in order to distribute power in Washington, D.C. And Nancy Pelosi is projecting when she says that it's Trump that what certain voters when, actually, Democrats don't want an accurate count because then it will display how many illegal immigrants are being counted for Democratic leadership and Democratic positions in Washington, D.C., because most of them live in blue places. So for Democrats this isn't about racism or about making sure people answer the census because they're scared.

This is our A-block, right? It's not war, it's not pestilence, you know. It's not people dying in the streets. It's about the census. But the big thing here that bugs me, and you guys actually argued this quite coherently, it's just the race smear, OK? And so counting now is racist. Is a counting racist? Is count basis racist? When someone gets an I.D. -- gets I.D. for beer, is that racist? If you're filling out a job application is that racist? Any time information is asked, well, that now be considered racist? This is -- it's so overdone now that it's becoming background noise. And I will make a deal.

Wow, where did these guys come from, a MAGA rally? Both are vocal black Democrats, yet I can't wait for the media to paint them as white supremacist. So I applaud this because right now the sensible Democratic Party is in hiding, terrified to the looniest voices, an unlikable mess of identities screamers and Antifa sympathizers who throw milkshakes for exercise. Maybe these two Johnsons will lead the way for others Dems to stand up and shout stop being crazy. If only crazy people would listen. But delusions make you deaf to sense. Right now, the Democrats are approaching cult status. One that rejects all mainstreaming, shrinking in size as they alienate everyone who isn't woke enough. For the new left, any deviation from resist makes you complicit and evil, just being born can make you a racist. But this strategy is for losers, meaning if only four people by your tiny definition or woke, that means the remaining 340 million aren't. And if you wish to condemn the un-woke, say goodbye to all of them. You'll be members of the world's smallest party, one that no one wants to attend. You know, Dana, if I were a team sport ideologue, I would have trashed the Johnsons, right? Because I don't want the Dems to listen to them. I want them to keep going in the identity path.

If you're a Democrat running for president, you can't win the general with socialism, but you can't win the primary without it. And here's the conundrum, 60 percent of Americans oppose giving health insurance to illegals, 60 percent oppose eliminating private health care, 60 percent oppose reparations, and an overwhelming majority oppose gun confiscation and sanctuary cities. But, the Democratic primary hardcore left-wing voters support all that stuff. So there's a huge disconnect between mainstream consensus American thinking and Democrat primary voters that puts them in a huge bind. Notice how they've tabled their traditional bread and butter, kitchen table issues, like jobs, and wages, and trade, and manufacturing because the Trump economy is so hot. And all of the massive wage growth is taking place amongst the bottom half of wage earners, especially among blacks and Hispanics. It's the bottom up recovery as opposed to the Obama fake recovery what was mostly from the top. Now to Dana's point, the Democrats have not been able to recreate that Obama coalition. Hillary couldn't do it. They're trying to replicate it again. Minorities, young women, millennials, they're just not going to be able to do it. And so, I just think Trump's got this locked down to the max and borrowing an unforeseen disaster, it's reelection in a landslide."

So, my problem with the lottery is this, it's too consequential of a debate for the Democrats and for the American people to have it left up to chance. They should do it the way they did it last time with the top tier and the bottom tier. It's a good gimmick, but you risk not having two major dynamics. What if we don't get to see Kamala-Biden round two. What if we don't get to see Liz Warren go up against Joe this time, because remember she got shut out last time.
