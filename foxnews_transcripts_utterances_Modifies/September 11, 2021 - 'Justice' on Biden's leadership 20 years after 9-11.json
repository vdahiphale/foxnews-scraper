We will never forget. And now to my open. There is no other day on the American calendar that reminds us how vulnerable even the most powerful nation on Earth can be. September 11 -- 9/11 -- memories from that beautiful sunny day in 2001 are still haunting and palpable. America was injured and in shock. Then our President came forward to speak to us.",

      "sentences": "After that, we were able to stand tall and united to confront the massive violence and hate from radical Muslim extremists who came after us in our own country, our homeland -- to kill us. I remember that day. As DA, I was in New York City for scheduled meetings. My security detail insisted I leave the city immediately and returned to Westchester. All the phones were down. Only police radios worked. People were desperate looking for loved ones. My own daughter, Kiki, was with the Rye Country Day class that day visiting The Pentagon. No one could reach any of the children. I called through a police phone. I called Police Commissioner Bernie Kerik, and hours later, we were able to tell the headmaster at that school and the families that all of those kids, all of those children were fine. I set up a center and the DA's office for families of the victims. We collected DNA and offered counseling. We offered help from the Surrogates Court. The family members who came every day, looking worse and worse as time went on started to realize that their loved ones were not going to be found, that they weren't coming home, confirmed by the hundreds of empty cars left at train stations throughout Westchester. Yes, they took much from us that day, and the ripple effect is still with us. What have we learned in 20 years? Are we any safer now? Are we still vulnerable? Sadly, I believe we're more vulnerable. There is a deficit of leadership today, the kind we need to vote protect and chart a course for America's safety. You don't even have to look at a poll to know instinctively that only 39 percent of Americans approve of Joe Biden, his lies, his ineptitude, and his determination to choose politics and ideology over the safety of America and her citizens. It is evident day after day. On this, one of the most sacred days on the American calendar, we are left with one of the most feeble, feckless, confused, and inept Presidents. One day, he says we won't leave Americans behind, and on the next, proudly admits he lied. And since he left only 10 percent of the Americans behind, then sadly, his brainwashed minions come out and stick up for his lies.",

Are you just stupid/ Now, we have to rely on real American veterans and heroes going into Afghanistan, risking their lives yet again to get Americans out. And while the administration tells us the Taliban is kinder and gentler, they shoot women who don't cover their faces in the street, and they go door to door looking to shoot anyone working with Americans, and they beat reporters. Meanwhile, Democrats like Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib announced a resolution on the eve of 9/11, no less, to condemn the hate, discrimination, and racism, and xenophobia that Arab Muslims and Sikh communities across America face. Lies, constantly, come out of our White House. Days after Americans were incensed about the death of our 13 service members, the Biden puppets decided to tell us they launched a drone to kill our enemies. In reality, that drone killed seven children. They hit the wrong car. They lied to us and said they took out Taliban facilitators. Look, the satellites we have are so sophisticated, you can read a license plate from outer space. The same people who allowed terrorists with suicide vests to be frisked are the same people who targeted the wrong car killing seven innocent children. And this administration stands in front of the American people and lie and say they went after the enemy that killed our servicemen? Despicable. But despite that, you and I have to keep fighting for the America we know and love. In honor of people like Todd Beamer who saved countless lives by foiling al-Qaeda's plot to crash Flight 93 into another U.S. target, the White House or the Capitol Building. Listen to this from the father about the last conversation Todd had with his wife. DAVID BEAMER, DAD OF FLIGHT 93 HERO TODD BEAMER: So, Todd was able to have that conversation with her, provided reconnaissance information, prayed together and asked her to send his love to his family. And he said we're probably not going to make it out of this. But then his last words, you know, \"Are you guys ready? Let's roll.\"",

I am so tired of all this woke nonsense, the creation of division. Our own so-called Commander-in-Chief pitting groups against each other. I'm tired of defunding police and wasting my time and energy trying to fight those who hate America and hate our flag. It is time for us to drown their voices out. It is time for the silent majority to stand up at the Star Spangled Banner and decry those who take a knee. I want to live in a country that understands that we are lucky to be in this experiment of democracy together. And no one -- no one can ever divide us. And that's my open. Let me know what you think of my Facebook and Twitter, #JudgeJeanine. Here now with reaction to my open and much more as we remember the 20th anniversary of September 11th, retired U.S. Army Ranger Jake Bequette and FOX Nation host and investigative journalist, Lara Logan. Thank you both for being here tonight. The way I see it, guys, what we had was the Taliban running Afghanistan in 2001, and here we are 20 years later, the Taliban is running Afghanistan armed to the teeth with all of the military supplies that we left them and now, we're trying to bring them into nation saying they're cooperative and business like in their negotiations. I'll start with you first, what say you, Jake, about all this?",

I was said. I was angry, and I wanted revenge. And I think the first seed there was planted of the call for me to serve our country in uniform. But, you know, fast forward 20 years, we have a feckless incompetent administration, that you're exactly right is making us less safe than ever before. He treats the Taliban as an equal regime, which of course, they are not. They are a terrorist organization. Our enemies -- China, North Korea, Iran, the Russians -- they see this weakness and incompetence and fecklessness on the international stage and it makes America less safe. But I think more importantly, we are less safe at home domestically. This country tragically is full of Marxist radicals who want to destroy the very foundations of this nation. They want to root it out. They want to destroy it root and stem because every Marxist regime has to start from scratch. There can be no history, there only has to be a future. And so it's a very dangerous time for us in America today. I was just at a Razorback football game, there were great signs of unity. I hope that continues. But look, it's a very dangerous time for all Americans, both domestically and internationally.",

And one of your tweets today says that \"Every Islamic terrorist is celebrating this victory over the U.S. while Afghan men and women are now left to fight this evil alone. It's hard to decide who's more evil. The terrorists murdering their way through Afghanistan right now, or you and those responsible for this?\" Lara, who is \"you\"? LARA LOGAN, FOX NATION HOST, \"LARA LOGAN HAS NO AGENDA\": Well, you is \"The Washington Post\" journalists who have, you know, who wrote these sort of fawning profiles on Joe Biden today. And you know, citing the moment that he knew about all of this and how he vowed that they would never win. And, you know, Judge, the thing that I just cannot -- I just cannot understand how we can be doing this. I cannot understand how you can have Afghan women beaten, and some of them murdered, how you can have your enemies, the people responsible for 9/11, right, on this very day, they're going through the Panjshir Valley in Afghanistan, and they are taking 12- year-old boys and above, and they're disappearing. These are the people that have extended a hand of friendship to the United States for decades, right, without them, nothing we've done over there would have been possible. And as Jake will tell you, you know, what you've done here is obliterate your human intelligence capability, because nobody trusts the United States anymore. And why would they? We literally took the lists of American citizens, and also green card holders, and special interest visa holders, and any other Afghan who worked with us and was vulnerable and at risk. And we gave it to the Afghan al- Qaeda to hunt them down and murder them. And then every time a handful of Americans gets on a plane for the theater of the Taliban, we all celebrate. What we've done is given victory to al- Qaeda on the 20th anniversary of 9/11. And I don't believe it's incompetence, because there's way too many indications that we know exactly what we are doing. Every standard operating procedure from whether it's disintegrating machines that are supposed to destroy our data, to the attack planes, and all the military equipment that we have in place. There's 400 million things that we could be doing right now to change the outcome. We do not have to leave weapons in the hands of the terrorists responsible for 9/11.",

And Jake is right, we have never been more vulnerable. We've never been more isolated. And for some insane reason. We're breaking the law negotiating with terrorists, supporting terrorists. We were even going to give the Air Force any sensitive Intelligence capabilities that are in Uzbekistan right now from Afghan pilots who fled. We agreed to give those to the Taliban.

I had to -- you couldn't get into the city at that point. I was able to get my radio show up and running, thanks to a Garden City radio station. We have five different stations, they got up, and by the way, that's something radio stations never do and they did it on 9/11 because it was that important for all of us to be on the air. And look, I lost friends that day. I was a pitcher in high school, the kid that was the catcher for all the years I pitched, him and his brother, they worked for Cantor Fitzgerald, they both died that day. I see his wife and church with these, you know, three or four beautiful daughters every single week, and it broke my heart.

I remember that day. As DA, I was in New York City for scheduled meetings. My security detail insisted I leave the city immediately and returned to Westchester. All the phones were down. Only police radios worked. People were desperate looking for loved ones. My own daughter, Kiki, was with the Rye Country Day class that day visiting The Pentagon. No one could reach any of the children. I called through a police phone. I called Police Commissioner Bernie Kerik, and hours later, we were able to tell the headmaster at that school and the families that all of those kids, all of those children were fine. I set up a center and the DA's office for families of the victims. We collected DNA and offered counseling. We offered help from the Surrogates Court. The family members who came every day, looking worse and worse as time went on started to realize that their loved ones were not going to be found, that they weren't coming home, confirmed by the hundreds of empty cars left at train stations throughout Westchester. Yes, they took much from us that day, and the ripple effect is still with us. What have we learned in 20 years? Are we any safer now? Are we still vulnerable? Sadly, I believe we're more vulnerable. There is a deficit of leadership today, the kind we need to vote protect and chart a course for America's safety. You don't even have to look at a poll to know instinctively that only 39 percent of Americans approve of Joe Biden, his lies, his ineptitude, and his determination to choose politics and ideology over the safety of America and her citizens. It is evident day after day. On this, one of the most sacred days on the American calendar, we are left with one of the most feeble, feckless, confused, and inept Presidents. One day, he says we won't leave Americans behind, and on the next, proudly admits he lied. And since he left only 10 percent of the Americans behind, then sadly, his brainwashed minions come out and stick up for his lies."

Are you just stupid/ Now, we have to rely on real American veterans and heroes going into Afghanistan, risking their lives yet again to get Americans out. And while the administration tells us the Taliban is kinder and gentler, they shoot women who don't cover their faces in the street, and they go door to door looking to shoot anyone working with Americans, and they beat reporters. Meanwhile, Democrats like Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib announced a resolution on the eve of 9/11, no less, to condemn the hate, discrimination, and racism, and xenophobia that Arab Muslims and Sikh communities across America face. Lies, constantly, come out of our White House. Days after Americans were incensed about the death of our 13 service members, the Biden puppets decided to tell us they launched a drone to kill our enemies. In reality, that drone killed seven children. They hit the wrong car. They lied to us and said they took out Taliban facilitators. Look, the satellites we have are so sophisticated, you can read a license plate from outer space. The same people who allowed terrorists with suicide vests to be frisked are the same people who targeted the wrong car killing seven innocent children. And this administration stands in front of the American people and lie and say they went after the enemy that killed our servicemen? Despicable. But despite that, you and I have to keep fighting for the America we know and love. In honor of people like Todd Beamer who saved countless lives by foiling al-Qaeda's plot to crash Flight 93 into another U.S. target, the White House or the Capitol Building. Listen to this from the father about the last conversation Todd had with his wife. DAVID BEAMER, DAD OF FLIGHT 93 HERO TODD BEAMER: So, Todd was able to have that conversation with her, provided reconnaissance information, prayed together and asked her to send his love to his family.

Here now with reaction to my open and much more as we remember the 20th anniversary of September 11th, retired U.S. Army Ranger Jake Bequette and FOX Nation host and investigative journalist, Lara Logan. Thank you both for being here tonight. The way I see it, guys, what we had was the Taliban running Afghanistan in 2001, and here we are 20 years later, the Taliban is running Afghanistan armed to the teeth with all of the military supplies that we left them and now, we're trying to bring them into nation saying they're cooperative and business like in their negotiations. I'll start with you first, what say you, Jake, about all this?"

      "utterance": "Well, first of all, it's a somber day and reflecting about these days, it's very interesting for me, and many Americans of my generation who joined the military after 9/11, I think, I speak for a lot of us, you know, watching those events unfold as a 12-year-old in seventh grade. I was said. I was angry, and I wanted revenge. And I think the first seed there was planted of the call for me to serve our country in uniform. But, you know, fast forward 20 years, we have a feckless incompetent administration, that you're exactly right is making us less safe than ever before. He treats the Taliban as an equal regime, which of course, they are not. They are a terrorist organization. Our enemies -- China, North Korea, Iran, the Russians -- they see this weakness and incompetence and fecklessness on the international stage and it makes America less safe. But I think more importantly, we are less safe at home domestically. This country tragically is full of Marxist radicals who want to destroy the very foundations of this nation. They want to root it out. They want to destroy it root and stem because every Marxist regime has to start from scratch. There can be no history, there only has to be a future. And so it's a very dangerous time for us in America today. I was just at a Razorback football game, there were great signs of unity. I hope that continues. But look, it's a very dangerous time for all Americans, both domestically and internationally."

And one of your tweets today says that \"Every Islamic terrorist is celebrating this victory over the U.S. while Afghan men and women are now left to fight this evil alone. It's hard to decide who's more evil. The terrorists murdering their way through Afghanistan right now, or you and those responsible for this?\" Lara, who is \"you\"? LARA LOGAN, FOX NATION HOST, \"LARA LOGAN HAS NO AGENDA\": Well, you is \"The Washington Post\" journalists who have, you know, who wrote these sort of fawning profiles on Joe Biden today. And you know, citing the moment that he knew about all of this and how he vowed that they would never win. And, you know, Judge, the thing that I just cannot -- I just cannot understand how we can be doing this. I cannot understand how you can have Afghan women beaten, and some of them murdered, how you can have your enemies, the people responsible for 9/11, right, on this very day, they're going through the Panjshir Valley in Afghanistan, and they are taking 12- year-old boys and above, and they're disappearing. These are the people that have extended a hand of friendship to the United States for decades, right, without them, nothing we've done over there would have been possible. And as Jake will tell you, you know, what you've done here is obliterate your human intelligence capability, because nobody trusts the United States anymore. And why would they? We literally took the lists of American citizens, and also green card holders, and special interest visa holders, and any other Afghan who worked with us and was vulnerable and at risk. And we gave it to the Afghan al- Qaeda to hunt them down and murder them. And then every time a handful of Americans gets on a plane for the theater of the Taliban, we all celebrate. What we've done is given victory to al- Qaeda on the 20th anniversary of 9/11. And I don't believe it's incompetence, because there's way too many indications that we know exactly what we are doing. Every standard operating procedure from whether it's disintegrating machines that are supposed to destroy our data, to the attack planes, and all the military equipment that we have in place. There's 400 million things that we could be doing right now to change the outcome. We do not have to leave weapons in the hands of the terrorists responsible for 9/11."

The democratically elected leader of Afghanistan, the acting President Amrullah Saleh is still fighting today, and we have chosen to side with terrorists, and we are intending to fund them with U.S. taxpayer money, which is the greatest disservice to every American. And Jake is right, we have never been more vulnerable. We've never been more isolated. And for some insane reason. We're breaking the law negotiating with terrorists, supporting terrorists. We were even going to give the Air Force any sensitive Intelligence capabilities that are in Uzbekistan right now from Afghan pilots who fled. We agreed to give those to the Taliban. Not just leave the weapons they have in their hands, but give them more. So our own forces are equipped with that technology.

I remember being the DA, being in New York City at the time, my security detail telling me, we have to go back because the second plane hit the World Trade Center.

My best friend from third grade, John Gomez calls me and says, \"Are you watching this,\" I'm like, \"What?\" And I go home and like everybody else, I turn on the TV and just watched in horror. I had to -- you couldn't get into the city at that point. I was able to get my radio show up and running, thanks to a Garden City radio station. We have five different stations, they got up, and by the way, that's something radio stations never do and they did it on 9/11 because it was that important for all of us to be on the air. And look, I lost friends that day. I was a pitcher in high school, the kid that was the catcher for all the years I pitched, him and his brother, they worked for Cantor Fitzgerald, they both died that day. I see his wife and church with these, you know, three or four beautiful daughters every single week, and it broke my heart. It changed me because as the 9/11 Commission Report said, and I don't think I could say it any better. They were at war with us and we weren't at war with them. And now, when you look at -- it's almost surreal where we are today, 20 years later, and Joe Biden is saying just a couple of weeks, oh, no, no, I will stay as long as we have Americans and then abandoning our fellow Americans behind enemy lines with the Taliban. And now, of course, the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan will be a safe harbor for terrorists to plot, plan, and scheme."

Unity of purpose, too. And part of that was getting the people that did this and making sure it never happens again. And I mean, I'll never forget. I mean, Campbell's Soup for example, they opened up the soup lines. You know, restaurants were feeding any first responder that was down there for free. Everybody got on board. The whole country united together and it was a good period for the country in that sense. Good came out of the evil. But we've taken our eye off the ball, and now we've abandoned Afghanistan, and that's where now we've left it. Beyond the fact that I never in my lifetime, Judge, we've been friends a long time. I never, ever, ever in my lifetime, thought we'd ever leave our fellow Americans hostage behind enemy lines, their lives based on the whims of known terrorists. This will now become a safe harbor for the next plotting, planning, scheming of the next 9/11. That's just a fact."

They're saying we should avoid placing blame and leave out the gruesome details, because it might lead to extreme nationalism, according to college students.

I'll be the first to say that. But as the great Barry Farber -- late great, Barry Farber, one of the great pioneers of talk radio would always say, there's never been a country on the face of this Earth that accumulated more power, abused it less -- I add to that and used its power to advance the human condition, and we share everything with the world."

The DoD was telling State all along during this drawdown, Blinken, yes, we're drawing down, start moving these people out. And the State Department failed to move.

Well, there were 90,000 applications pending when the President of the United States said, oh, they don't want to come here. I mean, it's all a farce. It's a lie.

The California election is on Tuesday, and Gavin Newsom is saying that the Republicans are weaponizing the process. Why couldn't they wait until the election next year?

And polls for what they're worth, you know, I mean, they are not worth very much on the state level particularly -- appear to show Newsom surviving in this deep blue state at this point, but perhaps Democrats are seeing and sensing something different in terms of their own internal polling or what they're feeling on the ground because why else would every other major Democrat fly to California to stump for him? You have Biden, Harris, and Obama. Are Gary Hart and John Evers going to show up? You have expecting JFK and FDR to pull up Patrick Swayze and do the same, right? So, win or lose, Judge, the fact that the Democrats have to spend this much time, this much money, this bunch of political capital to defend the state Joe Biden won by something like I don't know, three points shows you how dire things are for the blue team at this point, Judge."

But the reason why the Democratic big boys are coming in is because they are afraid, Judge. This is a potential tidal wave, a perfect storm, a chance to get rid of one of the most incompetent governors ever. And it was not just by Republicans. Democrats and Independents signed this petition. And I'll tell you right now, the problem is that Newsom is scared. Larry Elder represents the best and the brightest of taking over California in a deep blue state. And you know what, Judge, I want to be very clear, the most racist, racist political campaign ever. Larry Elder is a black man. A black man, and yet a woman in a white gorilla suit assaulted his staff and threw things at him. If he was a Democrat, they would be calling it a hate crime. There was no police report. This woman is still out there and what the Democrats are afraid -- I want people to understand that the Democrats believe they own black people, and they are afraid that a black Republican, destroy their narrative, and that they are afraid that blacks will follow Larry Elder. I left the Democratic Party. The Democratic Party do not own black and brown people, and black and brown people need to wake up and leave that party. It is corrupt."

God forbid this kid from the hood who went to public school breaks this Jedi mind tricks stranglehold the Democrats have over black and brown voters. They are so afraid.\" And I think there's a lot of truth to that, because Larry Elder was doing very well. And you know, when you see a white woman wearing a gorilla mask, which in itself is something that's outrageous, and then they are cursing at Larry Elder, and then when someone goes over to tell her to stop throwing eggs at Larry Elder, she punches him. It's like there is no law and order. They have no values. It's about them, only them."

The Apocalypse in terms of the media coverage would be over whelming. Right? But of course, we're barely saying anything about it. It is \"The Silence of the Lambs\" at this point. Let's talk about priorities for a second, shall we? Because the President of the United States will travel to California, as you said on Monday to speak on behalf of Gavin Newsom at a campaign stop. But Joe Biden could not be bothered to give us a live speech today to honor nearly 3,000 dead -- the firemen, the police, the EMTs, the volunteers who exposed themselves to God knows what in the case of New York when the fires and smoke were prevalent for weeks. Instead, you have the President, what appears to be an edited video released on September 10th, the day before. How can any sane American Democrat, Republican, Independent, apolitical -- I don't care -- isn't shaking their head right now and saying this is so shameful. It's embarrassing. Defend the absentee President at your own peril, Judge, because how he didn't give a speech today because I guess, a prompter wasn't available. You know, that says -- that speaks volumes, Judge."

He was shaming people that won't take the vaccine and warning that there are risks to those who have the vaccine, which isn't true because the vaccine works. And the one thing, if the vaccine works, by the way, you're not going to go in the hospital even if you encounter someone that hasn't been vaccinated, right? He made it all about shaming and arrogance and looking down at people. The one thing that I was looking for that he didn't say that's really important is to keep schools open, Judge, let's break news tonight, you need a re a free rapid test in every household in America, so we can see if your child has COVID or not. We don't want them in school, if they have COVID. You know where they're doing that, the National Health Service in the United Kingdom of all places, and guess where those tests are coming from? The very country that's gamed us from the beginning here, China makes those tests, Judge, and these tests need to be here and we need to make them in America and they need to be free in every household so we could tell if a kid is sick or not. Yes, I encouraged mask. Of course, everyone should be vaccinated to protect those around you. But as usual, purely political speech, Judge, nothing medical or public health about it."

The ones that they're selling in the pharmacies cost too much. So he said, okay, we're going to put some money towards them, but I want them to be purely free. That's what the Defense Production Act is for, for free. And by the way, you're right, China is gaming the system, they made a crummy vaccine that they tried to push around the world. Luckily, we caught on to that. The vaccines that were made here in the United States, Moderna vaccine way better than what came out of China. The same with the Pfizer. Again, China has throughout not only caused a pandemic, but also has tried to benefit off of it. Free testing in every household in America, rapid test to see if your child is sick with COVID or has been exposed to COVID or not. That will keep the schools open, Judge."
