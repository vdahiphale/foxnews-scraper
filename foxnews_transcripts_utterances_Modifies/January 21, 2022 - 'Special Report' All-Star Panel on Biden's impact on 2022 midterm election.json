Still a long way to go, but if you look at the Real Clear Politics average of the direction of the country, when that question is asked, right direction 27 percent, wrong track 64 percent as of right now. What about this, where things stand politically? Let's bring in our panel, Josh Kraushaar, he's the politics editor for \"National Journal,\" Kimberley Strassel, a member of the editorial board at \"The Wall Street Journal,\" and Jason Riley, \"Wall Street Journal\" columnist and senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute. Kimberley, what about the position of the White House, where things stand, and if you are a Democrat in a district that is, let's say, a suburb of big city and you are trying to hold on to your seat, do you want President Biden to campaign for you or not? KIMBERLEY STRASSEL, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\": Well, first of all, the strategy is now coming into focus, and you saw that in the clip that you just played, which is that traditionally, as we know, midterms tend to be referendums on White House performance. The president there is desperately now trying to instead make this about Republicans and claiming that they don't have any ideas. I think the problem for those moderates that you mentioned, those suburban representatives, is that voters are looking at the economy, inflation. It's impossible for them to not view this as a referendum on the presidency. And right now, no, I don't think most of them would want him in their district given polling numbers and given the recent failures the Senate had in getting his agenda across the line.",

JOSH KRAUSHAAR, \"NATIONAL JOURNAL\": Yes, and I would also add that President Biden had an opportunity to reset his agenda, to talk about the issues that most concern Americans, the economy, COVID, rising crime, and he instead chose to essentially double down on his first year agenda by saying he's going to break up the social spending package and try to get it passed in the new year. It was not a reset. It was a double down. And that is his biggest problem. You are not going to have Democrats in swing districts and swing states that are going to want to campaign with him if he is not talking about the issues that their constituents are caring most about. So the press conference was an opportunity to reset the messaging and it doesn't seem like this White House still really gets the message that a lot of voters are sending.",

JASON RILEY, COLUMNIST, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\": Well, I would agree this is a search for a message. Things aren't going well. It's obvious. His approval rating is down. The response to COVID that he had hoped would happen has not happened. Inflation is going up, his economic agenda is going nowhere. And so I think what we saw, or what we are seeing is him reverting to the sort of tired tactics that the left reverts to, which is identity politics and racial division, and that's why we see this double down on voting rights acts and this pretending that the black franchise is in jeopardy. And that's what the reverting to. This is the new shiny objects that they want people to pay attention to, even though I don't think there is any basis in reality here. We have seen voter, both registration and turnout, going up for decades among black, and in some case it's exceeded the turn out rate among whites, even in the deep south. So, this is a fake issue, but this is all they have to run on. When Democrats are pushed into a corner, they play the racial division card, and that's what they are playing here with voting rights because so many other things on their agenda aren't going well.",

And now we have Biden essentially with no real plan now, lots of questions about why he is sitting around. This seems to be a crew that thinks everything can be solved in diplomacy room. But the president needs to be leading here, uniting Europeans and letting Russia know that the resolve exists to not let them do whatever they want in Ukraine, and that should be just as important as making a plan for getting our people out.",
