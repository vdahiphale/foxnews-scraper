Remember the sticker that says \"Objects in the side-view mirror are closer than they appear.\" convexity offers a large field of view that makes the objects look smaller. Trump is the opposite. In that rearview mirror, the larger field of vision is telling you something else. It's the Dems that are getting smaller, not him because they really can't do a better job than Trump. He kind of aced the test and they're trying not to flunk it. In that mirror, here is where Trump comes out ahead. First, North Korea in four years what Obama deemed the most pressing threat to the incoming administration now isn't even on Biden's to-do list. Why? Did Trump solve the most pressing problem before the pandemic? The vaccines. Their effectiveness is being called miraculous by the press. Who pushed that forward? Did Trump solve the most pressing problem, which is the pandemic before Biden even emerged from the basement? The Middle East peace deals. If this happened under Obama, the CNN Washington Bureau would be drowning in its own tears of joy. The economy, if Trump hadn't ushered in such a historic economic machine, would we have enjoyed the pandemic with unemployment dropping now to around six percent with a GDP roaring back? Could it be the tax breaks? And deregulation helped? China. Who saw them coming first while D.C. cronies and corporations cozied up to these communists? One orange visionary was yelling, what about our workers? What about our country? And who exposed fake news for what it was and shall never be the same? So it's amazing looking back and it is funny looking forward. One thing is for certain, the media isn't looking anywhere, except at their own navels.

A serious existential risk Donald Trump continues to deny because he hates clean air, water and birds. Speaking of birds, bird watchers have spotted a once in a lifetime rare half male, half female cardinal and we are sure, if Donald Trump would have his way, this bird would never be able to serve in the military or be allowed to marry another half male half female cardinal because he is a heartless transphobic monster. Bruce Springsteen has been fined $450.00 for drinking tequila in a national park, but after having Donald Trump as President for four years, shouldn't all of us be allowed to drink tequila in a national park? I mean, seriously, he is really evil. My life is a wreck. I've been drinking tequila since noon. And it's all on that horrible jerk. From Washington, I'm Anderson Lemon, All Trump News."

Remember the sticker that says \"Objects in the side-view mirror are closer than they appear.\" convexity offers a large field of view that makes the objects look smaller. Trump is the opposite. In that rearview mirror, the larger field of vision is telling you something else. It's the Dems that are getting smaller, not him because they really can't do a better job than Trump. He kind of aced the test and they're trying not to flunk it. In that mirror, here is where Trump comes out ahead. First, North Korea in four years what Obama deemed the most pressing threat to the incoming administration now isn't even on Biden's to-do list. Why? Did Trump solve the most pressing problem before the pandemic? The vaccines. Their effectiveness is being called miraculous by the press. Who pushed that forward? Did Trump solve the most pressing problem, which is the pandemic before Biden even emerged from the basement? The Middle East peace deals. If this happened under Obama, the CNN Washington Bureau would be drowning in its own tears of joy. The economy, if Trump hadn't ushered in such a historic economic machine, would we have enjoyed the pandemic with unemployment dropping now to around six percent with a GDP roaring back? Could it be the tax breaks? And deregulation helped? China. Who saw them coming first while D.C. cronies and corporations cozied up to these communists? One orange visionary was yelling, what about our workers? What about our country? And who exposed fake news for what it was and shall never be the same? So it's amazing looking back and it is funny looking forward. One thing is for certain, the media isn't looking anywhere, except at their own navels. Their next headline, \"Belly button lint,\" another shameful legacy of Trump."

Yes, I've been there. Meanwhile, there's another brand name slurping from the woke trough. Mr. Potato Head is now dropping the Mister like a hot potato -- you like that? That way, according to \"Fast Company,\" a girl potato can wear pants and a boy potato might wear earrings. But after some uproar, Hasbro now claims the Mr. Potato Head character isn't changing at all, but going forward, the new brand name will simply be Potato Head, which oddly is a common sex act in Dublin.

Of course, we know that coronavirus can also spread other ways through droplets in the air. I wonder if glasses provide any protection against that. We sent Kat out on the street to find out."
