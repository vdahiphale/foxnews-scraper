      "sentences": "Welcome to a special edition of “Hannity.” Tonight, we're holding the media in this country accountable as I sit down with the great one, Mark Levin, for an entire hour. His brand new book, \"Unfreedom of the Press.\" And we're going to take a journey that starts at this nation's founding, remembering the once great press tradition in America and how it ended up becoming nothing more than an extension of the Democratic Party and all things left wing.  We'll uncover what went wrong, how the media fell so far so fast. We'll be exposing every hoax, every lie, all of the besmirchment this media mob has told to smear a duly elected president of the United States and just do nothing but divide this country. From the Russian collusion delusion, to Covington, to ignoring the biggest abuse of power corruption scandal in our nation's history, we're going to take it apart piece-by-piece.  We will expose how they've abandoned the great tradition of freedom of the press in this country, choosing to act as nothing but partisan hacks rather than serious investigators, choosing to put fake news narratives over facts for years at a time, choosing to smear anyone and everyone who dares calls out their lack of ethics, their lack of objectivity.  Remember, the hate Trump media mob and the biggest names on the left never thought it would get to this point. Never thought President Trump would pull off what was one of the biggest political upsets of American history and deliver success after success, record after record, helping the forgotten men and women of this country. Take a look.",

They moved them from time to time because the British were trying to hunt them down. They pushed these ideas. Thomas Paine was a great pamphleteer. There were many, many others. And what happened is people would read these, they talk about them at their pubs, at their homes, at their dinner table, and word would spread. Common sense, Thomas Paine's pamphlet, it's estimated 120,000 people read it. It's a country of about 2 million people. And by the time it was over, half a million people had read it. It had enormous influence.   Why is it important? Because back then, what if our press -- they didn't call themselves a press, what did the press do? Promoted liberty, individualism, representative government, private property rights, low taxes and so forth.  And then from that period, soon there after, we had a party press. And it was brutal. And the press would at least be transparent. They would identify with the political party, with the candidate, with the cause. And Thomas Jefferson and John Adams would really duke it out. Some of the people in the press were on the payroll of the political party and so forth. But they were all open about it. Again, is it very, very ugly?  Then you move into a period of -- and that lasted from about 1780 to the Civil War. Let's jump forward to the early part of the last century, the progressive movement. Well, they devoured much of our government, their ideology did. It does today. They devoured these so-called media at the time, too. They wanted to professionalize them. They wanted standards.  They said, we needed to be more objective. But, they said, we need to -- you know, we need to have a handful of elites, a handful of people who understand the country, who understand the world through which all of this will be laundered, which is the way they view government too. The people are stupid, the people are plebes, they're too busy, or they're too ignorant. Let us tell them what to think.  Today's media, that's their heritage, they've taken it a step further. They're social activists. That's what they are.  They're being taught this in journalism school. It's not enough to report the facts. It's not enough to be objective, they argue, whatever that means. We have to push an agenda. Some of them are out of the closet and they admit that we need to push the liberal and progressive agenda. Some of them, when you challenge them, they say you're attacking freedom of the press. And they pretend that they're still objective when they're not.  Survey after survey, study after study shows half of the country, the vast majority of Republicans, the vast majority of people who lean conservative or are conservative, do not trust the media. There's a reason for it. Another half do. Democrats, liberals think the media is pretty darn good. So, when you lose the trust of half of the country, you're not doing your job. And they're not doing their job. They play to a niche. Even the word \"objective\" is debated. Do we mean objective in the terms of the thinking of the journalists? Do we mean objective in terms of the process? So they pretty much surrendered that. You know, a couple of months ago, Chuck Todd on \"Meet the Press\", he declared that manmade climate change is a fact. And we're not going to allow deniers -- we're not going to allow deniers on \"Meet the Press.\"  He's more than the host of \"Meet the Press\". He's the chief political guru for the entire NBC network.",

And he has declared we're not going to allow that on our show. So, that demonstrates to you, he's pushing the agenda. This whole Russia collusion thing, what I write in the book also, Sean, is the notion of news versus propaganda versus pseudo events. The president of the United States is really on to something. When he talks about fake news, there was a brilliant historian, the University of Chicago, Daniel Boorstin, who he became the head of the Library of Congress, he wrote a book on pseudo events. He was talking about the news among other things. They create their own reality, by how they choose events, how they create events, how journalists promote themselves through drama, you can see with Jim Acosta who creates conditions where the focus is on him and not -- this is an enormous disservice to the American people.   Pseudo news, Russia collusion with the Trump campaign. We have 2 1/2 years of pseudo -- as the president calls it, fake news. And pseudo news requires more pseudo news. So, obstruction, a pseudo event, it didn't really happen, but they claim it. Seven hundred former prosecutors writing a letter, all liberals no doubt, there are thousands of former prosecutors. Another pseudo event. Phony subpoenas that are intended to gather information that won't do the American people any good, that have nothing to do with congressional oversight. Pseudo events. This impeachment debate, absolutely phony. Another pseudo event. Meanwhile, there's all kinds of events taking place in the world and in this country that are not being covered by news organizations. There are some exceptions. But in the aggregate, this is the condition we face. This is an enormous disservice to the American people.  Remember this. The First Amendment belongs to the American people. The Bill of Rights belongs to the American people. The Constitution belongs to the American people. When they say Donald Trump is like a dictator because he calls the media or media outlet or media person the enemy of the people, they have no idea what they're talking about. Donald Trump points out, questions them, is harsh in his rhetoric, and ought to be. And you have Acosta in a few weeks going to write a book and say we basically have not seen anything like this, Sean. Let me give you a history lesson.",

Let's start quickly. John Adams. John Adams was a great founder, and he was a great man and a great writer about liberty and all things. So he and his party put in place the Alien and Sedition Act. But the sedition act is if you criticize that president, you criticize his party, you criticize the government, he has the power to imprison you. And you know what? He imprisoned some journalists and he shut down some newspapers. Jefferson was furious. Jefferson was a libertarian. He runs against Adams, among other thing, against the Alien and Sedition Act. He wins in a brutal campaign. I won't get into all of the details. But he wins. And he gets rid of the Sedition Act. And the media attacked him and brutalized him. And so that's the party press, the party press that supported Adams and Hamilton and his party and that party, would viciously attack him. And he would still say, I'm not going to touch it. Abraham Lincoln during the civil war through his secretary war standard shut down approximately 300 newspapers, and imprisoned a slew of journalists, among others, among others, because they felt like whatever your argument is, they felt like they needed to because of the civil war.  Woodrow Wilson, one of the great progressive intellectuals who became president of the United States almost by accident, he went further. He put a new Sedition Act in place in 1918. And an extension of the Espionage Act, we're familiar with that. And what he and his party did is they went after journalists they disagreed with. They went after political opponents they disagreed with. They put him in jail. He also put in place an extensive censorship campaign and an extensive government propaganda campaign. The great progressive Franklin Roosevelt turned the IRS on newspapers he disagreed with. The owner of \"The Enquirer\" was investigated by the IRS at his direction. Gannett was investigated at the direction of Eleanor Roosevelt. So they would use the IRS. Kennedy did too. Barack Obama. This is recent history.

The New York Times barely covered it. The New York Times barely covered the holocaust. The New York Times is owned by a Jewish family. It barely covered the holocaust because Mr. Sulzberger decided he didn't want his newspaper to be seen as sort of a Jewish newspaper. He wanted the newspaper to be more of a universal newspaper. FDR didn't want to focus on the Holocaust. So The New York Times complied. They wouldn't accept evidence that was coming, was being printed in European publications. They pretended the evidence was not quality evidence. It wasn't good enough. People have escaped, firsthand accounts, for the most part they ignored it. Three scholars in particular have written about this. How many people know that The New York Times self-censored when it came to the Holocaust ten years before, when Stalin was slaughtering the Ukrainians and starving them to death? They had a correspondent in Moscow by the name Walter Duranty, he got a Pulitzer Prize for his reporting, covered up the slaughter that Stalin had committed against the Ukraine. This is The New York Times. Can any other in the business survive that, let alone be called the paper of record, All Of The News That's Fit To Print? The New York Times still hasn't significantly and seriously dealt with this. It keeps its Pulitzer Prize. Two massive genocides in the last century, you wouldn't find hell a lot about of it in the pages of The New York Times at the time. That's the kind of media that we're talking about.",

I have a section in the book, it's called collusion, abuse of power, and character because this is what they accuse the President of, collusion, abuse of power and character. And I'll give another history lesson. Collusion, let's talk about collusion. I explained that Nancy Pelosi was colluding with a dictator in Syria when George Bush asked her not to. Her predecessor, one of them, Jim Wright, was colluding with the Nicaraguan communists when Ronald Reagan asked them not to. Ted Kennedy has been colluding with the Soviet Union to try and defeat Ronald Reagan in his second term. The media utterly ignored that. He was still alive. There were no hearings, no Logan Act, no nothing. Right now, John Kerry is colluding with the Iranians to undermine the President of the United States. So we actually have real cases of collusion. What about abuse of power? The last President before this President, the IRS refused to go after the Tea Party. The media blew it off. It was no big deal. He blew it off, he didn't know anything. The IRS was used by Franklin Roosevelt, I said earlier, against media outlets. It was used by JFK. JFK sat down with Ben Bradlee, then with Newsweek, but later with The Washington Post. He's considered iconic. And Pierre Salinger, who was working for Kennedy, shared FBI files. Robert Kennedy agreed and agreed to order wiretaps of Martin Luther King. Lyndon Johnson wire tapped Hubert Humphrey, his Vice President, when he was trying to - here's what I want to get at, this is important. There's been abuses - uses of the IRS, of the FBI, to go after political opponents, to go after newspapers, to go after newspaper men. Our President has done none of that, and yet you would think he's a dictator. You listen to MSNBC and Scarborough, I don't know how many times they compare him to a Nazi or to Hitler or those words come up in describing the President of the United States. You really have to be really unhinged. And speaking of that, remember that period they were bringing the professor in from Yale and she and 26 others wrote a book about how the President of the United States - they never met the President of the United States - how he was mentally unhinged. They pulled the same thing on Barry Goldwater in 1964.",

When Hamas fires missiles into Israel, somehow The New York Times always winds up on the side of Hamas. The New York Times did this unbelievable story one Christmas, I think it was last Christmas, about how Hezbollah in Lebanon was celebrating Christmas with the Christians. Hezbollah is a brutal militia terrorist wing of Iran, has killed American soldiers, American marines, and The New York Times puffs them up.

His brand new book, \"Unfreedom of the Press.\" And we're going to take a journey that starts at this nation's founding, remembering the once great press tradition in America and how it ended up becoming nothing more than an extension of the Democratic Party and all things left wing. We'll uncover what went wrong, how the media fell so far so fast. We'll be exposing every hoax, every lie, all of the besmirchment this media mob has told to smear a duly elected president of the United States and just do nothing but divide this country. From the Russian collusion delusion, to Covington, to ignoring the biggest abuse of power corruption scandal in our nation's history, we're going to take it apart piece-by-piece. We will expose how they've abandoned the great tradition of freedom of the press in this country, choosing to act as nothing but partisan hacks rather than serious investigators, choosing to put fake news narratives over facts for years at a time, choosing to smear anyone and everyone who dares calls out their lack of ethics, their lack of objectivity. Remember, the hate Trump media mob and the biggest names on the left never thought it would get to this point. Never thought President Trump would pull off what was one of the biggest political upsets of American history and deliver success after success, record after record, helping the forgotten men and women of this country.

They were great, great presence. And these were the men who pushed for revolution, who pushed the ideas, who talked about philosophers like Locke and Montesquieu, and so forth --"

      "utterance": "Which I have in my past books. But these were the people, the printing press. They were only a few of them. They moved them from time to time because the British were trying to hunt them down. They pushed these ideas. Thomas Paine was a great pamphleteer. There were many, many others. And what happened is people would read these, they talk about them at their pubs, at their homes, at their dinner table, and word would spread. Common sense, Thomas Paine's pamphlet, it's estimated 120,000 people read it. It's a country of about 2 million people. And by the time it was over, half a million people had read it. It had enormous influence. Why is it important? Because back then, what if our press -- they didn't call themselves a press, what did the press do? Promoted liberty, individualism, representative government, private property rights, low taxes and so forth. And then from that period, soon there after, we had a party press. And it was brutal. And the press would at least be transparent. They would identify with the political party, with the candidate, with the cause. And Thomas Jefferson and John Adams would really duke it out. Some of the people in the press were on the payroll of the political party and so forth. But they were all open about it. Again, is it very, very ugly? Then you move into a period of -- and that lasted from about 1780 to the Civil War. Let's jump forward to the early part of the last century, the progressive movement. Well, they devoured much of our government, their ideology did. It does today. They devoured these so-called media at the time, too. They wanted to professionalize them. They wanted standards. They said, we needed to be more objective. But, they said, we need to -- you know, we need to have a handful of elites, a handful of people who understand the country, who understand the world through which all of this will be laundered, which is the way they view government too. The people are stupid, the people are plebes, they're too busy, or they're too ignorant. Let us tell them what to think. Today's media, that's their heritage, they've taken it a step further. They're social activists. That's what they are. They're being taught this in journalism school. It's not enough to report the facts. It's not enough to be objective, they argue, whatever that means. We have to push an agenda. Some of them are out of the closet and they admit that we need to push the liberal and progressive agenda. Some of them, when you challenge them, they say you're attacking freedom of the press. And they pretend that they're still objective when they're not. Survey after survey, study after study shows half of the country, the vast majority of Republicans, the vast majority of people who lean conservative or are conservative, do not trust the media. There's a reason for it. Another half do. Democrats, liberals think the media is pretty darn good. So, when you lose the trust of half of the country, you're not doing your job. And they're not doing their job. They play to a niche. Even the word \"objective\" is debated. Do we mean objective in the terms of the thinking of the journalists? Do we mean objective in terms of the process? So they pretty much surrendered that. You know, a couple of months ago, Chuck Todd on \"Meet the Press\", he declared that manmade climate change is a fact. And we're not going to allow deniers -- we're not going to allow deniers on \"Meet the Press.\" He's more than the host of \"Meet the Press\". He's the chief political guru for the entire NBC network."

You're a physicist, you have PhDs, climatologists, meteorologists, not just hundreds of them, thousands of them who debate manmade climate change, debate its effect, debate if it exists. And he has declared we're not going to allow that on our show. So, that demonstrates to you, he's pushing the agenda. This whole Russia collusion thing, what I write in the book also, Sean, is the notion of news versus propaganda versus pseudo events. The president of the United States is really on to something. When he talks about fake news, there was a brilliant historian, the University of Chicago, Daniel Boorstin, who he became the head of the Library of Congress, he wrote a book on pseudo events. He was talking about the news among other things. They create their own reality, by how they choose events, how they create events, how journalists promote themselves through drama, you can see with Jim Acosta who creates conditions where the focus is on him and not -- this is an enormous disservice to the American people. Pseudo news, Russia collusion with the Trump campaign. We have 2 1/2 years of pseudo -- as the president calls it, fake news. And pseudo news requires more pseudo news. So, obstruction, a pseudo event, it didn't really happen, but they claim it. Seven hundred former prosecutors writing a letter, all liberals no doubt, there are thousands of former prosecutors. Another pseudo event. Phony subpoenas that are intended to gather information that won't do the American people any good, that have nothing to do with congressional oversight. Pseudo events. This impeachment debate, absolutely phony. Another pseudo event. Meanwhile, there's all kinds of events taking place in the world and in this country that are not being covered by news organizations. There are some exceptions. But in the aggregate, this is the condition we face. This is an enormous disservice to the American people. Remember this. The First Amendment belongs to the American people. The Bill of Rights belongs to the American people. The Constitution belongs to the American people. When they say Donald Trump is like a dictator because he calls the media or media outlet or media person the enemy of the people, they have no idea what they're talking about. Donald Trump points out, questions them, is harsh in his rhetoric, and ought to be. And you have Acosta in a few weeks going to write a book and say we basically have not seen anything like this, Sean. Let me give you a history lesson."

Let's start quickly. John Adams. John Adams was a great founder, and he was a great man and a great writer about liberty and all things. So he and his party put in place the Alien and Sedition Act. But the sedition act is if you criticize that president, you criticize his party, you criticize the government, he has the power to imprison you. And you know what? He imprisoned some journalists and he shut down some newspapers. Jefferson was furious. Jefferson was a libertarian. He runs against Adams, among other thing, against the Alien and Sedition Act. He wins in a brutal campaign. I won't get into all of the details. But he wins. And he gets rid of the Sedition Act. And the media attacked him and brutalized him. And so that's the party press, the party press that supported Adams and Hamilton and his party and that party, would viciously attack him. And he would still say, I'm not going to touch it. Abraham Lincoln during the civil war through his secretary war standard shut down approximately 300 newspapers, and imprisoned a slew of journalists, among others, among others, because they felt like whatever your argument is, they felt like they needed to because of the civil war. Woodrow Wilson, one of the great progressive intellectuals who became president of the United States almost by accident, he went further. He put a new Sedition Act in place in 1918. And an extension of the Espionage Act, we're familiar with that. And what he and his party did is they went after journalists they disagreed with. They went after political opponents they disagreed with. They put him in jail. He also put in place an extensive censorship campaign and an extensive government propaganda campaign. The great progressive Franklin Roosevelt turned the IRS on newspapers he disagreed with. The owner of \"The Enquirer\" was investigated by the IRS at his direction. Gannett was investigated at the direction of Eleanor Roosevelt. So they would use the IRS. Kennedy did too. Barack Obama. This is recent history. The FBI, the Department of Justice, went after \"The New York Times\"."

The New York Times barely covered it. The New York Times barely covered the holocaust. The New York Times is owned by a Jewish family. It barely covered the holocaust because Mr. Sulzberger decided he didn't want his newspaper to be seen as sort of a Jewish newspaper. He wanted the newspaper to be more of a universal newspaper. FDR didn't want to focus on the Holocaust. So The New York Times complied. They wouldn't accept evidence that was coming, was being printed in European publications. They pretended the evidence was not quality evidence. It wasn't good enough. People have escaped, firsthand accounts, for the most part they ignored it. Three scholars in particular have written about this. How many people know that The New York Times self-censored when it came to the Holocaust ten years before, when Stalin was slaughtering the Ukrainians and starving them to death? They had a correspondent in Moscow by the name Walter Duranty, he got a Pulitzer Prize for his reporting, covered up the slaughter that Stalin had committed against the Ukraine. This is The New York Times. Can any other in the business survive that, let alone be called the paper of record, All Of The News That's Fit To Print? The New York Times still hasn't significantly and seriously dealt with this. It keeps its Pulitzer Prize. Two massive genocides in the last century, you wouldn't find hell a lot about of it in the pages of The New York Times at the time. That's the kind of media that we're talking about."

I have a section in the book, it's called collusion, abuse of power, and character because this is what they accuse the President of, collusion, abuse of power and character. And I'll give another history lesson. Collusion, let's talk about collusion. I explained that Nancy Pelosi was colluding with a dictator in Syria when George Bush asked her not to. Her predecessor, one of them, Jim Wright, was colluding with the Nicaraguan communists when Ronald Reagan asked them not to. Ted Kennedy has been colluding with the Soviet Union to try and defeat Ronald Reagan in his second term. The media utterly ignored that. He was still alive. There were no hearings, no Logan Act, no nothing. Right now, John Kerry is colluding with the Iranians to undermine the President of the United States. So we actually have real cases of collusion. What about abuse of power? The last President before this President, the IRS refused to go after the Tea Party. The media blew it off. It was no big deal. He blew it off, he didn't know anything. The IRS was used by Franklin Roosevelt, I said earlier, against media outlets. It was used by JFK. JFK sat down with Ben Bradlee, then with Newsweek, but later with The Washington Post. He's considered iconic. And Pierre Salinger, who was working for Kennedy, shared FBI files. Robert Kennedy agreed and agreed to order wiretaps of Martin Luther King. Lyndon Johnson wire tapped Hubert Humphrey, his Vice President, when he was trying to - here's what I want to get at, this is important. There's been abuses - uses of the IRS, of the FBI, to go after political opponents, to go after newspapers, to go after newspaper men. Our President has done none of that, and yet you would think he's a dictator. You listen to MSNBC and Scarborough, I don't know how many times they compare him to a Nazi or to Hitler or those words come up in describing the President of the United States. You really have to be really unhinged. And speaking of that, remember that period they were bringing the professor in from Yale and she and 26 others wrote a book about how the President of the United States - they never met the President of the United States - how he was mentally unhinged. They pulled the same thing on Barry Goldwater in 1964."

      "utterance": "Mark, this is important because for two-plus years, they have peddled lies and conspiracy theories. Again, when you take it to what we have reported, Hillary rigged the primary, they rigged an investigation, where the evidence is overwhelming and incontrovertible, as well as obstruction, nothing. Then they tried to use a Phony Russian Dossier as a means of spying on the Trump campaign, taking away the constitutional rights. They trying to rig that election, then trying to bludgeon the President with a phony - ironically a phony Russian Dossier bought and paid for by Clinton, even The New York Times suggesting now that it could very well have been Russian disinformation from the beginning. So 99.9% of the media never touched it. They're still not going after what is - if we have that kind of abuse of power, rigged investigations, rigged elections, unmasking, surveilling, abusing the constitutional rights of American citizens, you once said we're in a post-constitutional America in an earlier book, you put that together with this book and this experience? What are we, a Banana Republic?"

It focuses on the media. There's a difference between media and a free press. We don't have a free press. It's not because Donald Trump calls them names or the government is interfering, it's because they're not free. A free press would give us the closest thing to news that they can. They're not doing that. They're giving us propaganda and pseudo-events."

Dr. Richard Strauss treated athletes in at least 16 sports, as well as in the student health center and an off campus clinic. The investigation found many people at Ohio State knew of complaints and concerns, but failed to investigate or take action. Strauss killed himself in 2005. A police officer in Texas was fired today after being charged with criminally negligent homicide for shooting and killing a man at a traffic stop last September. The Arlington Police Department announced the firing in a statement that said Officer Bau Tran violated department policy, which led to the death of 24-year-old O'Shae Terry. Body camera video shows Tran firing at Terry, as Terry began to drive away. I'm Trace Gallagher, now back to Hannity."

Recently, New York Times has been grappling with an anti-Semitism scandal. Weeks ago, the so-called paper of record, they were forced to answer for why two anti-Semitic cartoons appeared in the paper's international edition just days apart. Now even more disturbing, is how anti-Semitism and the hatred for Israel all -- not only is it spreading all across Europe, but it's becoming more and more mainstream in this new radical extreme Democratic Socialist Party, as Congresswoman Omar and Talib have now repeatedly come under fire for anti-Semitic remarks. Much of the media, of course, covers for them."

As you think they know what they're doing, I think they are so ideologically blind that they wake up with this psychotic rage to hate the President that they have so convinced themselves that they're right. I think Comey and all these Deep State people that abuse their power, they think they're super patriots, Mark."

The Democrat Party has a growing tolerance for anti-Semitic bigotry. Nancy Pelosi would not propose a resolution that specifically named Omar as the anti-Semite she repeatedly proves that she is. Talib--"

      "utterance": "The history is out there for everyone to see. Talib, same thing. Keith Ellison, same thing, and their closeness with Farrakhan and Sharpton in my opinion, same thing. The Democratic Party has a high tolerance for it. So then the media has a high tolerance for it. In other words, you found them and you just pointed out how they were covering up. Now, if you said it was (inaudible) they wouldn't have any tolerance for it, we don't. But because these are Democrats, because they are the first two women Muslims in the house, they're going to give them the pass, and they largely have given them the pass. And again I want to repeat, The New York Times did not cover the Holocaust in any significant way. The New York Times has a history of this, and I explain this in the book. And let me repeat this. When Hamas fires missiles into Israel, somehow The New York Times always winds up on the side of Hamas. The New York Times did this unbelievable story one Christmas, I think it was last Christmas, about how Hezbollah in Lebanon was celebrating Christmas with the Christians. Hezbollah is a brutal militia terrorist wing of Iran, has killed American soldiers, American marines, and The New York Times puffs them up. And then they start attacking the President for turning this into a political issue. It's not a political issue. The media have got to come to grips. They're destroying themselves. People are going elsewhere. There's new technologies, there's going to be more technologies. And the problem is, they won't police themselves, and more over, I think we're at the lowest point in American history of freedom of the press, thanks to the press. The press has effectively been hijacked by a progressive movement, by a Democratic Party. Look, I explained in the book. Look at all of the Democrats, who worked in government and now work in the press or vice versa. Look at all the Democrats who worked in the press and worked in the Obama administration. You'll have some in this network who are Republicans who have done it, it doesn't come anywhere near the army of Democrats who now become so-called journalists and vice versa."

I learned so much about the history of all of this. But I do think you're right about one thing, the great story that will come out of this is the emergence of new media. I'd like to say we do their job for them. The job they're supposed to do. We do reporting, we do investigative reporting, we also give opinion, we talk about sports sometimes. Yes, we're an entire newspaper. But we're upfront about being opinionated. Big difference between us and them is they lie and they pretend to be something that they're not.
