      "sentences": "Hi, I'm Greg Gutfeld with Tammy Bruce, Juan Williams, Brian Kilmeade, and she skis in a sugar bowl, Dana Perino -- \"The Five.\" Life is all about holes. You spend your life trying to fit into one, but that's the last thing you should want because when you die, trust me, you'll fit. No matter how round a peg you are, eventually you go nicely into a rectangular hole. It's your job to do what John McCain did: Never willingly fit, never lie down and quit, make a fuss, make everyone work harder. In fact, you can measure a life by the size of the hole needed to accommodate it. Make sure yours is McCain's size.  There are people whose exit leaves a Grand Canyon-sized space that can never truly be filled. Senator McCain left that space. And while condolences may often feel trite, they can help fill that space, especially when there are millions of them. Senator McCain was foremost an independent thinker, a round peg in a world capital of square holes. He owned his thoughts, critics be damned. His experiences taught him to shrug stuff off stuff that would have left us in tears. Five and a half years in a prison camp will do that to you, and that's real diversity.  He was feisty, funny and real. We need a good John McCain and not just every generation but every day. Somebody who reminds us that we don't all have to act the same and who knows that there is a difference between a good idea and the latest idea.  The Earth is covered in cemeteries, endless green acres of rectangular holes. There's one near you and in your future. But if there's an army of round pegs filling square holes won't be easy. And life, be a John McCain, be a little less predictable tomorrow than you were today. Realize that politics is only a small part of life, not life itself. Be the round peg that refuses to fit in. Dana, I heard you earlier talking about John McCain when the news came out. I just want to get your thoughts on -- I don't know, his passing and.",

Bush finally wins in South Carolina over McCain, that -- what a remarkable level of forgiveness happens between adversaries so then they can go on to work.

He always regret -- I don't think this is wrong, but he regretted the confessions they beat out of him in the big picture. He also -- I also think that when it came to the collapsing of the economy, I think that at one point he lost to Barack Obama. Barack Obama calmly picked with the phone and talked to Anne Paulson, said what's going on? When John McCain suspended his campaign he got angry.

And you know people in the military, and the rarity of John McCain is that his granddad and his dad were both admirals. And then he goes to the U.S. military -- U.S. naval academy in Annapolis, which is where he would be buried. And he's not an outstanding student, but he is a dedicated person. And when he goes to war he's a dedicated person. I think he's the kind of person based on the honor that he displayed as a politician that I would want at my back if I'm under fire.   And when you saw John McCain's statement, the statement that he issued knowing that he was about to die, he talked about American ideals, Greg, in terms of, this is a country based on an idea, not on blood and soil. And he spoke with a depth that I don't hear from politicians about what real patriotism is. You know politicians are always glad to wrap themselves in the flag, not John McCain. And he could have done it more easily than any of them because he really was, as Dana said, in a prison camp and tortured. I'm not saying he was just held, tortured.

This is a time though to reflect on somebody, and all of us really, more than just what we see necessarily on television, more than in one moment that reflects something. And who someone is and what they've contributed within the larger context. And his final statement, I think, said something very appropriate for all of us across the spectrum about not surrendering, right? About what really matters.  And that's the message especially for Trump supporters that they can learn from, that no matter what's going on that you continue on with what matters to you. That you -- none of us are going to get out of this alive, right? We're going to hopefully have a wonderful moment at the end where we can think about what mattered, if we did what we could and in every single way. And that's what I think all of us are trying to do. And he also mentioned, of course, the thing that gave him the strength. I worked on that campaign briefly in a peripheral way in 2008. The difference was his family, his wife and his daughter, Megan, who I got to know a little bit, and that, of course, was -- just a foundation for him, I think, that makes a huge difference for every politician, for all of us who do these things. And, of course, in the future, there's going to be much more critique, discussion about his legacy and the nature of what he has been able to accomplish, the things he's done when it comes to legislation, and how we move forward from this. But I think, ultimately, it's about sticking with your principles, not being bullied away from them, continuing on to help make this country stronger and better, and I think we're in a good position doing that.",

If you look at the risk of overdose among cancer patients and pain patients who are taking actual prescription drugs, it's .3 percent per year. And when you look at opioid overdoses, it's very misleading when they say 50,000. It's a combination that is killing people, combination of opioids, benzos, cocaine, alcohol. A lot of times people using as a lifestyle party drug. They overdose. They buy it on the street. Why am I bringing this up? Because we are unfairly punishing cancer patients and pain patients by limiting their access to prescription drugs. When they reduce the number of prescription drugs overdoses actually go up. What does that remind you of? Prohibition, when you made it harder to get the booze more people were dying of alcohol poisoning because they were using an unsafe product. So, once again, if you're a conservative and you're for banning prescription drugs, then you should also -- or pursuing -- if you were for pursuing prescription drug companies then you should be pursuing gun companies, all right? If a gun is used in an armed robbery, illegally, you should be suing a gun company. You should be suing an automobile company if the car was in the getaway car. So you cannot be a conservative and say we're suing drug companies because somebody is buying drugs on the streets.",

They could even be put behind bars for 15 days. And in North Carolina, the parents of a 10-year-old boy are outraged, claiming their child was punished for being too polite, by calling his fifth-grade teacher, \"Ma'am.\" They say their son was forced to write the word more than one hundred times on a piece of paper and have them sign it. You guys, obviously, this is a little crazy. I contend that teacher in that story perhaps didn't know what \"ma'am\" meant, because the issue is usually that you're not respectful in class. For her to be upset about that. And when confronted by the mom, she couldn't explain why it upset her. So that becomes an issue.

His experiences taught him to shrug stuff off stuff that would have left us in tears. Five and a half years in a prison camp will do that to you, and that's real diversity.

He always regret -- I don't think this is wrong, but he regretted the confessions they beat out of him in the big picture. He also -- I also think that when it came to the collapsing of the economy, I think that at one point he lost to Barack Obama. Barack Obama calmly picked with the phone and talked to Anne Paulson, said what's going on? When John McCain suspended his campaign he got angry.

But you know what strikes me is that, through it all, anger or whatever, was the sense of honor. And you know people in the military, and the rarity of John McCain is that his granddad and his dad were both admirals. And then he goes to the U.S. military -- U.S. naval academy in Annapolis, which is where he would be buried. And he's not an outstanding student, but he is a dedicated person. And when he goes to war he's a dedicated person. I think he's the kind of person based on the honor that he displayed as a politician that I would want at my back if I'm under fire. And when you saw John McCain's statement, the statement that he issued knowing that he was about to die, he talked about American ideals, Greg, in terms of, this is a country based on an idea, not on blood and soil. And he spoke with a depth that I don't hear from politicians about what real patriotism is. You know politicians are always glad to wrap themselves in the flag, not John McCain. And he could have done it more easily than any of them because he really was, as Dana said, in a prison camp and tortured. I'm not saying he was just held, tortured. And displayed to me what was the greatest example of honor that I could think of as somebody I know, which is not to allow yourself to be freed."

And we've -- expressed those and there's going to be time in the future to have those critiques. This is a time though to reflect on somebody, and all of us really, more than just what we see necessarily on television, more than in one moment that reflects something. And who someone is and what they've contributed within the larger context. And his final statement, I think, said something very appropriate for all of us across the spectrum about not surrendering, right? About what really matters. And that's the message especially for Trump supporters that they can learn from, that no matter what's going on that you continue on with what matters to you. That you -- none of us are going to get out of this alive, right? We're going to hopefully have a wonderful moment at the end where we can think about what mattered, if we did what we could and in every single way. And that's what I think all of us are trying to do. And he also mentioned, of course, the thing that gave him the strength. I worked on that campaign briefly in a peripheral way in 2008. The difference was his family, his wife and his daughter, Megan, who I got to know a little bit, and that, of course, was -- just a foundation for him, I think, that makes a huge difference for every politician, for all of us who do these things. And, of course, in the future, there's going to be much more critique, discussion about his legacy and the nature of what he has been able to accomplish, the things he's done when it comes to legislation, and how we move forward from this. But I think, ultimately, it's about sticking with your principles, not being bullied away from them, continuing on to help make this country stronger and better, and I think we're in a good position doing that."

The flags on the top of the state capital have never waver they are at half-staff to recognize the passing of Senator John McCain. About halfway between here in Nashville and Knoxville in the eastern part of the state, there's a little town called Celina, Tennessee, in Clay County. Fifteen hundred people live in Celina, Tennessee, 1,500 people served by four big busy drugstores. Those four big busy drugstores, last year, according to the DEA wrote 1.3 million prescriptions, 1.3 million pills, opioid pills were prescribed by those four drugstores in that tiny town of Celina, Tennessee. Obviously, what the DEA and the TBI, the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, suspects is that some of those drugs are being diverted or the doctors are overprescribing, that those drugstores have become prescription pill factories, dispensing drugs to people who pay the freight, but causing the kind of carnage that your reference at the top of the segment, 72,000 Americans dead last year alone, that's up from 64,000 in 2016, 72,000 last year, that number continues to rise.

If you look at the risk of overdose among cancer patients and pain patients who are taking actual prescription drugs, it's .3 percent per year. And when you look at opioid overdoses, it's very misleading when they say 50,000. It's a combination that is killing people, combination of opioids, benzos, cocaine, alcohol. A lot of times people using as a lifestyle party drug. They overdose. They buy it on the street. Why am I bringing this up? Because we are unfairly punishing cancer patients and pain patients by limiting their access to prescription drugs. When they reduce the number of prescription drugs overdoses actually go up. What does that remind you of? Prohibition, when you made it harder to get the booze more people were dying of alcohol poisoning because they were using an unsafe product. So, once again, if you're a conservative and you're for banning prescription drugs, then you should also -- or pursuing -- if you were for pursuing prescription drug companies then you should be pursuing gun companies, all right? If a gun is used in an armed robbery, illegally, you should be suing a gun company. You should be suing an automobile company if the car was in the getaway car.

That attitude comes in to a frame where you save a lot of money if you don't do a surgery. And if you got that back surgery you want to do or something else and somebody prescribes a pain reliever instead, usually opioid, that's what we saw beginning in 2009.

And Republican has said, I kind of like NAFTA. I've got to see the details. I want him to come to congress to ratify it. My sense is, if you told me, what are the chances of Mexico in a transition from old leader to new leader, agreeing on one-third of NAFTA as opposed to Canada. That is no way that's going to happen even in the best terms. But he got Mexico done first and guess who is looking over the shoulder the whole time? Canada. They want to start negotiating right away. So, again, this is why we've hired him, to go and start forging some of these unique deals. In this case, modernize and improve. I haven't read this trade agreement yet. But my sense is they saw enough in the market to rage.

Part of it is moving -- automobile manufacturing more -- 75 percent here versus 62.5 percent, at least they say. So what it says is, is that you're right.

If this was the dad's firearm, he should be held responsible for that. If this unstable, mentally-ill people was to get that. That way you don't punish -- and I talk about this with opioids. You don't punish the overwhelming majority of people who are using the product wisely, whether you're driving a car or using opioids or whether you're using opioids or you're using weapons.

Just like with opioids, to save money when maybe a different kind of therapy would work, maybe someone does need to be hospitalized for a period of time.

An Oklahoma high school is reportedly cracking down on students for tardiness and skipping class by threatening fines and possibly jail time. A state law allows students to be slapped with a $250 fine -- Boy, they've got a lot of money in that school -- for missing classes repeatedly without an excused absence. They could even be put behind bars for 15 days. And in North Carolina, the parents of a 10-year-old boy are outraged, claiming their child was punished for being too polite, by calling his fifth-grade teacher, \"Ma'am.\" They say their son was forced to write the word more than one hundred times on a piece of paper and have them sign it. You guys, obviously, this is a little crazy. I contend that teacher in that story perhaps didn't know what \"ma'am\" meant, because the issue is usually that you're not respectful in class. For her to be upset about that. And when confronted by the mom, she couldn't explain why it upset her. So that becomes an issue. But isn't this also about whose parenting, and you've got the school districts and teachers thinking that they can really do whatever they want because they think that there are no parents around?"
