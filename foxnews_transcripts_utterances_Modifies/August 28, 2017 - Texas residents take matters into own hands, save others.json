So from a human standpoint, this is just horrendous. I think -- I guess, you know, we always go to the political optics here. So that's an important thing to talk about too. It's a real challenge for President Trump. The remarks he made today, I think, were really the kind of unifying, sort of bringing the nation together in tone type remarks.

We arrived here to this neighborhood on the western side of the city about an hour and a half, two hours ago now, and the water here has just been rapidly rising. You know we spoke to some people who say they're abandoning their house and going to their neighbor house who's on higher ground. And we must have seen at least five or six full-size families get off on boats from these houses right behind us. Some of them are waiting the water. You might see some of them floating around on a kayak behind us.  And this is the western side, the far western side of the city. Yesterday, we were closer on the southwestern side of the city in the downtown, closer to downtown area. And there were also countless families who were plucked from their rooftops. We saw one family who was walking in water like this, and they had their dogs on a pool raft. And we said where are you guys going? And they said we just left our house. First time ever we have to leave our house. And they had their dogs on a pool raft. Another gentleman we spoke too said my wife and children and I abandon our house for the first time ever. They're a mess. I got to get out of here. He brought his canoe over to his brother's house because he figures his brother is going to need it in the coming days because his brother will have to abandon his house. And as you guys can see it is a consistent saturating wall of rain. It's been like this almost on and off for 24 hours for about three days now. And as you look at it and as our forecasters say this is going to continue, you say where is this water going because it's going to end up in places like this. It's going to destroy people's homes. And gentleman like Scott that we just talk to, and he's in good spirits considering the circumstances, has to walk away from their house. So, you know, you've opened the show talking about the devastation, and this is it. We're witnessing it firsthand. Back to you guys in New York.",

We saw neighbors helping neighbors. We saw people -- we saw volunteers, so many volunteers around here on their own boats.  We ran in last night to a firefighter who was out on his own boat for the entire day rescuing people. You know, the county called out for anybody here, if you have a boat, feel free to use it, and we've seen that a lot.

Houston police tell us perhaps the hardest hit area. We spent nearly the entire day and into the night there last night. And towards the tail end of the night in the same saturating rain you're seeing right now, out of the darkness came this little boat that was floating, and on it were three firemen. And they were clearly exhausted. And they said we've spent the entire day rescuing people. I can't even count how many people we've rescued from roofs. And people we've rescued from their homes. And they actually said, you know, can you give us a ride back to the fire station? And I'm not a hero, I'm not trying to point that out, but they were so exhausted they couldn't go any further.  A story like that you see replicated over and over. And that same neighborhood, the man that we talked too said, well, my wife and kids are back in the house, we're abandoning it. I'm running this canoe over to my brother because I think he's going to need it next. We watched as a young lady last night, we brought you on-air last night a young lady who was watching her car go underwater. She said I tried to move it the night before but I couldn't get it started. And now she sat there watching a fairly nice new car that she might be working hard to drive go underwater. And so, there is a resiliency, but you know there's also people who are frustrated in situations like this. You know, who say we don't know where to turn to. And so, there's -- that element is there as well. But in general, right now, I think most people are trying to help each other get out and stay alive here in Texas, Lisa.",

Everything you're looking at shaded in the red there that is a tornado watch. The conditions are right for tornadoes right now. And actually, this tropical storm, this hurricane at last count, it's hard to keep track. I believe we're at 32 spun-up tornadoes from this system. Currently, we're looking good but we've seen several in the last couple hours. Either way, very heavy rain running all along I-10. That is going to be continuing here throughout the overnight hours.  Let me show you what's going to be happening in the next couple of days, our actual system is still spinning there off the coast of Texas. All the rain out on the eastern side of this. But pay attention to where it's moving. This is taking you into Tuesday, eventually into Wednesday. So this system is going to pacify Houston again. Good news it's on the good side of the storm which generally brings a little less rain. At least not as heavy of rain, but still pretty consistent over there right now. Heavy rain though on the right side of this here for the next couple of days. Before we eventually dry off, not until the end of the week. What it's actually going to like? Well, this is the future forecast. Heavy rain continuing for you into Tuesday. By Wednesday, perhaps beginning to see a little less rain in the Houston area as the heavy rain continues to track off a little farther to the east. But what numbers are we talking about? Quick look at this, we're still talking about numbers getting up easily to 10 to 15 more inches, maybe 20 inches of rain before this is all said and done. Kat?",

The reports from Japan suggest that that missile overflew northern Japan. This is not the first time that the North Koreans have launched a missile with that kind of range. The first time they did so was back in the '90s, when they surprised the world by firing a Taepodong missile. That was the first time that it flew over Japan. It got the attention of the world. They've only done so three times. What's notable about the timing of this -- and I've spoken to senior U.S. officials who said that they had seen some sort of movement that suggested that the North Koreans were preparing for an intermediate range ballistic missile. But they weren't sure whether that was going to come. They were surprised that it came today. Remember, there are ten days of military exercises taking place right now in South Korea between the U.S. military and the South Korean military. Those exercises are slated to end on Wednesday. Those exercises have -- are annual exercises. They have angered Kim Jong-un, the leader of North Korea.  And what's notable is just last week, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson had praised the North Korean leader, saying that, in fact, he had shown a great deal of restraint. But then you saw over the weekend he fired three missiles. Two of them were short range. One of them failed of the three. So I believe that this is timed to coincide with those military exercises with South Korea. Back to you.",

However, this kind of range missile could pose a threat to Guam, and it is not clear whether this is the last of the missiles being fired from Pyongyang, especially since these military exercises are ongoing.",

So from a human standpoint, this is just horrendous. I think -- I guess, you know, we always go to the political optics here. So that's an important thing to talk about too. It's a real challenge for President Trump. The remarks he made today, I think, were really the kind of unifying, sort of bringing the nation together in tone type remarks.

We arrived here to this neighborhood on the western side of the city about an hour and a half, two hours ago now, and the water here has just been rapidly rising. You know we spoke to some people who say they're abandoning their house and going to their neighbor house who's on higher ground. And we must have seen at least five or six full-size families get off on boats from these houses right behind us. Some of them are waiting the water. You might see some of them floating around on a kayak behind us. And this is the western side, the far western side of the city. Yesterday, we were closer on the southwestern side of the city in the downtown, closer to downtown area. And there were also countless families who were plucked from their rooftops. We saw one family who was walking in water like this, and they had their dogs on a pool raft. And we said where are you guys going? And they said we just left our house. First time ever we have to leave our house. And they had their dogs on a pool raft. Another gentleman we spoke too said my wife and children and I abandon our house for the first time ever. They're a mess. I got to get out of here. He brought his canoe over to his brother's house because he figures his brother is going to need it in the coming days because his brother will have to abandon his house. And as you guys can see it is a consistent saturating wall of rain. It's been like this almost on and off for 24 hours for about three days now. And as you look at it and as our forecasters say this is going to continue, you say where is this water going because it's going to end up in places like this. It's going to destroy people's homes. And gentleman like Scott that we just talk to, and he's in good spirits considering the circumstances, has to walk away from their house. So, you know, you've opened the show talking about the devastation, and this is it. We're witnessing it firsthand. Back to you guys in New York."

I hear the heaviness, Matt, in your voice as you are reporting live for us. Is there panic, is there concern? Are people trusting and feeling hopeful around the efforts of the community?

They're getting off a boat from their home. They didn't walk away from it. They were escorted or rescued by a boat. In multiple neighborhoods, we saw people coming together. That's for sure. We saw neighbors helping neighbors. We saw people -- we saw volunteers, so many volunteers around here on their own boats. We ran in last night to a firefighter who was out on his own boat for the entire day rescuing people. You know, the county called out for anybody here, if you have a boat, feel free to use it, and we've seen that a lot. So the human element is that people have got each other's backs here, but there is also a lot of shell-shocked and just genuine heartbreak. As you walk around and you witness people leaving their homes behind."

Can you tell us about any moments that have stood out to you as you've been covering this for the past couple of days?"

      "speaker": "FINN",

Houston police tell us perhaps the hardest hit area. We spent nearly the entire day and into the night there last night. And towards the tail end of the night in the same saturating rain you're seeing right now, out of the darkness came this little boat that was floating, and on it were three firemen. And they were clearly exhausted. And they said we've spent the entire day rescuing people. I can't even count how many people we've rescued from roofs. And people we've rescued from their homes. And they actually said, you know, can you give us a ride back to the fire station? And I'm not a hero, I'm not trying to point that out, but they were so exhausted they couldn't go any further. A story like that you see replicated over and over. And that same neighborhood, the man that we talked too said, well, my wife and kids are back in the house, we're abandoning it. I'm running this canoe over to my brother because I think he's going to need it next. We watched as a young lady last night, we brought you on-air last night a young lady who was watching her car go underwater. She said I tried to move it the night before but I couldn't get it started. And now she sat there watching a fairly nice new car that she might be working hard to drive go underwater. And so, there is a resiliency, but you know there's also people who are frustrated in situations like this. You know, who say we don't know where to turn to. And so, there's -- that element is there as well. But in general, right now, I think most people are trying to help each other get out and stay alive here in Texas, Lisa."

And I think right now we're about three or so days into it. And, you know, the forecast had called for up to 50 inches of rain. If you can wrap your mind around that. And I don't know where we stand on that scale right now. But, you know, since I arrived here, Friday, our forecasters have been saying this is going to be a five day event if not longer. And they were saying from the start basically that most of the damage would probably not come from wind, which we have seen a lot of that, but from this consistent rain. And, you know, this is being referred to as a catastrophic, unprecedented event here. In fact, I talked to two of those firemen last night and they said -- one of them who was the president of the firemen's association of Houston, and he said this is without a doubt, on record saying, this is the most catastrophic event we've ever seen.

Everything you're looking at shaded in the red there that is a tornado watch. The conditions are right for tornadoes right now. And actually, this tropical storm, this hurricane at last count, it's hard to keep track. I believe we're at 32 spun-up tornadoes from this system. Currently, we're looking good but we've seen several in the last couple hours. Either way, very heavy rain running all along I-10. That is going to be continuing here throughout the overnight hours. Let me show you what's going to be happening in the next couple of days, our actual system is still spinning there off the coast of Texas. All the rain out on the eastern side of this. But pay attention to where it's moving. This is taking you into Tuesday, eventually into Wednesday. So this system is going to pacify Houston again. Good news it's on the good side of the storm which generally brings a little less rain. At least not as heavy of rain, but still pretty consistent over there right now. Heavy rain though on the right side of this here for the next couple of days. Before we eventually dry off, not until the end of the week. What it's actually going to like? Well, this is the future forecast. Heavy rain continuing for you into Tuesday. By Wednesday, perhaps beginning to see a little less rain in the Houston area as the heavy rain continues to track off a little farther to the east. But what numbers are we talking about? Quick look at this, we're still talking about numbers getting up easily to 10 to 15 more inches, maybe 20 inches of rain before this is all said and done. Kat?"

Pretty cold as well. It's making it very difficult for anyone to get around. A lot of the major roads are flooded. And as you can see behind me here, sometimes even worse than that. Some of the structure, some of the roads is being washed away. A major sinkhole here. We've seen a lot of emergency trucks go out, so despite these tough conditions, they're going out to try to do what they can. It's not just a Houston problem. A lot of shelters here in the suburbs all around filling up and filling up quickly as these neighborhoods go from voluntary evacuations. Now many of them turning into mandatory evacuations.

The police here have also tweeted that they want people to hang out a sheet or towel from their houses if they need of help. But despite their pleas, the calls on social media for help are steady. If you watch this area, in Richmond, it's every minutes people are saying, you know, my grandmother is stuck. I have three kids in the house. Does someone have a boat? Can you come and get me?

One of the things we felt in New Orleans and that area was that we were alone and that we were left to our local resources, and all we had were one another. Are you getting that sentiment or are the people of the greater Houston area understanding that from a national perspective, and I'm sure even international at some point, that people are there for them and that they're not alone."

So I don't think there's a sense of I'm in trouble. The government will help me. It's I'm in trouble. Someone's got to help me, even if it is the guy next door. If you can help somebody else, you are going out to do it. But there's a lot more sense of not just waiting for the government. But a lot of people of people help going on.

It was a tropical storm and then within 56 hours, it was a major, powerful hurricane. So it just really shows me how inexact things are. There's a real sadness too. I mean, I'm talking to people who lost everything. And when you look at your house, you're glad you're alive, but after a little while when you talk to people, they start to shake or they start to cry.

One of the things the president touted earlier was coordination at the national, state, and local levels. And that's something that has been implemented, anecdotally to much greater effect in this storm than we've seen in previous major hurricanes like this. So that's a wonderful thing that's happening.

Japan is a major ally to the United States, though we're not -- you know, they're not wedded to us through a NATO treaty; and we're not obligated to necessarily come to their defense in this instance. That's a question that will immediately be on the president's plate."

      "utterance": "Gillian, how does this -- if you're the White House, how does this change their calculus in dealing with North Korea, if the reports are true?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TURNER",
      "utterance": "I don't know that it will immediately change the president's calculus, but it definitely -- it ups the stakes. It doesn't mean that we'd be prepared to -- you know, to launch a ground war against North Korea or, you know, sort of escalate the nuclear threat or anything like that. But it's definitely something that will infuriate the president, and rightly so. And it's something that will, I think, cause the United States to really push China a lot harder than they even have been, which has sort of been to the max lately, in terms of hedging against North Korea."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "And a lot of people have been describing this dynamic between President Trump and, really, previous U.S. presidents, as well, and Kim Jong-un and that regime, as kind of a game of chicken. It is something that I've heard floated. We know this is not a game. Right? We know that these are potentially millions of lives at stake, as you're saying. And if this development is even anywhere near true, those stakes just got higher today."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TURNER",
      "utterance": "You're absolutely right. It's not a game. It's not a game of chicken. There are real consequences here. Millions of lives when you calculate out North and South Korea, Japan, whoever else is in arm's length of the missile, or a nuclear missile. But the problem here is that there's no good alternative. So people have been very quick to criticize whoever the president is on this issue for not doing enough; we're not being forceful enough. But there are no good -- there are no easy options, and there is nothing that is guaranteed to get us from 0 to 10 on this issue."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Certainly no guarantees. With more on this very immediate development, we're going to bring in FOX's Jennifer Griffin. Jennifer, thanks and what do you have for us?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JENNIFER GRIFFIN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Well, Eboni, we have seen the reports, and the Pentagon is aware of the reports from Yonhap News Agency, the South Korean news agency, which first reported within the last few minutes that the North Koreans had fired a missile somewhere from a location near Pyongyang. The reports from Japan suggest that that missile overflew northern Japan. This is not the first time that the North Koreans have launched a missile with that kind of range. The first time they did so was back in the '90s, when they surprised the world by firing a Taepodong missile. That was the first time that it flew over Japan. It got the attention of the world. They've only done so three times. What's notable about the timing of this -- and I've spoken to senior U.S. officials who said that they had seen some sort of movement that suggested that the North Koreans were preparing for an intermediate range ballistic missile. But they weren't sure whether that was going to come. They were surprised that it came today. Remember, there are ten days of military exercises taking place right now in South Korea between the U.S. military and the South Korean military. Those exercises are slated to end on Wednesday. Those exercises have -- are annual exercises. They have angered Kim Jong-un, the leader of North Korea. And what's notable is just last week, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson had praised the North Korean leader, saying that, in fact, he had shown a great deal of restraint. But then you saw over the weekend he fired three missiles. Two of them were short range. One of them failed of the three. So I believe that this is timed to coincide with those military exercises with South Korea. Back to you."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "Jennifer, do we know how or even when we can expect to hear from the White House on this?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GRIFFIN",
      "utterance": "Well, I know that the White House has called over here to the Pentagon to get the latest intelligence on this. Right now, U.S. Pacific Command and others are trying to gather the data on this missile launch. And so they will be communicating that to the White House. The White House will want to wait, of course, until they have that information, because there will be a lot of decisions based on this. But from those I'm speaking to here at the Pentagon, this missile never posed a threat to any of the continental U.S. or to Hawaii or Alaska. However, this kind of range missile could pose a threat to Guam, and it is not clear whether this is the last of the missiles being fired from Pyongyang, especially since these military exercises are ongoing."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOOTHE",
      "utterance": "Jennifer, from your time covering North Korea and from your perspective, are we in a different place with North Korea than we previously have been?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GRIFFIN",
      "utterance": "It certainly feels like it is -- that tension is ratcheting up. There's what feels like a very dangerous game of chicken, almost a dare taking place, and Kim Jong-un continues to try to show that he is still -- still in power and in control and able to fire these missiles. But certainly, the range of these missiles has gotten the attention; and the capabilities in the last six months of what we've seen has gotten the attention of those who watch these things here at the Pentagon and elsewhere."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Jennifer, just quick final question. You talk about Secretary of State Tillerson and what sounds like a very diplomatic tone he took last week. Can you give any anticipation about what that diplomacy will look like moving forward?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GRIFFIN",
      "utterance": "Well, I think that you're going to see a very tough line from not only the White House. Tillerson had praised those U.N. sanctions the Security Council had imposed unanimously, sanctions against North Korea. And that was significant. That was an achievement. But it is clear that it is not deterring Kim Jong-un, so now they're going to have to go back to the drawing board on this."

      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",

Let's talk about the fact that he -- he violated a federal order, and while the -- while he was being investigated for the illegal violation of a federal order, he hired a detective to look into the wife of the judge was prosecuting him. What? How can a sitting president think that it's OK to pardon someone who would -- who would seek to have, I mean, I guess judicial retribution or something for even being investigated? This is dangerous. This is frightening, and this cannot -- this cannot stand. This can not stand."

      "utterance": "My issue, I agree -- I agree. Well, here's the thing. Here's my point. Look, yes, a bad pardon, we're on the same side with that. This is someone, however, who -- you know, Arpaio was looking at making certain that judges do not come after him to obey the law. He was -- he was investigating the family member of the judge."

We're not going to relitigate the underlying nature of what Chelsea Manning did or what Oscar or what Sheriff Joe did, because that's the very point of a pardon. Is that the president, whoever that is occupying 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, any given time, gets full discretion around who to administer them to. So we can have a feeling around it; we can like or dislike it, but that is the nature of a presidential pardon."

And so for mine, I just wanted to show, basically, a compilation of people helping each other. Because one thing that I've been profoundly struck by is just the resiliency of Texans, the fact, neighbor helping neighbor, community helping one another. And I just think it's a beautiful message, because it shows that we are so much more united than we are divided as a nation. And, you know, thank God for the people of Texas standing strong and showing that to all of us in this time of need for them -- Eboni."

These are two opportunities right here. One, the American Red Cross. The thing is, and I hate to say this, but I was a young, budding litigator. And you saw a lot of scams, unfortunately, in these times of crises and people really taking advantage. So the American Red Cross is a safe place, if you want to give money, you want to give supplies, clothing, food, anything like that. Please reach out to your American Red Cross.
