And he wasn't kidding.  But of course, he's wrong. There are plenty of homely people who have achieved great things: Socrates, Abe Lincoln, Beethoven. But as always, this invites the game I like to call \"What would happen if you said that\" or anyone who isn't the Dalai Lama? Fact is, the media picks and chooses outrages depending on alliances and current cultural trends. The Dalai Lama can get away with something a Christian leader can't, because he's cool, as is Tibetan Buddhism.  It's not just icons but also ideology, which is why the media seems very, very comfortable yakking about the pope's radical climate change beliefs more so than Planned Parenthood dispensing baby body parts. That story only creates discomfort, especially for the guilt-ridden media. And as usual, reporters will claim that climate change is a moral issue, but baby butchering? No, that's a political one.   But the Dalai Lama's words reveal also about a politically incorrect truth about the simple biological imperatives of man. That holy or not holy, an 80-year-old man is still an 80-year-old man. And even with the robes and stature, we're all just suckers for a pretty face.",
