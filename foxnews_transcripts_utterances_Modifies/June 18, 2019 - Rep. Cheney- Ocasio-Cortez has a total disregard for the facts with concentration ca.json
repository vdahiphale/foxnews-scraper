Just like the Mueller report was expected to tee up the president's ouster. Yet, did you notice that pro-impeachment rallies all around the country this weekend? Well, some of them drew dozens. And while the president's critics keep citing everything from tariffs that have hit farmers in the Midwest, to struggling poll numbers of the president in some battleground states to make their case he's on the ropes, he keeps fighting back. And don't forget the polls in 2016 did not quite catch the movement that was building and building on his behalf.   In moments, Marc Thiessen, and former DNC chair Ed Rendell, to over whether the president is in a stronger position than Democrats think. And as we get closer to the rally, we'll hear from Victor Davis Hanson, who, in a recent op-ed refer to the president as the Democrats \"Great white whale under constant attacks that only seemed to make him more indestructible.\" But first, let's turn to the professor who says he's correctly predicted nine of the last nine elections.

And if, in fact, Mark Milley is confirmed as the next chairman of the joint chief of staff, this relationship between the possible secretary of defense and the chairman of the joint staff will be important. I would add one other thing is that Secretary Pompeo is also a West Point graduate. So now you'll have the secretary of defense and the secretary of the state both having some kind of common background from which to build a relationship.

I think the Iranians sending us a signal that they still have some influence in the area, but I'm not overly concerned that we're going to go into a hot war. Now, as acting Secretary Shanahan had said earlier, the biggest concern we have is about a miscalculation.

However, having said that, I am concerned that by completely ripping up the JCPPOA, I don't know that we have a good plan, I don't know whether or not the economic sanctions are going to pressure them. And obviously, what you are seeing is the rhetoric between the U.S. and Iran, it's probably not helpful for relations in the area.

Good evening, everybody. I'm Ed Henry, in for Martha MacCallum. If you listen to many in the mainstream media, the enthusiasm is supposed to be all on the Democratic side. Just like the Mueller report was expected to tee up the president's ouster. Yet, did you notice that pro-impeachment rallies all around the country this weekend? Well, some of them drew dozens. And while the president's critics keep citing everything from tariffs that have hit farmers in the Midwest, to struggling poll numbers of the president in some battleground states to make their case he's on the ropes, he keeps fighting back. And don't forget the polls in 2016 did not quite catch the movement that was building and building on his behalf. In moments, Marc Thiessen, and former DNC chair Ed Rendell, to over whether the president is in a stronger position than Democrats think. And as we get closer to the rally, we'll hear from Victor Davis Hanson, who, in a recent op-ed refer to the president as the Democrats \"Great white whale under constant attacks that only seemed to make him more indestructible.\" But first, let's turn to the professor who says he's correctly predicted nine of the last nine elections.

My system, the 13 keys to the White House that predicted Trump's victory works because I ignore the polls, I ignore the pundits, I don't look at things like campaigns, speeches, debates, ads.

You seem to be saying that Democrats best shot of beating the president is to go all-in on impeachment even though there are polls suggesting from 60 to 70 percent of the country says to do it."

And the Democrats have fundamentally misread the impeachment of Bill Clinton.

First of all, Donald Trump 2020 is going to have two advantages that Donald Trump 2016 didn't have. One, he's going to have far more money than us. He's already bankrolled a tremendous war chest, and he's going to maintain that lead all the way through. Hillary Clinton had far more money than Donald Trump did in 2016. And number two, he's president presiding over a good economy. And although that hasn't shown up in the polls yet, that still a factor as people go vote. So, I think he's stronger than we think. The polls can be wrong. For example, the Donald Trump's internal poll showed he's trailing in Pennsylvania 55 to 39. There is no way he's going to lose Pennsylvania by 16 points."

We've had a long history if you go back at people who really are left-wing zealots ignoring history, ignoring facts to pursue their causes, to try to convince people the rightness of their causes. So it's not new that we would have this point on. You know, what is new is that we have it going on from a member of Congress who really seems to have become the intellectual leader of the Democrats here in the House. And again and again and again we see this total disregard for the facts and it's a total disregard for the facts in particular about the Holocaust. But also you know you see the extent to which her colleagues and the people who are supposed to be leading the Democrats in the House Speaker Pelosi, Steny Hoyer, won't stand up and criticize what she's saying and condemn those comments and those statements."

You know, we're in a situation where first of all, we really do actually have a crisis at the border. And if Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortes and her colleagues are so concerned about humanitarian conditions at the border, they should have voted -- 15 times they've had the chance to vote for a bill that Congressman Mike Rogers has put on the floor to provide $4.5 billion in humanitarian aid for those people at the border. Secondly, we should never be in a situation where somebody is bringing up the Holocaust in this public discourse particularly diminishing what happened, particularly demeaning the State of Israel, demeaning the memory the people who are lost. And we really ought to understand and come to an agreement that we're not going to do that. And any in-depth understanding of history, and frankly it doesn't have to be an in-depth understanding of history, it could be a surface level understanding of history would demonstrate how wrong her comments were. And I just -- I'm waiting for her fellow freshman. I'm waiting for her -- the leaders of her party to stand up and say they disagree because certainly, they ought to disagree.

The President announcing in the last 24 hours that next week there were going to be some major ICE raids and that he's going to try to kick many, many of thousands of people who are here illegally out of the country. Is it a smart idea though to telegraph that when the Oakland mayor as you remember of months and months ago telegraphed a raid in her city and the Republicans were pretty upset about it."

I'm not quite sure how you control your border if you don't have a situation where you are detaining people who try to cross illegally prior to their court appearances which is exactly what we are doing. So, we have to secure the border. We have a crisis. We've got people coming across in numbers that we have never seen before. And if a nation can't secure the borders and know who's coming here and know where they are going, that we can't keep our people safe."

The president naming Army Secretary Mark Esper to be the new acting secretary of defense. Just yesterday, Shanahan authorized an additional 1,000 U.S. troops to the Mideast as the American military ramps up pressure on Iran.

But I think what you need to know is that he's got a great relationship with the chief of staff with the army General Mark Milley. And if, in fact, Mark Milley is confirmed as the next chairman of the joint chief of staff, this relationship between the possible secretary of defense and the chairman of the joint staff will be important. I would add one other thing is that Secretary Pompeo is also a West Point graduate. So now you'll have the secretary of defense and the secretary of the state both having some kind of common background from which to build a relationship. So, I think Mark Esper is going to do a fabulous job as the secretary of defense. He's a good pick."

Because on one hand I've heard a lot of analysts, even some who don't normally support the president saying his maximum pressure campaign on Tehran with the sanctions is working. And that may prevent war. But on the other hand, there are concerns tonight about more U.S. troops being sent to the Mideast and the possibility of war. How concerned are you with that we could be headed for a hot war?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCRAVEN",

And the Iranians certainly don't want to go to war with us. But these attacks on the tankers and the attacks in the green zone and some of the other attacks that the Iranians and the Iranian proxies have executed here in the last six months. I think the Iranians sending us a signal that they still have some influence in the area, but I'm not overly concerned that we're going to go into a hot war. Now, as acting Secretary Shanahan had said earlier, the biggest concern we have is about a miscalculation. If a republican guard officer miscalculates and comes a little too close to an aircraft carrier, if somebody shoots around into the green zone and it hits the embassy, these are miscalculations that will not go well for Iran."

      "speaker": "HENRY",

What say you?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCRAVEN",
      "utterance": "Yes, I'm not in favor of that. I think one, what we've got to be able to do is to make sure we have confirmed the intelligence that our allies are behind this, you know. And the United States policy in the past has really been to attack only when we are threatened. And so, I think we've got to make absolutely certain before we conduct a strike, you know, on the Iranians that we think this through. Again, the Iranians don't want war with us, the president doesn't want to go to war. If the Iranians attack us then we need to have a proportional and a measured response to that attack."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "OK. Admiral, last question, I'm going to keep you out of politics because of your long service. But on the other side of the screen there is a rally that's about to happen with the president of the United states kicking off his reelection. And at these rallies he typically talks about how he ripped up the Iran nuclear deal. So not focus on the policy but the substance of it which you know so well. President Obama had one approach with the Iran nuclear deal. President Trump came in office and said that it was the wrong approach and has ripped that up. What's your suggestion about what should be the way forward for the United States in terms of dealing with Iran's march towards getting nuclear weapons?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCRAVEN",
      "utterance": "Yes. Well, the JCPOA was certainly not a perfect agreement and I understand President Trump's concern over it. However, I do think what it was going to do was defer or delay the Iranian's ability to build a nuclear weapon. And honestly nobody wants a nuclear weapon in the hands of the Iranians. However, having said that, I am concerned that by completely ripping up the JCPPOA, I don't know that we have a good plan, I don't know whether or not the economic sanctions are going to pressure them. And obviously, what you are seeing is the rhetoric between the U.S. and Iran, it's probably not helpful for relations in the area. So, I think it remains to be seen whether or not walking away from the JCPOA was a good call. I would have preferred to stay with that but we'll see, have to see how this plays out."

But for most of the past two hours, two and a half hours at times there are about a thousand people packing into the street here with a cornucopia of protest anti-Trump assigns. Groups participating the Florida Democratic Party, Latinas United for Respect, Organize Florida, Gays Against Guns, and Alianza, a Puerto Rican activist group. For those only one termers for Trump, certainly a big highlight was when the big diaper wearing baby Trump inflated right in the middle of the street, at one point there was almost a clash as a small group of Trump supporters made the way about six blocks away from the Amway Center where Trump is having his rally at eight o'clock and tried to crash this anti- Trump rally.

Writing, quote, \"If Trump is reelected next year, that could mark the end of America's Democratic experiment.\" And here's the thing he writes, \"white working-class voters seem to have noticed that Trump is not working for them.\" Well, joining me now, Victor Davis Hanson, author of \"The Case for Trump.\" Good evening, sir."

But when you look at these rallies that Trump attracts, the people in it they're not -- they don't wear tweed coats, they're not academics there.

And as we look at that crowd live building there in Orlando, you're right. I don't see a lot of tweed coats. I see a lot of red hats. And I wonder the counter protest or the protest at the counter rally that we just heard about from Phil Keating, one of the people he spoke to said the president has committed so many crimes. That was the allegation. And we hear Democrats in Congress saying, maybe it's time for impeachment. Where is the high crime, misdemeanors? They haven't seemed to named that yet."

We had Lois Lerner public creating felonious crimes, we had a lot of scandals in the GSA, the Secret Service, the V.A. and nobody ever said that Barack Obama should be impeached. So when people use these generic high crimes or felonious behavior and they don't specify and they don't specify because we spent 22 months, $35 million with Robert Mueller and they couldn't find a specific crime to charge the president with, and so we're left with this boilerplate, or Trump did this or that, but there's nothing to that.

Well, I was struck first of all that term, you know, waste bin, dustbin, all of that is a Trotskyite term Reagan used it but only of foreign enemies, not on his domestic opponents. So, it's a little bit over the top. But Newsom has a selective memory, he is referring to CAP 187 of 1994 valid emission that cut off regular health care not emergency health care to illegal aliens. And that won by 59 percent of the people. It was a judge that nullified it three days later and it got Pete Wilson reelected as governor. But what really changed California was not the Republican Party, it was demography and money because three things remember happened. We have about in the last quarter-century about 10 million people, many of them illegally enter the United States across the southern border.

Expecting to highlight two big things. The strong economy and the immigration. The same issue that really catapulted his campaign four years ago, only this time there are some pretty major differences, right? This time he has all the advantages of being the incumbent. He has a massive 40- million-dollar plus war chest and the full support of the Republican National Committee. Something he did not have four years ago in 2016. But there are some signs of trouble, especially here in the swing state of Florida. President Trump only narrowly won this state in 2016, and the latest poll show him trailing behind several of the top Democratic contenders. But, you know, those polls were wrong in 2016.
