      "sentences": "He's right. Islamists see fun as evil maybe because it's missing in their ghoulish, cowardly lives. Pop singer Morrissey from The Smiths -- you remember them -- went even further. When the Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham called the attacker \"an extremist,\" Morrissey asked \"an extreme what? An extreme rabbit?\" This is the same mayor who said the jihadist was a terrorist and not a Muslim. Sorry, guy, he's both. But to avoid the bigot stigma, the mayor avoids a truth -- which is a pattern. BBC News claims calls were made to a terror hotline about the bomber years before he struck. So, why no action? Could it be again the fear of appearing bigoted?  But at least some entertainers are starting to reject this. Maybe they realize that hugs won't bring peace, but a willingness to fight does. You want to know how pop music actually flourished? How The Beatles were able to sing All You Need is Love? You can thank veterans who dispatched heinous enemies in some really ugly wars, giving pop music center stage in long periods of peace.   So, can music survive under a caliphate? I doubt it. ISIS has no use for Coldplay. Bataclan, the Pulse nightclub, Manchester -- all young people, all music fans, all targets. So, maybe it's time we speak less of love and more about evil. Maybe it's time for All You Need Is Guns. So, Jesse, what do you make of Bono? He's always a clear-eyed thinker in this thing and I think he kind of like explained it fairly succinctly.",

And you think after 9/11, everybody came together, everybody wanted to go after Afghanistan, there was a lot of bipartisan support. That dissipated. But when pop stars, especially liberal pop stars, can speak the truth about evil, it galvanizes people that are apolitical, young Americans, liberal Americans to say, you know what, it's OK to say radical Islam, it's OK to describe the heinous acts that these people are committing. And it gives the license because when you're able to do that and you're clear-eyed and you're united, it enables the country to come together and actually defeat evil instead of just kind of placating it like we've been doing.",

How horrific to target specifically young girls, women and their parents that are going to a concert like this. This was no accident. This was specific. And if you see under Sharia law nothing but disdain for women, for children. You have young girls being sold into slavery by ISIS, being raped and tortured, horrific things. Some of them so bad that you don't even hear about them in the media. They don't even want to talk about them on the news.  But this is the reality of the situation. You have to be able to face it. You have to be able to deal with it and use a variety - a platform of weapon to be able to target them. And by that, I mean, yes, social media and popstars and education.  And you've got to be able to put out your own propaganda to match theirs because otherwise you have people that will be attracted to this, people like the president calls them evil losers, people that specifically are looking for somewhere to go for some relevancy in their lives, and they're just sitting there, waiting for something like this and for radical jihad to soak into them, so that they can commit some of kind of act that they think is significant, so that their life has some matter to it, some importance.",

And, in fact, one of the big stories - especially out of the civil right movement was really that musicians were actually helpful to try to bring people together, but they were pushing the envelope too. They would make people question past practices.   Interesting thing here is that, in Western civilization, we send our children to concerts. Abedi's father sent him to die, to kill other people. And so, when you're dealing with that type of an ideology, I'm not exactly sure how you fix it, but you mentioned something last week - I don't think it was on air - but we were talking about the Toby Keith concert in Saudi Arabia and, of course, there weren't women allowed, so there was a little bit of controversy, but the truth is that actually young Muslim people like our culture, they like the music, they maybe have to listen to it privately. So, if I were the politicians and there's some new people on the scene, Theresa May, Macron, President Trump, why not recruit some of these musicians actually help. Call upon their patriotism, ask them to help to either put on big event. They actually have the power to reach a lot more people than we do.",

There is a desperate search tonight for the bomb maker that involves not just the British police, but also their military, a sign of just how intense the situation is at this very hour. Remember, ISIS took responsibility for the attack at Manchester Arena. I've spoken to people inside the Trump administration who are deeply concerned that the terrorist who made the bomb that killed so many people is still at large and could mastermind another attack at any time. British and US intelligence officials tell us their assessment is the suicide bomber who died in the attack, Salman Abedi, had recently visited Libya where he could've gotten training, but he was essentially a mule who was outside the arena and set off that bomb that was put together by someone else who's on the run right now. British authorities are trying to close in on the bomb maker with a series of raids that stretch from UK to Libya where Abedi's father and younger brother were detained, while Abedi's older brother was one of several people taken into custody in the UK. All of this is why the British Prime Minister Theresa May has increased UK's terror threat level from severe to critical and ratcheted up all of this even more by sending British Army troops to guard major landmarks like Buckingham Palace, Downing Street, Westminster and the British Parliament. The Prime Minister declaring that the \"spirit of Manchester is far mightier than sick plots of depraved terrorists,\" though there was real concern tonight about that bomb maker who's still at large.

He said, if the terrorists had actually been attacking a Jewish child that he wondered if Prime Minister Abbas would actually have said the same thing about terrorism being so evil. And that's why - the ideology is what is so difficult. The thing about the Libya connection I think is very troubling because Al Qaeda and ISIS have both been trying to expand. Al Qaeda in the Maghreb, AQM, has been frustrated that ISIS has been getting so much attention. You have thousands of migrants leaving the Libyan coast for Italy and then dispersing throughout Europe and possibly the world. So, we now have to have a ton of resources spent to try to find this one guy, plus all the other ones that we're trying to find. So, we are asking a tremendous amount of our intelligence community and law enforcement in order to do this. But I thought that Tom Joscelyn of \"The Weekly Standard\" today wrote something very interesting. ISIS first claimed responsibility and said there were 30 dead. OK? It's pretty easy to check the news report that it's actually 22 dead and 15 injured. It could be that you're seeing now either some sort of a metamorphosis or a combination or a merger between ISIS and AQM or some sort of way that they are utilizing these young people and you don't even realize it's happening.

The network wants us to adopt the lone wolf assumption because if you only believe in lone wolves, you don't look for the network. So, whenever you hear the lone wolf story, say that's - for now, that's something to entertain later. I also think his return was a red flag. We have to think about that. Who is in charge of watching the red flags. Do we need more people in charge of running? Should we hire more, create a bigger industry?

We're talking about family members that were implicated in this that Trump was criticized for raising the issue whether or not to take these guys out. But let's talk about what really is going on here. This happened from Libya. President Obama and Hillary Clinton toppled Qaddafi. They led from behind and left a failed state because they didn't win the peace. ISIS has taken over those militias. It's chaos. Now, there's training grounds there.  Is Obama or Hillary responsible for the failed state in Libya? And not only that. Obama withdrew from Iraq and created a vacuum where ISIS took over. Is he accountable for that? He didn't enforce a redline in Syria and has now over - a huge refugee crisis, which is now infecting Europe. Is Obama responsible for that?

I do think the Democrats need to explain to us why -- I can understand why you increase snap benefits, food benefits basically after the 2008 financial crisis. I get that. But, if President Obama had such a great economy, and now we're at 4.4 percent on unemployment, and those numbers haven't come down at all, why is that? There's a problem there that they can't answer in terms of the policy. So I do think it's a little bit of rinse and repeat.

And in this book, World Changer, she really wanted to provide parents with advice on how to raise children who will leave a mark in indelible imprint on the world, much like her fallen beloved son, Aaron. And I'm happy to say that Karen will also be my guest tomorrow night on Hannity, Sean will be on vacation for two days and I will be in for him, so you can all watch that as well.",

When the Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham called the attacker \"an extremist,\" Morrissey asked \"an extreme what? An extreme rabbit?\" This is the same mayor who said the jihadist was a terrorist and not a Muslim. Sorry, guy, he's both. But to avoid the bigot stigma, the mayor avoids a truth -- which is a pattern. BBC News claims calls were made to a terror hotline about the bomber years before he struck. So, why no action? Could it be again the fear of appearing bigoted? But at least some entertainers are starting to reject this. Maybe they realize that hugs won't bring peace, but a willingness to fight does. You want to know how pop music actually flourished? How The Beatles were able to sing All You Need is Love? You can thank veterans who dispatched heinous enemies in some really ugly wars, giving pop music center stage in long periods of peace. So, can music survive under a caliphate? I doubt it. ISIS has no use for Coldplay. Bataclan, the Pulse nightclub, Manchester -- all young people, all music fans, all targets. So, maybe it's time we speak less of love and more about evil. Maybe it's time for All You Need Is Guns. So, Jesse, what do you make of Bono? He's always a clear-eyed thinker in this thing and I think he kind of like explained it fairly succinctly."

And you think after 9/11, everybody came together, everybody wanted to go after Afghanistan, there was a lot of bipartisan support. That dissipated. But when pop stars, especially liberal pop stars, can speak the truth about evil, it galvanizes people that are apolitical, young Americans, liberal Americans to say, you know what, it's OK to say radical Islam, it's OK to describe the heinous acts that these people are committing. And it gives the license because when you're able to do that and you're clear-eyed and you're united, it enables the country to come together and actually defeat evil instead of just kind of placating it like we've been doing."

How horrific to target specifically young girls, women and their parents that are going to a concert like this. This was no accident. This was specific. And if you see under Sharia law nothing but disdain for women, for children. You have young girls being sold into slavery by ISIS, being raped and tortured, horrific things. Some of them so bad that you don't even hear about them in the media. They don't even want to talk about them on the news. But this is the reality of the situation. You have to be able to face it. You have to be able to deal with it and use a variety - a platform of weapon to be able to target them. And by that, I mean, yes, social media and popstars and education. And you've got to be able to put out your own propaganda to match theirs because otherwise you have people that will be attracted to this, people like the president calls them evil losers, people that specifically are looking for somewhere to go for some relevancy in their lives, and they're just sitting there, waiting for something like this and for radical jihad to soak into them, so that they can commit some of kind of act that they think is significant, so that their life has some matter to it, some importance."

And, in fact, one of the big stories - especially out of the civil right movement was really that musicians were actually helpful to try to bring people together, but they were pushing the envelope too. They would make people question past practices. Interesting thing here is that, in Western civilization, we send our children to concerts. Abedi's father sent him to die, to kill other people. And so, when you're dealing with that type of an ideology, I'm not exactly sure how you fix it, but you mentioned something last week - I don't think it was on air - but we were talking about the Toby Keith concert in Saudi Arabia and, of course, there weren't women allowed, so there was a little bit of controversy, but the truth is that actually young Muslim people like our culture, they like the music, they maybe have to listen to it privately. So, if I were the politicians and there's some new people on the scene, Theresa May, Macron, President Trump, why not recruit some of these musicians actually help. Call upon their patriotism, ask them to help to either put on big event. They actually have the power to reach a lot more people than we do."

      "utterance": "Kimberly, good evening. There is a desperate search tonight for the bomb maker that involves not just the British police, but also their military, a sign of just how intense the situation is at this very hour. Remember, ISIS took responsibility for the attack at Manchester Arena. I've spoken to people inside the Trump administration who are deeply concerned that the terrorist who made the bomb that killed so many people is still at large and could mastermind another attack at any time. British and US intelligence officials tell us their assessment is the suicide bomber who died in the attack, Salman Abedi, had recently visited Libya where he could've gotten training, but he was essentially a mule who was outside the arena and set off that bomb that was put together by someone else who's on the run right now. British authorities are trying to close in on the bomb maker with a series of raids that stretch from UK to Libya where Abedi's father and younger brother were detained, while Abedi's older brother was one of several people taken into custody in the UK. All of this is why the British Prime Minister Theresa May has increased UK's terror threat level from severe to critical and ratcheted up all of this even more by sending British Army troops to guard major landmarks like Buckingham Palace, Downing Street, Westminster and the British Parliament. The Prime Minister declaring that the \"spirit of Manchester is far mightier than sick plots of depraved terrorists,\" though there was real concern tonight about that bomb maker who's still at large. Kimberly, back to you."

    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "Right. And so, again, that's also something that Benjamin Netanyahu said the other day after President Trump made remarks in Israel. He said, if the terrorists had actually been attacking a Jewish child that he wondered if Prime Minister Abbas would actually have said the same thing about terrorism being so evil. And that's why - the ideology is what is so difficult. The thing about the Libya connection I think is very troubling because Al Qaeda and ISIS have both been trying to expand. Al Qaeda in the Maghreb, AQM, has been frustrated that ISIS has been getting so much attention. You have thousands of migrants leaving the Libyan coast for Italy and then dispersing throughout Europe and possibly the world. So, we now have to have a ton of resources spent to try to find this one guy, plus all the other ones that we're trying to find. So, we are asking a tremendous amount of our intelligence community and law enforcement in order to do this. But I thought that Tom Joscelyn of \"The Weekly Standard\" today wrote something very interesting. ISIS first claimed responsibility and said there were 30 dead. OK? It's pretty easy to check the news report that it's actually 22 dead and 15 injured. It could be that you're seeing now either some sort of a metamorphosis or a combination or a merger between ISIS and AQM or some sort of way that they are utilizing these young people and you don't even realize it's happening. So, we could see this is actually evolving even more."

    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "Well, first, they should get - all their police officers should get guns. The fact that they don't have guns - I'm not saying that that would've prevented this, but you might have an edge if you have guns. And also, we have to acknowledge that there is a network involved, which rejects the lone wolf assumption that we always go by. The network wants us to adopt the lone wolf assumption because if you only believe in lone wolves, you don't look for the network. So, whenever you hear the lone wolf story, say that's - for now, that's something to entertain later. I also think his return was a red flag. We have to think about that. Who is in charge of watching the red flags. Do we need more people in charge of running? Should we hire more, create a bigger industry? And again, I return to my earlier point why did they miss the red flag because political correctness prevents you from focusing on obvious risks because that would be bigoted. You cannot profile. If you profile, you're done."

We're talking about family members that were implicated in this that Trump was criticized for raising the issue whether or not to take these guys out. But let's talk about what really is going on here. This happened from Libya. President Obama and Hillary Clinton toppled Qaddafi. They led from behind and left a failed state because they didn't win the peace. ISIS has taken over those militias. It's chaos. Now, there's training grounds there. Is Obama or Hillary responsible for the failed state in Libya? And not only that. Obama withdrew from Iraq and created a vacuum where ISIS took over. Is he accountable for that? He didn't enforce a redline in Syria and has now over - a huge refugee crisis, which is now infecting Europe. Is Obama responsible for that? So, no one is reporting this is all the aftermath of a failed foreign policy and everyone is talking about Islamophobia or Trump. That's not the issue."

But the truth is that until people in Washington are willing to actually come together and deal with some of the bigger things, then you're going to actual have less money to spend on discretionary programs like Snap or Chip. I do think the Democrats need to explain to us why -- I can understand why you increase snap benefits, food benefits basically after the 2008 financial crisis. I get that. But, if President Obama had such a great economy, and now we're at 4.4 percent on unemployment, and those numbers haven't come down at all, why is that? There's a problem there that they can't answer in terms of the policy. So I do think it's a little bit of rinse and repeat. We've heard all of these complaints about this before, but until both parties are willing to come together and actually deal with the increase, social security and Medicare, there's going to be less money for other things.

See, I can do it too. If you do it, if you can say it without any backup, I can say stuff like that, too. De Blasio says children will die. How many police officers have you put in harm's way by marginalizing their jobs, by saying that, you know, you had to tell your kids to be careful with the police? How many cops lives did you put in jeopardy when you did that? So screw you. By the way, you know the other thing too? It's like some of these are reductions in increases. So it's like saying you're going to get a 5 percent raise instead of a 7 percent raise and somehow you're a monster. If you try to make any subtle, tiny change, people will say -- it's such a gimmick. And you get away with the gimmick because the media lets them get away with it.

I think it can be very effective if we put in the right amount of resources and it just can't be the United States every single time, dipping into our well, every time."

Well, there they are, water skiing, seriously. Check this out. In Quentin Connealy Cornfields, they were flooded in Nebraska, so they attached a wakeboard to an all-terrain vehicle and he went surfing among the cornstalks. Connealy is about a mile from the Missouri river in Nebraska, but he said they never seen this much rain. So while this was fun, this city boy is hoping that he finishes the rain in time to plant some more corn, my favorite summer dish. Kimberly, I hope you like corn."

We've talk -- let's see, the terror attack, President Trump's foreign trip, we talked about the Republican budget that just got proposed, and a memorial day, a little Stirewalt type of tutorial on that. And we talk about this. This is a picture of a bear -- it looks like a professional picture, right? No, on contrary, my mom, Jane Perino, took that from her car on her road trip through West Virginia."

Sadly, Aaron, an American hero perished on August 6th, 2011, along with 30 other Americans that were shot from the sky while rushing into battle. And losing Aaron really change her life, had a profound impact as you can imagine. And in this book, World Changer, she really wanted to provide parents with advice on how to raise children who will leave a mark in indelible imprint on the world, much like her fallen beloved son, Aaron. And I'm happy to say that Karen will also be my guest tomorrow night on Hannity, Sean will be on vacation for two days and I will be in for him, so you can all watch that as well."
