I just want to take this opportunity to say he was a friend, and we will miss him. Thank you for letting me do that. Well, eye to eye, National Security Adviser Sullivan said, but we shall see what happens. Afghanistan was not a great moment. I'm sure that it had something do with Russia's actions here. I'd be more impressed if we were arming, sufficiently arming the Ukrainians now. Why not javelin missiles? All I heard about was defensive missiles. What about some offensive missiles? Take some toll on the Russians, be ready to take some toll on the Russians should they invade. And the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, really, do we really think we can impose upon the Germans the willingness to give up that pipeline, having signed off on it? I wish we had more options short of what we have got. But the main thing we don't have is, I think, resoluteness in the Oval Office. That's what bothers me.",

But Germany is making some kind of positive noises that they will consider doing something about that if Russia invades Ukraine. I think the big question from today is when Jake Sullivan says he looked Putin in the eye and says we are going to do things that we didn't do in 2014, what does that mean? Does that mean canceling Russia's access to the international banking system through a program called SWIFT? Does it mean that that would in effect freeze the bank accounts of oligarchs and President Putin? That would be something that would probably hurt. But if they just do the kind of sanctions that they did in 2014, we know that didn't deter Putin from annexing Crimea. So we have to see what the U.S. and its European allies come up with that would really make a difference to Russia.",

And Mara was noting 2014, the annexation of Crimea. Don't forget 2008 and the incursion into Georgia. Putin has attempted very provocative things, and, in fact, pulled them off multiple times in recent memory. And there was an explosion in each case of sound and fury and finger wagging, and a few things happened, and Putin seems to have absorbed them. Would this time be different? Would it be painful enough? Are those threats credible and painful enough to actually deter Putin from doing something that he appears to be preparing to do? We'll see.",

The prosecutors prosecute. They go to jail, and they stay there for a long time, not this quick in and out. Also, I think the bail reform system, bail system needs to be reformed. Use the federal model. Don't make it dependent on cash and on whether people are poor or rich. Make it dependent on danger to the committee. Likelihood of that person committing another crime.
