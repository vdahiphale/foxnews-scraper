So, thank God no more people are getting killed and injured and there aren't any violent mobs roaming the streets. And that should be the model.

We don't want violence in our streets. We want to keep people safe. If you don't have safety in your communities, what do you have? Nothing else matters.

I wonder what she wants to do now as she heads towards November 3rd.  I think the point is that the more this happens to people, and the more they see that this is a mob that in effect has been supported and it really has monetarily been supported by bailing out, you know, these violent criminals from folks in the Biden campaign, people wonder, why would I vote for this?

So, we have bus tours going all across this country. We started about a month ago in our Women for Trump bus, bright pink, you can't miss it out there across the country, and we're out talking about the results produced by this president because at the end of the day, you know, women want to know specifically that the opportunities are available for them. You saw that we are 65-year low in women's unemployment among this when -- since this president took office. You've seen that, you know, the number of jobs created for women in 2019 alone, 70 percent of those new jobs created went specifically to women. We have to remind people out there, you know what, tune out the distorted and biased commentary out there and look at what this president has done and that is our strategy.",

But then sometimes voters simply vote for whoever's message is coming across loudest and clearest. So you have the state of the polls as measured -- the state of the races, excuse me, as measured by the polls which show coming out of these two weeks Biden still maintains a really strong lead ahead of President Trump, but it also shows you that coming out of the DNC, Biden didn't get the boost that Democrats had really hoped and expected he would get, which speaks, I think, to the messaging based on what the pollsters, people who do this for a living, tell us. I also have to point out, Chris, that now in the 21st century, especially in this race, this 2020 campaign season, there's another entire metric here, which is social media. And if you look at social media coming out of these two weeks, the two people who far and away blew the competition out of the water in terms of social media responses and engagement was Melania Trump on the Republican side, Michelle Obama on the Democrat side. I believe Michelle Obama had nearly seven times as much engagement on Twitter and Instagram and FaceBook as Joe Biden. And Melania Trump had nearly five times the engagement of her husband.

It could be because Joe Biden was at or near his ceiling already. With the Trump campaign being, let's say, seven or eight points behind pretty consistently, if they put on a good convention, which I think overall they really did. I think it was an achievement. And then with everything else playing out in the streets of America, which we're going to talk about in the next segment, if that combination did not add up to some sort of bump in the polling for president Trump, I think it would be close to panic button time for the campaign.

      "speaker": "L. TRUMP",
      "utterance": "Well, I think the message is that he cares about each and every American. And, you know, this is a situation where you've seen, sadly, that throughout this country, in Democrat-run cities, there -- the people that are in charge, the mayors of these cities have let their citizens down. They have not upheld the laws. They have not protected their citizens. They have not protected small businesses. The president is going there because he cares about every single American in this country, he wants to make that known. And you saw that the National Guard was able to go in fortunately to Kenosha, they quelled the violence. In about 24 hours, everything was over there. So, thank God no more people are getting killed and injured and there aren't any violent mobs roaming the streets. And that should be the model. But I think all these mayors, the Democratic mayors that are playing politics instead of looking out for the safety of their citizens should look to this and say, hey, the president has offered all of us this opportunity and they should take it."

      "speaker": "WALLACE",

      "speaker": "L. TRUMP",

      "speaker": "WALLACE",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "L. TRUMP",
      "utterance": "Well, that is never something that any of us would want to see happen. Absolutely not. I think, unfortunately, what's really bad, specifically for Joe Biden and the Biden campaign because, Chris, you might remember that it took him about three months to finally come out and condemn this violence and say that people should stop doing it. The president from day one has been saying this, and I'll reiterate what I just said in my last interview which is that the president has said I have federal resources available to every mayor and every city across this country. We don't want violence in our streets. We want to keep people safe. If you don't have safety in your communities, what do you have? Nothing else matters. And I would put the onus on Joe Biden and say, it took him a little bit too long to come out and say that this wasn't a problem, and I think it's probably because he knows that that is his base and he doesn't want to upset these people. And so, you know what? I think it was a lot worse for him."

    {
      "speaker": "KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR TO THE PRESIDENT",
      "utterance": "There was a quote today from a restaurateur in Wisconsin saying, are you protesters trying to get Donald Trump reelected? He knows full stop and I guess Mayor Pete knows full stop that the more chaos and anarchy and vandalism and violence reigns, the better it is for the very clear choice on who's best on public safety and law order."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "The better it is, she said, the more violence in the streets, the clearer the choice for voters on the issue of law and order."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "L. TRUMP",
      "utterance": "Yeah, well, I think it certainly paints a very clear picture. Look, what did we see after the convention wrapped the other night when people are leaving the White House, Chris? We saw that it was, you know, this anarchist mob that was attacking Trump's supporters, attacking Republicans. Yet you didn't see that happening on the other side. There was an opportunity at the end of the Democrats' convention where we could have had people attacking their folks. But that would never happen. It only goes one way. So, if there's one person in that crowd that for a second thought, you know what, maybe I'm going to vote for Joe Biden, maybe I'm going to vote for the Democrats, I bet their mind was changed very quickly. The people that you see, by the way, getting accosted and harassed at restaurants around Washington, D.C., I understand that one of those women, you know, was marching in the previous weeks with the BLM protests. I wonder what she wants to do now as she heads towards November 3rd. I think the point is that the more this happens to people, and the more they see that this is a mob that in effect has been supported and it really has monetarily been supported by bailing out, you know, these violent criminals from folks in the Biden campaign, people wonder, why would I vote for this? Why would I want to see this continue in America? I don't they do, and I think they know President Donald Trump is the person that has been saying this has to stop from day one and he wants to see it stopped all around this country."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "All right. Let's talk about the fall campaign because we're told that starting after Labor Day, although he's already started, the president is expected to go out a couple of times a week and hold rallies of some sort in key states around the country. This last week on Thursday, as part of the Republican convention, the president gave his acceptance speech on the South Lawn of the White House. We're showing pictures of it now. More than 1,500 people packed in, very few masks, no social distancing. Lara, is the president just going to ignore the public health guidelines?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "L. TRUMP",
      "utterance": "Well, look, we always, whether at this event you saw at the White House or any campaign event, we always encourage people to follow the guidelines and to do what they think is best for themselves. So, we always have masks available. We encourage people to use them. We always have hand sanitizer available. And we encourage people to spread themselves out. But I think you know as it always works out, people always rush towards the front of the stage. They want to be around this president. They pack themselves in. And, look, at a certain point in this country, I think we all have to recognize that people want to get back to normal. And you know what? Maybe it's going to a Trump rally that does that, but we are always following the guidelines. We had -- we had health professionals worked with our convention team the entire time. We've followed exactly what they said we should do and we'll continue to do that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "But some health officials say, you know, I mean, the fact is, you did stack the chairs right next to each other, some health officials say this has the potential to be a super spreader event."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "L. TRUMP",
      "utterance": "Yeah, well, it was an outdoor venue, and I'll remind everybody that the folks that were spitting in the faces of our people leaving the convention that night were not social distancing. There was an absolutely disgusting display. The next day, there were, you know, thousands of people on the National Mall all packed together as well. So, look we either have to say that everybody plays by the same rules, or we have to stop talking about it because whenever you're talking about the president's campaign, you know, and how people weren't specifically socially distanced, but the next day, thousands of people on the National Mall, and that's not a problem for anybody, it seems a little hypocritical."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "Let's talk about your speech to the Democratic Convention, because you made a very specific appeal to women voters and there's a reason for that. Let me put up some numbers from the campaign. In the last FOX News poll before the convention, the president is trailing Biden 51 percent to 39 percent among women, and trailing even worse 58 percent to 35 among suburban women. Lara, why does the president have such a problem with women?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "L. TRUMP",
      "utterance": "Well, I don't think is that he has a problem with women. I think it's the way that he gets portrayed by and large in the mainstream media. I think women specifically, you know, maybe don't like everything he tweets and they're more inclined to tune in to the 92 percent negative media coverage of this president. But that is why, Chris, we have to campaign, are doing everything we can to remind women, look, don't think about what this president has said, or the way he delivers a message specifically, look at what he's actually done for this country. So, we have bus tours going all across this country. We started about a month ago in our Women for Trump bus, bright pink, you can't miss it out there across the country, and we're out talking about the results produced by this president because at the end of the day, you know, women want to know specifically that the opportunities are available for them. You saw that we are 65-year low in women's unemployment among this when -- since this president took office. You've seen that, you know, the number of jobs created for women in 2019 alone, 70 percent of those new jobs created went specifically to women. We have to remind people out there, you know what, tune out the distorted and biased commentary out there and look at what this president has done and that is our strategy."

First of all, she said that Vice President Biden had -- did not quickly condemn the violence around these protests. That's absolutely not true. He came out right after George Floyd was killed back in May and said there's no place for violence. He said it forcefully again this week. So that's simply not true. But the other thing we heard her say is, you know, don't listen to what Donald Trump has said. Well, a president's words matter. They matter. Part of the reason that we are in these state of chaos that we're in, in this country is because Donald Trump has failed to lead on the coronavirus, he failed to take it seriously from the outset, and he's failed to be a uniter, he's failed to lead, as we've been grappling with this moment of racial injustice in this country. So I just -- I wanted to address that from the outset because --"

In a \"Washington Post\" poll this month, 42 percent of white suburban voters said Biden would make them less safe from crime, 22 percent said he would make them more safe from crime. That's a 22 -- a 20 point deficit. Is -- how is the vice president going to deal with the fact that a lot of suburban voters, a lot of voters, are now hearing, at least, what the president is saying, which is that he's going to protect them, and maybe the vice president won't?"

The chaos that suburban voters are feeling and that voters all across this country are feeling is the result of Donald Trump's failed leadership.

Look at -- look at his proposals. The proof is in the proposals. And I think the proof is also in -- in his career, in the way that he has worked over the course of his career across the aisle. He's worked successfully with Republicans. He's worked successfully with independents. He's worked successfully with progressive Democrats. I mean when President Obama and Joe Biden came into the White House, Joe Biden got three Republican votes for the Recovery Act. The single biggest clean energy investment in this country, the single biggest investment in - - in bringing us back from the brink of nearly economic collapse in 2009. He did that by reaching across the aisle, by being able to get Republican votes. It's something he's been able to do his entire career. It's something he'll be able to do as president."

This guy will take the country in the wrong direction. But I'm not sure I've heard both candidates describe the choice in this election in such apocalyptic terms.

I think it's interesting to see both campaigns seemingly agree, vigorously, on the proposition that this election is not only the most important of our lifetimes, which we hear every two to four years, but the most important election in the history of the country. They agree on that. And if you watched both conventions, and I had the great joy of watching every minute of both, they said repeatedly, both parties made the argument that basically America is on the ballot and if their side loses, America as we know it, America in general, will be badly damaged or could, in fact, slip away. And I wonder how many voters truly agree with that and I wonder if that's a healthy thing for our republic. Overall, I would imagine probably not. But that is exactly the argument being advanced. It's not by one side, it is by both sides. And it's going to be polarized and intense down the stretch."

This is a pure mobilization effort at this point. Get out your base by scaring your base about the threat posed by the other guy's base. And I must say, there must surely be some voters out there, probably a lot, who are kind of bewildered by this choice, not excited by the -- being forced to look at their country in these terms. But that is the way our two political parties are campaigning."

They obviously wanted to point out the -- President Trump's accomplishments, Joe Biden's failings, but -- but here's where I would disagree a bit with -- with Chuck. And -- and we heard this from Lara Trump, which was that I think they did want to try to persuade some people who like the president's policies but don't like his tone. Here -- here's an example of that during the convention."

      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "Gillian, how well do you think the convention made the case to try to persuade people who like what the president does but have real problems with the way the president does it to, in effect, almost give them -- and this I guess is probably primarily women, to give them a permission structure despite their concerns about the president, to still vote for him."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GILLIAN TURNER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "I think that's really the key question that gets to the meat of the issue for probably most American voters. You know Chuck just said that sometimes it's a choice between good and evil. Sometimes it's a choice between, you know, hate and love, I guess, for lack of a better word. Chuck didn't use that word. But then sometimes voters simply vote for whoever's message is coming across loudest and clearest. So you have the state of the polls as measured -- the state of the races, excuse me, as measured by the polls which show coming out of these two weeks Biden still maintains a really strong lead ahead of President Trump, but it also shows you that coming out of the DNC, Biden didn't get the boost that Democrats had really hoped and expected he would get, which speaks, I think, to the messaging based on what the pollsters, people who do this for a living, tell us. I also have to point out, Chris, that now in the 21st century, especially in this race, this 2020 campaign season, there's another entire metric here, which is social media. And if you look at social media coming out of these two weeks, the two people who far and away blew the competition out of the water in terms of social media responses and engagement was Melania Trump on the Republican side, Michelle Obama on the Democrat side. I believe Michelle Obama had nearly seven times as much engagement on Twitter and Instagram and FaceBook as Joe Biden. And Melania Trump had nearly five times the engagement of her husband. So I'll leave it to the political analysts to tell you what that means, but it is significant."

      "speaker": "BENSON",
      "utterance": "Well, I'd love to see some stronger polling, better polling in the next let's say three or four days. There are a few surveys that are dripping out that suggest there's maybe a small bounce for the Trump campaign. I think they really needed a bounce out of this week because the Democrats, as Gillian said, didn't get any bounce out of their convention, but that may not be because they put on a bad convention. It could be because Joe Biden was at or near his ceiling already. With the Trump campaign being, let's say, seven or eight points behind pretty consistently, if they put on a good convention, which I think overall they really did. I think it was an achievement. And then with everything else playing out in the streets of America, which we're going to talk about in the next segment, if that combination did not add up to some sort of bump in the polling for president Trump, I think it would be close to panic button time for the campaign. So I think for now, if I had to guess, I think he'll get a couple points. I think that will pull things closer to a margin of error race, but still a Biden lead. And the debates are looming and could be potentially decisive."

      "speaker": "LANE",
      "utterance": "I guess I see it similarly to Guy. I'd say after all the conventions, a marginal advantage to Trump, surprisingly enough, because he was so far behind. And I think one little tell is that Joe Biden is not just leaving the basement of his house, he's going to Minnesota, where the polls have really tightened and in that particular Great Lakes state, which is usually a Democratic state, the fact that Joe Biden feels he has to campaign there I think suggests that they're concerned about that, you know, white, working class belt up there where they lost the election last time and even in a place like Minnesota."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "Yes, that's interesting, Chuck, because, of course, as somebody who covered the Reagan campaign in 1984, that's the only state that the Democrats won and -- but -- but Trump almost won it. I think the margin was 1.5, 2 points in 2016. So if -- if -- I agree with you, if the Democrats are worried about Minnesota, that's not good."

Gillian, it seems to me the two campaigns have two very different theories about how this race is going to run. That the -- the Biden campaign is focused on the coronavirus and how it has been and should be handled. The Trump campaign focusing much more on violence in the cities and this question of far left social policy. We'll get to that second part in a moment. But, Gillian, who do you think, at this point, is winning the argument over the coronavirus?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TURNER",
      "utterance": "Well, for months the conventional wisdom has been that if voters go to the poll focused on coronavirus, that's going to help former Vice President Joe Biden. If they go to the polls focused instead on law and order, that is going to help President Trump. But the real problem the country faces, Chris, has now entirely transcended that dynamic because over the last two months we have really entered territory where domestic terrorism is becoming systemic. Whenever you have groups of American gunning down other Americans in the streets because of the color of their skin or because of what they believe, that is the very definition of domestic terrorism. It's not a problem that can be solved in one -- with one vote or even in one election season. We now have a terrorism problem, not a politics problem. I don't know how you solve that quickly. I don't believe there's a country in history where it has been solved over the course of one election."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "Guy, do you agree with that, that the question of disorder in the streets, and I -- I guess what Gillian's talking about when she says domestic terrorism is some of the violence by protestors and some of the violence by counter protestors. Do you think that that has now eclipsed the virus as people's top concern?"

    {
      "speaker": "BENSON",
      "utterance": "I'm not sure it's the top concern, but it's a growing concern and I think that's part of the reason why President Trump may have some momentum in this race. But I can't really envision a scenario where two months from now, in a few days, you know, so you've -- you've said the number of days, roughly two months away from this election, where coronavirus will not be the biggest issue hanging over everything. And I would say, they're related, actually, in a number of ways. The other big issues, if you will, are economic concerns that are tied almost exclusively to coronavirus. And I think some of this violence and anger and unrest in the streets is fueled by this environment that we've all lived through for the last number of months where people are kind of losing their minds. And I think that goes back to lockdowns and all of these other fears that have been simmering and stewing. So it's -- it's a sort of toxic mix of issues, but looming over all of it is coronavirus. And I think how that is looking, how the facts on the ground are looking on the virus itself in let's say mid to late October, that could be a decision making event or situation for many, many voters. They're feeling better. They might give Donald Trump a second chance. If they're not feeling better or feeling worse, then I think it's almost impossible for the president to win re-election."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "LANE",
      "utterance": "Well, I think when people say they're concerned about the coronavirus, they are sometimes not necessarily saying the same concern that they have. I mean everybody, I guess, is afraid of getting sick. There are a lot of people, when you say, are you concerned about the coronavirus, they are the ones who are saying, well, I'm concerned because my freedom of movement is being taken away and my small business is suffering and the lockdowns are an overreaction. And on that length, I think, Trump wants to talk about the coronavirus. And you heard a little bit in -- in those clips. But I think what's interesting here is the coronavirus has kind of been in our system now since March. The urban violence, particularly in Kenosha where so much was destroyed, is kind of like a fresher, newer -- fresher is a bad word, but is a newer element in the political system, in the political situation that is now newly being factored into a lot of people's thinking. And -- and it has given the president an opportunity to kind of change the subject a little bit from the coronavirus because of that."

But this one seems so obvious to me, that -- that the Democratic message early on, and certainly at the convention, should have been, look, we're against police brutality, we're against, you know, the -- whether it's Kenosha, which hadn't happened  yet, or George Floyd, which had happened. On the other hand, we're also against an overreaction by protestors and violence and chaos in the streets, like Portland. Did the Democrats make a huge, unforced error in not making exactly that point at their convention?"

You have to always start with the point here that the killing of George Floyd by police officers was the original sin that ignited the summers round of rioting and protesting. It's very hard to say that that was a mistake, however, because the second you start condemning the counter violence, it creates room for what we've seen, which is the abuses by law enforcement. My father and my husband, half my family comes from a country, South Africa, where black people have bene, for a period of time, several decades, were routinely killed for being unruly. That's not a country any of us Americans really want to live in. So I think Biden's trying to tow that line. It's very politically risky territory --"

Am I wrong?"

      "speaker": "BENSON",
      "utterance": "No, you're right, it shouldn't be hard, and yet it was impossible for the Democrats to even make that distinction once over four nights. So respectfully I disagree with my friend Gillian, I think it's pretty clear cut. Democrats made a mistake. They decided not to address or even acknowledge that there were riots in the streets and now they're trying to clean up because it's becoming an issue that could hurt them. But it could be too little too late in some respects."
