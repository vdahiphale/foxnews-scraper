Now the president wants to spend billions of tax dollars to ensure that Americans are incentivized, that electric vehicles are the future.   Just a little while ago, the president even had a chance to hop into the driver's seat of Ford's latest electric vehicle. This is going to be the F- 150 Lightning. It's going to be unveiled tomorrow, but the White House certainly seeing this as a chance to convince Congress that now's the time to spend billions of dollars within the American Jobs Plan on electric vehicles, including $100 million to spend on rebates to convince people to get into this, also to get money to get 500,000 charging stations online by the year 2030.",

He had them over at the White House. Now he's sending his Cabinet secretaries to speak with them. But now we're also seeing this pushback from Democrats that say they don't want to see the White House leave their priorities behind.  We will see if there's any middle ground.

And we ended up spending I think it was $1.9 trillion there. Infrastructure is going to be arguably more popular than that. That came at a time when we could see COVID was kind of ebbing a bit. And since then, it has proven to be the case.   Here, everyone loves infrastructure. But when you hear, let's go big, let's go fast, does that sound like it would end up being done efficiently, maybe giving time for markets to adapt to it?  I know the Big Three have said that they want to be all electric by 2030. Got to talk about the grid. If you move that quickly, you may not even be able to have the electricity that could do it, let alone all the stations you need to build. When you start trying to allocate resources at the trillions of dollars -- and this is $2.5 trillion. And even if you reduce roads and bridges to $600 to $800 billion, I mean, these numbers they are throwing around, the whole relief package back in '08 or '09 was that amount -- you get inefficiencies, you get mistakes. I'm one that believes we need to move into the future. It scares me when I start to see government trying to orchestrate it all. That's never worked. That's been proven in many other places.   When you have a central command economy, you start getting real sloppy, you waste money. And we're borrowing every penny of this, to boot.",

I started the Climate Caucus. The Republican Party can't be the party of no, where we don't want to engage on it.  But you still can't throw all the principles away of what's made this place so inefficient in the first place and be honest with the American public. You talk about taxes, revenue, that wouldn't even put a small dent in our normal structural deficits we run annually.

It's all about the cost, as you report, of those two-by-fours -- or I guess they're two-by-sixes in the wall over there, those costs up big time. And take a look at the numbers on single family starts in April. Just a little over a million for an annual rate. That was up -- that was down 13 percent in April, and the future not looking a whole lot brighter. Permits, which is, of course, an indication of future construction, they were about a million or so annual rate. And that was down about 4 percent as well. This, by the way, is what a building permit looks like in the city of Chicago. The problem is not getting the permits. The problem is actually getting construction going because of the costs. A lot of builders have put that off. And, consequently, here's another figure for you. The numbers of homes that have gotten a permit, but have not started construction up almost 50 percent last month, about 131,000 of those out there, and so places like this sometimes even halting construction because the lumber just costs too much, double the cost in some cases of the wood that makes these houses.

And we ended up spending I think it was $1.9 trillion there. Infrastructure is going to be arguably more popular than that. That came at a time when we could see COVID was kind of ebbing a bit. And since then, it has proven to be the case. Here, everyone loves infrastructure. But when you hear, let's go big, let's go fast, does that sound like it would end up being done efficiently, maybe giving time for markets to adapt to it? I know the Big Three have said that they want to be all electric by 2030. Got to talk about the grid. If you move that quickly, you may not even be able to have the electricity that could do it, let alone all the stations you need to build. When you start trying to allocate resources at the trillions of dollars -- and this is $2.5 trillion. And even if you reduce roads and bridges to $600 to $800 billion, I mean, these numbers they are throwing around, the whole relief package back in '08 or '09 was that amount -- you get inefficiencies, you get mistakes. I'm one that believes we need to move into the future. It scares me when I start to see government trying to orchestrate it all. That's never worked. That's been proven in many other places.

I started the Climate Caucus. The Republican Party can't be the party of no, where we don't want to engage on it. But you still can't throw all the principles away of what's made this place so inefficient in the first place and be honest with the American public. You talk about taxes, revenue, that wouldn't even put a small dent in our normal structural deficits we run annually.

And I think that's where a lot of the focus needs to be, is on the White House, asking them to reevaluate their policies that are driving this crisis at the end of the day."

And as -- you heard about his kids were just playing, and he had to step in. The migrant was so injured, though, from the journey, that he ended up getting some Tylenol and helping him -- helping him back on his journey again, and trying to make sure that he didn't -- this wasn't a migrant that died right there on his property. But the resources, I mean, what are these small towns going to do? I mean, if it's unsustainable, how much can they -- how much longer can they hang on and deal with this crisis themselves?"

And so they want to protect them and make sure that they continue to thrive. But the federal government has a fundamental responsibility here in making sure that those communities are safe and securing that border. And what we have seen time and time again is that the Biden administration is not interested in border security and immigration enforcement. It's the law of the land. They need to uphold that rule of law, so that we send a signal to these cartels and to these smugglers and others that sending people in the hundreds and thousands across the border is no longer acceptable, they will be returned, they will be removed from the United States. And until we do that, again, we're going to continue to see these numbers and the stories like you have mentioned."

The Biden administration has all the tools that it needs administratively and through the executive branch to solve this crisis at the end of the day. They first need to do that. They first need to restore law and order to the border. And then I think we can have a larger conversation about immigration reform in a variety of different other areas."

Now, rockets from Gaza of the militant group Hamas once again raining down on Southern and Central Israel today. Most of them were knocked out by Israel's Iron Dome defense system. But a few got through, leaving casualties and damage. After a brief pauses more than to allow much needed aid to get into battered Gaza, Israeli airstrikes once again picked up the targets, militant strongholds and their vast network of tunnels. And that's not the only way that Israel is waging war. Take a look of what we saw today."

Now, Sandra, let's get back to that cease-fire talk. It's desperately needed on all sides. One report said that Hamas was willing to stop Thursday morning if Israel would stop. No confirmation of that. And another report says Israel is willing to halt actions in two or three days, when it's satisfied it's done the job. No confirmation of that either.

This has -- runs the risk of spilling over to a larger regional conflict, which is why the previous administration's approach towards the region was to push back Iran. Iran is the country that's fueling and funding Hamas, this militant organization in among the Palestinian people. And the previous administration supported Israel, which the Biden administration is kind of doing this both sides thing, which can perpetuate the conflict. So, Israel is not going to stop counterattacking Hamas until Hamas ceases attacking Israel. And so that is the first step that needs to happen. And I don't think Israel -- nor do I blame them -- is going to stop unless they're satisfied that they have destroyed the targets that continue to be launched against their own people."

President Biden should denounce that. Speaker Pelosi should clearly denounce that. This is not the time to play politics. So, they need to marginalize -- marginalize those voices that are radical and anti-Semitic, because it's fueling the flames. So, right now, the Biden administration needs to be clear in defending Israel, without -- without pause and without hesitation."

And so if you -- if you kind of get squishy on that, and if the Biden administration goes soft on Israel and continues to reach out to Iran -- again, Iran is funding Hamas -- then you have all these other Arab states that start to lose confidence in the dynamics in the region. And they have got their own constituencies that see the region. If they if they see that the Palestinians now have some oxygen, some credibility within the United States' Congress or the White House, then that again destabilizes things. And so you can see larger destabilization throughout the Middle East. And so you have really got to tamp this down, got to get this under control, and get back to the paradigm that was working over the last four years."

And then here they are completely overturning the great progress made because of American leadership, because the United States did support our allies and partners who shared interests. And so it was the Biden administration going back to what they thought was the right way to go, which is reaching out to Iran and going back to this failed Iran deal that didn't stop Iran from pursuing a nuclear weapon. It just flushed Iran with cash, which they turned around, didn't help their own people, instead funded these proxy states. That's how we got here so fast."

And you had a Nancy Pelosi standing behind him. Everybody's double- vaxxed, double-masked, and six feet apart. And this is not -- this is not leadership right now during COVID-19.

If you want to wear a mask, then so be it. Every Democrat that wants to wear a mask or Republican should be able to wear a mask. But for those who, like myself, I had a really severe case of COVID-19. I have been vaccinated. I had two vaccinations. I should be able to have the choice on wearing that mask or not.

Meanwhile, we know lawmakers are huddling with the president, trying to hash out some sort of deal. We obviously know your party is criticizing this administration for pushing these massive spending plans. And, as I was speaking to Senator Braun top of the hour, he was saying how, in so many cases, he doesn't see any Republican proposals -- proposals in these spending plans.

I know that a number of Republicans have met with the Biden administration on multiple occasions now, trying to find a way to make a deal on this infrastructure package. The problem is, we're just so far apart. And this infrastructure proposal initially was so bad, the administration had to rename it to the American Jobs Plan. And so, right now, the number is too big. And only 6 percent of it that they're talking about, only 6 percent of that package would actually go to roads and bridges, 1 percent to airports, less than 1 percent to our waterways and ports. That's not infrastructure. When you're spending $100 billion on school lunches, rather than traditional infrastructure, no one's going to be able to agree on that. It needs to be a much smaller package. And it needs to be singularly focused on traditional infrastructure to find a bipartisan way forward, in my opinion."

It's all about the cost, as you report, of those two-by-fours -- or I guess they're two-by-sixes in the wall over there, those costs up big time. And take a look at the numbers on single family starts in April. Just a little over a million for an annual rate. That was up -- that was down 13 percent in April, and the future not looking a whole lot brighter. Permits, which is, of course, an indication of future construction, they were about a million or so annual rate. And that was down about 4 percent as well. This, by the way, is what a building permit looks like in the city of Chicago. The problem is not getting the permits. The problem is actually getting construction going because of the costs. A lot of builders have put that off. And, consequently, here's another figure for you. The numbers of homes that have gotten a permit, but have not started construction up almost 50 percent last month, about 131,000 of those out there, and so places like this sometimes even halting construction because the lumber just costs too much, double the cost in some cases of the wood that makes these houses.

So, on one hand, she says, oh, we will gain competitiveness. But she's actually saying we won't. So I don't know what book -- what economics 101 book she was reading.

Look, there was a legislative analyst's office did a study for the sugary drink tax in California just a couple of years ago. And the two benefits that they found from taxing sugary drinks, one was, you get revenue for California. And, two, you would get less sugary drinks sold, because -- and it increased the health of Californians because of the tax. So, they know -- the Democrats know this.

What we really should be discussing is Biden's infrastructure plan and how the buy-American proposal would actually incentivize manufacturers to hire more Americans to create products sold right here at home, instead of shifting them overseas, which is what many corporations are doing right now."

      "utterance": "Many of President Biden's critics pointing out that it seems that he took a page from the Trump playbook with that buy-American slogan. Gary, I want to ask you about this and switch gears. Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont. Have you seen this? He's saying his states now going to pay $1,000 bonuses to the first 10,000 long-term unemployed workers who land a job. All of this coming as lots of businesses that we're hearing from say those extended federal unemployment benefits are keeping potential workers at home. So, Gary, look what Connecticut is having to do to get people through the door, apply for jobs, and hopefully get a job and get off of this government assistance."

      "speaker": "KALTBAUM",
      "utterance": "First, we have actual businesses having to compete with government using tax dollars being handed out the people that decide to stay home. And now you have to have a state compete with the federals on how much money is being put out by you taking another benefit to replace the first benefit. What Connecticut should do is like 20 other governors have done and get rid of that benefit I can promise you, in those states, employment is going to pick up in a big way. And all these restaurants and service industries that are dying for employees right now will start getting them again. Simple rule. Connecticut, don't give that another thing. Just get people back to work."

      "speaker": "SMITH",
      "utterance": "Well, Kristal, we know a lot of people needed help during the pandemic and help was certainly there. But at this point, to Gary's point, 22 states have now decided, governors of those states, have ended the federal extended unemployment benefits, because businesses were complaining they just couldn't get anybody to come back to work."

      "speaker": "KNIGHT",
      "utterance": "Well, the government, the federal government needs to raise the minimum wage; $7.25 is -- it just doesn't work. That math doesn't add up. When people are thinking about going back to minimum wage jobs, and a single parent is thinking about putting their kid in childcare, how can they compete with unemployment and just sitting at home and making money that way, while watching their kids are doing whatever it is that they need to do? And so the math doesn't add up. Companies need to raise the pay that they're paying workers. And the federal government needs to raise the minimum wage."

    {
      "speaker": "LAMBERT",
      "utterance": "Well, it's just an example of more micromanagement by the government. They need to get out of the way. They need to stop competing with private businesses. The governor -- it makes no sense. He's saying, if you have been unemployed for eight to 12 weeks, you can apply for it. So, if you have been unemployed for six weeks, what are you going to do? You're going to sit there and stay unemployed until the eight weeks comes, and then you're going to go look for a job. And if you leave the job -- you're getting paid up front. If you leave the job, what are they going to do, go back and get the money from you? They're not going to be able to do that. So, this is just another basically gimmick, quite frankly, that's not going to work."
