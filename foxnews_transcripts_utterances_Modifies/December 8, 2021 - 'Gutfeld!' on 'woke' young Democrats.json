      "sentences": "Happy Wednesday, everyone. So it turns out there are only two sexual orientations, leftists and everyone else. It's true. According to a new poll, 71 percent of Democrat college students wouldn't go on a date with someone with opposing views versus only 31 percent of Republicans. That's a difference of like a thousand percent, Kat. Yes. Although 40 percent of young Dems refuse to be friends with the other side compared to just five percent of Republicans. So apparently the newly woke prefer to judge you as good or evil based on political affiliation, which can explain how a child rapist rioter attacking someone in Kenosha suddenly became a martyr. Also 30 percent of Dems but only seven percent of Republicans wouldn't work for someone who voted differently from them, which sucks for Democrats since all bosses are Republicans. But on the bright side, Democrats everyone at the unemployment office, they vote blue. Gender affects the divide and that fewer women would go on a date with someone who voted for an opposing candidate than men. Probably because men don't see politics when they see hotness. Meaning if a guy has sex with a woman who looks like a young Brigitte Bardot and suddenly notices her Obama tattoo, I'm pretty sure that won't be a deal breaker. Fact is if we saw politics before looks, politics wouldn't exist, because neither would we. The study also shows fewer women would shop at a business owned by someone of the other party. Although I'm sure that changes when there's this shoe sale. Am I right, Kat?",

If you're for strong law enforcement, you must hate minorities. If you want school choice, you must be a domestic terrorist. All of these beliefs, however, are not original. They are dispersed by the triple t-shirt cannon. That is the media academia and the arts. They're the Super Soakers of bad ideas. And there's nothing unique or rebellious about them. And once again, we find that tolerance as practiced by the left is as real as Kat's hair. Oh. It's not tolerance if you tolerate only those who accept your beliefs. It's just like how anti racist really means racist. So where does this new hate actually come from? It's not like it's simply erupts in the brain, it's exactly at the same age for everyone. It's not like puberty where you suddenly get aroused by the legs of an ottoman. And by you, I mean me, or like Kat where she suddenly her voice is deeper than James Earl Jones.",

      "sentences": "Nope. Hate is assigned to you like a social security number from somewhere else. Think about it. All those deranged political kids used to be OK. They were part of loving families. At some point, Buffy was a decent, fun loving, open minded kid who played well with others. And then one day like a remake of Invasion of the Body Snatchers. That spirit of fun and cooperation got replaced by robotic rage. The kid comes home infused with anger and their youthful good looks deliberately defaced like the side of a graffiti covered train sitting on the tracks. The cheap piercings, the horribly-dyed shaved hair. The ugliness is the work uniform for the unemployable. If you don't know what I mean, just Google Antifa mug shots, or go to the Supercut's web site. So the transformation is no product of some biochemical change. It's so conforming, that it tells you it's a well packaged ideological virus designed to pitch human against human. The Shia and the Sunni is have nothing on us. That's wokeism which relies only on one single variable, identity. This dark spiteful movement is given a wide berth because normal people are terrified of them. It's like being berated by a homeless guy high on bath salts. It's better to appease that become a target of a mostly peaceful protest. But beneath these superficial changes, looks at dark fascism that's fed daily on campus by elites who decide the best way to get revenge against a country they despise is to poison impressionable minds and then release them into the wild. It's not that they won't want to work for you or don't want to date you, they want you destroyed. They want to cancel you. Your business, your bank account, your right to free speech. It's what brought us Antifa and the riots. Being politically apart to them means the same thing it does to a serial killer who has you tied to a radiator in his basement. They can do anything to you and they will. They're not robbing expensive handbags. They're punching Hitler by stealing expensive handbags. So maybe it's time for a national intervention. Back in the eras of cult. Cults, we call the deprogramming. And today this is a cult and like a cult, they take impressionable people and isolate them from any family or friends that hold a different view to take advantage of them. So where do they go after college when they can't date, converse or work with half the population and their only skills are painting crude signs and making a decent Molotov cocktail. They become more and more reliant on the colt, or they get a job at CNN.",

Actually, we'll be -- we'll be rewriting it on \"THE FIVE\" tomorrow. But try telling the New York Times that it's the fault of a homeless man. The rags headline reads Fox News Christmas tree catches fire in Manhattan. Catches fire. Isn't that cute? I guess they only ever hate crimes when they're phony. So our tree caught fire spontaneously just like Kenosha did or SUVs that magically drive into crowds. Maybe the truth -- he pulled Smollett and torched itself while it was getting a sandwich. Yes. You know what, maybe the tree was asking for it. That's what it gets for wearing that short skirts. Called the skirt. But sadly, season's greetings have turned into seasons beatings. New NYPD data shows there have been 503 hate in bias crimes doubling last year's output. There are 129 hate crimes against Asians that's up from 28 from last year, 183 anti- Semitic crimes compared to 121 last year. The NYPD commissioner says it's driven by lower incarceration rates. Who would have thought? Case in point, this freak was busted after attacking to women and back to back beatings this month that left them hospitalized. But surprise, he was out on liberal bail reform after a similar attack last year. And get this, the D.A.'s office says these new charges weren't enough to hold him on bail. So he's already out under supervised monitoring of course, which I'm sure will be a great comfort to his next female victim.",

      "utterance": "Happy Wednesday, everyone. So it turns out there are only two sexual orientations, leftists and everyone else. It's true. According to a new poll, 71 percent of Democrat college students wouldn't go on a date with someone with opposing views versus only 31 percent of Republicans. That's a difference of like a thousand percent, Kat. Yes. Although 40 percent of young Dems refuse to be friends with the other side compared to just five percent of Republicans. So apparently the newly woke prefer to judge you as good or evil based on political affiliation, which can explain how a child rapist rioter attacking someone in Kenosha suddenly became a martyr. Also 30 percent of Dems but only seven percent of Republicans wouldn't work for someone who voted differently from them, which sucks for Democrats since all bosses are Republicans. But on the bright side, Democrats everyone at the unemployment office, they vote blue. Gender affects the divide and that fewer women would go on a date with someone who voted for an opposing candidate than men. Probably because men don't see politics when they see hotness. Meaning if a guy has sex with a woman who looks like a young Brigitte Bardot and suddenly notices her Obama tattoo, I'm pretty sure that won't be a deal breaker. Fact is if we saw politics before looks, politics wouldn't exist, because neither would we. The study also shows fewer women would shop at a business owned by someone of the other party. Although I'm sure that changes when there's this shoe sale. Am I right, Kat?"

If you're for strong law enforcement, you must hate minorities. If you want school choice, you must be a domestic terrorist. All of these beliefs, however, are not original. They are dispersed by the triple t-shirt cannon. That is the media academia and the arts. They're the Super Soakers of bad ideas. And there's nothing unique or rebellious about them. And once again, we find that tolerance as practiced by the left is as real as Kat's hair. Oh. It's not tolerance if you tolerate only those who accept your beliefs. It's just like how anti racist really means racist. So where does this new hate actually come from? It's not like it's simply erupts in the brain, it's exactly at the same age for everyone. It's not like puberty where you suddenly get aroused by the legs of an ottoman. And by you, I mean me, or like Kat where she suddenly her voice is deeper than James Earl Jones."

      "utterance": "Nope. Hate is assigned to you like a social security number from somewhere else. Think about it. All those deranged political kids used to be OK. They were part of loving families. At some point, Buffy was a decent, fun loving, open minded kid who played well with others. And then one day like a remake of Invasion of the Body Snatchers. That spirit of fun and cooperation got replaced by robotic rage. The kid comes home infused with anger and their youthful good looks deliberately defaced like the side of a graffiti covered train sitting on the tracks. The cheap piercings, the horribly-dyed shaved hair. The ugliness is the work uniform for the unemployable. If you don't know what I mean, just Google Antifa mug shots, or go to the Supercut's web site. So the transformation is no product of some biochemical change. It's so conforming, that it tells you it's a well packaged ideological virus designed to pitch human against human. The Shia and the Sunni is have nothing on us. That's wokeism which relies only on one single variable, identity. This dark spiteful movement is given a wide berth because normal people are terrified of them. It's like being berated by a homeless guy high on bath salts. It's better to appease that become a target of a mostly peaceful protest. But beneath these superficial changes, looks at dark fascism that's fed daily on campus by elites who decide the best way to get revenge against a country they despise is to poison impressionable minds and then release them into the wild. It's not that they won't want to work for you or don't want to date you, they want you destroyed. They want to cancel you. Your business, your bank account, your right to free speech. It's what brought us Antifa and the riots. Being politically apart to them means the same thing it does to a serial killer who has you tied to a radiator in his basement. They can do anything to you and they will. They're not robbing expensive handbags. They're punching Hitler by stealing expensive handbags. So maybe it's time for a national intervention. Back in the eras of cult. Cults, we call the deprogramming. And today this is a cult and like a cult, they take impressionable people and isolate them from any family or friends that hold a different view to take advantage of them. So where do they go after college when they can't date, converse or work with half the population and their only skills are painting crude signs and making a decent Molotov cocktail. They become more and more reliant on the colt, or they get a job at CNN."

Actually, we'll be -- we'll be rewriting it on \"THE FIVE\" tomorrow. But try telling the New York Times that it's the fault of a homeless man. The rags headline reads Fox News Christmas tree catches fire in Manhattan. Catches fire. Isn't that cute? I guess they only ever hate crimes when they're phony. So our tree caught fire spontaneously just like Kenosha did or SUVs that magically drive into crowds. Maybe the truth -- he pulled Smollett and torched itself while it was getting a sandwich. Yes. You know what, maybe the tree was asking for it. That's what it gets for wearing that short skirts. Called the skirt. But sadly, season's greetings have turned into seasons beatings. New NYPD data shows there have been 503 hate in bias crimes doubling last year's output. There are 129 hate crimes against Asians that's up from 28 from last year, 183 anti- Semitic crimes compared to 121 last year. The NYPD commissioner says it's driven by lower incarceration rates. Who would have thought? Case in point, this freak was busted after attacking to women and back to back beatings this month that left them hospitalized. But surprise, he was out on liberal bail reform after a similar attack last year. And get this, the D.A.'s office says these new charges weren't enough to hold him on bail. So he's already out under supervised monitoring of course, which I'm sure will be a great comfort to his next female victim."

Oh, wait, that's not ink, that's some of Stelter's barbecue sauce. Now, HarperCollins Publishers has confirmed they're no longer going to publish his book. The upcoming memoir was titled: \"Deep Denial,\" possibly referring to the belief he has talent. That's a cheap shot, but accurate. Who said that? But sadly, they're already starting a fire to burn the manuscript and melt his crayon. So, does Chris deserve to be de-platformed like this? Yes, he's an idiot, and a liar and a blowhard. But frankly, we'd rather see his book published, just to laugh at how poorly it sells. We've been cheated.
