From the excerpts and from everything we've been hearing from the White House today, it seems like they didn't make a decision, sounds like he will do a little bit of both, talking about his campaign promise to bring troops home and talking about where the country of Iraq is today. I think he's going to try to do both. I think if you try to do both you are not likely to be successful. The things that I am going to be looking for in the speech are a basic acknowledgment of the sacrifice of troops, which I expect we'll hear and hear at some length. But I hope he talks about the troops in way that treats them as warriors, not as victims. I think that is an important thing for the president to do. He hasn't done it in the past. It's an important way to talk about it. Another thing I'm hoping that he will do, but I suspect he probably won't, is to give some credit to President Bush even in passing for the surge. The success of the surge is why the president is bringing home our troops in victory, not in defeat. He opposed it and he fought it tooth and nail as we have seen from these comments.

The Democrats in the Afghan war complained for years that the Bush administration had had us at the cusp of success at the beginning of the Afghan war, turned away its attention to Iraq, and as a result we're in the mess we are now.  I think that is absolutely the wrong analysis. I don't know what the Democrats would have suggested as an alternative -- half a million Troops in Afghanistan? I can't imagine any Democrat would ever have offered that as an alternative.  The irony is, however, that here we are with Iraq on the cusp of success when the war was handed over from the Bush administration to Obama on inauguration day. We had a military success accomplished. Petraeus had done that with the surge. The problem is the Obama administration was left with one task. And it's now turned its attention away to Afghanistan and left us in a position where all Obama ever wanted to do was end the war. He talks about it now, campaign promise fulfilled, at a time when Iraq doesn't have a government, and a week after Al Qaeda in Iraq pulled off simultaneous attacks in 13 cities killing 51 Iraqis, which could not have happened in January of 2009 when Obama was inaugurated.  He had one task he has not succeeded. I'm with Michael O'Hanlon with a prescient and even-handed analysis from the Brookings Institute who says this is a mistake. You don't declare an arbitrary milestone on a fixed timetable when you have no Iraqi government and Al Qaeda is resurgent. You do it when you have a stable government and then you have a ceremony in which the president and the new leader of Iraq have a ceremony in which the transition is declared mutually acknowledged. This is premature and political and it could be very costly.",

In fact, President Karzai is now putting pressure on us to shift our strategy and go after not only Al Qaeda but Taliban over in Pakistan to make the effort over there. Secretary Gates says we have to do more in terms of fighting corruption in the country to gain the trust of the Afghan people. So all of this is taking place as we approach next June, and again, I think that is a very uncertain sort of manufactured date. I understand that everyone agreed to it, but you have to have a sense of what is the goal, why do we have Americans there in danger? Why are we put something much into it?  I think the president has to be clear this is about preventing Pakistan, preventing Afghanistan from becoming a breeding ground, and that he is willing to also go into Somalia if necessary, Yemen, whenever the terrorists are, we'll fight them.

It's a remarkable irony that you hear the same protagonists, Gates and Petraeus, as we saw in the clips, arguing in favor of a surge in Afghanistan that they argued in the Bush administration three years ago again in the tease of Democratic opposition about Iraq. Same idea.  And I think people talking about whether Obama will be gracious enough to acknowledge the success of the surge in Iraq are missing the point. I think Obama by his actions has acknowledged the success of the surge. He has the same commander, the same secretary of state, the same strategy, a reorientation of the counterinsurgency strategy of protecting the population, and the same mechanism, increasing troop level, as his previous effort that Bush had done in Iraq with success. So imitation here is the highest form of approbation. This is a guy repeating it and showing that the Iraq surge worked.

      "utterance": "Well, there are a lot of ironies here. The Democrats in the Afghan war complained for years that the Bush administration had had us at the cusp of success at the beginning of the Afghan war, turned away its attention to Iraq, and as a result we're in the mess we are now. I think that is absolutely the wrong analysis. I don't know what the Democrats would have suggested as an alternative -- half a million Troops in Afghanistan? I can't imagine any Democrat would ever have offered that as an alternative. The irony is, however, that here we are with Iraq on the cusp of success when the war was handed over from the Bush administration to Obama on inauguration day. We had a military success accomplished. Petraeus had done that with the surge. The problem is the Obama administration was left with one task. And it's now turned its attention away to Afghanistan and left us in a position where all Obama ever wanted to do was end the war. He talks about it now, campaign promise fulfilled, at a time when Iraq doesn't have a government, and a week after Al Qaeda in Iraq pulled off simultaneous attacks in 13 cities killing 51 Iraqis, which could not have happened in January of 2009 when Obama was inaugurated. He had one task he has not succeeded. I'm with Michael O'Hanlon with a prescient and even-handed analysis from the Brookings Institute who says this is a mistake. You don't declare an arbitrary milestone on a fixed timetable when you have no Iraqi government and Al Qaeda is resurgent. You do it when you have a stable government and then you have a ceremony in which the president and the new leader of Iraq have a ceremony in which the transition is declared mutually acknowledged. This is premature and political and it could be very costly."

Up next, more bloodshed in Afghanistan. GEN. DAVID PETRAEUS, U.S./NATO AFGHANISTAN COMMANDER: There is nothing easy about this. And again, it is very, very understandable that there would be impatience and a desire to see progress right now. But the nature of these endeavors is such that that progress is slow. It's hard fought. And as I mentioned earlier, the fact is that we're just now for the first time getting the input right."

      "utterance": "Defense Secretary Gates went on to say that the intensifying combat and the rise in casualties is really reminiscent of the early days of the Iraq surge. In fact, in Afghanistan, five more U.S. troops were killed today in the east and the south. In the past 72 hours, 19 American service members have been killed in Afghanistan, most from roadside bombs, the Taliban's weapon of choice. We're back with the panel. Juan?"

      "utterance": "The speech tonight on some level is about Afghanistan, because the president has to build American public support for this continued effort going forward. Where are we going, what are our goals, and what are we trying to do? It's a difficult process, as you just heard General Petraeus say. In fact, President Karzai is now putting pressure on us to shift our strategy and go after not only Al Qaeda but Taliban over in Pakistan to make the effort over there. Secretary Gates says we have to do more in terms of fighting corruption in the country to gain the trust of the Afghan people. So all of this is taking place as we approach next June, and again, I think that is a very uncertain sort of manufactured date. I understand that everyone agreed to it, but you have to have a sense of what is the goal, why do we have Americans there in danger? Why are we put something much into it? I think the president has to be clear this is about preventing Pakistan, preventing Afghanistan from becoming a breeding ground, and that he is willing to also go into Somalia if necessary, Yemen, whenever the terrorists are, we'll fight them. And that's what the military effort is about."

      "utterance": "He said as much last week. You have serving military in uniform can't contradict the president in public but who have said repeatedly in the past that they think this handcuffs it. I think the problem with Afghanistan today is we're reaching a point it's becoming clear we can't win unless the president publicly, loudly, and convincingly repudiates the deadline. He has got to do it. It was clear through the beginning it was going to be problematic. We heard from all the external parties. It is fatal and lethal to the efforts in Afghanistan. And yet largely for domestic and political purposes, as we read again in the \"New York Times\" last week, he persists in continuing with it."

      "speaker": "KRAUTHAMMER",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. It's a remarkable irony that you hear the same protagonists, Gates and Petraeus, as we saw in the clips, arguing in favor of a surge in Afghanistan that they argued in the Bush administration three years ago again in the tease of Democratic opposition about Iraq. Same idea. And I think people talking about whether Obama will be gracious enough to acknowledge the success of the surge in Iraq are missing the point. I think Obama by his actions has acknowledged the success of the surge. He has the same commander, the same secretary of state, the same strategy, a reorientation of the counterinsurgency strategy of protecting the population, and the same mechanism, increasing troop level, as his previous effort that Bush had done in Iraq with success. So imitation here is the highest form of approbation. This is a guy repeating it and showing that the Iraq surge worked. And now, ironically, of course, he's proposing a surge in Iraq, Afghanistan, which will require the kind of patience and understanding that he, Obama, as a senator never gave the previous administration."
