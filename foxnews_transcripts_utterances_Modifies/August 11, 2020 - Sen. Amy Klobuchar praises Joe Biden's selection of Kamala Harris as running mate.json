The second thing is, I guess all of us fail if you don't win and that's because Joe Biden won. And every single one of us endorsed him with joy because we think it is so important to get behind a candidate, whether you're Democrat, Republican or Independent, someone who's going to bring decency and dignity and confidence and compassion to the White House.
