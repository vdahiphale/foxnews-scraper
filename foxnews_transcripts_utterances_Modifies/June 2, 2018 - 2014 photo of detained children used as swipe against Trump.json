      "sentences": "That is CNN, folks. Stop. I don't know about you, but I am outraged out. Tweets here, c-words there, even the flying nun got involved.  I am not kidding. The flying nun is throwing the c-word around like a nasty little frisbee. What is happening to America. What is happening to people? What did we learn from this week of outrage? Well, it used to be that would cost you your job, it was that thing you did behind a tree at the company picnic.  If you are laughing, you know. No, now it is Twitter, the one stop career liquidator. All it takes is one idiotic statement and you disappear faster than a Twinkie in Michael Moore's lap. Where would I be without Michael Moore's lap? I'd be out of jokes. Okay, as the online world encourages mob action over forgiveness, companies now need to protect themselves so Twitter has become a global human resources.  As the population combines as a moral force to decide who stays and who goes. And let's not forget on Twitter, the world's bathroom wall, all inscriptions are permanent, you are branded. You are branded for life. Of course, you can't just blame Twitter. It did not write that tweet, Roseanne, and every company has the right to fire you over words. Freedom of speech without consequences only exists against the government.  But, this week the offenses were not only on twitter or by Roseanne, two women said bad things. One apologized and lost her job, one apologized and kept her job. That is life, but let's be clear, I accept all apologies. If you are sorry I accept it. I say this knowing that this favor may never be returned to me.   There are organizations devoted to catching me screw up. It is true. It is true, but I will forgive all even if they would and end me with glee. Let's do the simple exercise. If I said what Samantha Bee said about the daughter of a President how long would I last? I would be frog marched into a vat of truck drivers back sweat. I would have requested that actually, but as righties experience boycott, lefties get awards. It's not just about the offense really, it's about the tribe. And one tribe is less forgiving than the other, see, I am willing to forgive blunders, but I don't think there's reciprocity over there at the left. Why is that? Well, Krauthammer said it first, \"You think they are stupid, they thank you are evil.\" Meaning a conservative believes the liberal is mistaken, but a liberal believes a conservative is immoral.\" It's a huge difference.   The behavior toward a righty is an excuse because after all, you are bad. If someone is evil, you can do anything to them, you can mimic their beheading, you can call a mom a c-word for posting a picture of her child, you can wish death on Americans just for fun. So, we all knew Bee would survive because that's the real story. We knew she was safe. Because in the contemporary landscape, the liberal joker's heart is always in the right place. After all, Ivanka -- she had it coming. She's a mom and her dad is evil, but such logic will lead to a dark and violent place. If one group sees you as evil, what stops others from moving beyond speech? Remember the antifa, the weather underground, the uni-bomber? I bet all major violence, the kind of the mass killing variety, did not start with, \"I disagree with you.\" No, it was, \"You are evil and we must stop you.\"  Now, Trump has triggered some seriously angry people -- Kathy Griffin, the decapitator in chief. She still sees herself as the victim. There is Tom Arnold -- oh man, sad case. Chelsea Handler, what happened? Kimmel -- Oberman is back. Sarah Silverman who wanted a military coup, Robert de Niro, who threatened to punch the President. Of course, there was Alec Baldwin, then there is sad Jim Carrey, and now even the flying freaking nun.   It just breaks my heart. I loved Sally Fields. These people are so broken by Trump that they no longer see you as human but as a problem. I guess after the Obama era, all this losing is unknown territories so we are a watching a national tantrum for spoiled brats. What do you do if political adversaries want you ruined, but you just want them healthy enough so you could debate them? If they're constantly demanding scalps, shouldn't we do the same as sort of mutually assured career destruction? Is that the only way to get everyone to stop the outrage crusade? To see that it goes both ways?  I don't know. That is not me and it should not be you, either. Let's welcome tonight's guests. He has more good-humor than the ice cream man, TV writer and producer Rob Long.  Don't talk to him without a nurse because he'll put you in stitches, writer and comedian, David Angelo.  She drinks her own tears to stay hydrated, \"Natural Review\" reporter, Kat Timpf. And he stole his pinky ring from Saturn, former WWE Superstar and my massive sidekick, Tyrus.  Rob, you are a big-time Hollywood producer, \"Cheers,\" what was that other show?",

      "utterance": "That is CNN, folks. Stop. I don't know about you, but I am outraged out. Tweets here, c-words there, even the flying nun got involved. I am not kidding. The flying nun is throwing the c-word around like a nasty little frisbee. What is happening to America. What is happening to people? What did we learn from this week of outrage? Well, it used to be that would cost you your job, it was that thing you did behind a tree at the company picnic. If you are laughing, you know. No, now it is Twitter, the one stop career liquidator. All it takes is one idiotic statement and you disappear faster than a Twinkie in Michael Moore's lap. Where would I be without Michael Moore's lap? I'd be out of jokes. Okay, as the online world encourages mob action over forgiveness, companies now need to protect themselves so Twitter has become a global human resources. As the population combines as a moral force to decide who stays and who goes. And let's not forget on Twitter, the world's bathroom wall, all inscriptions are permanent, you are branded. You are branded for life. Of course, you can't just blame Twitter. It did not write that tweet, Roseanne, and every company has the right to fire you over words. Freedom of speech without consequences only exists against the government. But, this week the offenses were not only on twitter or by Roseanne, two women said bad things. One apologized and lost her job, one apologized and kept her job. That is life, but let's be clear, I accept all apologies. If you are sorry I accept it. I say this knowing that this favor may never be returned to me. There are organizations devoted to catching me screw up. It is true. It is true, but I will forgive all even if they would and end me with glee. Let's do the simple exercise. If I said what Samantha Bee said about the daughter of a President how long would I last? I would be frog marched into a vat of truck drivers back sweat. I would have requested that actually, but as righties experience boycott, lefties get awards. It's not just about the offense really, it's about the tribe. And one tribe is less forgiving than the other, see, I am willing to forgive blunders, but I don't think there's reciprocity over there at the left. Why is that? Well, Krauthammer said it first, \"You think they are stupid, they thank you are evil.\" Meaning a conservative believes the liberal is mistaken, but a liberal believes a conservative is immoral.\" It's a huge difference. The behavior toward a righty is an excuse because after all, you are bad. If someone is evil, you can do anything to them, you can mimic their beheading, you can call a mom a c-word for posting a picture of her child, you can wish death on Americans just for fun. So, we all knew Bee would survive because that's the real story. We knew she was safe. Because in the contemporary landscape, the liberal joker's heart is always in the right place. After all, Ivanka -- she had it coming. She's a mom and her dad is evil, but such logic will lead to a dark and violent place. If one group sees you as evil, what stops others from moving beyond speech? Remember the antifa, the weather underground, the uni-bomber? I bet all major violence, the kind of the mass killing variety, did not start with, \"I disagree with you.\" No, it was, \"You are evil and we must stop you.\" Now, Trump has triggered some seriously angry people -- Kathy Griffin, the decapitator in chief. She still sees herself as the victim. There is Tom Arnold -- oh man, sad case. Chelsea Handler, what happened? Kimmel -- Oberman is back. Sarah Silverman who wanted a military coup, Robert de Niro, who threatened to punch the President. Of course, there was Alec Baldwin, then there is sad Jim Carrey, and now even the flying freaking nun. It just breaks my heart. I loved Sally Fields. These people are so broken by Trump that they no longer see you as human but as a problem. I guess after the Obama era, all this losing is unknown territories so we are a watching a national tantrum for spoiled brats. What do you do if political adversaries want you ruined, but you just want them healthy enough so you could debate them? If they're constantly demanding scalps, shouldn't we do the same as sort of mutually assured career destruction? Is that the only way to get everyone to stop the outrage crusade? To see that it goes both ways? I don't know. That is not me and it should not be you, either. Let's welcome tonight's guests. He has more good-humor than the ice cream man, TV writer and producer Rob Long. Don't talk to him without a nurse because he'll put you in stitches, writer and comedian, David Angelo. She drinks her own tears to stay hydrated, \"Natural Review\" reporter, Kat Timpf. And he stole his pinky ring from Saturn, former WWE Superstar and my massive sidekick, Tyrus. Rob, you are a big-time Hollywood producer, \"Cheers,\" what was that other show?"

Like, if you are running ABC, you know you are going to have trouble with your advertisers, you can't just like ignore that. It's like half a billion dollar business that she torched. The real question is why did they not take her phone away? Right? Because every other star of a TV show, every other star of a movie had to go through something called -- you know, get a physical.

It was a premeditated hit and when they did what they did, because there was backlash, not because it was the right thing to do to look back and be like, \"Hey, that was wrong to call someone that,\" especially of it's her holding a child, which I think is (inaudible), but it was because the sponsors were like, \"No, were not good with that.\" And it's okay, I guess, because she got -- here's where it gets weird. She got away with that because she was a woman, because if I would have said that on the show, you think you guys will let it run? You guys would've been -- and Greg would be like, \"I am so sorry.

Mr. President, \"Bro, you don't apologize when your staffer said that about John McCain, no. Even if it did come out of your mouth and it was wrong, we don't apologize over here.\" That has been something that the Trump and Trump presidency and the new Trump Republicans, \"We don't apologize for nothing.\" And for him to be like, \"Why are we -- you need to apologize to this person.\" I was like, \"Come on man,\" like you've got to be messing and joking around. The right don't apologize. They just keep going.

You don't get that on \"Watters' World\". Every bad thing ever -- I love Jesse. Everything bad ever is on the head of this evil orange monster from hell. Especially if you are the media. Take these images of immigrant children sleeping in cages. Journalists, politicians, the Obama flak, they all blamed Trump. It turns out the photos are four years old and when Obama was in charge. Whoops. Then there is -- even better this photo, an all baby seat immigration detention bus, also blamed on Trump, it was called a prison bus for babies by an anchor -- a prison bus for babies. How could anyone say that with a straight face and believe it. A journalist. I mean, who would make a prison bus for babies? It's the craziest thing I've ever heard. The prison bus for babies. But you will believe anything if you hate Trump. Even though this photo was also from Obama's era and no, it wasn't a prison bus for babies. It was for a field trip.

The memo obtained by Fox News on Saturday was sent to special counsel, Robert Mueller in January. It also says the President cannot be forced to sit for an interview with investigators probing Russian meddling in the 2016 election. And in Santa Fe, Texas, Friday night more than 300 seniors receiving their high school diplomas about two weeks after a deadly mass shooting at their high school, ten people including eight students were killed. Seniors from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida graduate Sunday. A gun may killed four of their classmates along with 13 others on Valentine's Day.

They had never seen anything like it. The line to get in wrapped around the block just get a taste of a capitalist burger. One year later, the Soviet Union dissolved.
