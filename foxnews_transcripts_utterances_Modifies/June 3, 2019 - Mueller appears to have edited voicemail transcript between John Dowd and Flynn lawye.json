      "sentences": "And it is a big breaking news night. Thank you, Tucker. Great show as always. We begin tonight. This is a Fox News alert: a district court judge tossed out a lawsuit from House Democrats who are seeking an injunction against the president's emergency border wall funding. This is a huge decision. A big step forward for border security, and a big win for President Trump who has vowed he will build miles and miles of wall in the next two years.  We'll have more on this breaking story in a moment.  Also tonight, the president continues as all important state visit to the United Kingdom, but back here at home, Robert Mueller's true colors have now been laid bare for everybody to see, damning new evidence tonight, now reveals that the special counsel literally scrubbed important exculpatory evidence from a very key section of his report.  Now, this all surrounds a transcript from the former Trump attorney, John Dowd, whose words were significantly altered, seemingly on purpose, in order to smear the president of the United States. Now, John Dowd will join us exclusively as well as Professor Alan Dershowitz, we'll get to that in a moment.  First, we start and turn our attention to a new bombshell discovery just released also from judicial watch. Just hours ago, they obtained 218 new pages of e-mails between Strzok and Page. Now, the biased, high-ranking FBI love birds left a paper trail of corruption a mile long. And tonight, we can now report that it leads back to Hillary Clinton and James Comey and oddly, even, I would argue, Loretta Lynch. Newly released e-mails showed the FBI totally and completely failed to document significant interviews with at least four key witnesses as a result of the Clinton e-mail investigation. In other words, no 302s, nothing was recorded, no reports, nothing. It's as if the interviews never happened.  And that's not all. The e-mails also reveal how then FBI general counsel, James Baker, ordered the bureau to expedite requests from Hillary Clinton's attorneys writing, quote, in my view, we need to move as quickly as possible. In other words, tonight we were right all along, yes, the investigation to Hillary Clinton was rigged, the fix was in. Comey and Loretta Lynch were always going to clear Hillary Clinton, their chosen candidate, of all of the charges as quickly as possible so she could claim her rightful throne.  As Sara Carter put it, the investigation was a total and complete joke and that's why Comey, Strzok and others authored Hillary Clinton's exoneration letter, that happened in May of 2016 before they ever interviewed Hillary or 17 other key witnesses. And also, they changed the language, very significant from the legal standard of gross negligence using the words \"extreme carelessness\" that has no weight in the legal world.   And while Comey's inner circle was working to clear Hillary Clinton as quickly as possible, well, they made a huge mistake. It appears they accidentally granted Clinton's attorneys access to top secret classified material found on her private server even though the legal team lacked the proper clearances. As James Comey should know, mishandling information, yes, that is a serious crime, 18 USC 793. And Comey should think about beefing up his own legal team. And also today, the least self-aware person in the entire world, Hillary Clinton tweeted, quote, I don't know who needs to hear this, but the president is not above the law. Neither are you, Hillary. I have news for you. No one is above the law, not even a twice-failed presidential candidate and former secretary of state.   In fact, as \"The Hill's\" John Solomon has just released in a new article tonight, pointing out there are still very pressing questions around so many aspects of Hillary Clinton's seedy actions like why did the Clinton Foundation rake in millions and millions and millions of dollars from foreign governments while Hillary Clinton was serving as secretary of state? Why did she sign off on giving 20 percent of America's uranium to Vladimir Putin after a foundation received a sizable donation from Uranium One executives, both before and after? And why did the Clinton campaign pay a former spy, a foreign spy, Christopher Steele, to put together a dossier with lies and disinformation about Donald Trump during the height of the election? And why did she delete the 33,000 subpoenaed e-mails and destroy the evidence with hammers and Bleach Bit? Well, we know the answer. The intent was the underlying crime of the Espionage Act, and that would be called destroying the evidence. And most importantly, how she's not charged with any crime to date is unconscionable. It's time we all demand equal justice because Hillary -- remember, no one is above the law. We're going to have more of my opening monologue in a moment, but first, joining us with reaction to the breaking news, we have Judicial Watch chairman Tom Fitton, also FOX News investigative reporter, Sara Carter.  Tom, we begin with you. I guess there are numerous big headlines out of this. Not the least of which, Tom, is that we have four specific witnesses in the Clinton e-mail case. The FBI failed to document anything, nothing.   And don't forget, the time they finally interviewed her, which was July 2nd, three days before James Comey had his 15-minute press conference, pretty much laying out the case how she violated the law, if you remember back to that date, she had two people allowed in the room with her, which is totally unprecedented.",

And the shocking level of bias corruption at the highest levels of our bureaucracy clearly knows no bounds. And tonight, we have sadly even more evidence proving Mueller's witch hunt was nothing more than a political hit job according to newly uncovered documents. We now know that the special counsel's report literally, Mueller's report, altered a voice mail transcript from Trump attorney John Dowd. Now, in the voice mail, Dowd was asking the Clinton legal team to give him a heads up should any national security issues arise out of his newly formed cooperation with the Mueller investigation.  Now, remember for a long time, Team Flynn, they had a joint defense agreement with all of the other lawyers involve in this particular matter.  And this is by the way typical, a typical privileged call between attorneys. But the report made it seem nefarious. Because Mueller conveniently omitted Dowd's words and statement that this request was, quote, not only for the president, but for the country and then he wasn't asking for any confidential information. In other words, there was nothing untoward or illegal or nefarious about Dowd's request, nothing at all. Well, you wouldn't know that from the official Mueller report. Full exculpatory evidence was now purposefully withheld and it was meant to create a false perception among the American people.  So, make no mistake, this probably has Andrew Weissmann's fingerprints all over it, he's a pit bull of Mueller. You know, he made a career out of withholding exculpatory president, the same Andrew Weissmann at Hillary's victory party in November of 2016. Two of his most high profile cases were overturned because of his prosecutorial misconduct for innocent Merrill Lynch executives, they spent a year in prison because of Weissmann, and that was overturned. Thousands of Anderson accounting, Americans, losing their jobs because of Weissmann, losing 9-0 in the Supreme Court. So, it's pretty close -- crystal clear tonight the Hillary-loving bureaucrat played a pretty central role in the Mueller investigation.  Now, Congressman Devin Nunes, formerly the chair of the House Intel Committee, now the ranking member, is calling the report a total fraud.  And former FBI official Kevin Brock wrote that the government behaved like a bully.  And I guarantee, today's discovery is only the tip of the iceberg. Well, that's not stopping the outright delusion inside of the radical extreme new Democratic socialist party. They don't care about the truth because their political blood lust is that strong. From Congressman Nadler to James Clyburn, top Democrats everywhere now openly advocating for impeachment, over what? None of them have been able to give a reason for why Trump should be impeached except collusion, except we have four exonerations at this point. Four separate investigations, the FBI investigation, House Intel investigation, bipartisan Senate investigation, and the Mueller report even as abusively biased as it was.  No obstruction, no conspiracy, no conclusion. Collusion, but none of that seems to matter to the Democrats or their best friends in the media mob.  Take a look.",

      "utterance": "a district court judge tossed out a lawsuit from House Democrats who are seeking an injunction against the president's emergency border wall funding. This is a huge decision. A big step forward for border security, and a big win for President Trump who has vowed he will build miles and miles of wall in the next two years.  We'll have more on this breaking story in a moment. Also tonight, the president continues as all important state visit to the United Kingdom, but back here at home, Robert Mueller's true colors have now been laid bare for everybody to see, damning new evidence tonight, now reveals that the special counsel literally scrubbed important exculpatory evidence from a very key section of his report. Now, this all surrounds a transcript from the former Trump attorney, John Dowd, whose words were significantly altered, seemingly on purpose, in order to smear the president of the United States. Now, John Dowd will join us exclusively as well as Professor Alan Dershowitz, we'll get to that in a moment. First, we start and turn our attention to a new bombshell discovery just released also from judicial watch. Just hours ago, they obtained 218 new pages of e-mails between Strzok and Page. Now, the biased, high-ranking FBI love birds left a paper trail of corruption a mile long. And tonight, we can now report that it leads back to Hillary Clinton and James Comey and oddly, even, I would argue, Loretta Lynch. Newly released e-mails showed the FBI totally and completely failed to document significant interviews with at least four key witnesses as a result of the Clinton e-mail investigation. In other words, no 302s, nothing was recorded, no reports, nothing. It's as if the interviews never happened. And that's not all. The e-mails also reveal how then FBI general counsel, James Baker, ordered the bureau to expedite requests from Hillary Clinton's attorneys writing, quote, in my view, we need to move as quickly as possible. In other words, tonight we were right all along, yes, the investigation to Hillary Clinton was rigged, the fix was in. Comey and Loretta Lynch were always going to clear Hillary Clinton, their chosen candidate, of all of the charges as quickly as possible so she could claim her rightful throne. As Sara Carter put it, the investigation was a total and complete joke and that's why Comey, Strzok and others authored Hillary Clinton's exoneration letter, that happened in May of 2016 before they ever interviewed Hillary or 17 other key witnesses. And also, they changed the language, very significant from the legal standard of gross negligence using the words \"extreme carelessness\" that has no weight in the legal world. And while Comey's inner circle was working to clear Hillary Clinton as quickly as possible, well, they made a huge mistake. It appears they accidentally granted Clinton's attorneys access to top secret classified material found on her private server even though the legal team lacked the proper clearances. As James Comey should know, mishandling information, yes, that is a serious crime, 18 USC 793. And Comey should think about beefing up his own legal team. And also today, the least self-aware person in the entire world, Hillary Clinton tweeted, quote, I don't know who needs to hear this, but the president is not above the law. Neither are you, Hillary. I have news for you. No one is above the law, not even a twice-failed presidential candidate and former secretary of state. In fact, as \"The Hill's\" John Solomon has just released in a new article tonight, pointing out there are still very pressing questions around so many aspects of Hillary Clinton's seedy actions like why did the Clinton Foundation rake in millions and millions and millions of dollars from foreign governments while Hillary Clinton was serving as secretary of state? Why did she sign off on giving 20 percent of America's uranium to Vladimir Putin after a foundation received a sizable donation from Uranium One executives, both before and after? And why did the Clinton campaign pay a former spy, a foreign spy, Christopher Steele, to put together a dossier with lies and disinformation about Donald Trump during the height of the election? And why did she delete the 33,000 subpoenaed e-mails and destroy the evidence with hammers and Bleach Bit? Well, we know the answer. The intent was the underlying crime of the Espionage Act, and that would be called destroying the evidence. And most importantly, how she's not charged with any crime to date is unconscionable. It's time we all demand equal justice because Hillary -- remember, no one is above the law. We're going to have more of my opening monologue in a moment, but first, joining us with reaction to the breaking news, we have Judicial Watch chairman Tom Fitton, also FOX News investigative reporter, Sara Carter. Tom, we begin with you. I guess there are numerous big headlines out of this. Not the least of which, Tom, is that we have four specific witnesses in the Clinton e-mail case. The FBI failed to document anything, nothing. And don't forget, the time they finally interviewed her, which was July 2nd, three days before James Comey had his 15-minute press conference, pretty much laying out the case how she violated the law, if you remember back to that date, she had two people allowed in the room with her, which is totally unprecedented."

Meaning, they didn't want any documentary evidence about what took place, or they didn't really care enough about the investigation to bother writing stuff down, because they knew it was wired. Either way, it highlights the sham nature of the investigation.

There's other sets of documents showing the lawyers for the Clinton campaign and the DNC were also talking to the FBI about Russia and Donald Trump. So, they were protecting Hillary on e-mails, working with Hillary on going after Trump.

And the shocking level of bias corruption at the highest levels of our bureaucracy clearly knows no bounds. And tonight, we have sadly even more evidence proving Mueller's witch hunt was nothing more than a political hit job according to newly uncovered documents. We now know that the special counsel's report literally, Mueller's report, altered a voice mail transcript from Trump attorney John Dowd. Now, in the voice mail, Dowd was asking the Clinton legal team to give him a heads up should any national security issues arise out of his newly formed cooperation with the Mueller investigation. Now, remember for a long time, Team Flynn, they had a joint defense agreement with all of the other lawyers involve in this particular matter.  And this is by the way typical, a typical privileged call between attorneys. But the report made it seem nefarious. Because Mueller conveniently omitted Dowd's words and statement that this request was, quote, not only for the president, but for the country and then he wasn't asking for any confidential information. In other words, there was nothing untoward or illegal or nefarious about Dowd's request, nothing at all. Well, you wouldn't know that from the official Mueller report. Full exculpatory evidence was now purposefully withheld and it was meant to create a false perception among the American people. So, make no mistake, this probably has Andrew Weissmann's fingerprints all over it, he's a pit bull of Mueller. You know, he made a career out of withholding exculpatory president, the same Andrew Weissmann at Hillary's victory party in November of 2016. Two of his most high profile cases were overturned because of his prosecutorial misconduct for innocent Merrill Lynch executives, they spent a year in prison because of Weissmann, and that was overturned. Thousands of Anderson accounting, Americans, losing their jobs because of Weissmann, losing 9-0 in the Supreme Court. So, it's pretty close -- crystal clear tonight the Hillary-loving bureaucrat played a pretty central role in the Mueller investigation. Now, Congressman Devin Nunes, formerly the chair of the House Intel Committee, now the ranking member, is calling the report a total fraud.  And former FBI official Kevin Brock wrote that the government behaved like a bully. And I guarantee, today's discovery is only the tip of the iceberg. Well, that's not stopping the outright delusion inside of the radical extreme new Democratic socialist party. They don't care about the truth because their political blood lust is that strong. From Congressman Nadler to James Clyburn, top Democrats everywhere now openly advocating for impeachment, over what? None of them have been able to give a reason for why Trump should be impeached except collusion, except we have four exonerations at this point.

They don't want to hold those people accountable. They don't want you, we, the people of this country, to know that the Trump-Russia narrative was one big conspiracy theory and con job.

And joining us now with reaction, the Senate Judiciary Committee, Lindsey Graham. You know, I actually read stuff. And I once read the Nunes report, took the time to read. I read the Grassley-Graham memo. You might be familiar with that one. And it said that the bulk of information -- the bulk of the information in the FISA application in October of 2016 that led to the spying of the Trump campaign, them the Trump transition team, then the Trump presidency was the Hillary phony unverifiable Russian dossier. And James Comey signed it.  And in January of 2017, told then candidate Trump in Trump Tower, President-elect Trump, oh, that it's salacious but not verified.

And then we've got the Attorney General himself who answered your questions. Is Mueller dead? Yes. Are you concerned about the Hillary investigation? Yes. Are you concerned about FISA abuse? Yes.

My job is to have oversight to change the laws to protect the country from abuse in the future. Durham is looking at criminality and Barr is sitting on top of all of that.

Now, the President fighting back, writing, \"Sadiq Khan, who by all accounts has done a terrible job as Mayor of London\" - which is true - \"has been foolishly nasty to the visiting President of the United States,\" adding that, \"He is a stone-cold loser who should focus on crime in London, not on me,\" and compares his failures to Comrade de Blasio in New York, the New York City Mayor.

When we come back, liberal cities in crisis, more than 50 were just shot this past weekend in the City of Chicago, rampant homelessness and worse out of Los Angeles spiraling out of control. Trace Gallagher has that report, next."

      "utterance": "Yes. And let's start with - yes. Let's start with Chicago, Sean, because Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson says the uptick this weekend was \"despicable levels of violence.\" In roughly 48 hours, the city had 52 shootings, 10 of them fatal, and some within a block of Chicago police officers. Johnson says that's how bold the gangs are. The city will now target areas where retaliation is likely. In Los Angeles, when city workers recently complained about the rat infestation in and around city hall, only one City Council person agreed the problem was linked to the explosion of homeless camps. But now a pest control company brought in to assess the problem says it is absolutely the homeless people. And as long as there is human waste, leftover food, and hypodermic needles on the streets and beneath the grates, things will only get worse. And because downtown is overrun with rodents, radio/TV host and physician, Dr. Drew Pinsky, told Laura Ingraham, bubonic plague is likely already present in Los Angeles. And Los Angeles police say typhoid is present because an LAPD officer contracted the disease that causes typhoid fever and five other officers are showing symptoms. Sean."

Here with reaction, Fox News Contributor, Former Arkansas Governor, Mike Huckabee; Former Florida Attorney General, Pam Bondi. Pam, there's one commonality. This is not happening in Florida or Texas or states that have zero income tax. This is happening in big cities where they have massive amounts of taxation."

      "utterance": "That's exactly right, Sean. And what you said, the Democrats abandoned our inner cities, our most vulnerable populations a long time ago when they started talking about a centralized government, their socialist solutions. And what do they want to do now? They want to take that nationwide in 2020 with this Presidential election. And look what President Trump has been doing, embracing the First Step Act to prevent recidivism, creating opportunity zones, putting over $100 billion I think back into over 9,000 of our lowest income communities to try to help people. And that's - it's all these liberal cities."

When you have that level of rat infestation, bubonic plague, for heaven's sakes, that stuff was wiped out decades ago. The fact that we're even talking about it in major prosperous cities like Los Angeles is absolutely stunning. And I don't understand how people can continue to live there. I feel sorry for two groups of people, the people who want to leave and who just can't because they can't afford to leave. And I feel sorry for the police officers and the public health individuals who have to deal with this stuff and they get zero assistance from the Mayor and the City Council who ought to be ashamed of themselves for even taking a paycheck for letting their cities--"
