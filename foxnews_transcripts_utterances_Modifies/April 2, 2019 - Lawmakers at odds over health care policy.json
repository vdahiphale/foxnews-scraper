The last year full stats for health insurance, 2017, you see the massive number of private insurance, almost 198 million people. Obamacare itself, 12.2 million, and uninsured still stands at 28.5 million in the U.S., roughly, depending on what the numbers are in 2018.  So let's start there with the panel, Guy Benson, political editor at Townhall.com, Mara Liasson, national political correspondent for National Public Radio, and Ben Domenech, publisher of \"The Federalist.\" OK, Mara, obviously Democrats saw a lot of political upside 2018 on the issue of healthcare, and now they're looking again at it.",

Obamacare has now effectively become a conservative position compared to what the Democrats who are running for president are proposing with Medicare for all. And there is a real unwillingness I think on their part to deal with the cost issue, which should be at least a portion that they could bite off and deal with in a smaller way.  There are 2.5 million people who dropped off of the exchanges in the last year, 2017 and 2018, because of the cost issue, which is something that should come before any of these other conversations about regulatory reforms that need to happen, bigger questions that need to be resolved, and that won't be resolved until after 2020.",

But he may have blundered into something quite important, which is something to offer the American people on healthcare in 2020. It's a top two issue. So the Democrats have their very serious problems with single payer healthcare and the tax increases associated with that and outlawing 180 million people's private insurance. Those are very unpopular things. They are delighted to ignore those and pivot to the Republicans and pre-existing conditions.   I think it's in the president's own self-interest to offer the American people something digestible, maybe not a specific bill, but a plan, because opposing something with nothing didn't work out very well for the Republicans in 2018.",

In this case they're going to the Heritage Foundation, to the Mercatus Center, and to the Hoover Institution, all of whom have various very smart people who have worked in health policy, who I have worked with and published in the past.   But the fact is that if you get a plan like that in front of a politician, there's always going to be choices that they have to make, tradeoffs that exist with any kind of competitive marketplace. And I have never seen the wherewithal among leading Republicans to go out on this issue and go in the face of any kind of opposition to the degree that they are willing to do so whenever it's their turf, where they are willing to pass a tax bill, and even when all the polls say people are opposed to it because they are confident about what it will do for the economy.",

      "utterance": "Usually it's Republicans pounced on x, y, and z. Today Democrats pounced over the past few days on the healthcare issue after the president essentially announced that he would wait until after 2020 to roll out a plan to repeal and replace Obamacare. The last year full stats for health insurance, 2017, you see the massive number of private insurance, almost 198 million people. Obamacare itself, 12.2 million, and uninsured still stands at 28.5 million in the U.S., roughly, depending on what the numbers are in 2018. So let's start there with the panel, Guy Benson, political editor at Townhall.com, Mara Liasson, national political correspondent for National Public Radio, and Ben Domenech, publisher of \"The Federalist.\" OK, Mara, obviously Democrats saw a lot of political upside 2018 on the issue of healthcare, and now they're looking again at it."

But he did decide to back off of this plan to present an alternative to Obamacare after he got a phone call from Mitch McConnell who said we don't really want to be doing that when we had all three branches of government and we tried and failed. I think the big problem for the Republicans is that Trump decided to weigh in on this lawsuit from Republican states attorneys general, saying Obamacare in its entirety should be declared unconstitutional, including the popular parts, like pre-existing conditions, staying on your parents' plan until 26. That's what --"

It may be lousy politics, but it's good for the American people."

      "utterance": "And I think that what you are ultimately going to see is pressure from House Republicans who are going to, I think, cave on any pre- existing conditions proposal that's put forward by Democrats ultimately. There is no spine on this issue within the Republican conference. The problem is you are caught between a party among Republicans who aren't sure what they think about healthcare anymore. Obamacare has now effectively become a conservative position compared to what the Democrats who are running for president are proposing with Medicare for all. And there is a real unwillingness I think on their part to deal with the cost issue, which should be at least a portion that they could bite off and deal with in a smaller way. There are 2.5 million people who dropped off of the exchanges in the last year, 2017 and 2018, because of the cost issue, which is something that should come before any of these other conversations about regulatory reforms that need to happen, bigger questions that need to be resolved, and that won't be resolved until after 2020."

      "speaker": "BAIER",

We know that there is some leeway, some bipartisanship on drug prices for example. So that's around the edges. But on the big issues, why not lay out a plan?"

      "speaker": "GUY BENSON, POLITICAL EDITOR, TOWNHALL.COM",
      "utterance": "I think so. You can make an argument, and I think it's a pretty sound one, that the president endorsing this lawsuit was a tactical blunder and a gift to the Democrats. But he may have blundered into something quite important, which is something to offer the American people on healthcare in 2020. It's a top two issue. So the Democrats have their very serious problems with single payer healthcare and the tax increases associated with that and outlawing 180 million people's private insurance. Those are very unpopular things. They are delighted to ignore those and pivot to the Republicans and pre-existing conditions. I think it's in the president's own self-interest to offer the American people something digestible, maybe not a specific bill, but a plan, because opposing something with nothing didn't work out very well for the Republicans in 2018."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "DOMENECH",
      "utterance": "But part of the issue there is what they did come up with was completely unsatisfactory. The skinny repeal bill would not have actually achieved any of the real aims that Republicans espoused. And the fact is they are going back to a lot of the same people who all had plans. In this case they're going to the Heritage Foundation, to the Mercatus Center, and to the Hoover Institution, all of whom have various very smart people who have worked in health policy, who I have worked with and published in the past. But the fact is that if you get a plan like that in front of a politician, there's always going to be choices that they have to make, tradeoffs that exist with any kind of competitive marketplace. And I have never seen the wherewithal among leading Republicans to go out on this issue and go in the face of any kind of opposition to the degree that they are willing to do so whenever it's their turf, where they are willing to pass a tax bill, and even when all the polls say people are opposed to it because they are confident about what it will do for the economy."

      "speaker": "BAIER",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "LIASSON",
      "utterance": "The people who want Medicare for all do want single payer in terms of getting rid of the private health industry and substituting a government plan. But there a lot of Democrats who merely want Medicare buy in at 50, or some kind of public option. This is a debate that's ongoing. But in the meantime, since it hasn't been resolved, Donald Trump can stand up and say they are all for socialized medicine."
    },

      "speaker": "BENSON",
      "utterance": "A lot of them are. More than roughly half of House Democrats have endorsed specifically a single payer plan that would outlaw private insurance, and a number of Democrats running for president have done the same. They are hugely vulnerable on that point. The Republicans, though, as I said before coming back at that with, well, we don't like that but, what?"

And what we should understand is that it's our own asylum laws that are driving that. That's something that we are going to have to deal with in a much more comprehensive way than just an arbitrary shutdown. There are going to be negative economic effects.

That's the thing that they're going to run on. So now there's talk about, gee, we can close the border, somehow exempt trade from that? I don't know how do you that."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "LIASSON",
      "utterance": "I don't know if it's changing the dynamic. There's two parts of this. One is if the Democratic Party is the zero-tolerance party, what is it they have zero-tolerance for? Clearly sexual harassment or assault, yes. But do they have zero-tolerance tore a peck on the head? Do they have zero-tolerance copping a feel in a rope line? Clearly they did. Al Franken got kicked out for that. So they have to decide that. But the second thing this is about is the huge vacuum that Joe Biden has created. Where is Joe Biden? He's issuing some statements. But he is not in there giving speeches, doing anything that would fill this vacuum. This is what has become the kind of preamble to the Biden campaign, and I think that's bad for him."

And the fact that he has said absolutely nothing in front of a camera I don't think is really helping his case all that much here. I do feel like there is -- look, the video footage that we played there is very uncomfortable to watch. There is a creepiness there."

There is a difference, I think, between that and some of the Me Too actions, that this is now being weaponized against him in a way that a lot of voters would say that's not the same thing."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DOMENECH",
      "utterance": "First to Mara's point, I think that the Democratic Party has a zero-tolerance attitude, excepting the commonwealth of Virginia."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DOMENECH",
      "utterance": "But, when it comes to Joe Biden, let's step back and look at the fundamentals of this situation, because I think we all anticipated this would be an issue that would come up when and if he gets into the race. Joe Biden has an enormous base of support of from the African-American voters within the Democratic coalition. They view him as being Obama's guy who worked well with him. He is by far the most popular candidate among them. I personally do not believe that's just because of name I.D. And I think that what you are going to see play out within this Democratic presidential primary is a conflagration between what you might describe as the woke progressive whites and the black voters, particularly in the American south and South Carolina and elsewhere, who are going to have a real tension between them about what they want in a leadership candidate. And it's interesting to me to see whether this kind of issue and other issues about Biden's past, when it comes to criminal justice reform and others, are used against him."

But Ukrainian officials telling them that there is one crucial piece of information that Biden must have known but didn't mention to his audience when talking in Ukraine.

Look, I think it's sort of an abstruse issue, and there's some moving parts to it, but if Democratic voters are concerned about shades of the Clinton Foundation and double dealing and that kind of thing, this is certainly something that Biden is going to have to explain."
