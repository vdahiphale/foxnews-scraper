Some bad news today on the economy. The GDP for the second quarter was revised downward from 2.4 percent to 1.6 percent. This was described as Ben Bernanke as \"unexpected slowing, disappointing, sharp deterioration.\"  He also said this, \"The painfully slow recovery in the labor market has restrained growth and labor income, raised uncertainty about job security and prospects and dampened confidence.\" However, the markets seemed liked this quote from Bernanke, \"Should further action prove necessary, policy options are available to provide additional stimulus. Any deployment of these options requires a careful comparison of benefit and cost.\" As you look at the market, the market went up about 165 points in the Dow and across the board.  What about this, again, the politics and the policy of the economy? Let's bring in our panel: David Drucker, political reporter for Roll Call; Juan Williams, news analyst for National Public Radio, and syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer.   David, what are your thoughts about Democrats and what they're facing and what you heard Congressman Van Hollen talking about?",

And I think Democrats are in real deep trouble and I think Congressman Van Hollen knows it. He's a very smart operator. But similar to President Bush before the surge in Iraq, when he wasn't going to talk down the war and yet they knew something was wrong, something is wrong here. And unless something really big happens to turn things around, they are on course to lose a heck of a lot of seats. Now I'm not convinced yet they are going to lose the majority, but I think we're looking somewhere in the neighborhood of 30 to 35 seats.   And I'll tell you that in talking to Republican pollsters who are polling House races they're seeing numbers so incredible that they started to overweight their own Republican numbers because they want to try and get what they think is a little bit more of an accurate picture and they do expect eventually some Democrats will come home.

There is no way Democrats can actually argue that their policies have worked. What they're going to have to do, I think, and what we heard the Van Hollen argument was, it's a choice between the old stuff that drove us in a ditch, all that other stuff, and what is happening today. And what does he say about what we're doing? We are on a path toward recovery. Who believes that after all of these numbers? And what they're going to do, he added, efforts to support small business. What they're going to do is in September when they return they will have a bill that's going to ostensibly to help small business and reduce its capital gains tax, as if -- that is a drop in the ocean for the administration that will raise taxes on small business in January.
