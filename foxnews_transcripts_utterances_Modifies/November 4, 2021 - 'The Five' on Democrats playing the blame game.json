You don't judge people by the color of their skin, the content of their character. Joy Reid all she wants to see is color. She just wants to strip everything else out. And all you see is color.

And the thing is, there's a -- in mentoring circles that there's a thing -- there's a saying, you need to see her to be her, OK. So, this is the idea that when you're a little girl, it's a good idea to be exposed to a lot of different women executives or report or whatever you want to do in your life, you should be able to -- oh I can do that, oh I could do that. So, you think about all the young black girls who can watch Winsome Sears and say, well that's another thing that I could aspire to that I could see myself doing.

But he's a Black man who's very accomplished. And their feeling is -- and you know, I go back to you know, their historic roles that they play.

But what if they are right in one respect, that there are white voters choosing white supremacy, except there are rich white liberals voting Democrat in Arlington, Fairfax, and Loudoun County. They vote Democrat and they vote for policies like higher taxes, right, climate change agendas, progressive education, anti-police reform. These are all things that a white rich liberal can afford but the Black working class can't. So, here lies the gravest error of the left. They -- when they go after the White working class, they're going after the Black working class. And they pretend by choosing this incredible amount of spending. It's a virtue signal for them. They pretend they're doing well but they're actually hurting everybody because they've shifted from class to race and they can't get out of it. So, in my opinion, it's the rich White liberal who votes Democrat who is the real racist because they are hurting the Black working class as they try to hurt the White working class."

He goes, that number is not going to happen. He said, $450,000 that's not going to happen. So then, the follow-up is, well, is it $425,000? What is the figure? Or have the President then say let me take a step back and explain to you our situation, what we're looking at, what the law says, the liability for the American taxpayer, why this would make sense. There's just a million things that you could do. And instead, they let it sit out there for days and then they clean it up, and then they get mad and call it a garbage report. I think it's pitiful."

And the founder of it, John Langley, a good friend of mine. He is a great guy. He put this on the air, kept it on the 30 odd seasons before it got runoff. But John, knowing that it was coming back on the air, was an off-road racer, and he was racing in Baja, California. And tragically, he died. It's a sad story, you know, but his show lives on. And his family, his son now fronts the show. And it's like I said a big hit. It's an honor to John, the Patriot Award. We'll be honoring him on the program."
