President Biden left Americans behind in Afghanistan and now his administration's being accused of stealing credit for getting people out. The State Department says it helped facilitate the safe departure of a stranded American mother and her three kids. But Army veteran Cory Mills and his team who risked their lives to bring them to safety say the federal government had very little to do with it. That comes as the Taliban's reportedly preventing at least six planes at an airport in northern Afghanistan from taking off. Secretary of State Tony Blinken claims the Taliban is not blocking Americans from leaving and says the Biden administration is working with the terror group.",

If you had told me on August 24th that we would have gotten 120,000 Americans out, I would have disputed it. In fact, I came on another show on our network to be critical of how things had taken place and how they'd unfolded. Now, this doesn't mean that oversight should take place. There are going to be Democrats in the House and the Senate who have already called for it, as a matter of fact, for us to figure out what happened, why it happened. Even some Democrats saying how could we spend a trillion dollars in the military and the security forces in Afghanistan and run like they did and not be prepared. I think we'll get answers and Democrats will hold them accountable as well. But I don't lose sight of the fact that we still did the right thing by leaving. And Secretary Blinken, I disagree with your characterization about him being the worst Secretary of State. I think there's a lot of frustration, there's a lot of anger. Here's why I don't -- there's a lot of anger for it. There's a competition for worst and we could have another show to deal will that. But I think that they have done -- they didn't do everything right and there's no doubt they will be held accountable, but when you look at where we are today, we have to make sure anyone we get out of there tomorrow or the following days, we need to vet them. I think that there is no doubt they've been -- those on this network and others who have showed -- who said that there's no reason in the world why we should not be extra careful after we've gotten all of our Americans out that anyone wanting to come now we have to make sure they indeed or ones who helped us.

Instead we kind of conflate these things in desperation with people just coming looking for work. It's all about friction, right? It's like, you know, friction addresses your motivations and your incentives. Every problem we're seeing is due to an abandonment of friction. So the border collapse was because, you know, Biden waved everybody forward and turned the wall into a dirty word. But we do realize, probably the simplest visual thing ever. The biggest, easiest solution was the wall because it introduced friction as a visual tool, you see the wall coming up, you're less likely to go there and cross it. Unless you're in desperate circumstances, then you have that other prop -- that other process. It just seems that there isn't any -- there isn't any solution anymore, and there is no real drive to solve it. And I don't know why, except the cynicism, of course, is to say it's for voting reasons. But I don't know.",

President Biden left Americans behind in Afghanistan and now his administration's being accused of stealing credit for getting people out. The State Department says it helped facilitate the safe departure of a stranded American mother and her three kids. But Army veteran Cory Mills and his team who risked their lives to bring them to safety say the federal government had very little to do with it. That comes as the Taliban's reportedly preventing at least six planes at an airport in northern Afghanistan from taking off. Secretary of State Tony Blinken claims the Taliban is not blocking Americans from leaving and says the Biden administration is working with the terror group."

If you had told me on August 24th that we would have gotten 120,000 Americans out, I would have disputed it. In fact, I came on another show on our network to be critical of how things had taken place and how they'd unfolded. Now, this doesn't mean that oversight should take place. There are going to be Democrats in the House and the Senate who have already called for it, as a matter of fact, for us to figure out what happened, why it happened. Even some Democrats saying how could we spend a trillion dollars in the military and the security forces in Afghanistan and run like they did and not be prepared. I think we'll get answers and Democrats will hold them accountable as well. But I don't lose sight of the fact that we still did the right thing by leaving. And Secretary Blinken, I disagree with your characterization about him being the worst Secretary of State. I think there's a lot of frustration, there's a lot of anger. Here's why I don't -- there's a lot of anger for it. There's a competition for worst and we could have another show to deal will that. But I think that they have done -- they didn't do everything right and there's no doubt they will be held accountable, but when you look at where we are today, we have to make sure anyone we get out of there tomorrow or the following days, we need to vet them. I think that there is no doubt they've been -- those on this network and others who have showed -- who said that there's no reason in the world why we should not be extra careful after we've gotten all of our Americans out that anyone wanting to come now we have to make sure they indeed or ones who helped us.

And border patrol officials tell Fox News that the majority of asylum seekers crossing into the country illegally are now being returned to Mexico. So, Dana, I would I ask, short of, or in addition to this, foreseeing those migrants seeking asylum to remain in Mexico. What else should we be doing at the border to address this crisis?"

And then when Biden came in, he campaigned on it, he said we're not going to do that. We're going to end that. And on day one, that's what they did. And then because of other things that they said, which was basically like come on over, until they said, oh, actually please don't come over. Then they have this run on the border. And the numbers usually go down in the summer. That didn't happen this year so they've got a big problem and they know it. And also, so one, there is doing on the merits and doing the right thing. And then also I think the poll numbers show that he's like in the low 30s I think on immigration and so there's that.

Instead we kind of conflate these things in desperation with people just coming looking for work. It's all about friction, right? It's like, you know, friction addresses your motivations and your incentives. Every problem we're seeing is due to an abandonment of friction. So the border collapse was because, you know, Biden waved everybody forward and turned the wall into a dirty word. But we do realize, probably the simplest visual thing ever. The biggest, easiest solution was the wall because it introduced friction as a visual tool, you see the wall coming up, you're less likely to go there and cross it. Unless you're in desperate circumstances, then you have that other prop -- that other process. It just seems that there isn't any -- there isn't any solution anymore, and there is no real drive to solve it. And I don't know why, except the cynicism, of course, is to say it's for voting reasons. But I don't know."

Now, we're talking about the $3.5 trillion infrastructure bill. You know who that bill is going to cover. We've got 200,000 people who came in July. I mean, how can we afford all this?

I just -- I'm just not sure he's serious enough and qualified enough to be governor of California. I think voters out there will make that determination. I would agree with you, Dana. It's unfortunate that the clip we showed, showed Newsome attacking him for personal issues. I think personal issues should not -- someone's personal life like that should not be involved in politics.
