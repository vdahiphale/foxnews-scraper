The wall has to be built and that's his signature promise. And he wasted the first time with it, and McConnell didn't deliver the first opportunity and it's a shame.

It's for our national security. It's to address the humanitarian crisis at the border. These are -- we're talking about resources for border patrol agents. You just had a little girl die crossing in horrific conditions.  So this idea that he's not giving him the money to spite Trump? You're not spiting Trump. You're spiting American citizens and you're spiting all those poor people who are being incentivized to come and cross this border under these horrific conditions. So I think Democrats should take a minute and really reflect on that.

With that said, I kind of can see both things. Listen, you don't want to give the Iranians and the Russians free reign over that area, and there's a lot of resources to protect in terms of energy, and you don't want to abandon your allies.

But what we understand happened earlier today, this is where the vice president and Mick Mulvaney and Jared Kushner were also involved is if there was an agreement that was made between the majority leader Senator McConnell, minority leader Senator Schumer, and senators Corker and Flake, that they would not vote to table the bill, which means that they would a vote to allow the bill spending before the Senate to come to the floor. Now, Flake had said that he was going to vote against it, so that's a change for Flake. So that should give them enough votes to get on the bill, as they say in the Senate, and then once you get on the bill and you start debating it, you can begin to offer amendments.  And here's where the potential deal could come in. As long as the Senate starts to consider this bill, you can start to change the dollar amount and the allocation of those dollar amounts in the bill. Now the bill that came out of the House last night was $5.7 billion for border security, including wall construction. Now, if the Senate starts to consider it, you can pair that money back to maybe where it was earlier in the week at $1.6 billion. There was a billion-dollar slush fund in there for the president to use as he sees fit. That was giving Chuck Schumer fits, so that's when they got rid of that bill and went to this short-term C.R. which would go until February the 8th. So there's a chance here that they can reopen that negotiation and that consideration that you give the president a smaller dollar figure, get it back to where it was earlier in the week, about $1.6 billion, the Senate passes that, you get it over to the House, the House then reconciles and syncs up with the Senate bill. You give the president a bill that says here's $1.6 billion, will you sign it? If they can get that all done before midnight tonight that would be a feat. It's going to be late night, there's no question about that. But here's the other thing. This is where you might run into some problems, is when you offer up an amendment to pare back the $5.7 billion, you can start writing into it, \"Well, this money can only be used for a certain type of barrier.\" The president tweeted out just a short time ago a picture of a steel-slat barrier which looks an awful lot like the palisades in old pioneer forts. And there you have them. You take a look at some pictures online of For Vancouver? It looks exactly the same, except that the forts were made out of wood. Let's see if we can put this together. They've only got six and a half hours to do it. It's going to be a real challenge, no question -- Jedediah.",

If you have these things like that, do you know how much cheaper that is than a $25 billion thing that they did with the prototype? You don't have -- the Border Patrol loves this, because you can see through the other side. It doesn't have to be as thick. It doesn't have to go as low under the ground. It doesn't have to go at an angle. That's actually a cheaper way to do the wall. And if we can do that with 1.6, then I think the president signs it and says done.",

I hope Senate Democrats will work with the White House on an agreement that can pass both houses of Congress and receive the president's signature. So, colleagues, when in the agreement is reached, it will receive a vote here on the Senate floor. I move to concur in the House amendment to the Senate amendment to the House amendment to the Senate amendment -- to HR 695.",

So there won't be test votes. Not going to be a tabling vote. And the vice president has been over here with his members negotiating already. What this does, I think, is push this ahead to a negotiation that yields a result and does the best we can to keep from shutting down governments, or if it does shut down, shutting down very briefly. So I want to thank the two leaders for agreeing to go forward in this manner. It allows us to move forward in a positive way. And yet it keeps negotiations alive.

A Fox News alert, the Senate scrambling as the clock ticks to avoid a partial government shutdown at midnight tonight.

But if he vetoes it, it just goes back and then everything gets shutdown. And then, maybe it shutdown for a week at most, and then the Democrats come in and take over and they never send him anything with any wall funding and you're back with square one. So, I don't see the end game. I guess, maybe he's just trying to signal to the people that he's going to fight, but he has to find more creative ways in the budget to build this wall. The wall has to be built and that's his signature promise. And he wasted the first time with it, and McConnell didn't deliver the first opportunity and it's a shame. But, if they get rid of the filibuster, which they won't, you could get a wall. You get a lot of stuff. The other side will get stuff, this side would get stuff. But the way that the system is designed in the Senate, 60 votes for these spending bills, you're never going to get what you want, and you're just going to use the shutdown as leverage time and time again, and then we have to talk about how boring it is."

Some of them pointing back to February, though, remember when the president had the cameras in and it was in the cabinet room and it was the most amazing meeting that anyone ever seen? That deal at the time would have given like $25 billion, plus it had the DACA fix. So, it's like -- we keep going back, like, gosh, maybe that was the deal that they should've had and taken back then.

That's like saying I don't like a fork because it won't cut my meat. Well, you have a knife for that. So you have a fork and a knife. So you can have a wall, strong border, and then you can address that other stuff. So the arguments are either emotional, flawed or pigheaded.

      "speaker": "BILA",

I think he's already done what he needs to do, regardless of how this works out he's now going to be the guy who was willing to go through with a government shutdown to dig his heels ends and say I'm willing to do that partial government shutdown. He's also proving that he's willing to take on the language and say, this is a Democrat shutdown. He's taking on the language when it comes to what a shutdown actually looks like that it's not this, you know, Armageddon that the left always paints it as. It's so many essential government function still keep working. I just think it's interesting, I watched Chuck Schumer and he says you're not going to get your wall, as if to the wall is for President Trump. The wall is for the United States of America. It's for our national security. It's to address the humanitarian crisis at the border. These are -- we're talking about resources for border patrol agents. You just had a little girl die crossing in horrific conditions. So this idea that he's not giving him the money to spite Trump? You're not spiting Trump. You're spiting American citizens and you're spiting all those poor people who are being incentivized to come and cross this border under these horrific conditions. So I think Democrats should take a minute and really reflect on that. And I know it sounds good to oppose the wall, but think about what you're actually opposing, which is addressing national security and the humanitarian crisis that's happening at the border. So I think he's done a lot what he had to do."

But, the bottom line is that -- I mean, you have people opening GoFundMe accounts in those countries to say, you know if the government is not going to do it, we're going to do it. That shouldn't be the case. The primary responsibility of the government is to protect its citizens, and that includes border security."

So, Jesse laid out a potential end game, a way that the president could get out of it which is to say, look, I really did my best. I have tried with these Democrats. I even went to the point -- I think Jedediah picked up on this Y_\"- I'm saying we're going to shut down the government.

      "utterance": "It does wake me up, though. You know, it is -- watching politicians debate over the wall is like watching Dana and I try to get something down from a high shelf, because there is no expertise, right? And I think that was the mistake at the beginning of this was not introducing expertise into this problem. Instead, it started with a price. It's like, if you're going to renovate your house, you don't say I'm going to spend this. No, you're going to figure out what you want to renovate. Do I need - do I need a table here? Do I need it? And then you come up with a budget. This is -- I was going to say ass backwards. Can I say that?"

It didn't get enough attention. It was actually quite impressive, very impressive. Secretary of -- Department of Homeland Security, Kirstjen Nielsen, announced that they have reached this deal with Mexico -- basically said to Mexico, they're going to -- basically, house or hold the asylum-seekers. So, if you're a migrant, you come across, you get processed, but then you wait in Mexico, that's a really big deal. And the administration has done lots of different things that are a part of the whole cutlery set --"

      "utterance": "That smaller knife."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "There's a lot of things that they're doing outside of the wall that can either give them some cover with their base, but also to let the American people know, like, they're not just waiting for a $5 billion for steel slots for a wall, they actually -- that's really impressive and she deserves some credit for that. Of course, it got buried because of all the other breaking news."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Sure. And also, the Supreme Court had a ruling, Jedediah that said the administration cannot put a cap on the number of people seeking asylum. It was an interesting vote because the chief justice John Roberts voted with the liberals against the administration."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BILA",
      "utterance": "Right, that is true as well. And I would also say about the dollar value, I think it's interesting there's been a lot of debate about the $5 billion. People needs to remember, he's not just pulling that number out of thin air, I mean, he's talking to border patrol agents. He's talking to people at the border. And they're telling him this is what we need. This is what's insufficient. So, you know, Chuck Schumer doesn't get to decide what the appropriate amount of money, and, frankly, neither does Donald Trump. He is working with the people on the border. So these numbers exists for a reason because he's getting it from the people who are there trying to process people, trying to get them in buses in these remote areas to other locations, trying to make sure that the proper medical supplies are there, and also trying to contain what's going on. So that number -- there's a reason that that $5 billion, in terms of a monetary value, even exist."

And could it be -- I mean, could it be that Mattis actually fulfilled the job that he was supposed to do, and now Trump wants somebody else to do a different job? I mean, if you read the letter, Mattis said, we went in there, we did this, we helped bolster the military, we did this. These are all the things that he was supposed to do. And now, Trump -- I want somebody else. Beside the fact that CNN claims the world has been shaken, but Obama went through three, right? Secretaries -- defense secretaries in less time.

Trump said no, we get in, we get out, good bye. And Mattis agreed with that. And I think the president deserves to have someone who is his secretary of defense that believes in his philosophy. With that said, I kind of can see both things. Listen, you don't want to give the Iranians and the Russians free reign over that area, and there's a lot of resources to protect in terms of energy, and you don't want to abandon your allies. But on the other hand, do we really need to be there forever in Syria, spending more blood and treasure with a mission that's really undefined? Fighting the Kurds with the Kurds, our national security interest, really, what is the point? So, we can come out and then go back in. Happens all the time. Are we going to be surprised if there's more chaos in the Middle East? We're going to have to go back and clean it up? I mean, are we just going to stay there forever? Why don't we just there forever. I think that's what the president is thinking?"

And the principle -- and I think that's the distinguishing feature here. Yeah, you have people moved-on on administrations, but he sent a letter that indicated that American alliances are important in the post-World War II era and continue to be important.

But I think -- and I said this yesterday, Donald Trump's head is always going to be in that space because this is a guy who not only wanted to kill terrorists, but he wanted to kill their families. So I think that this is not somebody that would say, OK, I'm going to sacrifice the safety of a country, you know, on a whim. I think to Jesse's point, you can go back in, you can go back out, it's 2,000 troops, this is not a huge deal.

      "utterance": "Hey, Jedediah, good afternoon to you. This is going to be announced on the Senate floor just a couple of minutes by Senator Mitch McConnell. But what we understand happened earlier today, this is where the vice president and Mick Mulvaney and Jared Kushner were also involved is if there was an agreement that was made between the majority leader Senator McConnell, minority leader Senator Schumer, and senators Corker and Flake, that they would not vote to table the bill, which means that they would a vote to allow the bill spending before the Senate to come to the floor. Now, Flake had said that he was going to vote against it, so that's a change for Flake. So that should give them enough votes to get on the bill, as they say in the Senate, and then once you get on the bill and you start debating it, you can begin to offer amendments. And here's where the potential deal could come in. As long as the Senate starts to consider this bill, you can start to change the dollar amount and the allocation of those dollar amounts in the bill. Now the bill that came out of the House last night was $5.7 billion for border security, including wall construction. Now, if the Senate starts to consider it, you can pair that money back to maybe where it was earlier in the week at $1.6 billion. There was a billion-dollar slush fund in there for the president to use as he sees fit. That was giving Chuck Schumer fits, so that's when they got rid of that bill and went to this short-term C.R. which would go until February the 8th. So there's a chance here that they can reopen that negotiation and that consideration that you give the president a smaller dollar figure, get it back to where it was earlier in the week, about $1.6 billion, the Senate passes that, you get it over to the House, the House then reconciles and syncs up with the Senate bill. You give the president a bill that says here's $1.6 billion, will you sign it? If they can get that all done before midnight tonight that would be a feat. It's going to be late night, there's no question about that. But here's the other thing. This is where you might run into some problems, is when you offer up an amendment to pare back the $5.7 billion, you can start writing into it, \"Well, this money can only be used for a certain type of barrier.\" The president tweeted out just a short time ago a picture of a steel-slat barrier which looks an awful lot like the palisades in old pioneer forts. And there you have them. You take a look at some pictures online of For Vancouver? It looks exactly the same, except that the forts were made out of wood. Let's see if we can put this together. They've only got six and a half hours to do it. It's going to be a real challenge, no question -- Jedediah."

Honestly! The only thing that was interesting about that is I like the new wall. If you have these things like that, do you know how much cheaper that is than a $25 billion thing that they did with the prototype? You don't have -- the Border Patrol loves this, because you can see through the other side. It doesn't have to be as thick. It doesn't have to go as low under the ground. It doesn't have to go at an angle. That's actually a cheaper way to do the wall. And if we can do that with 1.6, then I think the president signs it and says done."

Then he breezes in and does criminal justice reform, and which no side could do. And then he bans bump stocks, which should piss off a lot of other people. That was something that the media was screaming about, but when he does it, you don't hear about it. So all of these things are -- they do not fit into an ideological set. Right? They're all over the place. Because he has a vision that is untethered to ideology. So it's not about him. But one more point. One more point. Because Juan brings up talk radio. And it seems like, you know, or let's say FOX News. That Donald Trump hears something on FOX News or hears something on talk radio, and that influences opinion. You could argue that, in a way, what he does -- and I believe this as somebody who sits here and tries to think about the audience, that what he's getting a signal from is what do Americans want. And he gets that from talk radio. He gets it from FOX News. We represent millions of people. So it's not like, \"Oh, I heard Ann Coulter say this,\" or \"I heard Jesse say this,\" or \"I heard Tucker said this.\" It's more like that -- they have their finger on the pulse of America."

I hope Senate Democrats will work with the White House on an agreement that can pass both houses of Congress and receive the president's signature.

So there won't be test votes. Not going to be a tabling vote. And the vice president has been over here with his members negotiating already. What this does, I think, is push this ahead to a negotiation that yields a result and does the best we can to keep from shutting down governments, or if it does shut down, shutting down very briefly. So I want to thank the two leaders for agreeing to go forward in this manner. It allows us to move forward in a positive way. And yet it keeps negotiations alive.

There is no path forward for the House bill. The only path forward is to a bill that has an agreement between the president and both houses of Congress.

She's all of 7 pounds and I can't get her to even be -- there she is, with the vet kind of holding her mouth so that she doesn't get bitten."
