We have a mesmerizing menu of stories to bring to you tonight and as the left melts down over Brett Kavanaugh's a nomination to the Supreme Court, runaway judges are striking fresh blows against the Trump agenda. Plus is California Senator Kamala Harris the female Obama in waiting for 2020? We're going to debate that with someone who ran in her California circles, knows her well. And how President Trump plans to use 'America First' to make a big splash at tomorrow's NATO Summit. But first, Kavanaugh, Democrats and Dinosaurs, that's the focus of tonight's Angle. Watching the reaction of Democrats to the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the High Court is likely to give you ulcers. Their anger and unhinged rants are one part dystopian drama and one part just sour grapes. Kavanaugh, a federal judge who's occupied the bench for over a dozen years, and written hundreds of decisions, is a man who's really scary because he coaches his daughters' basketball team and volunteers in soup kitchens. Well he's now being derided as a total monster because of how he might rule on abortion, ObamaCare and gun rights. Actress Julianne Moore tweeted, \"Please we must send the senate a clear message. This country cannot afford a justice on the Supreme Court who is likely to support the gun lobby's extreme, absolutist interpretation of the Second Amendment. Message your senators now.\"   Alyssa Milano who's still ticked that Trump is the boss tweeted, \"Brett Kavanaugh, in just on just one case, attacked women's rights, health care and immigration. He's the trifecta of terrible and he must never sit on the Supreme Court.\" But it was 'This is Us' director Ken Olin who tweeted my favorite and arguably the most ignorant comment of the night. At least he admits his ignorance writing, \"I don't know what kind of judge Brett Kavanaugh is but he and all the other white, and in many cases old folks at the event, looked so out of date, so out of sync with what the world is becoming. What the world needs to become. A last gasp of the way life was in the past. Sad for Us\" So 'This is Us' director believes that old white people are apparently not us. Okay well we're glad we got that straight. Hollywood is not the only community reeling from the Kavanaugh nomination. The shock could be seen on the faces and heard in the voices of the left wing establishment. Oh don't tell Ken Olin but many of the Liberals you're about to see are in fact white and in many cases old.    SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER, D—N.Y., SENATE MINORITY LEADER: President Trump with the nomination of Judge Kavanaugh is fulfilling two of his campaign promises. First, to undo women's reproductive freedom. Second, to undo ACA. So I will oppose him with everything I've got. SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN, D—MASS.: He very well could be the deciding vote and whether or not a criminal prosecution against the President goes forward. But this is a President right now who hears the hoof beats of an investigation that is bearing down on him.  SEN. COREY BOOKER, D—N.J.: To avoid a constitutional crisis, we cannot let this confirmation process go forward.",

      "sentences": "Did Elizabeth Warren say hoof beats? Well the last time I saw this many dinosaurs on fire, Chris Pratt was running from them. What voters may soon be doing the same? You've got to watch these people, they're totally nuts. But did you hear what Corey Booker said there? \"We cannot let this confirmation process go forward\"  Do you remember any conservative, any conservative talking in those terms when Barack Obama nominated Elena Kagan, or for that matter Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court? The answer is no. So go ahead, critique the nominee's legal reasoning, that's fine. Question his or her view of the Constitution. Totally fine. But to adopt an ANTIFA like resistance that seeks to block the process at all costs or weaponize it? Is just absurd. The truth is, for all the histrionics, Brett Kavanaugh would have been a natural choice for pretty much any Republican president. He served on the second most important court in the country for more than a decade and is widely respected in legal circles. And he's widely like, by the way, by Democrats appointees and Republicans. And his nomination to the high court, it's hardly a radical change in 81 years. Think about this, only three men have held this seat. Justice Hugo Black, Justice Louis Powell and Justice Anthony Kennedy. Now Justice Thomas replacing Thurgood Marshall, now that was a big swing. But this basically a slightly more conservative nominee replacing a generally conservative Justice in Anthony Kennedy.  The big change is that for the first time though since the 1930s, the court could have a reliable Conservative majority, that's big. And this partially explains why some Democrats are just going completely bonkers today. To block Kavanaugh, Dems are trotting out even a new tactic, I loved seeing this unfold today. They now want to force nominees to answer how they would rule on hypothetical cases. Now this is all meant to pin down a nominee on hot button issues. Here's Senator Richard Blumenthal.   SEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL, D—CONN.: You know we have heard these phony platitudes again and again and again. We heard them form Neil Gorsuch, we heard them from now Chief Justice Roberts. These evasive and rehearsed answers are absolutely meaningless. No more business as usual, no more deferential or courteous acceptance of these phony platitudes.",

Now in the meantime they'll do whatever they can to try and turn out their base. Their desperate to do that since the senate seems to be slipping away. So even if it means slashing away at confident, very established court pick like Brett Kavanaugh creating this viral drama from the hearing room? They're going to do whatever they can but my sense is when the dust settles, these dinosaurs will be presiding over a fallen kingdom, all of their own. And that's the Angle.  Joining me now for reaction are two esteemed attorneys, Sol Wisenberg was the deputy independent counsel during the investigations into Bill Clinton, knows Brett Kavanaugh and Scott Bolden is a Democrat and chair of the National Bar Association and Political Action Committee. Great to see you. Let's start with you Scott, I think it's completely fair game for the senate, use the constitutional ability seriously, question Kavanaugh's judicial philosophy, his approach to the constitution and ask him about past cases. That's what you should do in your process of reviewing these nominees. But what you heard from Chuck Schumer is something quite different. He's now demanding, contrary to what he said one year and three months ago, that nominees must say how they're going to rule on certain hot button cases. What is that all about?

The latest example? Los Angeles based US District court Judge Dolly Gee, an Obama appointee and that rhymes, on Monday she rejected the Trump administration's request to allow children who are illegal immigrants to be detained together with their parents. Now Judge Gee called the administration filing a, \"Cynical attempt to undue a long standing court settlement that prohibits children caught at the border from being detained longer than 20 days\" But is it? And are federal judges overstepping their bounds by essentially legislating from the bench? One judge can affect national policy or bring policy to a total stand still. Here now to explain further is former federal prosecutor and Fox News contributor Andy McCarthy. Andy this Flores Settlement that we've talked about for quite some time continues to haunt the immigration stance of this president. Specifically this problem of family units or people posing as family units crossing the border and thinking they'll just be released into the country. Trump and Sessions wanted to put an end to that but now they are up against the same federal court judge that had shut down this process before for Obama. Where are we here?",

I think what the Trump administration tried to do ere was get this reversed the right way which would be to go to the court and go back to the litigation where this settlement was originally entered. The fact that they didn't succeed was predictable but I do think they did it in the right way and the honorable way. The problem here is that this is a terrible abdication by Congress and it's a great example of what happens when you legislate through litigation. So basically what we need is Congress to say, \"Here are the rules and the conditions of confinement, the conditions of detention that should apply to minor aliens\" They won't do that so they delegated to the Justice Department and what we end up having is these activist litigations where there's a discovery of substantive due process rights of minor children to a certain level of treatment when they're here. I think as humane people we can all sympathize with that and agree with it. But it's not an adult policy if you going to say, \"We're going to give these people these rights and we're not going to provide the physical infrastructure that you need to carry it out\"",

Most Americans listening to this conversation tonight are thinking to themselves, \"Wait a second, illegal immigrants have constitutional rights and if so, what rights? How far do they extend, do they get court interpreters, do they get lawyers paid for?

Not only that but I think Democrats are so engaged in what's happening right now because if you can't win at the ballot box, if you can't win votes in Congress, you have to look to the courts to have activist judges that will implement your progressive liberal socialist policies for you because you can't do it in the Congress and you can't win the hearts and minds of voters.

We have a mesmerizing menu of stories to bring to you tonight and as the left melts down over Brett Kavanaugh's a nomination to the Supreme Court, runaway judges are striking fresh blows against the Trump agenda. Plus is California Senator Kamala Harris the female Obama in waiting for 2020? We're going to debate that with someone who ran in her California circles, knows her well. And how President Trump plans to use 'America First' to make a big splash at tomorrow's NATO Summit. But first, Kavanaugh, Democrats and Dinosaurs, that's the focus of tonight's Angle. Watching the reaction of Democrats to the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the High Court is likely to give you ulcers. Their anger and unhinged rants are one part dystopian drama and one part just sour grapes. Kavanaugh, a federal judge who's occupied the bench for over a dozen years, and written hundreds of decisions, is a man who's really scary because he coaches his daughters' basketball team and volunteers in soup kitchens. Well he's now being derided as a total monster because of how he might rule on abortion, ObamaCare and gun rights. Actress Julianne Moore tweeted, \"Please we must send the senate a clear message. This country cannot afford a justice on the Supreme Court who is likely to support the gun lobby's extreme, absolutist interpretation of the Second Amendment. Message your senators now.\" Alyssa Milano who's still ticked that Trump is the boss tweeted, \"Brett Kavanaugh, in just on just one case, attacked women's rights, health care and immigration. He's the trifecta of terrible and he must never sit on the Supreme Court.\" But it was 'This is Us' director Ken Olin who tweeted my favorite and arguably the most ignorant comment of the night. At least he admits his ignorance writing, \"I don't know what kind of judge Brett Kavanaugh is but he and all the other white, and in many cases old folks at the event, looked so out of date, so out of sync with what the world is becoming. What the world needs to become. A last gasp of the way life was in the past. Sad for Us\" So 'This is Us' director believes that old white people are apparently not us. Okay well we're glad we got that straight. Hollywood is not the only community reeling from the Kavanaugh nomination. The shock could be seen on the faces and heard in the voices of the left wing establishment. Oh don't tell Ken Olin but many of the Liberals you're about to see are in fact white and in many cases old. SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER, D—N.Y., SENATE MINORITY LEADER: President Trump with the nomination of Judge Kavanaugh is fulfilling two of his campaign promises. First, to undo women's reproductive freedom. Second, to undo ACA. So I will oppose him with everything I've got. SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN, D—MASS.: He very well could be the deciding vote and whether or not a criminal prosecution against the President goes forward. But this is a President right now who hears the hoof beats of an investigation that is bearing down on him. SEN. COREY BOOKER, D—N.J.: To avoid a constitutional crisis, we cannot let this confirmation process go forward."

      "utterance": "Did Elizabeth Warren say hoof beats? Well the last time I saw this many dinosaurs on fire, Chris Pratt was running from them. What voters may soon be doing the same? You've got to watch these people, they're totally nuts. But did you hear what Corey Booker said there? \"We cannot let this confirmation process go forward\" Do you remember any conservative, any conservative talking in those terms when Barack Obama nominated Elena Kagan, or for that matter Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court? The answer is no. So go ahead, critique the nominee's legal reasoning, that's fine. Question his or her view of the Constitution. Totally fine. But to adopt an ANTIFA like resistance that seeks to block the process at all costs or weaponize it? Is just absurd. The truth is, for all the histrionics, Brett Kavanaugh would have been a natural choice for pretty much any Republican president. He served on the second most important court in the country for more than a decade and is widely respected in legal circles. And he's widely like, by the way, by Democrats appointees and Republicans. And his nomination to the high court, it's hardly a radical change in 81 years. Think about this, only three men have held this seat. Justice Hugo Black, Justice Louis Powell and Justice Anthony Kennedy. Now Justice Thomas replacing Thurgood Marshall, now that was a big swing. But this basically a slightly more conservative nominee replacing a generally conservative Justice in Anthony Kennedy. The big change is that for the first time though since the 1930s, the court could have a reliable Conservative majority, that's big. And this partially explains why some Democrats are just going completely bonkers today. To block Kavanaugh, Dems are trotting out even a new tactic, I loved seeing this unfold today. They now want to force nominees to answer how they would rule on hypothetical cases. Now this is all meant to pin down a nominee on hot button issues. Here's Senator Richard Blumenthal. SEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL, D—CONN.: You know we have heard these phony platitudes again and again and again. We heard them form Neil Gorsuch, we heard them from now Chief Justice Roberts. These evasive and rehearsed answers are absolutely meaningless. No more business as usual, no more deferential or courteous acceptance of these phony platitudes."

Now in the meantime they'll do whatever they can to try and turn out their base. Their desperate to do that since the senate seems to be slipping away. So even if it means slashing away at confident, very established court pick like Brett Kavanaugh creating this viral drama from the hearing room? They're going to do whatever they can but my sense is when the dust settles, these dinosaurs will be presiding over a fallen kingdom, all of their own. And that's the Angle. Joining me now for reaction are two esteemed attorneys, Sol Wisenberg was the deputy independent counsel during the investigations into Bill Clinton, knows Brett Kavanaugh and Scott Bolden is a Democrat and chair of the National Bar Association and Political Action Committee. Great to see you. Let's start with you Scott, I think it's completely fair game for the senate, use the constitutional ability seriously, question Kavanaugh's judicial philosophy, his approach to the constitution and ask him about past cases. That's what you should do in your process of reviewing these nominees. But what you heard from Chuck Schumer is something quite different. He's now demanding, contrary to what he said one year and three months ago, that nominees must say how they're going to rule on certain hot button cases. What is that all about?

These are real issues and when you take the gloves off in those Senate hearings, if you look at maybe the last five to ten that have been published, or that we've seen, you've got non-answers, you've got questions to skirt the issue. The Democrats and I think some Republicans are going to come out and say, \"Tell me what your feelings and thoughts are on Roe v. Wade\" When he went to the DC Circuit, Justice Kavanaugh, when he went to the DC Circuit, he said he would follow Rowe versus Wade. But that was a mix because the problem with that is, he was going to the DC Circuit. Now he's going to be on the Supreme Court, why shouldn't we be able to ask him about his feelings on Roe v.

And you're right Laura, really I got no problem with people opposing a judicial candidate because they oppose his constitutional philosophy or her constitutional philosophy. But the Democrats don't want to play that game because then they would have to admit in public hearings that really they believe the court should enshrine their notion of progressivism into the Constitution. They really can't win an argument based on textualism and originalism and so they have to come up with these phony issues and that's what you're going to see.

The latest example? Los Angeles based US District court Judge Dolly Gee, an Obama appointee and that rhymes, on Monday she rejected the Trump administration's request to allow children who are illegal immigrants to be detained together with their parents. Now Judge Gee called the administration filing a, \"Cynical attempt to undue a long standing court settlement that prohibits children caught at the border from being detained longer than 20 days\" But is it? And are federal judges overstepping their bounds by essentially legislating from the bench? One judge can affect national policy or bring policy to a total stand still. Here now to explain further is former federal prosecutor and Fox News contributor Andy McCarthy. Andy this Flores Settlement that we've talked about for quite some time continues to haunt the immigration stance of this president. Specifically this problem of family units or people posing as family units crossing the border and thinking they'll just be released into the country. Trump and Sessions wanted to put an end to that but now they are up against the same federal court judge that had shut down this process before for Obama. Where are we here?"

I think what the Trump administration tried to do ere was get this reversed the right way which would be to go to the court and go back to the litigation where this settlement was originally entered. The fact that they didn't succeed was predictable but I do think they did it in the right way and the honorable way. The problem here is that this is a terrible abdication by Congress and it's a great example of what happens when you legislate through litigation. So basically what we need is Congress to say, \"Here are the rules and the conditions of confinement, the conditions of detention that should apply to minor aliens\" They won't do that so they delegated to the Justice Department and what we end up having is these activist litigations where there's a discovery of substantive due process rights of minor children to a certain level of treatment when they're here. I think as humane people we can all sympathize with that and agree with it. But it's not an adult policy if you going to say, \"We're going to give these people these rights and we're not going to provide the physical infrastructure that you need to carry it out\""

You should be able to deport people at an expeditious manner at the border who cross the border illegally to non-contiguous countries and so forth. But at the same time this judge is taking it upon herself to undo what this administration is trying to do and I think this is an example of what happens when an activist judge gets a hold of a hot button issue like this. Most Americans listening to this conversation tonight are thinking to themselves, \"Wait a second, illegal immigrants have constitutional rights and if so, what rights? How far do they extend, do they get court interpreters, do they get lawyers paid for? Do they get to go to school and get entertainment while they're in custody?\" I mean I think for most Americans they think the whole thing is a little odd given the fact that they're illegally here."

Manafort is now being held in solitary confinement 23 out 24 hours a day as he's trying to prepare for his trial on tax and bank fraud charges.

They say he was tampering with witnesses, persuaded the district court that that was the case. The problem is, once you have somebody that's high profile like him, if the judge does actually put him pre-trial, that is put him in custody, rather than allow him to be out on bail, it's very hard for him to be in general population. So it's almost a given that if you find that he has to be detained, he's going to be detained in these every arduous conditions."

Once he was turned over to the bureau of prisons, the bureau of prisons made the decision that if you put him in general population, he's going to be an attractive target for the kinds of people who are in general population. Bear in mind this man has not been convicted of anything so to protect him and to protect the bureau of prisons against liability, they put him in solitary confinement. But this it totally unnecessary. It is not rocket science to have somebody in a detention situation outside a prison, home detention and similar kinds of detention in which he can't get access to a computer or to a telephone. There are people who are convicted of dealing in child pornography who are out and about who get restrictions on their access to computers and so on. This can be done and it is not rocket science.

But judge I want to move on to both Brett Kavanaugh briefly and this idea a federal district court judge, something that Justice Thomas wrote about at the end of the term in one of the big cases, that travel ban case.

Kamala's background was steeped in local politics first, then headed the district attorney's office and a large county in California in the San Francisco area, and then became the state attorney general before becoming a senator. Barack Obama's background was much more grassroots, working with organizations before he came on to the political stride and gained traction as a senator and popularity through his speeches and so on, his connection to the voters.

But let's talk about what she said today about Brett Kavanaugh. It didn't sound like she was interested in working across the aisle. Let's watch. SEN. KAMALA HARRIS, D—CALIF.: Listen, if you are a young woman in America or you care about a young woman in America, pay close attendant to this nomination. Pay close attention, because Kavanaugh has made his purpose clear. It's about government taking on the decision about a woman and what she does with her body instead of giving that woman and her family and her God the power to make the decisions for herself."

That's what the woman who is the 2020 I think likely presidential contender. REP. SEAN DUFFY, R—WISC.: Laura, set that aside. The thing that Kamala Harris is talking about, protecting women's rights. How about protecting a woman when she is in the womb as an infant, someone who is the most vulnerable in any stage of life when they are in the womb? And I know that's not the debate we're having here, but the fact that we are talking about women's rights and not protecting the women's rights in the womb is outrageous. That aside, I think your intro was absolutely correct. When we talk about Kamala Harrison and Barack Obama, it's not about race, it's not about their background. It's about who can be radical. Who can be the leader of the resist movement. Who can be the biggest hater of Donald Trump, because if you're a Democrat, there's no ideas, there's no policy that you can run on. It's just being a resistor. Not only that but I think Democrats are so engaged in what's happening right now because if you can't win at the ballot box, if you can't win votes in Congress, you have to look to the courts to have activist judges that will implement your progressive liberal socialist policies for you because you can't do it in the Congress and you can't win the hearts and minds of voters. So you want to have the activist court initiative and you also have who's going to lead the resist movement, and Kamala I think fits both of those, or Senator Harris, I should say, fits both of those narratives."

As far as what her viewpoints are, can she gain traction, come outside the resist mode, as you characterized it, I don't think that's where she really sits.

They shouldn't get away with paying only 50 percent of that. If they are going to put their name on the dotted line and commit to this, then they have to do it. Let's face it, we all know it. America has for decades paid the lion's share of all these expenses with our allies abroad, when we have these coalition operations.

Maybe if they had more of a free-market approach to some of these grand entitlements that have a little bit more extra cash floating around to invest in their military.

Is this what we have to resort to as Congress flails at solving this border crisis. Joining us now with reaction, immigration attorney Saman Nasseri. Saman, good to have you on tonight. Here is the problem I think most people see that are outside the political world. They are just watching this unfold. When we had thousands of people, which we do every month, crossing our borders illegally, not through the normal ports of entry, just crossing into our country illegally, most people believe that releasing them into the country, catch and release, is a joke and it just encourages more illegal crossing which is very dangerous and not compassionate at all.

It's a substantive due process right, but it's not exactly the same. The problem, however, is we don't have the facilities. Congress hasn't passed requisite legislation or funding for enough immigration courts and so forth, so a lot of these courts are now going until 10:00 p.m., correct? They used to go until midafternoon, 4:00 p.m. Now they are running nearly 18 hours a day to try to get through these cases. It seems to be having an effect, however, because now more people think, gosh, when I come across, if I don't have a child with me or someone I say is my child, I'm not going to be just released into the country. And we are beginning to deport people faster, which I think most Americans approve of, Saman."

You have people that are going to go through this federal process. They're going to get credit for time served. They are going to get deported and they're going to be back here as quick as possible, this time asking for asylum when they get to the entry or get caught crossing the border again.
