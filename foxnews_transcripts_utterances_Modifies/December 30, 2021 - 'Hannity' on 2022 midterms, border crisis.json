The United States just set a world record with 489,267 COVID cases in 24 hours, nearly 500,000 cases in a day.  In case you're wondering, the guy who promised to shut down the virus, Joe Biden, he's been on vacation on the beach with the doctor and the dogs, not a care in the world all week long. He left America's little king Dr. Anthony Fauci in charge. And like always, the good doctor claims he is following the science. He is science after all. And since he is science, it does make sense since we learned last night that king Fauci makes more in his annual salary than Joe Biden.  So the real president is running the show in Washington, D.C. All kidding aside, sort of, per usual, Fauci is speculating wildly. Watch this.",

In \"The Atlantic\", one columnist wrote an entire article about his decision to cancel his 40th birthday party because of omicron. How sad.

But, of course, Joe Biden has only made the situation worse with mixed messages and outright lies, about things like masks, social distancing, kids in school, vaccines and, of course, therapeutics. Can't talk about therapeutics not supposed to.  In fact recently, the White House used faulty data in order to reduce the supply of life-saving therapeutics. Now, one prominent Maryland doctor is telling FOX News that people will die as a result of not getting those therapeutics.

But what we should be looking at is the fact that omicron is a blessing in disguise because it's extremely infectious but it's not particularly virulent, and there's some evidence that if you've contracted omicron, you can develop immunity to the delta variant and perhaps some other variants, doesn't work in the other. So that could actually get us to herd immunity much faster than anybody's expected.  And even though the CDC, NIH, all of our government officials you know are preaching doom and gloom, it doesn't really matter what they think. If this is a natural phenomenon that's occurring and this is getting less and less virulent and it's spreading throughout our community, it's going to take care of itself, regardless of what they do. So this is actually something that's very helpful. Now, we also have very good news about the Paxlovid, the Pfizer drug which is a treatment, which reduces hospitalizations by almost 90 percent and you know, there's been the monoclonal antibodies. Now, they've said they don't really work for this new variant. But that's not true. There's the sotrovimab, which is a GSK, a GlaxoSmithKline monoclonal that works just fine with omicron.   So I think if people would allow the medical profession don't brow beat them, don't threaten them, give them access to the whole plethora of treatment options that we have and let them work with the individuals you know by having government tell you what you have to do what we are getting is a firsthand view of what socialized medicine would look like.

Let's apply that stuff, instead of trying to manipulate people, instead of trying to keep information from people. Our people here in the United States are very smart and we have a terrific medical system, if we would just be willing to allow to work. Let people work with their doctors.   And also, you know, look around the world. Nigeria for instance the mortality rate in Nigeria from COVID is 14 per million. In this country is 2,200 per million. That's a pretty big difference. We should be saying what's going on in Nigeria that's not going on here? Well, for one thing, they take anti-malarial like hydroxychloroquine.  And we should be all over that. We should be looking into this is this really something that helps. Of course, we know it helps but why do we pooh-pooh hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin and some other things because we have this silly rule that when it comes to vaccines which says if there's another useful treatment, an effective treatment, then you cannot get an EUA, an emergency use authorization.

The withdrawal from Afghanistan, an unmitigated disaster reverberating across the globe. And the economy, it's a train wreck, record level inflation, slow growth, a widespread labor shortage, major supply chain problems. But according to this tweet -- get this -- this tweet from Joe Biden: everything is going great. And I quote: We're ending with what one analyst described as the strongest first-year economic track record of any president in the last 50 years, end quote. Lest I be associated with it.   Biden never named that one analyst with, some speculating it could be his son zero experience Hunter as Sean likes to say rightfully, or Biden fan girl Jennifer Rubin.  Now, make no mistake, with Biden faltering, Hillary Clinton is more than happy to make herself available. Can you believe that? Recently in fact, she appeared on MSNBC and blamed far left progressives for this year's long national nightmare. Wow, how far we've come.

There is a uniformity and panic over the nature of what's happening, and yet, there is no attempt to acknowledge it and not a willingness to do so and that tells you that will not change. It's been almost a year. This will continue. So Americans have to be prepared for that. But for the Democrats, it will only get worse as we lead to the midterms and, of course, Americans we're going to be seeing alternatives and this also is an opportunity for Congress, for the -- for the Republicans in Congress to pressure more and more of the Democrats in the House, their fellow senators as well.  You know who the role models are for the Democrats and the Democrats understand this, the base. It's Kyrsten Sinema and Joe Manchin.

Look, our election systems are governed by the lower houses in the states. That's what the Constitution said. Let's get those laws in place. Let's stop this perversion of our election system.

We're now learning that border patrol recently picked up illegal migrants on the border from as far away as the country of turkey and dozens of other countries across our globe. As our porous southern border continues to be a massive national security threat, it's not just about sovereignty -- of course, it is -- but it is a national security threat and it is wide open. And the numbers continue to be more and more shocking. The numbers tell an even bigger story. In just 2021 alone, as this year comes to an end, border officials are telling Breitbart that over 1.9 million illegal migrants have been apprehended along our southern border. That's almost million apprehensions and that's not including the approximately so-called gotaways, meaning illegals that evaded border patrol custody. Let's provide some context to those numbers. In just one year, if you add those numbers together, that means more illegals entered America than the entire population of Houston Texas. Have you ever been to Houston? It's huge. And almost as many as America's third largest city, city of Chicago. Think about that. Let that soak in. Those numbers are staggering. So, in under a year, we've gone from safety and security to an open borders catastrophe, all caused by the policies and the person of Joe Biden.

It's a crime actually that Washington won't, but we're grateful that you and others are standing up trying to maintain the sovereignty our country deserves, our taxpayers deserve frankly. Ken Paxton, thank you so much for your time tonight. And remember, the crisis doesn't stop at our southern border as we have multiple reports of illegals being flown on secret flights in the dead of night to states all across the country, and there are more questions tonight about a series of migrant flights landing in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, as the airport operator there says the flights came from ICE, while the agency of course denies they had anything to do with these middle of the night secret flights. But as the airport's fixed based operator told local media, quote, the airline that contacts us sends us paperwork, the paper trail doesn't lie. The failed far-left governor of Pennsylvania, Tom Wolf, admitted that illegals were in fact on the flight but claimed they were just passing through Pennsylvania on their way to their final destination their final destination of course being the interior of the United States, somewhere in your own backyard. So ask yourself this: Why exactly is the Biden administration trying to hide -- what are they trying to hide? Why all the secrecy? Why the lack of transparency? And why don't we, the tax paying, law-abiding citizens of America deserve to know what our federal government is doing?  And as Pennsylvania's Senate candidate Dr. Oz tweeted, quote: Biden's border crisis had turned every state into a border state and the effects of his disastrous open border policy have rippled across our country, sadly, even to the Wilkes-Barre, Scranton area. We need strong leaders who will secure our border. Here now with more reaction is Dr. Mehmet Oz himself. Dr. Oz, thanks for joining us. And I know you're in the middle of a Senate race right now, which means you're in the middle of the issues facing your state and people don't normally think of Pennsylvania as a state affected by what's happening at the border but you're seeing it. What are you seeing?",

We obey the law, we pay our taxes, the government secures our border. With a porous border, not only do we get illegal immigrants, we support cartels that are human trafficking and they're bringing opiates across the border, as we've heard from two prior guests this evening. So every state is truly a border state as I tweeted out and I think this middle of the night flights to Wilkes-Barre/Scranton airport are really a problem. It's not whether ICE or HHS, you know, Health Human Services is responsible for the flights, it's the reality that these people become the responsibility of every local community, every local government. And Pennsylvanians deserve answers. You know, the first thing, Pete, when you walk into an operating room as a surgeon, that's what I do, you shine a light on the wound. You want to be able to see everything.  The Biden administration's doing the opposite -- obfuscating, clouding the view, darkening the room. And they're hiding dangerous ramifications of this failed border policy. If we had an 18 percent incidence of COVID last summer amongst illegal immigrants, imagine what it is today.

The CDC arbitrarily shortens the quarantine period from 10 days to five days, it's based on convenience, not science which we were told for two years. There's no national plan. I'm sitting in a place where I can't get antibody cocktails for people who are suffering from COVID who are at risk. I can't get pills. Where are the tests? I mean, this is a ridiculous failure of our government to provide the very fundamental basics. As a physician, you don't just prevent disease. You have a backup plan, in case someone actually gets the illness, where are these strategies? How come we don't have the fundamentals? And issues like closing schools which was not following the science in my opinion, and I voiced it on this program two years ago is because causing other bodies to publish today an article from Brown showing the kids born during the pandemic are developmentally delayed.  Think about that. We're hurting our children with some of these policies. Kids who can't see the mouths of their teachers move don't learn to speak. Five percent of kids wear glasses, they fog up, they can't read. These are the penalties we paid and we weren't any safer because of these destructive authoritarian restrictions. I believe we should empower the people of Pennsylvania. That's what I've done for my whole career. I know what works. People are smart. They know what to do.

The United States just set a world record with 489,267 COVID cases in 24 hours, nearly 500,000 cases in a day. In case you're wondering, the guy who promised to shut down the virus, Joe Biden, he's been on vacation on the beach with the doctor and the dogs, not a care in the world all week long. He left America's little king Dr. Anthony Fauci in charge. And like always, the good doctor claims he is following the science. He is science after all. And since he is science, it does make sense since we learned last night that king Fauci makes more in his annual salary than Joe Biden. So the real president is running the show in Washington, D.C. All kidding aside, sort of, per usual, Fauci is speculating wildly. Watch this."

So what happened? Did any of these so-called journalists really believe that a president could stop an airborne virus in its tracks? Of course they didn't. But, of course, Joe Biden has only made the situation worse with mixed messages and outright lies, about things like masks, social distancing, kids in school, vaccines and, of course, therapeutics. Can't talk about therapeutics not supposed to. In fact recently, the White House used faulty data in order to reduce the supply of life-saving therapeutics. Now, one prominent Maryland doctor is telling FOX News that people will die as a result of not getting those therapeutics. Joining us now with more is former HUD secretary and world renowned doctor, Ben Carson. Doctor, thank you so much for being here."

A virus they knew existed, a plan they said they had and that they would crush it. You were in the Trump administration when the China virus was unleashed and no one saw it coming. Yet, we're a year into this. How can it be that they're so far behind this curve?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARSON",
      "utterance": "They're not really paying attention to the data, it seems like maybe there's other objectives here. But what we should be looking at is the fact that omicron is a blessing in disguise because it's extremely infectious but it's not particularly virulent, and there's some evidence that if you've contracted omicron, you can develop immunity to the delta variant and perhaps some other variants, doesn't work in the other. So that could actually get us to herd immunity much faster than anybody's expected. And even though the CDC, NIH, all of our government officials you know are preaching doom and gloom, it doesn't really matter what they think. If this is a natural phenomenon that's occurring and this is getting less and less virulent and it's spreading throughout our community, it's going to take care of itself, regardless of what they do. So this is actually something that's very helpful. Now, we also have very good news about the Paxlovid, the Pfizer drug which is a treatment, which reduces hospitalizations by almost 90 percent and you know, there's been the monoclonal antibodies. Now, they've said they don't really work for this new variant. But that's not true. There's the sotrovimab, which is a GSK, a GlaxoSmithKline monoclonal that works just fine with omicron. So I think if people would allow the medical profession don't brow beat them, don't threaten them, give them access to the whole plethora of treatment options that we have and let them work with the individuals you know by having government tell you what you have to do what we are getting is a firsthand view of what socialized medicine would look like. One size fits all, we tell you what to do, end of story."

Yet time and time again from the top down and especially from this White House, not the Trump White House, the Biden White House, they downplay play anything that is not get the shot, boost, boost, boost, mask, double mask. That's all -- pretty much all we hear time and time again. Why can't they make a shift to the things that have actually worked or there's evidence they are effective as well?"

And you -- you can see some of the crazy stuff that's going on in places like Australia. You know, they have traditionally looked to us and if we can just put aside the politics and deal with the facts, there's plenty of stuff that we've learned over these last two years. Let's apply that stuff, instead of trying to manipulate people, instead of trying to keep information from people. Our people here in the United States are very smart and we have a terrific medical system, if we would just be willing to allow to work. Let people work with their doctors. And also, you know, look around the world. Nigeria for instance the mortality rate in Nigeria from COVID is 14 per million. In this country is 2,200 per million. That's a pretty big difference. We should be saying what's going on in Nigeria that's not going on here? Well, for one thing, they take anti-malarial like hydroxychloroquine. And we should be all over that. We should be looking into this is this really something that helps. Of course, we know it helps but why do we pooh-pooh hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin and some other things because we have this silly rule that when it comes to vaccines which says if there's another useful treatment, an effective treatment, then you cannot get an EUA, an emergency use authorization. This is really stupid and we really need to do something about it."

Now, make no mistake, with Biden faltering, Hillary Clinton is more than happy to make herself available. Can you believe that? Recently in fact, she appeared on MSNBC and blamed far left progressives for this year's long national nightmare. Wow, how far we've come.

Not great choices if you're a Democrat and you're looking to either keep your seat. You're looking to get elected. You don't have a lot of great options. So what they're really banking on is that the American people are stupid. But what they don't understand is the American people are not stupid. We go to the grocery store. We go to the gas pump. We see that this country is turning into a giant dumpster fire. You know, as President Trump said over and over again, if Biden would just have come into office and stayed in the basement and whoever his puppeteers are would have just stayed in the basement with him, our country would have done very well. But they chose not to do that, they chose woke-ism, they chose lockdowns over freedom. Now, here we are and they're trying to confuse us into thinking things are going well. Not going well."

There's so many different signals. Whether it's the polls, whether it's personal lives, whether it's what family might be telling them, what they see on the television, even what their favorite, you know, propaganda news sites are saying to them, \"The New York Times\" or even CNN. There is a uniformity and panic over the nature of what's happening, and yet, there is no attempt to acknowledge it and not a willingness to do so and that tells you that will not change. It's been almost a year. This will continue. So Americans have to be prepared for that. But for the Democrats, it will only get worse as we lead to the midterms and, of course, Americans we're going to be seeing alternatives and this also is an opportunity for Congress, for the -- for the Republicans in Congress to pressure more and more of the Democrats in the House, their fellow senators as well. You know who the role models are for the Democrats and the Democrats understand this, the base. It's Kyrsten Sinema and Joe Manchin. They're the ones who represent the Democratic Party and if they really wanted to have an impact, they would do more outreach and they would try to save their party."

The court battles that may go to the Supreme Court, that'll be a factor. But I wouldn't take that as the only thing. It drives the Republican base, that's understandable, but are there enough crossover Democrats? Are there enough crossover independents who will vote on those issues? We have safety issues, community issues, border security, Second Amendment issues that are on the table, cultural issues. We see what's going on with education. So I don't think Republicans should just take it as Biden's failing, we should win. And I think the Republican Party shouldn't just focus on the Congress. Look to the state and local elections. Look, our election systems are governed by the lower houses in the states. That's what the Constitution said. Let's get those laws in place. Let's stop this perversion of our election system. Let's get redistricting and gerrymandering which the Democrats are going after taken care of, because if not, once they shore up those competitive districts they're going to go after and try to destroy Republicans.

      "utterance": "Welcome back. More evidence tonight of Joe Biden's open borders failure which is an agenda really. We're now learning that border patrol recently picked up illegal migrants on the border from as far away as the country of turkey and dozens of other countries across our globe. As our porous southern border continues to be a massive national security threat, it's not just about sovereignty -- of course, it is -- but it is a national security threat and it is wide open. And the numbers continue to be more and more shocking. The numbers tell an even bigger story. In just 2021 alone, as this year comes to an end, border officials are telling Breitbart that over 1.9 million illegal migrants have been apprehended along our southern border. That's almost million apprehensions and that's not including the approximately so-called gotaways, meaning illegals that evaded border patrol custody. Let's provide some context to those numbers. In just one year, if you add those numbers together, that means more illegals entered America than the entire population of Houston Texas. Have you ever been to Houston? It's huge. And almost as many as America's third largest city, city of Chicago. Think about that. Let that soak in. Those numbers are staggering. So, in under a year, we've gone from safety and security to an open borders catastrophe, all caused by the policies and the person of Joe Biden. Here to explain more, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton. Mr. Attorney General, thanks for being here. Am I being hyperbolic when I say at the end, all caused by the policies and the person of Joe Biden?"

We had good policies in place before Biden came into office under the Trump administration that worked. They were effective and they dismantled them as quickly as they could in violation of federal law. And exactly what you would have thought would have happened and what I thought it would happen, we have a massive influx of illegals out of control who are bringing COVID, drugs and all kinds of other problems to this country."

      "utterance": "You know, I think it's a hard question for Americans to really think about because you want to think of your president as looking out for you, is looking out for Americans but clearly he's not. He values the illegal immigration as an important part of his agenda, and I think you said it a few minutes ago. This is a part of his agenda. And if it means that more Americans die because of COVID or more Americans die because of fentanyl overdoses, which are up -- I think drug overdoses are up like 29 percent this year, or whether there's more crime along the border or more people lose jobs, it's worth it to him I think because of votes and, two, I think it hurts Republican states particularly.

And remember, the crisis doesn't stop at our southern border as we have multiple reports of illegals being flown on secret flights in the dead of night to states all across the country, and there are more questions tonight about a series of migrant flights landing in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, as the airport operator there says the flights came from ICE, while the agency of course denies they had anything to do with these middle of the night secret flights. But as the airport's fixed based operator told local media, quote, the airline that contacts us sends us paperwork, the paper trail doesn't lie. The failed far-left governor of Pennsylvania, Tom Wolf, admitted that illegals were in fact on the flight but claimed they were just passing through Pennsylvania on their way to their final destination their final destination of course being the interior of the United States, somewhere in your own backyard."

And I know you're in the middle of a Senate race right now, which means you're in the middle of the issues facing your state and people don't normally think of Pennsylvania as a state affected by what's happening at the border but you're seeing it.

We obey the law, we pay our taxes, the government secures our border. With a porous border, not only do we get illegal immigrants, we support cartels that are human trafficking and they're bringing opiates across the border, as we've heard from two prior guests this evening. So every state is truly a border state as I tweeted out and I think this middle of the night flights to Wilkes-Barre/Scranton airport are really a problem. It's not whether ICE or HHS, you know, Health Human Services is responsible for the flights, it's the reality that these people become the responsibility of every local community, every local government. And Pennsylvanians deserve answers. You know, the first thing, Pete, when you walk into an operating room as a surgeon, that's what I do, you shine a light on the wound. You want to be able to see everything. The Biden administration's doing the opposite -- obfuscating, clouding the view, darkening the room. And they're hiding dangerous ramifications of this failed border policy. If we had an 18 percent incidence of COVID last summer amongst illegal immigrants, imagine what it is today. And think about the crime and drug stats that are skyrocketing places like Philadelphia with higher homicide rates than ever before seen, period, even more than the crack wars of the 1990s. A lot of this is related to overall frustration because you don't know who's who?"

      "utterance": "Top of mind with that question is the economy. The issues around jobs are massive. Inflation, of course, is not only diminishing the value of your paycheck, but it's also undermining your confidence that whatever you're doing and putting in the bank is going to be there. But I think this week, COVID is once again raised to the top and I got to say this speaks to the general incompetence of the Biden administration. People are saying it's just not working, right? The CDC arbitrarily shortens the quarantine period from 10 days to five days, it's based on convenience, not science which we were told for two years. There's no national plan. I'm sitting in a place where I can't get antibody cocktails for people who are suffering from COVID who are at risk. I can't get pills. Where are the tests? I mean, this is a ridiculous failure of our government to provide the very fundamental basics. As a physician, you don't just prevent disease. You have a backup plan, in case someone actually gets the illness, where are these strategies? How come we don't have the fundamentals? And issues like closing schools which was not following the science in my opinion, and I voiced it on this program two years ago is because causing other bodies to publish today an article from Brown showing the kids born during the pandemic are developmentally delayed. Think about that. We're hurting our children with some of these policies. Kids who can't see the mouths of their teachers move don't learn to speak. Five percent of kids wear glasses, they fog up, they can't read. These are the penalties we paid and we weren't any safer because of these destructive authoritarian restrictions. I believe we should empower the people of Pennsylvania. That's what I've done for my whole career. I know what works. People are smart. They know what to do. What they want in medicine is transparency, and they want to make sure they know who their doctor is. We're not doing either for them."

He's a medical doctor. You Dr. Oz having been in the operating room now in the political arena. When you can understand and speak the issues you do at a moment like this, it's a pretty darn powerful political thing, even if that's not what you initially set out to do. Dr. Oz, thank you so much for clarifying for us tonight. We appreciate it. All right. Up next, the devastating consequences of the left soft on crime policies.

And it's why on this program, the HANNITY program, we've continued to cover the 100-day rooftop vigil organized by Pastor Corey Brooks who's raising money in Chicago for a community center to help improve the quality of life in some of the Windy City's toughest neighborhoods. And Pastor Corey Brooks joins us now. Pastor, thanks so much for being here. I got to admit, I watched your day 40 episode of rooftop revelations today at FOXnews.com. Other people can check them out, they're phenomenal. You're doing it day by day. And today, you talked about the role of fathers. You talked about -- you want to repair crime and gangs. You got to get households back together as well."

It's imperative that we get households back together because what we're experiencing especially in Chicago is the blatant disregard of authority and because of that, people have lost their moral confidence their principles are not being abided by and we believe that it's a lack of fathers being in the household, that 80 percent of the households in our neighborhood are fatherless households, there's no father in the house. And we believe that fathers add structure, they add discipline, the things that are needed especially in this day and time. And that's one of the reasons why I'm on this roof, trying to build a community center so that we can fix those issues that our community is dealing with."

Americans when they come together there's nothing that we cannot accomplish. And so, I want to say thank you to all the American citizens who have been given and happy holidays and a happy New Year.

    {
      "speaker": "BROOKS",
      "utterance": "Yeah, it's a dangerous assignment but someone has to do it, someone has to step up and say, hey, enough is enough. We have to take charge and responsibility of our community. We cannot keep depending on government to come in and solve our issues and be dependent upon government because it's not going to fix the issue. We've already had that proven that they cannot solve our problems and that's -- we see that every single day or we would not even be in this situation. So, we have to step up, I'm going to step up and I'm praying that others will step up as well, and we can do it if we all continue to work together and do the things that need to be done -- the tough things that need to be done."

FOX News digital spoke to one father who lost his six-year-old son -- put yourself in those shoes -- six-year-old son in a senseless shooting in the summer of 2020, the summer of love, mostly peaceful protests. And he's slamming the city's all-out neglect when it comes to holding violent criminals actually accountable. Take a look. FATHER OF MURDERED 6-YEAR-OLD: Because of the politics and the policies of the district attorney, there's no accountability. I mean, we're doomed as a city especially with the district attorney like Chesa Boudin, the police are doing their due diligence to try to solve these crimes and hold people accountable for these crimes and the district attorney's office is not willing to prosecute and hold these criminals accountable all the time."

Everyone has a right to defend themselves and they need to defend themselves against rising crime across Tinseltown. Here for reaction, Larry Elder. Larry, thanks so much for being here. You heard what that father had to say, the real life personal consequences of this. Is this -- I mean, are we seeing -- we're seeing the migration of people leaving the state of California. At this point, it's about personal safety."

      "speaker": "LARRY ELDER, NATIONALLY SYNDICATED RADIO HOST",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. Pete, and that poor father lost a six-year-old and the 17-year-old who was prosecuted for the murder of that 17-year-old was prosecuted as a juvenile not as an adult and so, he's probably going to do about five years, maybe eight years if that. What's interesting is that just last year, there was a ballot initiative in that city called Proposition G that would have allowed and year olds the right to vote. So it's okay to vote. It barely failed, it's okay -- it's okay to vote when you're 16 or 17 years old, but if you murder somebody at the age of 17, all of a sudden, you're just a child. It is absolutely outrageous and you're absolutely right, more and more people are buying guns here in California. When Obama was president, if you walk into a gun store, Pete, you see a poster that said salesman of the year and you'd see a picture of Barack Obama now you walk into a gun store in California and you'll see salesman of the year here in L.A. County and you see a picture of prosecutor George Gascon who's one of these soft on crime D.A.'s believes in cashless bail, believes that bad guys are really victims of society. They ought -- they ought not be held accountable and you have laws out here in California like Proposition 57 that have reclassified all sorts of groups of crimes as non-violent. And they include but are not limited to serial arson, non-violent crime, assault on a police officer, nonviolent crime, aggravated assault, nonviolent crime, domestic felony battery, nonviolent crime, rape of an intoxicated victim, non-violent crim. As a result people are not being held for the time they ought to be held and they're out in the streets when they ought not be out in the streets."

Is that why we're seeing the governor and some of these mayors start to at least rhetorically attempt to walk back their defund the police, you know, so-called bail reform nonsense? Is it the rich people getting hit, now, we need to talk about it?"

You have rising crime, rising homelessness, poor quality of public education. People are leaving California for the very first time, poor water management, poor fire management, you name it. And I said it's going to take somebody who is homeless to relieve himself on your front lawn and that front lawn is going to be in Hancock Park or Beverly Hills. Once that happens, then they'll rethink their allegiance to the Democratic Party and bring back common sense. I think we're almost there, Pete."

But you know what's more important, Pete, last year this time, we had not as many deaths, only about 1,500 right now. Last year, we had almost 3,000 deaths. So I think it's important to notice that. Also, it's important to find that balance of safety and your emotional and mental well-being. Look, we are all social creatures. We thrive that human interaction, that social engagement. It's just a matter of knowing your risk, understanding your risk and protecting yourself."

We're adults. Now, Emily, you won't know everyone in Times Square I don't think tomorrow might. What's your approach going to be? EMILY COMPAGNO, CO-HOST OF \"OUTNUMBERED\": Well, I don't need Dr. Fauci to tell me not to kiss 40 or 50 people on New Year's Eve, to your point, Hegseth, because, yes, I'm going to be around a ton of strangers. But I think, unfortunately, it's just another example of the sort of impractical and really out of touch rules that has stemmed from this gentleman's mouth that, unfortunately, the federal government takes as gospel. Because the reality is that every American as Dr. Nesheiwat laid out perfectly assesses their own risk with their personal physician and they make those decisions based on their household and they identify and mitigate their risk factors on their own, and we don't need to hear it from him to not make out with people. Again, I made that decision on my own regardless of him telling me that. But, Pete, it's going to be so fun on New Year's. I'm going to be holding down the fort in Times Square with Lawrence Jones. We're going to be coming to you live all night and I'm so excited with you guys at the helm, you and Rachel and Will there in Nashville and Jimmy doing stand up, it's going to be so exciting. We're doing a scavenger hunt. We have NYPD involved, like there's going to be so much fun stuff here in Times Square in New York City. So, 10:00 p.m. Eastern, stay tuned."

Doctor, what -- we heard that Anthony Fauci's -- his New Year's Eve party is not going to be much fun. There won't be anybody there. Nobody's going to be kissing or hugging.
