The president talks tough on trade, slams the Democrats over immigration and their push to abolish ICE. And he hints at who he may nominate to be the next Supreme Court justice.  Good morning, everyone. Thanks so much for joining me this morning. I'm Maria Bartiromo. Welcome to \"Sunday Morning Futures.\"  Justice Anthony Kennedy announces his retirement, sparking a fierce political battle on Capitol Hill and across the country about his replacement. President Trump now getting another historic opportunity to reshape the high court and affect key issues, including Roe vs. Wade. We will hear what the president has to say about Kennedy's legacy and what kind of judge he plans to nominate on July 9.  ICE is now at the center of the fight over immigration, as Democrats ramp up their calls to get rid of the controversial agency. Why the president believes that will help Republicans win in the midterms if the left makes it a campaign issue. And, as trade tensions escalate with China and Europe, I ask the president how he plans to push back on unfair trade practice and keep Beijing from stealing American innovation.  All that right now, and a lot more, in my exclusive interview with President Trump, as we look ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\"   After an incredibly busy week in our nation's capital and for the country, I sat down for an exclusive interview with President Trump. The conversation covering everything from his upcoming Supreme Court pick to the debate over tariffs and phase two of his plan for the economy. Take a listen.",

And then, for the most part, the rest of it would go right to the middle class. It's a great stimulus.  And one of the things I'm doing that you have been reporting on -- although I'm not sure that you're a believer, but I think you are getting there -- look what's happening with the steel companies. They are doing -- they are expanding. They are going wild. And we need steel. And we need aluminum. And we need solar panels. And, you know, the same thing with solar panels -- it was like a dead business, and we did a 30 percent tariff, because they were dumping all over the place. And washing machines, doesn't sound very glamorous. It is actually a very big business. But if you look at what's happened to steel and aluminum, we practically built a new industry in a period of four, five months. It is incredible, what's happening. But the big thing that I'm focused on now is trade. I have to straighten out trade deals. Maria, we have trade deals -- as an example, with China, we don't even have a trade deal with China. We don't have a deal. Nobody bothered to make a deal.  And they will charge 25 percent for a car, and we charge 2.5 percent. And you have used those numbers on your show, so I don't want to bore people.  But we have a -- some of the -- we have the worst trade deals in the world. We lose money with everybody. You know, when somebody walks in, I say, how much do we lose with this country? We lose with everybody. We are going to make it reciprocal. We are going to make them fair. And I will tell you that you don't know about this, but every country is calling every day, saying, let's make a deal, let's make a deal. It is all going to work out.",

You just heard the president mention oil prices, yesterday he tweeted this, he says just spoke to King Salman of Saudi Arabia and explained to him that because of turmoil and dysfunction in Iran and Venezuela, I'm asking that Saudi Arabia increase oil production maybe up to 2 million barrels a day to make up for the difference. Prices too high, he has agreed. Now last night, the White House issued a statement saying that the Saudi king agreed to raise output if needed, and they made no mention of a specific amount that was pledged however. We're going to react to that interview right now, we've got our panel on deck joining me to talk about that exclusive sit down with President Trump, I will get their thoughts on the looming Supreme Court decision, and whether immigration will be a winning issue for Republicans in November or not. We are looking ahead right now on \"Sunday Morning Futures\", we're back in two minutes time. Welcome back, we are zeroing in on that exclusive interview with President Trump. Let's bring in our panel, Ed Rollins is former Reagan Bush campaign manager, he is a Fox News contributor. Al D'Amato is former Republican senator from New York and a Fox News contributor. And Alan Dershowitz, law profession emeritus at Harvard Law School, and the author of \"The Case Against Impeaching Trump\". Gentlemen, good to see you all, thank you so much for joining us this morning. We appreciate it. And Alan Dershowitz, I want to kick it off with you because of this Supreme Court story, he as very specific in terms of Roe v. Wade, said he's not going to ask these nominees their opinion on that before nominating them. Your take on the Supreme Court decision and what you took away from that interview?",

One who believes in judicial restraint, who recognizes precedent. He shouldn't be focusing on particular cases like Roe versus Wade, he should be thinking about the future. We don't know what will come before the Supreme Court 10, 20 years from now. When you think about some of the past horrible cases, Korematsu where we detained 110,000 Japanese Americans. It was the liberals who supported that and the conservatives who dissented, or when they allowed sterilization of mentally challenged people. It was the liberals who supported that and one lone, conservative, catholic justice who said liberty doesn't permit that. So if he can pick a genuine libertarian rather than somebody who's oriented towards state power, it will contribute enormously to the country and enormously to bringing the people together (ph).",

The president talks tough on trade, slams the Democrats over immigration and their push to abolish ICE. And he hints at who he may nominate to be the next Supreme Court justice. Good morning, everyone. Thanks so much for joining me this morning. I'm Maria Bartiromo. Welcome to \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" Justice Anthony Kennedy announces his retirement, sparking a fierce political battle on Capitol Hill and across the country about his replacement. President Trump now getting another historic opportunity to reshape the high court and affect key issues, including Roe vs. Wade. We will hear what the president has to say about Kennedy's legacy and what kind of judge he plans to nominate on July 9. ICE is now at the center of the fight over immigration, as Democrats ramp up their calls to get rid of the controversial agency. Why the president believes that will help Republicans win in the midterms if the left makes it a campaign issue. And, as trade tensions escalate with China and Europe, I ask the president how he plans to push back on unfair trade practice and keep Beijing from stealing American innovation. All that right now, and a lot more, in my exclusive interview with President Trump, as we look ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" After an incredibly busy week in our nation's capital and for the country, I sat down for an exclusive interview with President Trump. The conversation covering everything from his upcoming Supreme Court pick to the debate over tariffs and phase two of his plan for the economy. Take a listen."

And they were sort of, like, acting anonymous. I said, wait a minute. I'm the president of the United States. How can I see somebody I don't know who it is? Anyway, I figured it out. And it was a very elegant moment. It was a beautiful moment. He presented me with a letter. And it really is a retirement of a great gentleman. He's a fine, fine gentleman, and really did a -- I think he did a very -- he was -- ended up being a little more neutral than a lot of people would have preferred, but a lot of people preferred that he was. And we're going to pick somebody who is outstanding. And I said I will do it in your honor, but we're going to pick somebody who is outstanding.

And I'm very proud of Neil Gorsuch. He's been outstanding. His opinions are so well-written, so brilliant.

And everybody on that list is outstanding, but I'm going to pick somebody who is outstanding. And I think -- yes, I think we will go very quickly. I actually believe that. A lot of people think it is going to be a very long -- it is probably going to be vicious, because the other side, all they can do is obstruct and resist. You know, their whole thing is resist. But -- and maybe someday we will be able to get along with the other side. I don't know. But, right now, it is only resist. That's all they want to do, is stop things from happening. So they are going to try very hard. But I think it is going to go actually very quickly, if I pick the right person."

No -- no president, even during full terms, has cut back anywhere near what I have done. And we have more to do. Now, we're going to have regulation. We're going to have clean water. We're going to have, you know, clean air. We're going to have the cleanest water, cleanest air. But we are -- we have more regulation-cutting to do."

The union decision was a massive decision. The -- you know, you can look at any one of those four, they were all so big, so important. And they would have been exactly reversed. So many -- that's why I have always heard that, as president, I mean, obviously, outside of war and peace, the biggest decision you can make is the selection of a Supreme Court justice. And I see it. And you see it so vividly over the last two days, because, I mean, those decisions would have all gone the other way."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "TRUMP",
      "utterance": "We're doing a phase two. We will be doing it probably in October, maybe a little sooner than that. And it will be more of a middle class. We did a lot for the middle class, but this will be even more aimed at the middle class. One of the things we're thinking about is bringing the 21 percent down to 20. And then, for the most part, the rest of it would go right to the middle class. It's a great stimulus. And one of the things I'm doing that you have been reporting on -- although I'm not sure that you're a believer, but I think you are getting there -- look what's happening with the steel companies. They are doing -- they are expanding. They are going wild. And we need steel. And we need aluminum. And we need solar panels. And, you know, the same thing with solar panels -- it was like a dead business, and we did a 30 percent tariff, because they were dumping all over the place. And washing machines, doesn't sound very glamorous. It is actually a very big business. But if you look at what's happened to steel and aluminum, we practically built a new industry in a period of four, five months. It is incredible, what's happening. But the big thing that I'm focused on now is trade. I have to straighten out trade deals. Maria, we have trade deals -- as an example, with China, we don't even have a trade deal with China. We don't have a deal. Nobody bothered to make a deal. And they will charge 25 percent for a car, and we charge 2.5 percent. And you have used those numbers on your show, so I don't want to bore people. But we have a -- some of the -- we have the worst trade deals in the world. We lose money with everybody. You know, when somebody walks in, I say, how much do we lose with this country? We lose with everybody. We are going to make it reciprocal. We are going to make them fair. And I will tell you that you don't know about this, but every country is calling every day, saying, let's make a deal, let's make a deal. It is all going to work out."

I won that whole -- you look at a map, it's a got a little blue on the outside, everything else is red And it's beautiful color red. But I have to say that, if you look at what's happened with farms, over 15 years, it's just the steady decline. Over the last five -- I've been here a year-and-a-half. Over the last five years, they have been very bad years for farms and farmers. I said, we have to change that. And one of the reasons is because they have barriers. These aren't even economic barriers, although, in Canada's case, 275 percent tariff for dairy. That's not fair."

And they were right -- for South Korea, not for us. That was a Hillary Clinton special. That's done. NAFTA, I could sign it tomorrow, but I'm not happy with it. I want to make it more fair, OK? I want to make..."

And the reason is because, if they're not fine, I'm going to tax their cars coming into America, and that's the big one. You know, the cars are the big one. We can talk steel. We can talk everything. The big thing is the cars."

      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "A -- a major lobbying group for the auto industry says that your administration's threatened 25 percent tariff on all imported vehicles will amount to $45 billion in taxes on consumers and wipe out any benefits of the tax cut plans for low- and middle-income American."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TRUMP",
      "utterance": "Well, actually, it's 20 percent. Tell them to get their numbers right. Look, Maria, what's going to really happen is, there's going to be no tax. You know why? They're going to build their cars in America. They're going to make them here. We bring in millions and millions of cars a year. We charge 2.5 percent. Some of these countries don't even take our cars. If we want to send General Motors or any of our companies to some of these countries, they won't take our cars. They have a barrier. They put up a barrier, non-monetary barrier. They call it non-monetary tariff. And the barrier is so strong, you can't sell a car. If you do sell a car, it's 10 percent, 15 percent, 25 percent. And we get 2.5 percent, and nobody pays it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Yes. Would you agree, though, that a tariff is a sales tax? I mean, even Steve Forbes was on my show last week. He said, look, for every job you're creating in the aluminum and steel industry, you're losing 15 in the industries that import aluminum and steel."

      "speaker": "TRUMP",
      "utterance": "First of all, I love free trade. Do you know, when I was at the G7, I said, I have an idea, everybody. I'll guarantee you we'll do it immediately. Nobody pay anymore tax, everybody take down your barriers. No barriers, no tax. Everybody, are you all set? No more tax. Canada, you're not going to get 275 percent for your dairy, and you're going to take down all your barriers. We're going to take all our barriers. We're going to down all our taxes, right? You know what happened? Everybody said, \"Uh, can we get onto another subject?\" Because America, our country, lost last year $817 billion in terms of deficit. We had a trade deficit, Maria, of 817 billion -- with a B -- dollars last year. Before that, it was $800 billion. This has been going on for years. We have rebuilt China. I have a great relationship with China, great relationship with President Xi. I have tremendous respect for him. But I said, We have to straighten this out. We can't continue to do this."

The tariffs are -- in fact, it could go up to 500, frankly, if we don't make a deal. And they want to make a deal. I will tell you, China wants to make a deal. And so do I, but it's got to be a fair deal for this country. One of the hard things is, our presidents and our business leaders, they were missing in action -- not so much the business leaders. You know, some business leaders benefit by allowing this stuff to go on. That's the problem. They benefit. They're more for their business than they are for the United States. I had a great company, the head of a great company come up to me. He's very seriously affected by the tariffs."

I like the president. He's president for life. We can call him the king, right? But I like the president. I didn't like pinpointing China. I don't think it's fair, because they're not the only ones. Now, they're bigger and stronger. And, frankly, they do it more. And they're probably a bigger violator. But it's other countries too. And I wanted to go worldwide. And we are doing that. So, actually, what I'm doing is a very similar thing. But I want it to pertain to everybody. So, you mean China can't -- China can't do it, but other countries can? Now, I know China, and I know how smart they are. They'll send their people into other counties and do it through other counties. And they'll just go through an extra process."

European Union, take a look at the car situation. They send a Mercedes in. We can't send our cars in. Look what they do to our farmers. They don't want our farm products. Now, in all fairness, they have their farmers. So, they want to protect their farmers. But we don't protect ours, and they protect theirs. The European Union last year made, if you look at a trade surplus, which I think is a very important thing, $151 billion. Now, we all sort of love the European Union.

They would have put more regulations on. There wouldn't have been any tax cuts. For the tax cuts, we didn't get one Democrat vote. Now add this to it. Part of their platform, one other thing they want to do, they want to raise the taxes. They want to end the tax cuts, take the money back, and they want to raise the taxes.

BARTIROMO: Thanks very much for joining us. TRUMP: Thank you very much. Thank you, Maria. BARTIROMO: Appreciate it. And my thanks to President Trump for joining us. You just heard the president mention oil prices, yesterday he tweeted this, he says just spoke to King Salman of Saudi Arabia and explained to him that because of turmoil and dysfunction in Iran and Venezuela, I'm asking that Saudi Arabia increase oil production maybe up to 2 million barrels a day to make up for the difference. Prices too high, he has agreed. Now last night, the White House issued a statement saying that the Saudi king agreed to raise output if needed, and they made no mention of a specific amount that was pledged however. We're going to react to that interview right now, we've got our panel on deck joining me to talk about that exclusive sit down with President Trump, I will get their thoughts on the looming Supreme Court decision, and whether immigration will be a winning issue for Republicans in November or not. We are looking ahead right now on \"Sunday Morning Futures\", we're back in two minutes time. Welcome back, we are zeroing in on that exclusive interview with President Trump. Let's bring in our panel, Ed Rollins is former Reagan Bush campaign manager, he is a Fox News contributor. Al D'Amato is former Republican senator from New York and a Fox News contributor. And Alan Dershowitz, law profession emeritus at Harvard Law School, and the author of \"The Case Against Impeaching Trump\". Gentlemen, good to see you all, thank you so much for joining us this morning. We appreciate it. And Alan Dershowitz, I want to kick it off with you because of this Supreme Court story, he as very specific in terms of Roe v. Wade, said he's not going to ask these nominees their opinion on that before nominating them. Your take on the Supreme Court decision and what you took away from that interview?"

    {
      "speaker": "ALAN DERSHOWITZ, LAWYER",
      "utterance": "Well I think the most important thing, if he wants to unite the country and broaden his own base is to pick a true conservative Libertarian, one who emphasizes individual liberty over the power of the state. One who believes in judicial restraint, who recognizes precedent. He shouldn't be focusing on particular cases like Roe versus Wade, he should be thinking about the future. We don't know what will come before the Supreme Court 10, 20 years from now. When you think about some of the past horrible cases, Korematsu where we detained 110,000 Japanese Americans. It was the liberals who supported that and the conservatives who dissented, or when they allowed sterilization of mentally challenged people. It was the liberals who supported that and one lone, conservative, catholic justice who said liberty doesn't permit that. So if he can pick a genuine libertarian rather than somebody who's oriented towards state power, it will contribute enormously to the country and enormously to bringing the people together (ph)."

    {
      "speaker": "DERSHOWITZ",
      "utterance": "Well, remember the question, Roe v. Wade there were three possibilities. One, Roe versus Wade was wrong then, it's wrong now, I'm going to overrule it. Second, Roe versus Wade was wrong then, but it's been on the books for 45 years. I'm not going to overrule it. The third most extreme position is I believe in a constitutional right to life and therefore not only do I overrule Roe versus Wade, but I prevent the states from allowing abortion because allowing abortion denies the right of the fetus to life. I don't believe he'll nominate somebody who will -- who accepts that third position, because that would hurt America and divide it greatly. I think he should pick somebody who respects precedent and will not overrule Roe versus Wade."

      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",

    {
      "speaker": "AL D'AMATO, FORMER SENATOR, R-N.Y.",
      "utterance": "I believe it will be, I really do, because I think not withstanding that there are two senators on the Republican side who Roe v. Wade is a big matter and -- and therefore I think the president already kind of has taken that off the table. But there are several Democrats who are in tough races in -- in states that the president carried overwhelmingly who will undoubtedly support the nominee, if the nominee meets the criteria that the president talks about. And I think he's right, a conservative, I -- agree with Alan. You want a -- a -- someone who believes in the constitution, who's a libertarian, and I honestly believe it will be done before the recess -- yes."

      "speaker": "ROLLINS",
      "utterance": "Once you get rid of all the brush underneath his feet, all the little minor controversies and really look at -- focus on what he's done, he's done an extraordinary amount in 18 months, and I worked for an extraordinary president, Ronald Reagan. If he appoints, and he's got a list of people to appoint that are superb, we have gone through this test before. My sense is -- I'm not on the selection panel, but I would -- I would recommend a conservative -- a real conservative, originalist woman. Sandra Day O'Conner was the first woman that Reagan appointed, by the end, she was the swing vote, voted most correctly most times. But a real conservative who can drive that court and help that court basically set precedent for the future I think would be a great, great appointment."

      "speaker": "ROLLINS",
      "utterance": "This -- this is a campaign of -- of this cycle, and -- and we're down to about 25 seats in the House that are -- that are swing seats, Democrats have to win two thirds of those to take the majority. He's going to have to talk about trade, he's going to have to talk about this appointment which is going to basically dominate everything between now and then, and I think the reality is that it's something he feels very positive about and I think he does it very, very well."
