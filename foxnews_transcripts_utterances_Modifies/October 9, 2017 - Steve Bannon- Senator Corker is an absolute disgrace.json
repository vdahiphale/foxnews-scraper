You the American people are being victimized by a liberal cultural hypocrisy, it is now penetrating every single aspect of our lives. The left, liberals, they like to claim they have moral monopoly, superiority on race, women's rights, gay rights, freedom of speech, religious freedom. It's a massive lie.  Tonight here on this program, we will expose that lie. And as the Harvey Weinstein scandal is exposing, the left only cares about one thing and one thing only -- money. Laura Ingraham is here with reaction.  Also, brand-new audio just released. Senator Bob Corker attacking the president to the New York Times. Listen to this.",

      "sentences": "We will have a lot more of that tape and Steve Bannon is here tonight to react with some pretty strong words. Also to former NFL greats are here for a big debate after another controversial weekend on the NFL football field. The Vice President of the United States Mike Pence, he left the Colts 49ers game after players continued to disrespect the flag, the anthem and of course, our military.  Also tonight, Republican House Majority Whip Steve Scalise. Remember, he was the victim of that shooting, he will respond to the left's call for gun control after the Vegas shooting. And tonight, we have two major announcements. Big ones you do not want to miss. But first, tonight's important breaking news opening monologue.   All right. This weekend, more and more disturbing accusations emerged about Hollywood executive and major, major Democratic donor Harvey Weinstein. Now after mounting allegations of sexual harassment, Weinstein was actually fired by his own company. That's good news. Now what details of what Weinstein is accused of doing are beyond shocking. What is even more disturbing is the fact that for 30 years, this guy has been praised by the left, by liberals, by Hollywood and Democrats. Now, let me explain. The website Axios, they analyzed almost 1,400 Academy Awards acceptance speeches. Harvey Weinstein ranked second for the most thanked person. Now back in 2012, Meryl Streep even jokingly called Weinstein God and she is only just a handful of celebrities that are now speaking out against Weinstein in the face of these accusations. But where is the widespread outrage and condemnation from Hollywood? I thought they cared about women's rights. Now, if tables were turned and this was a conservative in the same situation, Hollywood liberals would be enraged. The media would be enraged. However, since it's one of their own, it's mostly crickets. The silence is deafening.   Another example of how Hollywood has ignored this scandal? According to Axios -- look at all these late-night comedians. Jimmy Kimmel, Jimmy Fallon, Seth Meyers, James Corden. Guess what? They did not mention it at all during their shows. And \"Saturday Night Live,\" the show that ruthlessly mocks President Trump and all conservatives, well, they had jokes written about Weinstein yet they never made air. And what's worse is that the \"SNL\" creator, Lorne Michaels, he tells the Daily Mail that the reason he did not go after Weinstein because it's, quote, \"A New York thing.\" Really? What Michaels really meant? It's a hypocrisy thing. And you can't forget about Attorney Lisa Bloom. Pretty much, any time a woman accuses a conservative of something, she swoops in to represent them with a major press conference to attack conservatives. Big surprise. Bloom was actually advising Weinstein before resigning this weekend. And Bloom made the announcement via Twitter -- not tweeter. Quote, \"I have resigned as an attorney and advisor to Harvey Weinstein. My understanding is that Mr. Weinstein and his board are moving forward and toward an agreement.\" What is that even mean? Now, you would think since Bloom is the so-called champion of women's rights that she would never, ever consider working for Weinstein. Her hypocrisy is stunning but it is not surprising. Now, the same goes for many Democrats. They took piles of money from Harvey Weinstein and only now after these allegations surfaced, some, just a few, not all of them are beginning to give it back or give it to charity. Look at these statistics. Weinstein donated an estimated $44,000 to Hillary Clinton since 1999. And that's on top of the $15,000 he shelled out to a Super Pac tied to Clinton.  Weinstein also contributed over $56,000 to the Obama Victory Fund. The Hollywood big shot, he gave over $90,000 to the Democratic National Committee. And he also wrote checks for over $76,000 for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. All told the Center for Responsive Politics calculates Weinstein contributed over $2 million to Democrats. That's only since the year 2000.   Now some Democrats they're giving some of the money back or they are donating it to other liberal causes. They think that cleans their hands. But again, no across-the-board outrage. No disgust. And we can't forget that the two biggest beneficiaries of Weinstein's contributions, Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, they have yet to comment and publicly about him. If he was a conservative, do you think they might have commented? This is what I was telling you about during the election. Liberals claim to care the most about women's rights. If they did, Hillary Clinton and her family foundation would never have taken money from countries like Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman, Kuwait, the UAE. Now these country's treat women horribly. They kill gays and lesbians many of them. They persecute Christians and Jews. You can't build a temple and a church in Saudi Arabia.  So, the left, this is selective moral outrage. They are completely full of it on every single issue that they lecture you that they are morally superior about over Republicans. For example, The Daily Caller reporting that there's a coffee shop owner in Seattle, Washington -- we have the videotape of a group of Christian anti-abortion activists get kicked out after a vial tirade all because the owner could not tolerate their presence. Watch this.",

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "sentences": "We now have reached the point of cultural insanity. The left claims they are all for free speech but look what happens at the so-called home of freedom of speech. And we also cannot forget that conservatives have pretty much been essentially blocked from speaking at UC Berkeley. The left does not care about this country's history, doesn't care about its culture.   Just look at these videos from earlier today. All the Columbus Day protest. Liberals, they have no problem supporting people defacing, vandalizing our history and statues. Do you know what? What about what other people think? What about tolerance? It's just like what we saw when leftists were tearing down or removing confederate monuments. Here it goes even further.  Now, the one thing the left does not seem to care about is the NFL. When they disrespect our flag, our country. And the thousands and thousands of Americans that fought blood and died fighting under that flag. And they are out there protesting the national anthem. This weekend, the Vice President Mike Pence, he walked out of yesterday's NFL game following the national anthem protests. The vice president and second lady Karen Pence attended the game in Indianapolis. And after a handful of 49ers, all refused to honor the flag, Pence and his wife rightly headed for the exits. The vice president later tweeted, quote, \"I left today's Colts game because @POTUS and I will not dignify any event that disrespects our soldiers, our flag, or our national anthem.\"  We have a big debate later in the program. And President Trump took the Twitter writing, quote, \"I asked Vice President Pence to leave the stadium if players kneeled, disrespecting our country. I am proud of him and Second Lady Karen.\" Good for the vice president taking a stand. Americans are sick and tired of seeing these players protesting the flag and not honoring those brave men and women that fought, bled, and died. And by the way, this is a country that gives them an opportunity to make millions of dollars playing a game. NFL owners are beginning to start to realize that millions are at stake here and the American people are fed up for what is now blatantly disrespectful behavior.  Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, he said yesterday that players who protests the national anthem, they are not going to play. And the Miami Dolphins owner, Stephen Ross, he is saying it's incumbent on players to stand and salute the flag of the United States.  Finally, it's about time these owners did something. Because as Marc Thiessen pointed out a couple of weeks ago, the NFL's game operations manual says, \"All players must be on the sideline for the National Anthem. They must stand at attention, face the flag. Hold their helmets and their left hand and refrain from talking or face discipline such as fines, suspensions, and or forfeiture of draft choices,\" first offense.  But by the way, you can't do this in the end zone. Or you can't twerk or you can't be offensive to the other team or you can't gloat in the end zone. A lot of rules are restricting freedom of speech. You can't put \"9/11, We Will Never Forget\" on your cleats. And you can't honor police officers slain in Dallas. Now of course, after the vice president left the NFL game, the left and liberal mainstream media went into full on freak out mode.  ESPN's Jemele Hill, you remember her? She is the liberal host who tweeted that President Trump was a white supremacist. Well, earlier tonight, Hill was suspended by ESPN for two weeks after calling for fans to boycott advertisers of the Dallas Cowboys. Now, it's interesting how she got suspended for that and not for attacking the president of the United States. Here's the bottom-line tonight: this country is divided culturally because the left is hypocritical and inconsistent. They only feign phony moral outrage but only when it suits their political agenda. They only care about their only outrage over the conservative scandals, not liberal ones. And they pretend to have the moral authority on issues like race, women's rights, gay rights, and the list goes on and on. The truth is this -- the left has been lying about all of that for a long time. And this Harvey Weinstein scandal proves all of it. For the right price, the left and their silence can be bought. Joining us now with more on this. The author of brand-new just out today. \"Billionaire at the Barricades: The Populist Revolution from Reagan to Trump\" in bookstores now.

You the American people are being victimized by a liberal cultural hypocrisy, it is now penetrating every single aspect of our lives. The left, liberals, they like to claim they have moral monopoly, superiority on race, women's rights, gay rights, freedom of speech, religious freedom. It's a massive lie. Tonight here on this program, we will expose that lie. And as the Harvey Weinstein scandal is exposing, the left only cares about one thing and one thing only -- money. Laura Ingraham is here with reaction. Also, brand-new audio just released. Senator Bob Corker attacking the president to the New York Times. Listen to this."

      "utterance": "We will have a lot more of that tape and Steve Bannon is here tonight to react with some pretty strong words. Also to former NFL greats are here for a big debate after another controversial weekend on the NFL football field. The Vice President of the United States Mike Pence, he left the Colts 49ers game after players continued to disrespect the flag, the anthem and of course, our military. Also tonight, Republican House Majority Whip Steve Scalise. Remember, he was the victim of that shooting, he will respond to the left's call for gun control after the Vegas shooting. And tonight, we have two major announcements. Big ones you do not want to miss. But first, tonight's important breaking news opening monologue. All right. This weekend, more and more disturbing accusations emerged about Hollywood executive and major, major Democratic donor Harvey Weinstein. Now after mounting allegations of sexual harassment, Weinstein was actually fired by his own company. That's good news. Now what details of what Weinstein is accused of doing are beyond shocking. What is even more disturbing is the fact that for 30 years, this guy has been praised by the left, by liberals, by Hollywood and Democrats. Now, let me explain. The website Axios, they analyzed almost 1,400 Academy Awards acceptance speeches. Harvey Weinstein ranked second for the most thanked person. Now back in 2012, Meryl Streep even jokingly called Weinstein God and she is only just a handful of celebrities that are now speaking out against Weinstein in the face of these accusations. But where is the widespread outrage and condemnation from Hollywood? I thought they cared about women's rights. Now, if tables were turned and this was a conservative in the same situation, Hollywood liberals would be enraged. The media would be enraged. However, since it's one of their own, it's mostly crickets. The silence is deafening. Another example of how Hollywood has ignored this scandal? According to Axios -- look at all these late-night comedians. Jimmy Kimmel, Jimmy Fallon, Seth Meyers, James Corden. Guess what? They did not mention it at all during their shows. And \"Saturday Night Live,\" the show that ruthlessly mocks President Trump and all conservatives, well, they had jokes written about Weinstein yet they never made air. And what's worse is that the \"SNL\" creator, Lorne Michaels, he tells the Daily Mail that the reason he did not go after Weinstein because it's, quote, \"A New York thing.\" Really? What Michaels really meant? It's a hypocrisy thing. And you can't forget about Attorney Lisa Bloom. Pretty much, any time a woman accuses a conservative of something, she swoops in to represent them with a major press conference to attack conservatives. Big surprise. Bloom was actually advising Weinstein before resigning this weekend. And Bloom made the announcement via Twitter -- not tweeter. Quote, \"I have resigned as an attorney and advisor to Harvey Weinstein. My understanding is that Mr. Weinstein and his board are moving forward and toward an agreement.\" What is that even mean? Now, you would think since Bloom is the so-called champion of women's rights that she would never, ever consider working for Weinstein. Her hypocrisy is stunning but it is not surprising. Now, the same goes for many Democrats. They took piles of money from Harvey Weinstein and only now after these allegations surfaced, some, just a few, not all of them are beginning to give it back or give it to charity. Look at these statistics. Weinstein donated an estimated $44,000 to Hillary Clinton since 1999. And that's on top of the $15,000 he shelled out to a Super Pac tied to Clinton. Weinstein also contributed over $56,000 to the Obama Victory Fund. The Hollywood big shot, he gave over $90,000 to the Democratic National Committee. And he also wrote checks for over $76,000 for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. All told the Center for Responsive Politics calculates Weinstein contributed over $2 million to Democrats. That's only since the year 2000. Now some Democrats they're giving some of the money back or they are donating it to other liberal causes. They think that cleans their hands. But again, no across-the-board outrage. No disgust. And we can't forget that the two biggest beneficiaries of Weinstein's contributions, Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, they have yet to comment and publicly about him. If he was a conservative, do you think they might have commented? This is what I was telling you about during the election. Liberals claim to care the most about women's rights. If they did, Hillary Clinton and her family foundation would never have taken money from countries like Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman, Kuwait, the UAE. Now these country's treat women horribly. They kill gays and lesbians many of them. They persecute Christians and Jews. You can't build a temple and a church in Saudi Arabia. So, the left, this is selective moral outrage. They are completely full of it on every single issue that they lecture you that they are morally superior about over Republicans. For example, The Daily Caller reporting that there's a coffee shop owner in Seattle, Washington -- we have the videotape of a group of Christian anti-abortion activists get kicked out after a vial tirade all because the owner could not tolerate their presence. Watch this."

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "We now have reached the point of cultural insanity. The left claims they are all for free speech but look what happens at the so-called home of freedom of speech. And we also cannot forget that conservatives have pretty much been essentially blocked from speaking at UC Berkeley. The left does not care about this country's history, doesn't care about its culture. Just look at these videos from earlier today. All the Columbus Day protest. Liberals, they have no problem supporting people defacing, vandalizing our history and statues. Do you know what? What about what other people think? What about tolerance? It's just like what we saw when leftists were tearing down or removing confederate monuments. Here it goes even further. Now, the one thing the left does not seem to care about is the NFL. When they disrespect our flag, our country. And the thousands and thousands of Americans that fought blood and died fighting under that flag. And they are out there protesting the national anthem. This weekend, the Vice President Mike Pence, he walked out of yesterday's NFL game following the national anthem protests. The vice president and second lady Karen Pence attended the game in Indianapolis. And after a handful of 49ers, all refused to honor the flag, Pence and his wife rightly headed for the exits. The vice president later tweeted, quote, \"I left today's Colts game because @POTUS and I will not dignify any event that disrespects our soldiers, our flag, or our national anthem.\" We have a big debate later in the program. And President Trump took the Twitter writing, quote, \"I asked Vice President Pence to leave the stadium if players kneeled, disrespecting our country. I am proud of him and Second Lady Karen.\" Good for the vice president taking a stand. Americans are sick and tired of seeing these players protesting the flag and not honoring those brave men and women that fought, bled, and died. And by the way, this is a country that gives them an opportunity to make millions of dollars playing a game. NFL owners are beginning to start to realize that millions are at stake here and the American people are fed up for what is now blatantly disrespectful behavior. Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, he said yesterday that players who protests the national anthem, they are not going to play. And the Miami Dolphins owner, Stephen Ross, he is saying it's incumbent on players to stand and salute the flag of the United States. Finally, it's about time these owners did something. Because as Marc Thiessen pointed out a couple of weeks ago, the NFL's game operations manual says, \"All players must be on the sideline for the National Anthem. They must stand at attention, face the flag. Hold their helmets and their left hand and refrain from talking or face discipline such as fines, suspensions, and or forfeiture of draft choices,\" first offense. But by the way, you can't do this in the end zone. Or you can't twerk or you can't be offensive to the other team or you can't gloat in the end zone. A lot of rules are restricting freedom of speech. You can't put \"9/11, We Will Never Forget\" on your cleats. And you can't honor police officers slain in Dallas. Now of course, after the vice president left the NFL game, the left and liberal mainstream media went into full on freak out mode. ESPN's Jemele Hill, you remember her? She is the liberal host who tweeted that President Trump was a white supremacist. Well, earlier tonight, Hill was suspended by ESPN for two weeks after calling for fans to boycott advertisers of the Dallas Cowboys. Now, it's interesting how she got suspended for that and not for attacking the president of the United States."

And they pretend to have the moral authority on issues like race, women's rights, gay rights, and the list goes on and on. The truth is this -- the left has been lying about all of that for a long time. And this Harvey Weinstein scandal proves all of it. For the right price, the left and their silence can be bought.

You look at just getting to the hospital alive, my colleague said if an army ranger or someone who helped get people from the battlefield, he applied a tourniquet to slow the bleeding down. I would have bled out if I didn't have that tourniquet applied. I would not have even made it to the hospital."

In any tragedy, your first thought ought to be how can we help the people that are suffering? The victims of a criminal act like this. Let's pray for them first of all. In a case like what happened in Las Vegas, similar what happened to me. A lot of people needed blood. And yet, you get some people. Their first thought when they hear what happened is to go and hold a press conference and call for more gun control when they don't even know the facts. What they are offering, it would have done nothing to stop that shooting. Why don't we in those moments, our thoughts ought to be with the victims and praying for them. I felt the prayers. I imagine a lot of those families are looking for those prayers right now."
