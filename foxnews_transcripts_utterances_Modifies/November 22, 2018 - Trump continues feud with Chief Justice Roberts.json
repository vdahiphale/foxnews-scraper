I think Afghanistan will be the natural place that he will go. One of the interesting things with the president is that you do see, and we've obviously seen with Chief Justice Roberts, the tension about the separation of powers, the notion of constitutional powers. The president earlier today as well was speaking to a Naval officer who was talking about nuclear physics, oddly. And it was very striking to see, and this is where I think you see President Trump having a pretty good rapport with the military brass, the elites, the four-star generals as well as the enlisted personnel, that he does have a deference to their expertise. I think he likes the fact that they their job is to close with and destroy the enemy, personally. But at the same time, I think it is to the president's credit. He's at his best in a way with the military in the sense that he defers to better judgment, but he also has a respect for it and he is willing to listen. And that earlier discussion with a nuclear physics guy, the officer today, there was a disagreement, but he was like, OK, I sort of agree with you. You don't see that with other people. So I think the opportunity for the White House coming off the back of the midterms to go to a war zone is to say actually, the president, as George W. Bush was to a degree, in the comfort zone.",

I think he's very frustrated with the way that has gone since he agreed to that southern, south Asia policy as he did last year. The same in Syria, fighting ISIS. I think he wants to be done and out of there.  So would a trip to visit the troops send a mixed message? Would it may be perceived as an endorsement?

I think that is where you are getting Justice Roberts really kind of feeling like he has to defend the impartiality, or rather the independence of the judiciary. That we may be nominated by presidents of a certain party, but at least ideally we are that presidents guy on the bench -- you do hear this. Neil Gorsuch, the president's first major accomplishment, getting him on the Supreme Court, very early on in his Supreme Court tenure ruled against the president on an immigration issue.
