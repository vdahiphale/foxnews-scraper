It was an incredible and an electric speech by the President. Some saying it was a little too long, but this was his moment and he connected with this audience here and across the country, if any doubt in your mind, about what's at stake and who can keep America, our country that we love safe and, on the road, to even greater prosperity. Well, Donald Trump just reminded you. Now, in moments we're going to be joined right here on set by the president's son, Donald Trump Jr. is making his way over here right now and South Dakota Governor and rising star, Kristi Noem.  But first, the President knows that the Democrats are taking on political water after for months excusing these riotous events across the country. They called them protests for the longest period of time, but they went into massive looting that did enormous destruction from some of our most beautiful cities in the United States. And he took their pathetic and transparent shift attempt to blame shift to President Trump. He took that on tonight.",

Every, every night of the convention was a focus on policy achievements, you know, whether it's Criminal Justice Reform, Education Policy, and they seemed wanting to tell the country about why they do the things they do.  And it was also a big indictment, I think of the media itself. Going through this convention and seeing the story being told that has been completely hidden by the media or lied about by the media about the accomplishments of the Trump administration, and I think that explains a bit about why so many people in the media are not having the best night they know that Republicans had a good convention and they know that Democrats didn't have a good convention.

The Democrat Convention was all about Donald Trump is bad.   The person, the man, he's bad. What Donald Trump laid out tonight was something much deeper. It was, what will happen if the Democrats win? It's societal. Its cultural. As the President put it, he talked about speech codes and cancel culture and crushing conformity. And then he talked about the violence in the cities. That's societal. That's the implications if this continues and if the Democrats stay in charge of the cities, and Joe Biden wins.

Looking at these themes, people were being allowed to talk freely and openly about their faith. And it was in strong contrast to some of what we've seen in in in the culture. But the embrace of product-life values and having it not just be one speech, but again, many speeches. Also, reaching out really earnestly seeking Black voters to come join the Republican Party and doing it based on policy and not just platitudes, which is what you've seen in previous conventions, going through all the things that the Trump administration has done to try to gain Black voters and gain their trust and get them to - with Republican Party this time around.   And they were real things, funding for historically Black colleges and universities, criminal justice reform, job growth, wage growth that really benefits Black men and women.

And then the Republicans wanted to dispel the idea that they were white supremacists are racist, but they really did much better. They redefined this division in America's class, which is an inclusive terms and you saw that at the convention. Black people, nonwhite people, White people, all the upper, and middle and lower middle class. And the Democrats fell into this trap of being Hollywood, Silicon Valley, Wall Street and very elite identity politics activists, and I think that really hurt them. And then finally, the winds of the news cycle had been changing from headwinds to Trump to tailwind sometime around mid-August. And then these conventions were going to adjudicate whether the Democrats could stop it, or whether the Republicans could accelerate that trend. It was very important, because at some magical point, I think it's one or two points away. Joe Biden strategies are inert, when Trump gets close on the polls. He'll have to go out, and you saw what happened today when he goes out, he makes a fool of himself. So I think that it was successful. And you can see that Democrats know that better than anybody, because they're relying on internal polling. Internal polls don't lie. You don't pay for somebody to lie to you in confidence.

But when people talk about religion and the power of faith, there are some people I know who don't like it, because they think it means oppression. I think it means telling somebody what to think and what to believe, shoving it down your throat. When you listened to Alice tonight, you heard the power of redemption.

      "utterance": "It's just stunning to compare the Democratic Convention last week with the one this week in substance and in style. Substantively, the Democrats were so pessimistic, so down on the country, not explaining a lot of their policy positions. Republicans seemed eager to talk about policy. Every, every night of the convention was a focus on policy achievements, you know, whether it's Criminal Justice Reform, Education Policy, and they seemed wanting to tell the country about why they do the things they do. And it was also a big indictment, I think of the media itself. Going through this convention and seeing the story being told that has been completely hidden by the media or lied about by the media about the accomplishments of the Trump administration, and I think that explains a bit about why so many people in the media are not having the best night they know that Republicans had a good convention and they know that Democrats didn't have a good convention. And because they have become more openly partisan. It's very frustrating to them."

They're angry that people weren't socially distanced and didn't have masks on, but it seems like the country is craving normalcy, and they like seeing people back together again, because we're social people we want to be together.

I just thought hearing applause was refreshing. I don't think you've heard applause at a live event in six months. But when -- I'm struck, when I look at the difference between the two. The Democrat Convention was all about Donald Trump is bad. The person, the man, he's bad. What Donald Trump laid out tonight was something much deeper. It was, what will happen if the Democrats win? It's societal. Its cultural. As the President put it, he talked about speech codes and cancel culture and crushing conformity. And then he talked about the violence in the cities. That's societal. That's the implications if this continues and if the Democrats stay in charge of the cities, and Joe Biden wins. That's a much more powerful message, I think, than just Donald Trump the man is bad."

And it wasn't just about, having people give prayers to begin or end the evening, which is kind of standard at a convention. It was woven through every single - most everyone's speeches. Looking at these themes, people were being allowed to talk freely and openly about their faith. And it was in strong contrast to some of what we've seen in in in the culture. But the embrace of product-life values and having it not just be one speech, but again, many speeches. Also, reaching out really earnestly seeking Black voters to come join the Republican Party and doing it based on policy and not just platitudes, which is what you've seen in previous conventions, going through all the things that the Trump administration has done to try to gain Black voters and gain their trust and get them to - with Republican Party this time around. And they were real things, funding for historically Black colleges and universities, criminal justice reform, job growth, wage growth that really benefits Black men and women. And this is something unlike anything we've seen with the Republican Party and it was just less scared about talking about these things openly, whether it was faith or race or any of these issues that the Republicans have not particularly done a great job with previously."

Just walking these grounds and giving tours on domestic policy shop. But it was it was Lee Greenwood, it was it was embracing that Reagan optimism. How significant could that be for those undecided voters that we're a great country, we're not an evil, dark, gloomy place. We're a place of great opportunity. Teach that to the kids.

It is part and parcel of Republicanism and Republicans wear it on their sleeves. That's about the flag too. Laura, when you see people burn flags in this violence, it just tears you up inside.

I mean, that is one of the great American traditions, something that went on for 240 plus years, until now, until Donald Trump. And what's amazing about it, though, and what's really amazing about my father to me is that, despite all that adversity, I mean trying to throw his family in jail, unmasking his children, Russia hoax. I mean, they're still talking it about today as though it's real. Impeachment. He still delivered for the American people. He still put his head down, pushed through everything and got it done and delivered for the American people. That's an anomaly. That doesn't happen.

But now when CNN says, we know this is really kind of affecting the poll numbers now, it's getting a little ridiculous. Now, Joe Biden decides to step up. It's like the rest of Joe Biden's policies. Right. Now, after half a century in the swamp - after half a century, now he's going to deliver for the American people. Why would you wait 50 years? Why wouldn't you do it now? If Joe Biden could deliver for the American people? You think we'd have seen some of it by now? It's nonsense. It's smoke and mirrors. They do what the polling tells them.

You saw it the other day on CNN. Well, it's fiery, but mostly peaceful protests, while there's buildings burning in the background and people being killed in the streets. This isn't Donald Trump. This has been Democrat policies were Democrat people have allowed this to happen. They've set by, they haven't condemned it. They've sat by and watched it happen in their streets as if there's tacit acceptance, because the Democrat Party is far more likely to stand with the criminals then they are with law abiding citizens who just want to live their American Dream."

While in prison, I became a playwright, a mentor, a certified hospice volunteer and ordained minister, and received a Special Olympics event coordinator of the Year Award for my work with disabled women.

      "utterance": "Yes, I think the convention achieved two or three goals. It redefined the race is not necessarily Michelle Obama's great speech or Trump's tweets or liberal conservative, it's civilization versus civilization's discontents. In other words, the American way of life as we know it and is always constantly improving versus the people who are just so discontented, they want to tear it down. And then the Republicans wanted to dispel the idea that they were white supremacists are racist, but they really did much better. They redefined this division in America's class, which is an inclusive terms and you saw that at the convention. Black people, nonwhite people, White people, all the upper, and middle and lower middle class. And the Democrats fell into this trap of being Hollywood, Silicon Valley, Wall Street and very elite identity politics activists, and I think that really hurt them. And then finally, the winds of the news cycle had been changing from headwinds to Trump to tailwind sometime around mid-August. And then these conventions were going to adjudicate whether the Democrats could stop it, or whether the Republicans could accelerate that trend. It was very important, because at some magical point, I think it's one or two points away. Joe Biden strategies are inert, when Trump gets close on the polls. He'll have to go out, and you saw what happened today when he goes out, he makes a fool of himself. So I think that it was successful. And you can see that Democrats know that better than anybody, because they're relying on internal polling. Internal polls don't lie. You don't pay for somebody to lie to you in confidence. And when Michelle Obama says before and get out - to get out to vote. And Nancy Pelosi says, cancel the debates and Don Lemon say, address the violence. And Hillary Clinton says, don't concede, that's a reflection that the polls are changing."

I actually think Joe Biden will do fine in a debate. He's very good at shooting the breeze. And he'll do fine as he did fine in his last primary debate. But it really is significant that Democrats are so worried about it that they don't want him to go. The thing is, Joe Biden has three opportunity - had three opportunities, really, to change this race from one - well, to really make to make a significant statement. With who he picked as his vice president, with how he ran his convention, and then how he does in his debates. He flubbed the first one, the vice presidential pick. It was a totally wasted Democratic convention where they forgot to actually make the case for voting for them for any reason other than Donald Trump is someone that they personally loathe. And if he doesn't show up at the debates that is going to be devastating for him. But I think he will and he'll do just fine, I'm sure."

CARL & MARSHA MUELLER, DAUGHTER MURDERED BY ISIS: The government led us down. President Obama refused to meet with us until ISIS had already beheaded other Americans. To this day, we've never heard from Joe Biden. The administration showed more concern for the terrorists in Guantanamo than the American hostages in Syria. After 18 months of brutal torture, we learned from ISIS that Kayla had been killed. The Trump team gave us empathy we never received from the Obama administration. The Obama administration said it was doing everything it could. The Trump administration is - let me just say this, Kayla should be here. If Donald Trump had been president when Kayla was captured, she would be here today."

But Laura, if I can, I want to go back to your question to Mollie about religion, and how you began this with a beautiful woman Alice Marie Johnson. And I should disclose, I have a client who works in criminal justice reform and I earlier this week moderated a discussion with Alice Marie, and I got to know Alice - even I got to know her better. But when people talk about religion and the power of faith, there are some people I know who don't like it, because they think it means oppression. I think it means telling somebody what to think and what to believe, shoving it down your throat. When you listened to Alice tonight, you heard the power of redemption. This is what faith does for individual who seeks redemption. What a powerful moving story. And that is the power of religion, that tens of millions, hundreds of millions in both parties share. It is a powerful part of America. And I loved hearing it tonight for that woman who is now free."

They're nonexistent as if that they never existed in the first place. Mollie wrote a good column the other day and pointed out that a lot of these people are deeply invested in the swamp, in lucrative consulting and lobbyists. And then they pose as if they're brave renegades or something. They're not. They are people who are dissatisfied, because they don't have access to career enhancing positions in and out of government, in the revolving door and I know that's a cynical way to put it. But a lot of this angst is cultural snobbery, but especially a career disappointment. Because whatever Donald Trump is, he's not going to forget and he's not going to bring these people back in, I don't think."

They never had a word to say about coronavirus in the context of these riots. They have no standing to say anything now. But more than that, it really is this difference between Democrats and Republicans and how they presented their convention. Joe Biden with no need to wear a mask, put a mask like a heavy Black mask on at the end of his convention and went outside and socially distanced from his - from the person he's running with. Very big different optics from the Republicans who are saying, we're going forward"

But when I watched this today, he was grasping for words. He was reading a script through these two interviews with Andrea Mitchell and Anderson Cooper. And then that Kellyanne Conway quote, he bumbled it and bungled it two different times. Read it differently in both places. This is not a way to counter what we saw tonight fireworks and patriotism and heart and every life matters. And you had firemen and first responders here. This was an all American pageant and extravaganza wrapped up in the America First message. What Trump did tonight, I thought - someone said, \"Oh, the speech went on too long. Oh, he was - he wasn't himself.\" He was - No, I saw - and you and I watched him very closely. We were right up front. He was in command. He took the stage.

And I think when you look at the fireworks, when you look at what preceded it, the focus on life, on faith, on our future and our history, all of that. I think people - Americans, when they go to vote, they look at a campaign and they look at a candidate like a mosaic. It's filled in bit by bit over time. This was a summation of that mosaic. And a great closing argument for Donald Trump going into this final stretch."

They know he has to have a press conference that's unscripted, but they know that if he does, it's disastrous. They know that when he comes out like he did today, that they'd be better off even with Kamala Harris taking over the reins and doing the heavy work, but if they do that, it's going to backfire on them. So he should have never been a candidate to be - candidate, because he was not all there and he knew that, and people had told him that. And once you do something you know is not feasible, and once you make a devil's bargain with Bernie Sanders, you've got these paradoxes. He knows he must condemn the violence. The polls tell him. He knows that if he does condemned violence, he's going to lose the Sanders, Antifa, BLM base, because he's made these compromises. So, whereas Donald Trump is free to say whatever you want. He's not conflicted. He's not beholden to anybody. Biden is a prisoner. He's almost a prisoner of these constituencies and his own self-created paradoxes."

So you had all of these elites that came on and talked about their particular identity or their victimization, or Michelle Obama being depressed, Hollywood, Silicon Valley, and they're all unhappy. America, they've benefited more than anybody from America, and yet they're angry. And yet the middle class has always had it rough, they're upbeat and confident. And that was a difference. And they really pull that off. And it's revealed in the polls of minority voting that a lot of African-American support for Trump is going up to 30- 40 percent. That's because they feel more authentic and they're more genuine, and they don't come on and say you did this to me when they're very wealthy. They're very middle class like everybody else."
