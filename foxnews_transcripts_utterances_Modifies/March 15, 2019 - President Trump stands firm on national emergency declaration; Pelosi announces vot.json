It's part of his kind of -- like the bigger picture which is safe at home, an appreciation of law enforcement, so you have a lot of the police there. You have -- trying to eradicate the terror threat and you have military -- the military buildup, so all these things are part of one vision. So he tends to see it as that. And other people see it as fear mongering because that kind of belief can be seen as fear mongering. You want a strong military. You want a wall. You want law enforcement -- oh, my God, you're scaring people. So, unfortunately something that he believes in can be recast as something wrong. They brought up a fact in there that I -- you know, made me think about the other half of this story, the number one leading cause of death for people under 50 -- what he said drug overdose. One of the officers said that there. So I say, what about that? You know, the fault isn't in the dealers alone. You know, the drugs keep coming because we keep using. And I think there is -- there's a refusal to admit that often the drug war doesn't make things any better. We're seeing this with the opioid mess where we're trying to reduce -- we're reducing the legal ways to get opioids and that ends up in overdoses on fentanyl, which is one of the gentlemen spoke about his son dying on fentanyl.

There's been 260,000 illegal immigrants apprehended at the border. Ninety percent -- since October, 90 percent increase from last year. ICE is giving pregnancy tests to young girls over the age of 10 because of the amount of rapes and sexual assaults that are experienced along the journey. So, of course, we have a humanitarian crisis. The question is if a national emergency the way to solve it? I don't know. But the point being is that what we're seeing right now is everyone exercising their authority under the national emergencies act. President Trump has broad authority to declare a national emergency under the act. Congress also gave themselves the authority to try to rescind that national emergency.

You see on the video the gunman drive calmly toward the mosque, playing music and talking to himself. He approaches the entrance and fires his first shots at two men. They drop to the ground. One tries to crawl away desperately. The gunman walks up behind him and fires several more shots. The man stops moving. Then the gunman moves into the main prayer room where two large groups of worshipers are already cowering in two separate corners. The shooter fires dozens of rounds into each group. One man appears to run at the gunman but is shot at point blank range. The shooter then turns his attention to the groups again firing even more shots. He reloads several times, walks back into the hallway and then back into the main room. Many of the men there are already dead. Some appear to be wounded. The gunman walks slowly toward them taking kill shots finishing off his victims with bullets to the head or body. By our count, the gunman fires around 187 rounds within just the first two and a half minutes of the attack. Once he leaves the mosque, he shoots several people on the street. Including a woman wearing traditional Muslim dress. She's wounded. She lies on the street crying out for help. The gunman walks up to her and once again delivers the final shots directly to the woman's head. He then gets back in his car. He drives over that woman's body and continues to shoot other people from his vehicle.  There is no sign at that point of any police officers. The video stops after about 16 gut-wrenching minutes and by our count, 236 shots fired. Now the gunman also left online a manifesto of sorts. It's long, it's rambling in places, precise in others. The gunman makes his motivation very clear, intimidating, repelling, and killing what he repeatedly calls Muslim invaders. He says mass immigration is a threat to civilization. And at one point he poses a question to himself are you a supporter of President Trump? His answer, quote, as a symbol of renewed white entity and common purpose, sure, as a policy maker and leader, dear God, no. The gunman who was taken into custody alive also said in his manifesto that he hopes to go to trial where he will plead not guilty because in his view he was taking action against what he calls an occupying force. Leaders around the world, including President Trump have refuted that idea saying it was an act of pure hate, pure evil. I used to live in Christchurch for a time after 9/11, Dagen. I can tell you it is a beautiful and peaceful place. It is like a snapshot from the 1950's, immune, somehow, to the problems of the modern world. Well, it is around 10 AM Saturday in Christchurch right now and everybody there and across New Zealand is literally and figuratively waking up to a whole new reality. Dagen.",

So people can use technology however they want, and you have to catch up with the fact afterwards. And that's the unfortunate situation. Now, I don't understand how the media can lie about this guy's manifesto. I read it. The manifesto, if you read it, does not attribute this guy's philosophy to Donald Trump. This is a direct quote, the nation with the closest political and social values to my own is the People's Republic of China. This guy was an eco-nationalist. Meaning, he was a racist and thought that the immigrant population of the earth was too fertile and they were overpopulating everything and were causing climate change and they needed to be eradicated. He said he's not a conservative. He's not a Nazi. And like Greg said, he was celebrating these wacko European mass shooters more than anything. So for the media to link Donald Trump and frame Donald Trump for some lunatic's actions halfway around the world is so irresponsible and it's exactly what the guy wanted. If you read the manifesto the guy wanted division in his country. He wanted the left to overreact and take away guns from Republicans, and wanted to balkanize North America because that would create more racial purity in his opinion. So, we were very responsible when the Bernie bro shot up Steve Scalise's baseball game. We didn't attribute that to Bernie. We didn't attribute that to the left-wing media. We've said everyone is individually responsible for themselves. But the media doesn't do that when it's on the other side. They only frame Republicans.",

I really struggle in the fact that -- I think there's a responsibility to deny these killers what they want. And this guy wants to live in infamy. Clearly, he wrote a manifesto because he wanted it out. And I'm all about denying that by not giving the manifesto any time and not giving him what he wants. And to Greg's point about the copy cats, I spent all day today looking at statistics and studies about it and it's real and it's scary. Dr. Steven Pitt who's a psychiatric -- did psychiatric autopsy of the Columbine shooting, he said that the shooters predicted with chilling and stunning accuracy how their actions would encourage other similarly disaffected individuals for doing the same thing. You'll get things like the Aurora, Colorado movie theater shooting. During the trial there were two similar shootings in movie theaters in two weeks after that. ABC in 2014 did an investigation found that 17 school shooters and 36 others that tried were all partially inspired by Columbine. The Newtown shooter had clippings, as you've said, of previous mass murders that took place. So, clearly, these guys want infamy and we should deny it to them. And sometimes we give it to them. The Rolling Stone did that cover of the Boston bomber, put them on the cover. Remember after the Virginia Tech shooting, images of the guys with the gun. Let's deny them what they want.

Because I feel like -- that's every day we're always talking about the wall. It's part of his kind of -- like the bigger picture which is safe at home, an appreciation of law enforcement, so you have a lot of the police there. You have -- trying to eradicate the terror threat and you have military -- the military buildup, so all these things are part of one vision. So he tends to see it as that. And other people see it as fear mongering because that kind of belief can be seen as fear mongering. You want a strong military. You want a wall. You want law enforcement -- oh, my God, you're scaring people. So, unfortunately something that he believes in can be recast as something wrong. They brought up a fact in there that I -- you know, made me think about the other half of this story, the number one leading cause of death for people under 50 -- what he said drug overdose. One of the officers said that there. So I say, what about that? You know, the fault isn't in the dealers alone. You know, the drugs keep coming because we keep using. And I think there is -- there's a refusal to admit that often the drug war doesn't make things any better. We're seeing this with the opioid mess where we're trying to reduce -- we're reducing the legal ways to get opioids and that ends up in overdoses on fentanyl, which is one of the gentlemen spoke about his son dying on fentanyl. So we still haven't addressed maybe the underpinnings of this story which is our desire for oblivion."

There's been 260,000 illegal immigrants apprehended at the border. Ninety percent -- since October, 90 percent increase from last year. ICE is giving pregnancy tests to young girls over the age of 10 because of the amount of rapes and sexual assaults that are experienced along the journey. So, of course, we have a humanitarian crisis. The question is if a national emergency the way to solve it? I don't know. But the point being is that what we're seeing right now is everyone exercising their authority under the national emergencies act. President Trump has broad authority to declare a national emergency under the act. Congress also gave themselves the authority to try to rescind that national emergency. President Trump has the authority to then veto, and then Congress can try to find the votes, two thirds in the House and Senate to override it.

      "speaker": "JONATHAN HUNT, CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Dagen, the live streamed video of this attack is horrific to watch. We will not show it but we have watched it for the sake of accurately reporting what happened. You see on the video the gunman drive calmly toward the mosque, playing music and talking to himself. He approaches the entrance and fires his first shots at two men. They drop to the ground. One tries to crawl away desperately. The gunman walks up behind him and fires several more shots. The man stops moving. Then the gunman moves into the main prayer room where two large groups of worshipers are already cowering in two separate corners. The shooter fires dozens of rounds into each group. One man appears to run at the gunman but is shot at point blank range. The shooter then turns his attention to the groups again firing even more shots. He reloads several times, walks back into the hallway and then back into the main room. Many of the men there are already dead. Some appear to be wounded. The gunman walks slowly toward them taking kill shots finishing off his victims with bullets to the head or body. By our count, the gunman fires around 187 rounds within just the first two and a half minutes of the attack. Once he leaves the mosque, he shoots several people on the street. Including a woman wearing traditional Muslim dress. She's wounded. She lies on the street crying out for help. The gunman walks up to her and once again delivers the final shots directly to the woman's head. He then gets back in his car. He drives over that woman's body and continues to shoot other people from his vehicle. There is no sign at that point of any police officers. The video stops after about 16 gut-wrenching minutes and by our count, 236 shots fired. Now the gunman also left online a manifesto of sorts. It's long, it's rambling in places, precise in others. The gunman makes his motivation very clear, intimidating, repelling, and killing what he repeatedly calls Muslim invaders. He says mass immigration is a threat to civilization. And at one point he poses a question to himself are you a supporter of President Trump? His answer, quote, as a symbol of renewed white entity and common purpose, sure, as a policy maker and leader, dear God, no. The gunman who was taken into custody alive also said in his manifesto that he hopes to go to trial where he will plead not guilty because in his view he was taking action against what he calls an occupying force. Leaders around the world, including President Trump have refuted that idea saying it was an act of pure hate, pure evil. I used to live in Christchurch for a time after 9/11, Dagen. I can tell you it is a beautiful and peaceful place. It is like a snapshot from the 1950's, immune, somehow, to the problems of the modern world. Well, it is around 10 AM Saturday in Christchurch right now and everybody there and across New Zealand is literally and figuratively waking up to a whole new reality. Dagen."

So if you're spreading yourself that thin chasing that stuff, it's like having the FBI go after gum chewing on the subway. You're not going to get the real crime. They're trying to figure this out. I've said this a couple of days ago, technology is ahead of humanity. We aren't catching up to it so we have this vulnerability. The biggest issue -- we talk about this after every shooting is the copycat effect. That's why we never mention the guy's name. That's why we try not to cover it, blanket coverage, because blanket coverage enlarges the spotlight which is what they want. Each shooter cites previous shooters. That is a fact. Each one inspires the next. My worry is that because he filmed it he gave it a wider -- wider reach for more people to see, expanding his footprint and it is our -- I wound not just go after social media, it is our responsibility in the media to shrink that footprint to as small as possible."

Facebook says that it has 15,000 contractors and employees reviewing content as part of a 30,000 person team working on it. But I can say this, since they launched livestreaming there have been murders. There have been suicides. In fact, there was a man in Thailand who killed his 11-month-old daughter in a live video and that was two years ago, and we still have this going on."

      "utterance": "Well, I don't know what anybody can do about that because we live in a free society. So people can use technology however they want, and you have to catch up with the fact afterwards. And that's the unfortunate situation. Now, I don't understand how the media can lie about this guy's manifesto. I read it. The manifesto, if you read it, does not attribute this guy's philosophy to Donald Trump. This is a direct quote, the nation with the closest political and social values to my own is the People's Republic of China. This guy was an eco-nationalist. Meaning, he was a racist and thought that the immigrant population of the earth was too fertile and they were overpopulating everything and were causing climate change and they needed to be eradicated. He said he's not a conservative. He's not a Nazi. And like Greg said, he was celebrating these wacko European mass shooters more than anything. So for the media to link Donald Trump and frame Donald Trump for some lunatic's actions halfway around the world is so irresponsible and it's exactly what the guy wanted. If you read the manifesto the guy wanted division in his country. He wanted the left to overreact and take away guns from Republicans, and wanted to balkanize North America because that would create more racial purity in his opinion. So, we were very responsible when the Bernie bro shot up Steve Scalise's baseball game. We didn't attribute that to Bernie. We didn't attribute that to the left-wing media. We've said everyone is individually responsible for themselves. But the media doesn't do that when it's on the other side. They only frame Republicans."

It's absolutely despicable and disgusting. We obviously pray for the victims and their families as well. I'm with Greg. I really struggle in the fact that -- I think there's a responsibility to deny these killers what they want. And this guy wants to live in infamy. Clearly, he wrote a manifesto because he wanted it out. And I'm all about denying that by not giving the manifesto any time and not giving him what he wants. And to Greg's point about the copy cats, I spent all day today looking at statistics and studies about it and it's real and it's scary. Dr. Steven Pitt who's a psychiatric -- did psychiatric autopsy of the Columbine shooting, he said that the shooters predicted with chilling and stunning accuracy how their actions would encourage other similarly disaffected individuals for doing the same thing. You'll get things like the Aurora, Colorado movie theater shooting. During the trial there were two similar shootings in movie theaters in two weeks after that. ABC in 2014 did an investigation found that 17 school shooters and 36 others that tried were all partially inspired by Columbine. The Newtown shooter had clippings, as you've said, of previous mass murders that took place. So, clearly, these guys want infamy and we should deny it to them. And sometimes we give it to them. The Rolling Stone did that cover of the Boston bomber, put them on the cover. Remember after the Virginia Tech shooting, images of the guys with the gun. Let's deny them what they want. Don't give them the infamy."

It just keeps running and, of course, it spreads and it spreads to a specific niche population that's interested, you know, kind of the gamers and a little bit of a hate people all combined here for young men. I think it's very troubling. I just want to say, I think, imagine if a Muslim had committed such an act, I can imagine that there are a lot of people who would have gone bananas on the Muslim community here in the United States and around the world. But what I think is the reality is, we have white nationalists anger spreading globally, his manifesto was called the great replacement and they're talking about, you know, just like we saw in Charlottesville, you will not replace us.

      "utterance": "Well, I think -- around town the big cliche was Abe Lincoln he only had one term as the Congressman before he became President. But, I think clearly, the voters in El Paso liked him. And I think if you wanted to look at the actual record he was pretty good, not only on environment, but on military spending. Today, though, I must say the guns out for Robert Francis or that's what White House likes to call him or Beto, The Washington Post had a front page story about how Republican donors had been key to the start of his camp -- of his career as a politician. And he had backed spending for some malls that pushed people out of low-income neighborhoods. And then you also have to keep in mind that he, and I think this is really important, Lisa, sometimes I think the Right can't hear this, but he did lose to Ted Cruz. But for the people for people on the Left the idea that in Texas he challenged Ted Cruz and raised a record amount of money like $80 million, I think, really makes him a superstar."

      "speaker": "BOOTHE",
      "utterance": "Well, you're right, he did raise a record amount of money, Jesse, but part of that was because he was running against Ted Cruz, someone that the media hates, that the left hates, so they really protected him, and his record really wasn't examined. Now that's going to be a little bit different, Jesse. I was talking yesterday about the fact that he supports the Green New Deal allegedly, but took more money from the fossil fuel industry than anyone else besides Ted Cruz. So this stuff is going to surface and do you think it's going to end up having an impact on him?"

Like you said, if he doesn't have a demon as the Left sees Ted Cruz as, maybe they're not going to put money in his pockets, but we'll see. I think Chris Matthews has another throw up of his leg. It's clear he's the media darling right now and there's already Beto backlash. POLITICO says no woman got that kind of coverage and they don't like how this white male who has this privilege is being romanticized in the media. He's got the Vanity Fair cover. They had all the reporters down there in El Paso for the counter Trump rally, and he's only been to Iowa once. And when he got up on that table in the coffee shop there were more media reporters than there were voters. So we'll see about him. The weirder he gets, I kind of like him, to be honest with you. He was in a hacking group. He wrote some crazy stuff about murder. I don't know, he's kind of unpredictable, and that's kind of interesting and he's more fun to cover than some of the other candidates."

It is this kind of delusional moralizing from the people at Google. There motto used to be \"Don't be Evil\", well they got rid of that clearly if they're doing business with the Chinese, and the delusional moralizing that really hurts America.

What they're doing, Juan, is they're putting profits above patriotism. And you have to ask yourself, is Google an American company anymore? Or do they -- are they just this amorphous multinational conglomerate that just does whatever they want to whoever they want in search for the highest bidder? $21 billion in revenue over there in Asia, that's a pretty penny. And like you said in the beginning, if you invest Google in China, in a commercial enterprise, they just transfer that right to the state-owned corporations.

Both the RNC and the DNC have massive databases of consumer information for voters across the country. Every politician that was sitting on those Committees pointing the fingers, has Mark Zuckerberg has used consumer data in way to target voters, it's all such a sham. Not only that, there's literally no privacy anymore. You look at location services, it's a $21 billion industry in 2018, people following, you what you're doing via apps to reach you via advertising and things of that nature.

Because once every -- once you're using, they're just mining you, so you become the product. #2, their employees were -- a few of their employees were upset, because they were helping with the drone -- making the drone program in the Pentagon more precise. Precise drones will help eliminate mass warfare, that's what it's about. You don't have to carpet-bomb anymore if you have precise drones.

And guess what he was wearing Nikes. Yes, he's stuck with the brand. The shoemaker made a special size 15 with extra padding for the 6'7'', 285 pound college freshman. By the way NCAA tournament teams will be selected this weekend good luck to your team guys."
