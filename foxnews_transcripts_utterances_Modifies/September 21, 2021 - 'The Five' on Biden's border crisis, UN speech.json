We weren't sure what that was. And as you just mentioned, the FBI tweeting out the results coming from the Teton County Coroner. Dr. Brent Blue confirming the remains that were discovered in Wyoming on Sunday are those of Gabrielle Petito. They gave out her birthdate of March 19, 1999 in confirmation. The coroner's initial determination for the matter of death is homicide. Along with this announcement, the FBI in Denver also put out a tweet with an additional statement that I will read to you, saying the FBI's commitment to justice is at the forefront of each and every investigation said FBI De4nver Special Agent in Charge, Michael Schneider. The FBI and our partners remain dedicated to ensuring everyone, anyone responsible for or complicit in Ms. Petito's death is held accountable for their actions. And Mr. Brian Laundrie has been named a person of interest. Anyone with information concerning Mr. Laundrie's role in this matter or his current whereabouts should contact the FBI. Important to note, he is still being considered a person of interest even at this point. I just spoke to the family attorney in New York representing all the parents involved here for Gabrielle Petito. And they said that they could confirm that the family knows that the identification has been made. They told us earlier today that once Gabby is brought home, that is when the family will issue a statement in person. We are expecting a press conference at some point from them when she is returned home. Greg?",

I'm kind of inclined to think there was something that was, you know, very physical because they were physical. But my biggest concern is something that I said last week. And that is that the cops in Utah did not make an arrest. And the dispatcher said that there was a caller saying that he was hitting her. In addition to that, we got another witness who says he was hitting her. And I pulled up the Utah statute, which is like most statutes across the country. I know this because I've been doing domestic violence prosecutions since 1978. OK? There is something called mandatory arrest. The cops are mandated to determine who the primary aggressor is.

Basically, you think of how many countries are there thinking how mad they are that he would not listen to their pleas to extend the deadlines so that they could get their people out. Well, one person has resigned. And it was the Dutch foreign minister. Because the parliament said that things were mishandled. So, she resigned today.

So, all of these perks go to government agencies, not to small businesses, and people are really starting to notice. This was -- we knew that this was going to happen. We predicted it.",

Chris Cuomo, you Mickey April, all of these other bozos who pretend to be journalists then pretend to have a story. Do you that if a Democrat and the media had cared enough about this crisis from the time that we started covering it months ago and then weeks ago with this, this actual story would not exist. It wouldn't be necessary for guys to be on horses to help control the crowd. So, they're pull -- when I say they're pulling a Covington, I mean this.

We weren't sure what that was. And as you just mentioned, the FBI tweeting out the results coming from the Teton County Coroner. Dr. Brent Blue confirming the remains that were discovered in Wyoming on Sunday are those of Gabrielle Petito. They gave out her birthdate of March 19, 1999 in confirmation. The coroner's initial determination for the matter of death is homicide. Along with this announcement, the FBI in Denver also put out a tweet with an additional statement that I will read to you, saying the FBI's commitment to justice is at the forefront of each and every investigation said FBI De4nver Special Agent in Charge, Michael Schneider. The FBI and our partners remain dedicated to ensuring everyone, anyone responsible for or complicit in Ms. Petito's death is held accountable for their actions. And Mr. Brian Laundrie has been named a person of interest. Anyone with information concerning Mr. Laundrie's role in this matter or his current whereabouts should contact the FBI. Important to note, he is still being considered a person of interest even at this point. I just spoke to the family attorney in New York representing all the parents involved here for Gabrielle Petito. And they said that they could confirm that the family knows that the identification has been made. They told us earlier today that once Gabby is brought home, that is when the family will issue a statement in person. We are expecting a press conference at some point from them when she is returned home. Greg?"

And I think the police are not under a, you know, any kind of requirement that they call him a suspect now. Here's the issue in this case. If the manner of death is a homicide, we don't know the cause of death. Was she hit with blunt force trauma, was there a strangulation? I'm kind of inclined to think there was something that was, you know, very physical because they were physical. But my biggest concern is something that I said last week. And that is that the cops in Utah did not make an arrest. And the dispatcher said that there was a caller saying that he was hitting her. In addition to that, we got another witness who says he was hitting her. And I pulled up the Utah statute, which is like most statutes across the country. I know this because I've been doing domestic violence prosecutions since 1978. OK? There is something called mandatory arrest. The cops are mandated to determine who the primary aggressor is. Not the last person to hit but who is the primary aggressor."

He wasn't letting her in the car. She was chasing the car. He had her phone. He wouldn't give her the phone. We're talking jealousy, control. All the indicia of domestic violence. And they tell them to separate and they talk about mental health? No, this is domestic violence. You make an arrest. You decide who is the aggressor. And under Utah law you arrest one of them.

They can, you know, make it seem, you know, I don't know what happened to her. My goodness, what happen. The man always did it. I mean, that's my presumption, my working presumption is the guy did it, start your investigation right there. The other thing is, social media is a lie.

If you look at Afghanistan, you look at that drone strike, the border. You see a severely deflated presidency and in record time. Joe Biden is the chief air mattress of presidents. You fill it up.

There's never a lot of clapping or things like that. So, it's kind of hard to read the room. But I also notice that there's just -- in a speech like this, I think, especially for the first one a president gives at the United Nations, you're looking for some sort of rhetorical lift. A little bit of grace, a little bit of something. And that doesn't usually happen in his speeches. The other thing I would point out is this. He's vaguely talking about Afghanistan. Basically, you think of how many countries are there thinking how mad they are that he would not listen to their pleas to extend the deadlines so that they could get their people out. Well, one person has resigned. And it was the Dutch foreign minister. Because the parliament said that things were mishandled. So, she resigned today. So, she -- she's the one -- she's the only one who resigned when it wasn't her fault initially that all of these things were happening in Afghanistan and they couldn't get their people out in time."

One of the things that's terrible for small businesses is that they already have a situation where they can't find workers. And you have the jobs -- the Job Creators Network has this huge lawsuit against the administration about the mandate, but they're talking about small businesses. And it's not because they're against mandates -- against vaccines. It's the fact that it's so hard for small businesses to find workers already. Can you imagine if you're a young woman and you're thinking of getting your start in New York City, and you're going to take a job as a hostess, is this worth it? Because they're the ones that are on the front line. That's the first person that you see when you walk into the restaurant. It's not a security guard. And one of the things you have with the government is all these government agencies have worked around so that they don't have to necessarily get the vaccine.
