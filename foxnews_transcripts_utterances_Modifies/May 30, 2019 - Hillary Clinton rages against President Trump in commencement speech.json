But based on that statement it seems like there was an agreement very early on that they were on the same page when it came to what the Justice Department regulations said you could do in terms of indicting a sitting president. But on that note, going back to the media, it's like have they not learned their lesson about how they handled these kinds of stories? I mean, they're going to get President Trump reelected.   There's a huge risk for Democrats here, not only in losing the House for Nancy Pelosi, but also the political blow back.

But based on that statement it seems like there was an agreement very early on that they were on the same page when it came to what the Justice Department regulations said you could do in terms of indicting a sitting president. But on that note, going back to the media, it's like have they not learned their lesson about how they handled these kinds of stories? I mean, they're going to get President Trump reelected. There's a huge risk for Democrats here, not only in losing the House for Nancy Pelosi, but also the political blow back. If they're going to push this so hard in the primary and just drop it off in the general election, it shows that they're not willing to do what they actually said they were going to do, which is the politician speak that everybody is trying to get away from."

Now he comes out and he says, that Mueller, so prejudice, so much a witch hunt, he hates me, he had a bad business deal with me. You can't trust that guy. He's got all the Hillary Clinton --. You say, wait a second, you a minute ago were citing this man's work, now you're condemning this man. I think you've got a problem, Mr. President. I think you are being contradictory, hypocritical, and it's just like you go off and you attack everybody. And you know, you said something a moment ago, you said, oh, no evidence of any kind of conspiracy. That's not what Mueller said. Mueller said insufficient. And I think this comes back to the fact that so many people were misled by Bob Barr. But even more than that, I noticed today, the reaction from conservative suggests to me that they never read the Mueller report because if they had, they would have known everything that Mueller said yesterday.

You don't want to take away from the atmosphere of the game either. So if they fence everything in, it kind of takes away from being at the game and feeling like you can be and in it rather than just watching it on television. And the netting, you know, is a good idea, but it's also prevents you from really engaging with the players. So it is balanced, but obviously when something like that happens it's horrible and awful and people have been killed as a result of these things before. So you kind of have to balance out the risk. But I think when you're talking to parents whose kids get hit with a foul ball, there's not really a lot of room in the middle for negotiation."

So they should just give this family free tickets for life. That's the only way to solve it. I don't know what you can do about these things, freak accidents happen in life. I'm a freak accident, people have to accept me. There's nothing you can do about it. Other sports there's risk too, golf, someone slices one half of the tee you get hit in the shoulder, I've seen that thousands of times. Or about boxing, sometimes stuff spill out of the ring and there's a melee and someone gets a chair through the mouth. It happens a lot, and that's part of what happens when you go to a live sporting event. Baseball it does happen more than other sports, though. But they've already extended the netting, almost every single team has done that. Perhaps you can extend it more, and I'm willing to have that debate. But you can't have some sort of missile defense system where they can knock out a fly ball or a foul ball the minute it hits the bat. You just have to live with these things.

So if you use it bad way, it's a tool, it is bad. If you use it in a good way, it can be beneficial. I think the reason why they're saying that it substantially undermines your intelligence is because it requires a knee-jerk reaction to information, so you're not really diving in and thinking about the consequences of what you're responding to, it's emotional. People are saying things that they wouldn't say to you in person, they'll say it online. So, I think, just like anything else, it's a tool, can be used for good or bad."

You're having quick emotional reactions, as Jesse said. And to me, a lot of this has to do with people who are distracted or lonely. And so you're just looking at Twitter, it's just something like to eat up your time to make you feel connected. And this is the primary illusion of social media in our age. I think that it makes you feel like you're really connected to what's going on, what's happening. In fact, you are more disconnected from what's going on. You're not engaged with real people. You're not engaged with real ideas, the challenge the way you think and what you're saying. You get locked into your bubble - maybe even more than a bubble, it's like a jail cell, because you're - on Twitter you're following people who oftentimes are of like mine.

All the energy once reserved for violence gets detoured into arguments, it's ugly but necessary. But decades ago our reliance on politics got out of hand, when the Left announced that the political was now personal and vice versa. Now politics rears its ugly face at football games and superhero movies and award shows and we're sick of it, which is why “The Five” teamed up with country music star John Rich to write a song with one piece of advice \"Shut Up About Politics\", because politics is only great if you keep it in its box, separate from all the other fun stuff in life. Politics is great in “The Five,” but not at the baseball game, so \"Shut Up About Politics\".

And by the way if you don't know, Rotary is the second largest service club in the world. They help in DC to feed the homeless, host events for wounded veterans at Walter Reed, dictionaries to schools and support the Boys and Girls Clubs. That's me with the President Lisa McCurdy and Donnie Shaw, a Rotary remember who's also leader of the Metropolitan Washington YMCA. And here I am with two of the honorees from yesterday's event. Elias Bahanda Past President of Rotary in Uganda and Marilyn Mamua from rotary Tanzania. Here I am with Marilyn Cruz who heads a program to assist immigrants in DC. Lynn Holec who's the incoming President is also in that picture. Rotary inspiring example of local civic activism. Go Rotary!"

      "utterance": "Did you know that travelers left behind a million dollars in loose change at airport security checkpoints last year that includes $72,000 alone at New York's JFK, LAX had $71,000 in coins and Miami more than $50,000. So you're probably asking, well - right where is this money going? It typically goes to critical aviation security programs which pays for checkpoint maintenance, translation of checkpoint fine."
