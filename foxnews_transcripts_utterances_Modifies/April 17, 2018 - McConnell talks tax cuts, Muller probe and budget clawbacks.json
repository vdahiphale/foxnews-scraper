They want to take this to the American people. And we're happy to do that, to see whether the American people think it`s a good idea for us to let them keep more of their hard-earned money, rather than sending it to us to be spent on whatever we choose to spend it on.  I think it really kind of sums up the major differences between the parties these days, Neil. I got a letter from all but three of them before we passed the tax bill saying what kind of tax reform they would be willing to support. And it was all about class envy and wealth transfer. It had nothing to do with actually getting the economy growing.  And, in the end, of course, even the three who didn't sign the letter didn't vote for it. So, there's a clear line of demarcation.",

They want to take this to the American people. And we're happy to do that, to see whether the American people think it`s a good idea for us to let them keep more of their hard-earned money, rather than sending it to us to be spent on whatever we choose to spend it on. I think it really kind of sums up the major differences between the parties these days, Neil. I got a letter from all but three of them before we passed the tax bill saying what kind of tax reform they would be willing to support. And it was all about class envy and wealth transfer. It had nothing to do with actually getting the economy growing. And, in the end, of course, even the three who didn't sign the letter didn't vote for it. So, there's a clear line of demarcation."

Now, of course, you have more parliamentary mechanisms and problems as a result. The president said it, you have got to end the filibuster, so that it's a simple majority vote on a host of things. In fact, you have got to do it fast, because you never know how long that majority will last. You have resisted. Still?"

So, whether it was confirming Neil Gorsuch or lowering taxes or repealing regulations, every one of those things, we did with a simple majority. The Senate has a lot more responsibility than the House. We're in the personnel business. There are 1,200 executive branch appointments that come to the Senate for confirmation. So, a lot of our time is used confirming nominees to the SEC, to the NLRB, to the Food and Drug Administration, to the Supreme Court, to the circuit courts. It takes longer to do things in the Senate because we have vast personnel responsibility that our colleagues in the House simply do not have."

We think we have an opportunity, a good opportunity, to hold this majority, maybe even expand it. And so I`m going to worry about and concentrate on what I can have an impact on. And that is holding the Senate, because, with a full four years of the Trump administration, if we still have the Senate, we can still confirm judges. We can still put his appointments in place.

The Justice Department has a whole different line of inquiry that we're not involved in.
