It's because for $20 an hour it's not worth ruining his life the moment he becomes the suspect, the moment the media says this poor man was just getting bread to feed his family.

They are armed to the teeth because the state permits a lawlessness that no one else can survive. Lastly, I just want to make the point that like, while we're talking about this, President Biden is approving this huge plan to tackle domestic terror. So, this is happening. This is actually happening in America, but he's interested in this domestic terror and I'm trying to figure out like, I know the names of MS-13. I know Al Qaeda. I know ISIS.

So people are like, oh, that's great. These corporations are rich. I'm going to take their stuff and then I'm going to sell it and make money. And that means that the system is sort of upside down.

Brazen crimes caught on camera show exactly why American cities are under siege. Check out what happened at a Walgreens in San Francisco. This is a man in broad daylight looting a store and just filling up a garbage bag. Then he just casually rides his bike out of the store and onto the street. Walgreens alone has closed 17 stores in the city just because of this rampant theft. And other companies are following suit. And there are some shocking videos of a drive-by shooting in Atlanta's wealthy Buckhead neighborhood. People are running for their lives, but cops that aren't allowed to do anything about it. That's thanks to rules that limit police from chasing suspects. Residents in that neighborhood are fed up and they want their own police force. BILL WHITE, BUCKHEAD CITY COMMITTEE CEO & CHAIRMAN: We are living in a war zone. That's how we described living in Buckhead and what has happened here in the last several years is an incredibly dangerous spike in crime and a complete vacuum of leadership. The police in Atlanta are great policemen and women, we love them. They just want to do their job and they are not being allowed to do that."

      "utterance": "No, because what happens if you catch him? What happens if you catch him and that goes awry and then you have the media there and you have a hoard of people holding their phones and going like this? It's not worth it. Why did you think the security guard in that video in Walgreens barely stuck his hand out to grab the bag? It's because for $20 an hour it's not worth ruining his life the moment he becomes the suspect, the moment the media says this poor man was just getting bread to feed his family. He filled the garbage bag with loaves of bread and milk and then the security guard tackles him. So you can't -- there is no interest in doing your job. This is part of the trickle-downing of -- trickle downing?"

So if the police aren't there, whoever takes their place will also be vilified, whether it is the private citizen or the security guard, anybody interested in that. We were talking about this a while ago. It's called the Brazilification, where the people who can afford it go back into their gated communities, hire private securities. They are armed to the teeth because the state permits a lawlessness that no one else can survive. Lastly, I just want to make the point that like, while we're talking about this, President Biden is approving this huge plan to tackle domestic terror. So, this is happening. This is actually happening in America, but he's interested in this domestic terror and I'm trying to figure out like, I know the names of MS-13. I know Al Qaeda. I know ISIS. Who are these giant gangs that he's talking about that's doing this crime? Like why aren't we asking that question? Someone has got to talk to Jill."

One of the things the police or the city councils have decided is that, don't have the police chase the suspect because if you then end up injuring an innocent person in the chase that ends up causing even more problems and that you can try to catch the criminal later.

I think it's this idea of redistribution that has taken hold and so people hear that on loop and they hear that sort of reinforced all day long. And it's not just progressives anymore. They have mainstream Democrats that are talking about different ways of redistributing, you know, patriot tax, and we're going to take your wealth and we're going to give it out justly. So people are like, oh, that's great. These corporations are rich. I'm going to take their stuff and then I'm going to sell it and make money. And that means that the system is sort of upside down. It's one of the reasons that I despise Marxism because it hates the idea of private property and it feels that theft is justified.

It can't just be the cops doing it by themselves. It's like what -- because here's the problem, the problem is this policy that we have, right, of whether you call it anti-police policy or whatever, was created because those people who had problems with how the cops are doing business. So maybe it's bringing in community, bringing in lawmakers or bringing in police and saying how do we find some middle ground? There's calls that we shouldn't be at. Cops will tell you we don't want to be at domestic violence calls. We don't want to be at drug abuse calls because that's not what we're trained to do. So let's hire --"

Is that when it comes to these high stakes, one-on-one summits, a lot of this is personal relationship and you can insult the country, insult the leader, that makes things tough. So it looks like Joe Biden has a little bit of what I call impostor syndrome. I know it because I have it. It's kind of an insecure feeling that you're not worthy of the job you have. I see Joe Biden kind of grappling with the fact that, wait a second, I'm the leader of the free world here and two months ago I called this guy a killer and I'm on the eve of the big diplomatic meeting. Maybe I should soften his up after I have to sit down with him for four hours. It's all like it's happening in real time. He seems uncomfortable on the world stage. What I think the American people care about is not some dissident that no one can pronounce his name disappeared or something like that, I get that that's important from a human rights perspective."

I think that the one lesson is we're such a lucky country that we can endure and even survive not because of our leadership, but in spite of our leadership because we put people in this job that clearly, he's not up to it. You know, Biden can bumble through this thing with these long, frightening pauses and we have to sit there quietly and go, holy hell, what's going on? That pause, it went on forever. And meanwhile, god forbid, Trump held his glass of water with two hands or shuffled down a ramp, that slippery, and everybody went ballistic.

I think we live in a culture now where you make a setback, and it was like, yes, that's it, you can't come back, don't even think about it, you're now on the canceled list.
