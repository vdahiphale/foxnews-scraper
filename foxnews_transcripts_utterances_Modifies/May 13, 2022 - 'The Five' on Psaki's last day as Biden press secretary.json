Almost 80 percent say the country is headed in the wrong direction. Biden who promised to be the adult in the room and to always have a plan is once again caught off guard by a crisis he should've seen coming. American families can't get baby formula, but there are pallets of it for migrants at our southern border. Over 50 percent of supplies are out in some states and if you are concerned parent Joe Biden says don't worry. He's making a government web site to help you find baby formula.",

She just can't get it. Now here is a problem with Biden, there is food at the border, OK. And they say don't bully border patrol, don't put those pictures in your lying eyes. Don't leave a congresswoman and don't believe Governor Greg Abbott but you better believe Joe Biden. Well, I don't believe Joe Biden and the people in Washington and it gets better, you know why?

Listen, when you -- when you have, you know, a couple of weeks to a couple of months maternity leave many women do turn to formula, I did, because they can't breastfeed for the duration that they should, which is the best for the child. And I know everybody can't breastfeed, I adopted the child, I used lactation pills, those didn't work, I get it. But a lot of women especially women, you know, in the workforce, especially lower income women, they have to have formula because they can't stay home because we don't have maternity leave six months to a year like countries like Germany or Australia do.

So, you know, look, crime is not where it should be, certainly. I don't think that any one political entity, a party, just the mayor, just the president, just the governor can be blamed. It's a multifaceted problem and needs multifaceted solutions. But money helps with some of those solutions.",

A little bit better than he is on immigration, but in the 30s on crime is terrible. And that's just going to set back the Democratic Party I think for a decade on crime. You're never going to trust this party again with crime. Talking about all this money going out the door, Biden is sending more money to Ukraine to fight the Russians than he's sending the police here to fight crime. That's what people care about, crime and safety in this country. And the psychological effect in 2000, this defund crap, that caused so many police retirements.

We've seen obviously everything from Dukes of Hazzard, to Paw Patrol, to the Golden Globes in some way form or another, make decisions or cancel altogether certain aspects of how they're run due to those two forces of pressure.

Two, now I'm going to get my feminist (Inaudible) I know you're going to get, Tyrus, again side for this. Listen, when you -- when you have, you know, a couple of weeks to a couple of months maternity leave many women do turn to formula, I did, because they can't breastfeed for the duration that they should, which is the best for the child. And I know everybody can't breastfeed, I adopted the child, I used lactation pills, those didn't work, I get it. But a lot of women especially women, you know, in the workforce, especially lower income women, they have to have formula because they can't stay home because we don't have maternity leave six months to a year like countries like Germany or Australia do. So, this to me is a much bigger thing when you look at monopolies, when you look at the lack of maternity leave for women and the duration that it takes to breastfeed."

You're going to make -- you're going to take the time and taxpayers dollars to make a web site to help you find formula when just about every American and illegal immigrant has a cell phone and when they type in baby formula near me, a whole bunch of choices will pop up. And they're tell you what time it's open when you can get there. And if you're really feeling ingenuous that day you can type in the specific type you're looking for. It's called the internet.

Something he never said in 2021. And now what month this is, May, how many months before the midterm? If you get a grant, you know, I know you have to say what you're going to use the money for, they come in they monitor the grants. You have to fulfill the reason they gave you the grant and if they gave you this grant money, its COVID money, who claim they were going to be using the money to pay for police?

Crime is going to go up, either they are to be blaming him and he's going to say you know what, they could use this money. Now he wants to be a champion of policing, he should be us ashamed of himself. This is money that is already being spent for other issues that the government has approved.

Barack Obama spoke about it. And Joe Biden, when he ran for president, talked about funding the police. Joe Biden has said numerous times and every time he comes out, people will say, oh, now he wants to -- he's always wanted to fund the police. And there are opportunities whether it is the $139 million to police department specifically from the DOJ or whether it's at $358 million. Look, I know -- Joe Biden said it best. You know, they're going to blame me or they're going to blame Democrats because we're the ones in power right now. Absolutely. But on a state level, governors are responsible for crime in their states. Mayors are responsible for crime in their cities. You know, how many people would have known Lori Lightfoot's name if you didn't have the crime rate in Chicago, unless she lived in Chicago where she was your mayor, right? So, you know, look, crime is not where it should be, certainly. I don't think that any one political entity, a party, just the mayor, just the president, just the governor can be blamed.

And that's what's wrong with these cities. They're run by Democrats. That peels off to Biden. Biden is in the 30s on crime. He is in the 30s on crime. A little bit better than he is on immigration, but in the 30s on crime is terrible. And that's just going to set back the Democratic Party I think for a decade on crime. You're never going to trust this party again with crime. Talking about all this money going out the door, Biden is sending more money to Ukraine to fight the Russians than he's sending the police here to fight crime. That's what people care about, crime and safety in this country. And the psychological effect in 2000, this defund crap, that caused so many police retirements. And you're seeing massive retirements at the same time you're seeing no one applying to be a police officer. And you can't have that kind of process go on at the same time of a crime wave.

He -- Mr. President, you beat the progressives. They couldn't get in the White House without you. So, our hope was that this moderate president would turn them away and do his job. He's not. And now is the point where you can hire 100,000 more policemen, it's not going to change anything. You should take those Pelotons that you gave to the House members, give them to the police department so they can be in shape because they got to catch the guy, the same guy two or three times in a week. You've got to change -- you got to change -- you got to give judges power again. Repeat offenders don't get bail reform. And it starts with an apology. You spit in the face of our law enforcement.

And it gives them this ultimatum, \"If you'd find it hard to support our content breadth, Netflix may not be the best place for you.\" I'm going to start with Emily and -- because of your legal background. I know you have a legal background too so I got to you.

So, they're taking the same position that social media platforms did when they were -- when people tried to have them be held accountable for the content, which was then saying, look, our audience is diverse, our content has a diverse breadth, and therefore love it or leave it right. But they're not saying that they agree with or subscribe to something specific within it, they're just saying, we host it. And I think what we've seen is a pressure coming from two places, one woke employees, and the other from public pressure. We've seen obviously everything from Dukes of Hazzard, to Paw Patrol, to the Golden Globes in some way form or another, make decisions or cancel altogether certain aspects of how they're run due to those two forces of pressure. But I love that Netflix is saying love it or leave it and especially because it's to those woke employees who, with the power of the keyboard, think that there's some type of actual activist when really, they're just probably Generation Z annoying, avocado toast-eating snowflakes."

Nobody wanted any more woke documentaries of how bad we are and how great some individual is, or some fake story of victimism how they survived somebody not waving to them every morning. So, it was amazing. And Netflix like wow, we're losing money and subscriptions. And then the one old white man in the back smoking a cigarette still going, well, you took out all the good movies away. Of course, they're leaving.
