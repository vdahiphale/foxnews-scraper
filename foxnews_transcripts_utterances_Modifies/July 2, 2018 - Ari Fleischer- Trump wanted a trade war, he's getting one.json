Do you remember this trade war that started over aluminum and steel? And suddenly it's grown to include everything from pork and cheese and apples and cherries and maple syrup. I'm telling you, if they throw Ring Dings into the mix, that's it, America.  But we're on top of that, the single biggest event and focus of our day, barring, of course, whatever comes of this press conference.  But, right now, ahead of Sarah Sanders, we're going to go to Deirdre Bolton, spelling out the rather jolting news when it comes to trade.",

      "sentences": "Billion-dollar businesses here, Neil. So roughly this $13 billion trade tiff is full on between the U.S. and Canada. So the Trump administration, as you referenced, put tariffs on Canadian aluminum and steel, 10 percent, 25 percent. Americans are going to be paying more as of yesterday for any product that has those two ingredients.  But here's the retaliation list. You are going to see a lot, because Canada imposed tariffs on metals, but also this slew of wide-ranging products. As of yesterday, you can see there's the metals, but also American whiskey, coffee, maple syrup, ketchup. And really the unknown here is that Canada said it targeted American goods for which there's a Canadian alternative. If you take a look at ketchup or you focus on that idea, if a Canadians' favorite ketchup is Heinz, a Canadian is going to pay 10 percent more for that product or buy a Canadian brand.  What is unclear is if sales slow for Heinz, is Heinz going to pass that along to American consumers?   Here are some of the other goods that were targeted by the Canadian government against U.S. imports, if you like, so, chocolates, plywood, dishwashers, gas stoves, motorboats. So, if any Canadian wants to buy any of these, they just have to pay more. Now, as far as the U.S. trade tiff with China, the one that we have against China comes in two ways. And the first is going to apply to more than 800 Chinese goods worth about $34 billion. That goes into effect this Friday. Second wave, close to 300 goods, another $16 billion. That still doesn't have an implementation date -- implementation date, rather, still subject to public comment.   But here is what the Chinese are putting against U.S. goods. So, again, if a Chinese consumer wants to pay more for any of these things to have American quality products, they will have to pay more. So you can see obviously by the category it's a lot of food, it's a lot of agriculture products, it's a lot of things to eat. We're going to show you a second screen as well, but it is a continuation on the theme.  And as far as what we're doing with China, Neil, the difference is that we're not really focused on any of their farm products or any consumables.   We're actually trying to limit their influence in the areas that they most want to grow, so industrial categories. The whole made in China 2025 plan, that's what we're trying to block. So it's not too many things affect U.S. consumers day to day. It's more big industries. Aerospace is a big example.",

This weekend, actually, it was reported on a draft bill the administration is working on that would allow the president to raid tariffs -- to raise tariffs at will, without congressional approval. Now, the White House isn't denying this. And in response, spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said: \"It is no secret that POTUS has had frustrations with the unfair imbalance of tariffs that put -- put the U.S. at a disadvantage. He has asked his team to develop ideas to remedy the situation and create incentives for countries to lower their tariffs. The current system gives the U.S. no leverage and other countries no incentive.\"   Now, the White House also stressed that this draft bill has not been reviewed, and there are not current plans to roll it out. But it does give us some insight into what options and strategy the president may be considering going forward -- Neil.",

They will address, no doubt, some of these trade issues.  But the market was fascinating, down about 200 points, on the belief that this was going from bad to worse, and rebounding by day's end on the idea being that maybe we can avoid all of that.  Now, again, there was also a comeback in technology issues for a separate reason. So, I want to posit that one day doesn't a trend make or an up day or a down day define this market here. But it's safe to say that it trades on the prospect of trade. The worse it looks for a deal, the worse it looks for stocks. The better it looks potentially for a deal, the better.

And I think that is in fact an negotiating tactic, and in fact it can get some -- we have gotten some -- we have made some territory with the Chinese since the threats have been made. Of course, I'm not going to say that a full-blown trade war is -- that the global economy can rub that off. That's certainly not the case. But I do think that this a negotiating tactic.

However, it's different to threaten these tariffs as it is to actually put these tariffs on, which is what has just happened.  You hope it's a negotiation tactic. But they're playing an incredibly dangerous game. This slippery slope of you digging your heels in and getting into a trade war, we now don't -- we don't have any friends. We now have Canada, Mexico and the E.U. getting together to negotiate how they're going to deal with us. We have Asia as a bloc. That is $28 trillion of GDP in Asia, 4.5 billion people, not just China, getting together about how they are going to deal with us.  We are really isolating ourselves.

So, I think what -- a lot of what you're hearing here is people that are concerned about next quarter or the quarter after that, because it's what their jobs depend on. I think the president is more concerned with the long-term disadvantage of having these massive trade deficits. And I think that's the right thing for the president to focus on. I think these CEOs are focusing on what the market tells them to focus on, which is how they're going to look this quarter and next quarter.

The president genuinely believes that, without a steel sector in this country, we don't have a national defense. And I think that's a huge concern to him. Defense issues are a big concern.

So the Trump administration, as you referenced, put tariffs on Canadian aluminum and steel, 10 percent, 25 percent. Americans are going to be paying more as of yesterday for any product that has those two ingredients. But here's the retaliation list. You are going to see a lot, because Canada imposed tariffs on metals, but also this slew of wide-ranging products. As of yesterday, you can see there's the metals, but also American whiskey, coffee, maple syrup, ketchup. And really the unknown here is that Canada said it targeted American goods for which there's a Canadian alternative. If you take a look at ketchup or you focus on that idea, if a Canadians' favorite ketchup is Heinz, a Canadian is going to pay 10 percent more for that product or buy a Canadian brand. What is unclear is if sales slow for Heinz, is Heinz going to pass that along to American consumers? Here are some of the other goods that were targeted by the Canadian government against U.S. imports, if you like, so, chocolates, plywood, dishwashers, gas stoves, motorboats. So, if any Canadian wants to buy any of these, they just have to pay more. Now, as far as the U.S. trade tiff with China, the one that we have against China comes in two ways. And the first is going to apply to more than 800 Chinese goods worth about $34 billion. That goes into effect this Friday. Second wave, close to 300 goods, another $16 billion. That still doesn't have an implementation date -- implementation date, rather, still subject to public comment. But here is what the Chinese are putting against U.S. goods. So, again, if a Chinese consumer wants to pay more for any of these things to have American quality products, they will have to pay more. So you can see obviously by the category it's a lot of food, it's a lot of agriculture products, it's a lot of things to eat. We're going to show you a second screen as well, but it is a continuation on the theme. And as far as what we're doing with China, Neil, the difference is that we're not really focused on any of their farm products or any consumables. We're actually trying to limit their influence in the areas that they most want to grow, so industrial categories. The whole made in China 2025 plan, that's what we're trying to block. So it's not too many things affect U.S. consumers day to day. It's more big industries. Aerospace is a big example."

So now with the E.U. and Canada considering additional tariffs on the U.S. in response, President Trump is again threatening to slap a 20 percent tariff on all cars coming into the U.S., which would be a massive blow to the E.U. in particular.

The current system gives the U.S. no leverage and other countries no incentive.\" Now, the White House also stressed that this draft bill has not been reviewed, and there are not current plans to roll it out.

They will address, no doubt, some of these trade issues. But the market was fascinating, down about 200 points, on the belief that this was going from bad to worse, and rebounding by day's end on the idea being that maybe we can avoid all of that. Now, again, there was also a comeback in technology issues for a separate reason. So, I want to posit that one day doesn't a trend make or an up day or a down day define this market here. But it's safe to say that it trades on the prospect of trade. The worse it looks for a deal, the worse it looks for stocks. The better it looks potentially for a deal, the better.

But I do believe that China has been -- and it's a fact -- has been clearly cheating for decades. The U.S. has been incapable of curbing the theft of intellectual property, incapable of improving the trade imbalances with regard to unfair terms of trade. And I think that is in fact an negotiating tactic, and in fact it can get some -- we have gotten some -- we have made some territory with the Chinese since the threats have been made. Of course, I'm not going to say that a full-blown trade war is -- that the global economy can rub that off. That's certainly not the case. But I do think that this a negotiating tactic.

However, it's different to threaten these tariffs as it is to actually put these tariffs on, which is what has just happened. You hope it's a negotiation tactic. But they're playing an incredibly dangerous game. This slippery slope of you digging your heels in and getting into a trade war, we now don't -- we don't have any friends. We now have Canada, Mexico and the E.U. getting together to negotiate how they're going to deal with us. We have Asia as a bloc. That is $28 trillion of GDP in Asia, 4.5 billion people, not just China, getting together about how they are going to deal with us. We are really isolating ourselves.

The GDP numbers right now that's going to come out, it's going to be huge. The reason it's going to be huge, one of the big reasons is because you're getting a lot of these goods shipped before the tariffs go. So you are going to see that come off in the following two quarters. That is not going to be a sign that the economy is doing gangbusters. It's a sign that people are scared of these tariffs.

We know this. It's been decades. Bill Clinton, this was a bipartisan issue. President Bill Clinton also complained about this decades ago. So, this is something that I think the Trump administration is trying to attack. And, hey, I'm in favor of it. I'm not in favor of tariffs at all, but I'm in favor of improved terms of trade. Free trade is fantastic. I agree with it. I'm an economist, professor of economics. I agree with it. But we have to get real. Free vs. fair trade. With regard to NAFTA, we just had just -- just for your audience to keep in mind, Sunday, we had -- yesterday, we had the elections in Mexico.

And I don't think any of us are smart enough to know how it's going to turn out. Donald Trump may be right, and maybe all those nations are going to blink at some point down the road.

What I don't know is why he didn't unite Europe with us and the rest of Asia, Japan, India, against China. They don't like the way China does business either. But by going to war, trade wars with every ally around the world, I think he gave up leverage he could have used against China by uniting everyone against China's practices.

Presidents in the past -- the Iran deal is the perfect example -- where presidents say, these are non-negotiable points. Then, when you get close to an election, they negotiate them all away. I think what our trading partners are learning, and what Kim Jong-un learned in North Korea is this -- that's not this president. When this president says this is a non-negotiable point, he means it's a non- negotiable point. And when they come to grips with that, I think they will realize that the economic reality favors a deal and then we will get people dealing. These are rationale people in most of these countries.

And when you see a quarterly problem, even though you may not believe it's long-term, you need to come -- you need to let your shareholders know that you're concerned about the problem and you need to let them know you have a long-term solution to solve that problem. So, I think what -- a lot of what you're hearing here is people that are concerned about next quarter or the quarter after that, because it's what their jobs depend on. I think the president is more concerned with the long-term disadvantage of having these massive trade deficits. And I think that's the right thing for the president to focus on. I think these CEOs are focusing on what the market tells them to focus on, which is how they're going to look this quarter and next quarter. And doing that, you end up with some short-term strategies. What the country really needs is a long-term strategy. We haven't had once since the end of World War II on trade.

So, the best way to compare various countries and regions is average tariffs. And we have about 3.5 percent in our country, which is very low. But Canada, who we have been vilifying for what they're doing with lumber and dairy, they're at 4.5 percent. yet we have painted them out to be these loathsome individuals who are trying to take advantage of us.

They need to know that, even with an election coming up and even with the political risks, he's not going to back off. And, really, the vitriol that has been flowing across the border hasn't just become -- hasn't just been coming from the United States. It's been coming from Canada as well. And they have done some things that just aren't fair, that just aren't right or rational. They're a smaller country. We allowed them to get away with it for years. And the president is saying, look, it's a time to put an end to that. Steel and aluminum are different. The president genuinely believes that, without a steel sector in this country, we don't have a national defense. And I think that's a huge concern to him. Defense issues are a big concern.

So, perhaps this has to do with that and the secretary of state's interests in seeing exactly what's going on. The president stands by that agreement and his chat with Kim Jong-un, and the talk that there's going to be another one, maybe in New York and maybe later this year.

But a lot of Americans, when they start seeing these increases in a variety of items -- and by the end of the week, it could be better than 1,000 of them -- they are going to want to know why and they are going to have to have it explained to them in a way that might make it a politically brave thing to do, but they will do it. A good many will. But others will be kind of shell-shocked. What happens?"

      "utterance": "Yes, exactly. And that's going to be Trump's real question. I think he's doing this primarily because he views himself as a man of the people, and he thinks that that is what the people want. I think the recent poll I saw is that most people, to your point, don't want these tariffs. Now, certainly, in certain industries, steel and some of the others, you know, those people will be all for it. But is the pain spread out enough, as Charles says, that people are going to be up in arms, and then he has to do a 360 on this -- or I guess at least a 180? I don't know. I think Trump is very serious about these tariffs. He feels like he's a Wal-Mart, and everybody else out there is a vendor, and he can impose his -- the U.S.' strength and might and dollar power on these countries. I think he might be right."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Well, it has not happened yet, though, right? So Charles, is it your sense that -- and I use the markets oftentimes as a proxy for this. If they rise, they're less concerned about it and they're confident we will get through this. If they tank, they're getting very worried about it. They came back from a 200-point deficit today. What are we to read into that? I don't like to go to day-by-day gyrations."

      "utterance": "It was a remarkable reversal today. It's data -- a week that is going to be interrupted by a major holiday. And a lot of folks are away. By all rights -- we were down 400 points. We already had the storyline written. Right? We come, in Mexico has got a new socialist governor -- government, rather. Canada launched their tariffs. And on Friday was a big D-Day for China and America. So, the story were written. The headlines were written. The only thing that changed was a remarkable reversal in the markets. And I got to tell you what else was interesting. Manufacturing data out today, everybody who took this survey talked about their concern of tariffs, but the manufacturing data itself blew away consensus and it points to an amazing manufacturing renaissance. So, two things existing -- co existing, reality is, we have got a juggernaut of an economy, and the other part of it is people -- there's a growing economy."

    {
      "speaker": "SMITH",
      "utterance": "Both. I would ignore the trade stuff and I would stay in the market. I'm very bullish on the market, mainly because of the foundation that Trump has built with his tax plan, the tax cuts, the corporate cuts going down. I think he's, you know, a shake-them-up kind of guy. There's one only president in history who wrote a book called \"The Art of the Deal.\" And that is Donald Trump. So, this whole tariff thing, I think, is in his wheelhouse. Generally, I'm not in favor of it. But I think he's going to get it done. I think there's so much positive out there with employment, with GDP, with new technologies coming on board, like artificial intelligence, robotics, all that stuff, I think the U.S. economy is in great shape right now."

I think the game is on. And, to Gary's point, we are the world's largest consumer. We are going to have to play tough. We're going to have to use the muscle that we have and not fold."

What does that mean as far as any relations with the United States? Apparently, he and President Trump spoke for half-an-hour today, was considered a cordial conversation. Let's get the read from Democratic Texas Congressman Henry Cuellar. Congressman, good to have you. Is it your sense that these two can maybe cobble together a NAFTA deal?"

      "speaker": "CUELLAR",
      "utterance": "Well, you're right. He did say those words about the president. But, you know, President Trump does have a way of working with somebody that comes out stronger. The current president is a little bit more diplomatic. I think Obrador is going to be a little bit more aggressive and push back if things don't go his way. But I'm hoping that both of those presidents can keep in mind that the relationship between the U.S. and Mexico is extremely important for trade, security and migration."
