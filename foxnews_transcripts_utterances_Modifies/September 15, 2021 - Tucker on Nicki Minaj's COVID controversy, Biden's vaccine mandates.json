A couple of days ago, we would guess, most people watch the show may not have heard of Nicki Minaj and then she tweeted about the COVID vaccine. She didn't come out against the vaccines, she merely said that as an adult and an American, she should decide whether or not to take the vaccine. \"Pray about it,\" she said. 'Don't be bullied.\" Things blew up from there. No praying about it, you must submit to being bullied. Those are the new rules. Nicki Minaj wasn't aware of that and she resisted and she is still resisting. It's a long and interesting story. There's implications for all of us and Trace Gallagher has agreed tonight to frame it for us, to set it up and tell us what's going on, and here he is. Hey, Trace.",

His friend was weeks away from getting married, now the girl called off the wedding, so just pray on it and make sure you're comfortable with your decision, not bullied.\" Well, Tucker then talked about that tweet last night and today Nicki Minaj retweeted this clip.

      "sentences": "Trace Gallagher, thanks so much. So here's the point that she is making, probably a lot of things Nicki Minaj says that you may not agree with, you may not like her music, but the two points she is making are worth reiterating. You can't allow people to force you to take drugs that you don't want or that you don't need. It's up to you what drugs you take. Period. And if you allow people to force you to take drugs you don't want, you're done. They own you. You're no longer free. Period. And the second point that she has made quite a bit today is that you have a constitutional right, a moral right, a God-given right to ask simple questions and expect answers. Like you're an adult speaking to a fellow adult, and if you forfeit that right, you are no longer adult, you're no longer free, you're no longer a citizen. You're something much less than that. It's not complicated. It might be nice to have a few United States senators who are willing to say something like that and then stick to it, so it's left to Nicki Minaj to say it. Lara Logan joins us now. She is the host of \"Lara Logan has No Agenda\" on FOX Nation. We're happy to have her. Lara, thanks so much for coming on. So I never imagined we'd be opening the show with a segment about Nicki Minaj and I don't think it's actually about politics. The Democratic Party hates this because it disempowers them and they think they own Nicki Minaj and whatever. Leaving that aside, she is making much deeper points about what we're allowed to do in the United States and we're allowed to decide what medicine we take, are we not? We're allowed to ask questions about the effects of that medicine, are we not? Why are the rest of us relinquishing those rights without a fight? LARA LOGAN, FOX NATION HOST, \"LARA LOGAN HAS NO AGENDA\": Well, it's called surrender, Tucker. What's happened to this country is that people have surrendered to this because they feel powerless. And if you look throughout history, there are Marxist takeovers and Marxist doctrine and even the Nazis, right. They know this playbook. If you take over all these institutions and people have the impression that you know, nobody agrees and nobody is willing to stand up, then they submit even further. And the only form of victory that can't be won, right, that it can't be taken from you is the one that you give, which is surrender. If you accept defeat and you lose the will to fight, then they don't even have to fight that battle and that's where we are now. They've made the price of standing up to them so high that nobody is willing to do it, except now people are seeing, wait a minute, it's too many subjects. Whether it's the southern border, or it's the vaccine, right or it's the way they handled COVID. Or you know, four million other things -- Afghanistan, people on the left and on the right recognize these tactics. They are not new anymore. We know all about this now and people are saying it's not going to work on me. You know, I just spoke to James O'Keefe at Project Veritas and he was telling me that they are getting thousands of e-mails whether it's Marines who have -- you know on active duty who have been forced to take the vaccine or being fired or put on leave because they won't take it, whether it's critical race theory. Parents all across this country, Hispanic parents, black parents, white parents -- what does it matter? You know why do we even categorize people that way -- who are saying, no more, they've had enough.",

      "sentences": "So Joe Biden's order forcing a hundred million Americans to take the COVID shot is totally insane as a matter of public health, and by the way it has caused a crisis in the hospitals across the country as nurses have resigned. You can't say nurses don't know enough about healthcare or COVID, they treat it every day, unlike our politicians. Forcing nurses to take a vaccine they don't want has caused a healthcare crisis in our country, just in case you're wondering if this has anything to do with healthcare. But the mandate also tells you a lot about the people who are enforcing it. It's full of a lot of exceptions. Welfare recipients don't have to prove their vaccination status for example. Oh you do. You go to work to pay for other people to get aid, but you can't work unless you take the vaccination, but other people get aid regardless, right. Illegal immigrants have an exemption, too. They're coming into this country at record rates. This past August, Border Patrol officials encountered more than 200,000 illegal migrants at the southern border. For comparison, last August, that number was 50,000. So at least one Attorney General in one state is awake enough to notice what's happening here. He is in Arizona. He is Attorney General Mark Brnovich. He just filed a lawsuit against the administration citing the Equal Protection Clause in the Constitution. Brnovich's suit points out that the Biden administration is protecting the quote \"freedom and bodily autonomy of illegal immigrants more than American citizens.\" And that is true. That is exactly what's happening, and the Biden administration is not ashamed of it, they're happy to admit it. The other day, FOX's Peter Doocy asked Joe Biden's flak to explain why the vaccine mandate doesn't apply to illegal migrants and she didn't even bother to answer the question. Watch.",

People who are overweight are much more likely to die of COVID, so we close all the gyms and celebrate obesity. Again, not judging. This is the last show that's going to judge that. But seriously, if you cared about people's health, you would tell them the truth. No, they don't. Wear the mask. Take the vax. Toni Fauci is now advising colleges on how to implement bans on all forms of human contact. The independent journalist, Michael Tracey just reported on what's happening at Connecticut College for example. In Connecticut College, they have a nearly one hundred percent vaccination rate because they're forcing it. The Dean Con College who said he consults with Tony Fauci recently told kids on campus quote, \"Friends may not visit each other in rooms. Students may socialize with a maximum of three students outside, socially distanced, and wearing masks.\" They're all vaccinated. What is this? There is no escape. The pandemic at Connecticut College will go on forever despite the fact everyone has been vaccinated. Oh, it's not really about public health and it's not just Connecticut College. At Duke -- Duke -- where 98 percent of the students have been vaccinated, the administration mandated outdoor masking for two weeks. Why? No one explained because they feel like it. When you have power, it's hard to give it up. No one else sees what's going on here? It couldn't be more obvious. At Georgetown University, vaccinated students are told not to remove their masks, even to ask questions or drink water in class. At Brown University - - let's hope all these places close soon by the way -- Brown has decreed that quote, \"Students are expected to consistently engage with the same small social group. They should not go to indoor bars or restaurants,\" and that applies whether or not they're vaccinated. So if the vaccines don't change what you're allowed to do, have no material effect on your health status, on your protection against COVID, why are we forcing the vaccines? This is too crazy. Who is issuing these orders? And what are their lives like? That's an interesting question. And the health website \"Stat\" just took a look at that. They found that nearly half of public health experts, all of whom have been vaccinated said they are not comfortable attending an outdoor concert or sporting event. Huh? And fully two-thirds of vaccinated public health experts said they still are not comfortable eating in a restaurant. So obviously, we've got some very neurotic people here, but the principle remains. If you can force people to get the vaccine, what can't you do? That's a question that Jim Breuer appears to be thinking about. He is a comedian. He just announced he is not performing at any venue that requires patrons to be vaccinated. He joins us tonight to explain why. Jim Breuer, thanks so much for coming on.

Why would you -- I don't want any of my fans forced to come laugh and they've got to get a shot in them? And honestly, Tucker, I've got to be honest with you. What really started my video was -- there's a new narrative and the new narrative is the unvaccinated are the beast. Kill the beast. This program goes on forever. Kill the beast. The beast is the unvaccinated. Kill them. And when our leader put that out there and pointed the finger like we're the demons, I'm not vaccinate. I had COVID. You're not to tell me about my body. I know my body. I know my morals. I know my faith. You don't come telling me and threaten me and everyone else as if we're the demons. I have two close friends right now fully vaccinated and they got COVID, and they are both sick. So what is -- this is not about safety, because if it was, just like you said and I said in my video, eat more fruit, take care of your body, go to the gym. I've been saying that forever. You would have thought I called people savages for doing that, but this is where we're at as a society and the greatest thing I have to be honest with you, I'm so blessed because 95 percent of people -- I was just saying it to be honest, Tucker, one message after the other was \"Thank you. Thank you for speaking up. Thank you.\" \"I feel terrible I'm a fireman and they want me to get vaccinated, I don't want to get vaccinated.\" My child, I know someone -- my hand to God -- and it was the last vaccine push. Their child, five years old vaccinated went paralyzed from the neck down and I do a benefit for him every year, so when I hear people going, \"Oh, you don't know that.\" No, you don't. You don't know what you're talking about. Explain that to that father and mother, so thank God they're better now, but it took years. So, I don't understand what's going on like a lot of humans and this isn't political just like the other person said. This is good versus evil, and this is power versus the powerless.

That was not totally surprising, we already knew he was a reckless nutcase. In June, in the middle of a televised congressional hearing, Milley leveled a racial attack against more than half of this country. Milley told Congress that something called white rage was a national crisis. He never proved it or even defined the term and yet, still, he kept his job which says as much about Congress as it does about him. Then in July, we learned that Milley had suggested the U.S. military was willing to use violence against Donald Trump who was then the sitting President. We're the guys with guns, he told fellow officers. Still Congress, did nothing. Now, thanks to a new book by Bob Woodward and Bob Costa, we've learned that Milley secretly collaborated with our greatest military rival, the government of China. On October 30th last year according to the book, Milley called his counterpart in China, a Chinese General. He did not tell his boss about the call, either before he made it or after. Here was Milley's message for the Chinese military, \"We're not going to attack or conduct any kinetic operations against you. General Li, you and I have known each other for five years. If we're going to attack, I'm going to call you ahead of time. It's not going to be a surprise.\" It's hard to believe that conversation actually took place, but apparently it did. More than 24 hours after it was reported, Mark Milley has not denied it. Instead, his spokesman released a statement today confirming that Milley does regularly speak to Chinese military officials, but claiming that those calls are authorized by civilian leaders at The Pentagon. But that turns out to be a lie. Just hours ago, the former Secretary of Defense Christopher Miller told FOX News he has no idea what Mark Milley is talking about quote: \"As Secretary of Defense, I did not and would not ever authorize such conduct.\" As Miller put it, quote: \"A lesser-ranking officer accused of such behavior would immediately be relieved of duty.\" But Mark Milley has not been relieved of duty and apparently he won't be. Today, Joe Biden endorsed him and the job he is doing.",

So how much more evidence do you need, exactly? And why does no one in Washington consider this a crisis?

Just to put that in perspective for you, that's about the population of Birmingham, Alabama crossing our border in one single month. And we want to show you the impact it's having down here. Take a look at this video our drone team shot earlier today in Del Rio, Texas. What you're looking at here are shocking images of thousands of migrants waiting underneath the international bridge in Del Rio after they've crossed illegally into the U.S. They're just sitting there waiting for Border Patrol to pick them up and apprehend them. What we're being told is local Border Patrol holding facilities out there are so overwhelmed, so over capacity they just can't pick these people up right now. There is nowhere for them to go and we're hearing from Border Patrol sources, there are currently more than 4,000 migrants waiting underneath that bridge with more showing up by the minute, most of them from Haiti. Take a look at this second piece of video right here. You can see those migrants just keep streaming in by the minute walking down a dirt trail showing up to that bridge, some of them going back into Mexico, some of them crossing a dam over the Rio Grande, some of them end up playing in the water before they cross over. It certainly does not look like an international border. And finally, take a look at this third piece of video. We had a source on the ground who was right there at the situation with the bridge send us this video. You can see those migrants streaming in on the ground walking that dirt trail, when you see them come around the corner, you're going to see thousands of those migrants again just waiting underneath that bridge there with no Border Patrol anywhere. And the mayor of Del Rio says, their Intel is 20,000 more migrants are on the way as we speak. We'll send it back to you.",

We know about Anthony Fauci. We know about how the N.I.H. was funding gain-of-function research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. But when I was doing my investigation for my book, and for this documentary, I went to speak to the Chinese defectors, people who still maintain like Wei Jingsheng, impeccable contacts within the communist party system. And what Wei Jingsheng told me was that he first heard there was a coronavirus in Wuhan in October 2019. That was during the World Military Games in Wuhan. And from that point on, he desperately tried to alert America that there was this coronavirus spreading in Wuhan and making people very sick. And remember this man, Wei Jingsheng, highly credible. He was China's most famous defector to America and made global headlines when that happened in 1997. He is also known as the Father of China's Democracy Movement. He maintains contacts on both sides of the political aisle, Mike Pompeo and Nancy Pelosi alike. So he is really a very credible, highly respected figure. He had spent 18 years in prison in China before his defection, and as I said, he was a Communist Party insider. So he discovered this virus back in October. He tried to alert the American Intelligence Agencies. He told them about it. And as you just heard, he felt they weren't taking it seriously. He also told a politician and another human rights activist called Dimon Lui, and she did eventually get the message. She put Wei in contact with Matt Pottinger, who was the Deputy National Security adviser in the White House. And then eventually, they understood the gravity of it. But I think the question comes back to why didn't the Intelligence Agencies act? This wasn't the only piece of Intelligence they had in late 2019, and they missed the warnings. Of course, China is ultimately responsible, but we've now lost 4.6 million lives. Is this a pandemic that could have been -- the global spread could have been prevented had they paid closer attention?",

A couple of days ago, we would guess, most people watch the show may not have heard of Nicki Minaj and then she tweeted about the COVID vaccine. She didn't come out against the vaccines, she merely said that as an adult and an American, she should decide whether or not to take the vaccine. \"Pray about it,\" she said. 'Don't be bullied.\" Things blew up from there. No praying about it, you must submit to being bullied. Those are the new rules. Nicki Minaj wasn't aware of that and she resisted and she is still resisting. It's a long and interesting story. There's implications for all of us and Trace Gallagher has agreed tonight to frame it for us, to set it up and tell us what's going on, and here he is. Hey, Trace."

      "utterance": "Trace Gallagher, thanks so much. So here's the point that she is making, probably a lot of things Nicki Minaj says that you may not agree with, you may not like her music, but the two points she is making are worth reiterating. You can't allow people to force you to take drugs that you don't want or that you don't need. It's up to you what drugs you take. Period. And if you allow people to force you to take drugs you don't want, you're done. They own you. You're no longer free. Period. And the second point that she has made quite a bit today is that you have a constitutional right, a moral right, a God-given right to ask simple questions and expect answers. Like you're an adult speaking to a fellow adult, and if you forfeit that right, you are no longer adult, you're no longer free, you're no longer a citizen. You're something much less than that. It's not complicated. It might be nice to have a few United States senators who are willing to say something like that and then stick to it, so it's left to Nicki Minaj to say it. Lara Logan joins us now. She is the host of \"Lara Logan has No Agenda\" on FOX Nation. We're happy to have her. Lara, thanks so much for coming on. So I never imagined we'd be opening the show with a segment about Nicki Minaj and I don't think it's actually about politics. The Democratic Party hates this because it disempowers them and they think they own Nicki Minaj and whatever. Leaving that aside, she is making much deeper points about what we're allowed to do in the United States and we're allowed to decide what medicine we take, are we not? We're allowed to ask questions about the effects of that medicine, are we not? Why are the rest of us relinquishing those rights without a fight? LARA LOGAN, FOX NATION HOST, \"LARA LOGAN HAS NO AGENDA\": Well, it's called surrender, Tucker. What's happened to this country is that people have surrendered to this because they feel powerless. And if you look throughout history, there are Marxist takeovers and Marxist doctrine and even the Nazis, right. They know this playbook. If you take over all these institutions and people have the impression that you know, nobody agrees and nobody is willing to stand up, then they submit even further. And the only form of victory that can't be won, right, that it can't be taken from you is the one that you give, which is surrender. If you accept defeat and you lose the will to fight, then they don't even have to fight that battle and that's where we are now. They've made the price of standing up to them so high that nobody is willing to do it, except now people are seeing, wait a minute, it's too many subjects. Whether it's the southern border, or it's the vaccine, right or it's the way they handled COVID. Or you know, four million other things -- Afghanistan, people on the left and on the right recognize these tactics. They are not new anymore. We know all about this now and people are saying it's not going to work on me. You know, I just spoke to James O'Keefe at Project Veritas and he was telling me that they are getting thousands of e-mails whether it's Marines who have -- you know on active duty who have been forced to take the vaccine or being fired or put on leave because they won't take it, whether it's critical race theory. Parents all across this country, Hispanic parents, black parents, white parents -- what does it matter? You know why do we even categorize people that way -- who are saying, no more, they've had enough."

      "utterance": "So Joe Biden's order forcing a hundred million Americans to take the COVID shot is totally insane as a matter of public health, and by the way it has caused a crisis in the hospitals across the country as nurses have resigned. You can't say nurses don't know enough about healthcare or COVID, they treat it every day, unlike our politicians. Forcing nurses to take a vaccine they don't want has caused a healthcare crisis in our country, just in case you're wondering if this has anything to do with healthcare. But the mandate also tells you a lot about the people who are enforcing it. It's full of a lot of exceptions. Welfare recipients don't have to prove their vaccination status for example. Oh you do. You go to work to pay for other people to get aid, but you can't work unless you take the vaccination, but other people get aid regardless, right. Illegal immigrants have an exemption, too. They're coming into this country at record rates. This past August, Border Patrol officials encountered more than 200,000 illegal migrants at the southern border. For comparison, last August, that number was 50,000. So at least one Attorney General in one state is awake enough to notice what's happening here. He is in Arizona. He is Attorney General Mark Brnovich. He just filed a lawsuit against the administration citing the Equal Protection Clause in the Constitution. Brnovich's suit points out that the Biden administration is protecting the quote \"freedom and bodily autonomy of illegal immigrants more than American citizens.\" And that is true. That is exactly what's happening, and the Biden administration is not ashamed of it, they're happy to admit it. The other day, FOX's Peter Doocy asked Joe Biden's flak to explain why the vaccine mandate doesn't apply to illegal migrants and she didn't even bother to answer the question. Watch."

By the way lose some weight and that's not judgment from those of us who love donuts, hardly. It's just true, and the numbers prove it. People who are overweight are much more likely to die of COVID, so we close all the gyms and celebrate obesity. Again, not judging. This is the last show that's going to judge that. But seriously, if you cared about people's health, you would tell them the truth. No, they don't. Wear the mask. Take the vax. Toni Fauci is now advising colleges on how to implement bans on all forms of human contact. The independent journalist, Michael Tracey just reported on what's happening at Connecticut College for example. In Connecticut College, they have a nearly one hundred percent vaccination rate because they're forcing it. The Dean Con College who said he consults with Tony Fauci recently told kids on campus quote, \"Friends may not visit each other in rooms. Students may socialize with a maximum of three students outside, socially distanced, and wearing masks.\" They're all vaccinated. What is this? There is no escape. The pandemic at Connecticut College will go on forever despite the fact everyone has been vaccinated. Oh, it's not really about public health and it's not just Connecticut College. At Duke -- Duke -- where 98 percent of the students have been vaccinated, the administration mandated outdoor masking for two weeks. Why? No one explained because they feel like it. When you have power, it's hard to give it up. No one else sees what's going on here? It couldn't be more obvious. At Georgetown University, vaccinated students are told not to remove their masks, even to ask questions or drink water in class. At Brown University - - let's hope all these places close soon by the way -- Brown has decreed that quote, \"Students are expected to consistently engage with the same small social group. They should not go to indoor bars or restaurants,\" and that applies whether or not they're vaccinated. So if the vaccines don't change what you're allowed to do, have no material effect on your health status, on your protection against COVID, why are we forcing the vaccines? This is too crazy. Who is issuing these orders? And what are their lives like? That's an interesting question. And the health website \"Stat\" just took a look at that. They found that nearly half of public health experts, all of whom have been vaccinated said they are not comfortable attending an outdoor concert or sporting event. Huh? And fully two-thirds of vaccinated public health experts said they still are not comfortable eating in a restaurant. So obviously, we've got some very neurotic people here, but the principle remains. If you can force people to get the vaccine, what can't you do? That's a question that Jim Breuer appears to be thinking about. He is a comedian. He just announced he is not performing at any venue that requires patrons to be vaccinated. He joins us tonight to explain why. Jim Breuer, thanks so much for coming on.

Hey, you want to -- you want to come see a concert? You want to -- you want to -- here, catch the fish. Why would you do that? Why would you -- I don't want any of my fans forced to come laugh and they've got to get a shot in them? And honestly, Tucker, I've got to be honest with you. What really started my video was -- there's a new narrative and the new narrative is the unvaccinated are the beast. Kill the beast. This program goes on forever. Kill the beast. The beast is the unvaccinated. Kill them. And when our leader put that out there and pointed the finger like we're the demons, I'm not vaccinate. I had COVID. You're not to tell me about my body. I know my body. I know my morals. I know my faith. You don't come telling me and threaten me and everyone else as if we're the demons. I have two close friends right now fully vaccinated and they got COVID, and they are both sick. So what is -- this is not about safety, because if it was, just like you said and I said in my video, eat more fruit, take care of your body, go to the gym. I've been saying that forever. You would have thought I called people savages for doing that, but this is where we're at as a society and the greatest thing I have to be honest with you, I'm so blessed because 95 percent of people -- I was just saying it to be honest, Tucker, one message after the other was \"Thank you. Thank you for speaking up. Thank you.\" \"I feel terrible I'm a fireman and they want me to get vaccinated, I don't want to get vaccinated.\" My child, I know someone -- my hand to God -- and it was the last vaccine push. Their child, five years old vaccinated went paralyzed from the neck down and I do a benefit for him every year, so when I hear people going, \"Oh, you don't know that.\" No, you don't. You don't know what you're talking about. Explain that to that father and mother, so thank God they're better now, but it took years. So, I don't understand what's going on like a lot of humans and this isn't political just like the other person said. This is good versus evil, and this is power versus the powerless. And it's the power of fear, but it is time for the power of the fearless. I'm sorry, but the fearless have to start rising because we know something is wrong."

He was just accused credibly of colluding with the Communist Chinese military, seizing control of the American nuclear arsenal, and threatening violence against the President of the United States. So, why is he still there? And who is defending him? Well some are defending him. We'll tell you who they are, next."

      "utterance": "Yesterday, we learned that Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is a danger to the country. That was not totally surprising, we already knew he was a reckless nutcase. In June, in the middle of a televised congressional hearing, Milley leveled a racial attack against more than half of this country. Milley told Congress that something called white rage was a national crisis. He never proved it or even defined the term and yet, still, he kept his job which says as much about Congress as it does about him. Then in July, we learned that Milley had suggested the U.S. military was willing to use violence against Donald Trump who was then the sitting President. We're the guys with guns, he told fellow officers. Still Congress, did nothing. Now, thanks to a new book by Bob Woodward and Bob Costa, we've learned that Milley secretly collaborated with our greatest military rival, the government of China. On October 30th last year according to the book, Milley called his counterpart in China, a Chinese General. He did not tell his boss about the call, either before he made it or after. Here was Milley's message for the Chinese military, \"We're not going to attack or conduct any kinetic operations against you. General Li, you and I have known each other for five years. If we're going to attack, I'm going to call you ahead of time. It's not going to be a surprise.\" It's hard to believe that conversation actually took place, but apparently it did. More than 24 hours after it was reported, Mark Milley has not denied it. Instead, his spokesman released a statement today confirming that Milley does regularly speak to Chinese military officials, but claiming that those calls are authorized by civilian leaders at The Pentagon. But that turns out to be a lie."

He is lying about it and that should make you very nervous. Why is he lying about that? No one in Congress seems to care -- at all. People with oversight seem to be on his side.

We don't want to jump to conclusions yet. I know he will address it and we'll ensure that he addresses it, but this is one of those claims obviously that seems a little farfetched, the idea that an American military General is going to warn an adversary if an attack is coming.

So how much more evidence do you need, exactly? And why does no one in Washington consider this a crisis? The leadership of The Pentagon, some of them anyway, constitute a threat to the United States. Teddy Daniels served in the United States Military in Afghanistan.

Just to put that in perspective for you, that's about the population of Birmingham, Alabama crossing our border in one single month. And we want to show you the impact it's having down here. Take a look at this video our drone team shot earlier today in Del Rio, Texas. What you're looking at here are shocking images of thousands of migrants waiting underneath the international bridge in Del Rio after they've crossed illegally into the U.S. They're just sitting there waiting for Border Patrol to pick them up and apprehend them. What we're being told is local Border Patrol holding facilities out there are so overwhelmed, so over capacity they just can't pick these people up right now. There is nowhere for them to go and we're hearing from Border Patrol sources, there are currently more than 4,000 migrants waiting underneath that bridge with more showing up by the minute, most of them from Haiti. Take a look at this second piece of video right here. You can see those migrants just keep streaming in by the minute walking down a dirt trail showing up to that bridge, some of them going back into Mexico, some of them crossing a dam over the Rio Grande, some of them end up playing in the water before they cross over. It certainly does not look like an international border. And finally, take a look at this third piece of video. We had a source on the ground who was right there at the situation with the bridge send us this video. You can see those migrants streaming in on the ground walking that dirt trail, when you see them come around the corner, you're going to see thousands of those migrants again just waiting underneath that bridge there with no Border Patrol anywhere. And the mayor of Del Rio says, their Intel is 20,000 more migrants are on the way as we speak. We'll send it back to you."

Certainly, it is not the time there, not that it ever was. And so, my old assistant like three years ago she's like -- she's the last fan and she -- the woman that came in that presented as working for the LAPD in a black suit like kind of a short hair like a lesbian woman. She goes, you're an actress, you've done a nude scene, you're done. And she wasn't wrong. I knew she was right. I was like, yes, you're right. So, then I found out quickly that he was offering to anybody he'd done this to a million dollars that was his number, that was his standard offer and you had to sign a non-disclosure agreement, which means you cannot talk to your therapist, your boyfriend, your mom, anybody in your life for the rest of your life, you cannot tell them this monstrous thing happened to you. Keep it inside. So I was like, I'm going to trick him, so I played really dumb and requested a hundred thousand dollars in return for not signing an NDA. So I became very quickly his number one enemy because then the movies I had done that hadn't come out yet hit, and I got very famous very quickly. So then I'm dangerous to him. So from that point on, your former guest, Anthony Pellicano, he was hired actually to work with the \"Enquirer\" to keep dossiers on me.

We know about Anthony Fauci. We know about how the N.I.H. was funding gain-of-function research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. But when I was doing my investigation for my book, and for this documentary, I went to speak to the Chinese defectors, people who still maintain like Wei Jingsheng, impeccable contacts within the communist party system. And what Wei Jingsheng told me was that he first heard there was a coronavirus in Wuhan in October 2019. That was during the World Military Games in Wuhan. And from that point on, he desperately tried to alert America that there was this coronavirus spreading in Wuhan and making people very sick. And remember this man, Wei Jingsheng, highly credible. He was China's most famous defector to America and made global headlines when that happened in 1997. He is also known as the Father of China's Democracy Movement. He maintains contacts on both sides of the political aisle, Mike Pompeo and Nancy Pelosi alike. So he is really a very credible, highly respected figure. He had spent 18 years in prison in China before his defection, and as I said, he was a Communist Party insider. So he discovered this virus back in October. He tried to alert the American Intelligence Agencies. He told them about it. And as you just heard, he felt they weren't taking it seriously. He also told a politician and another human rights activist called Dimon Lui, and she did eventually get the message. She put Wei in contact with Matt Pottinger, who was the Deputy National Security adviser in the White House. And then eventually, they understood the gravity of it. But I think the question comes back to why didn't the Intelligence Agencies act? This wasn't the only piece of Intelligence they had in late 2019, and they missed the warnings. Of course, China is ultimately responsible, but we've now lost 4.6 million lives. Is this a pandemic that could have been -- the global spread could have been prevented had they paid closer attention?"
