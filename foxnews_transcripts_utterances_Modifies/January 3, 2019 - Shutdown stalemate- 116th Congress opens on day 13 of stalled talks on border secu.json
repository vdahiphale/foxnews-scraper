So he leaves in the kitchen and he comes out and puts more Trump on your plate, which is what he did at 4:30, which helps galvanize the media and then everybody reacts, responds. But here's what -- I want to think about the real threat to security is a rhetorical device -- conflation, OK?  If you think about the four areas of security, border, terror, crime, and let's say home protection -- guns, OK. Those are the four areas. In each one of those cases, there is the device that is used to prevent any kind of improvements in that area, its conflation. If you look at immigration, conflate illegal immigration with legal immigration, you can't get a wall.  With terror, if you conflate religion with extremism, you get Islamophobia. That prevents any movement in the anti-terror world. If you look at policing, you conflate law and order with racism, right? Police brutality, police shootings, and then when you look at the Second Amendment, you conflate gun crime with actually gun ownership.  So this is a tactic used by the left that is effective in every area of security. And it's probably most glaring here because we see that they both agree on the same thing. They both want border protection, but one won't budge because they are conflating it with bigotry. It's like you want a wall? You don't like -- you don't like brown people. That's what it is.

But there's this huge outpouring of emotion when a woman, a migrant in the caravan, is tear gassed. Now, one is dead and the other is tear gassed, and this country focuses on this woman at the border with her kid and she's held out to be this big hero. And an actual hero right now is now dead. So, the reason the sanctuary city policies continue to happen is because these open border politicians are protected by the open borders media. They should have reporters knocking down the door of the governor of California asking for accountability. They should have people out on the street saying why is this happening?

They are not on the front lines knocking on doors like a police officer who has to pay the price.

So right now, we're living in a peaceful, prosperous state, and it's -- it's causing people like Joy Behar to become more irrational and Hank Johnson to become more irrational, if that's, indeed, possible. And I do believe that there are times when come -- I'm going to say it -- there were people irrational about Barack Obama. Now, I disagree with everything that Barack Obama did, maybe 98 percent. But, you know, I don't think he was evil. And I know that people are going to say, \"How dare you say that?\" I think that you've got to hand it to Trump to make -- for making a lot of irrelevant comedians feel important again. I mean, they had to go very far to find Jane Curtin. I mean, that's an R -- that's an R-list comedian. I mean, they -- they're exhausting it. But my piece of advice for the Democrats is what I said when I was doing \"Red Eye\" during Obama -- the Obama thing, was to be positive and fun about what you're doing.

This is a numbers game for the president at this point. The other point I would make is that a lot of people in cable punditry, including myself, have started talking about this DACA for a wall funding swap. My question is, is that even being talked about inside the negotiating room because you don't hear about it from Trump or the White House. You don't hear about it from Pelosi.

They are hung up on that four-letter word and they can't get past it. Meanwhile, you have a bunch of people who aren't collecting paychecks, others who aren't going to work and those who are caught in the middle trying to work in this country, but by some, they are being demonized. And my question for Dan is what if the wall doesn't work, because really the greatest correlation between immigration in this country and when it proliferates is when the economy is doing really well. Right now, the economy is doing really well. You also have a lot of illegal immigration."

      "utterance": "And that is the big picture. It's a big picture. You know, I looked at it from -- OK, as part of the media, we are living in Donald Trump's restaurant, right? Because around 4:30, he says, you know, there's not enough Trump on your pizza. There's not enough Trump in your soup. So he leaves in the kitchen and he comes out and puts more Trump on your plate, which is what he did at 4:30, which helps galvanize the media and then everybody reacts, responds. But here's what -- I want to think about the real threat to security is a rhetorical device -- conflation, OK? If you think about the four areas of security, border, terror, crime, and let's say home protection -- guns, OK. Those are the four areas. In each one of those cases, there is the device that is used to prevent any kind of improvements in that area, its conflation. If you look at immigration, conflate illegal immigration with legal immigration, you can't get a wall. With terror, if you conflate religion with extremism, you get Islamophobia. That prevents any movement in the anti-terror world. If you look at policing, you conflate law and order with racism, right? Police brutality, police shootings, and then when you look at the Second Amendment, you conflate gun crime with actually gun ownership. So this is a tactic used by the left that is effective in every area of security. And it's probably most glaring here because we see that they both agree on the same thing. They both want border protection, but one won't budge because they are conflating it with bigotry. It's like you want a wall? You don't like -- you don't like brown people. That's what it is. You don't like the people from Dallas (ph). It's like, no, actually if you ask the Hispanics here, they would actually agree that they believe at security too, but that conflation is what is destroying every debate. That's my big picture."

And in Madera County, they have kind of an unspoken sanctuary policy. ICE was never contacted because these weren't felonies. They were only misdemeanors. So, when something like this happens, it's heart-wrenching. And there is not the outpouring of emotion when an American police officer is killed by an illegal alien criminal. But there's this huge outpouring of emotion when a woman, a migrant in the caravan, is tear gassed. Now, one is dead and the other is tear gassed, and this country focuses on this woman at the border with her kid and she's held out to be this big hero. And an actual hero right now is now dead. So, the reason the sanctuary city policies continue to happen is because these open border politicians are protected by the open borders media. They should have reporters knocking down the door of the governor of California asking for accountability. They should have people out on the street saying why is this happening? Instead, this guy is not on the cover of \"Time\" magazine. The mother with a daughter is on \"Time\" magazine.

It's always somebody else so they can proclaim how great a sanctuary city is because it doesn't really affect them. They are not on the front lines knocking on doors like a police officer who has to pay the price. And if you bring up the stat and I think a lot of people do bring the stat, the rates of crime are higher among citizens than illegal immigrants. And I would be inclined to believe that because I go back and forth. But, you know, I've said this before. Heart disease kills more than cancer but people still die from cancer. We can handle both kinds of threats. So you can say -- this is why the argument fails -- you can say, citizens commit more crime. Well, the citizen didn't kill that police officer.

Because the better state that America gets in, in terms of increased prosperity and lower incidence of violence, the more frustrated the critics who are out of power become. So right now, we're living in a peaceful, prosperous state, and it's -- it's causing people like Joy Behar to become more irrational and Hank Johnson to become more irrational, if that's, indeed, possible. And I do believe that there are times when come -- I'm going to say it -- there were people irrational about Barack Obama. Now, I disagree with everything that Barack Obama did, maybe 98 percent. But, you know, I don't think he was evil. And I know that people are going to say, \"How dare you say that?\" I think that you've got to hand it to Trump to make -- for making a lot of irrelevant comedians feel important again. I mean, they had to go very far to find Jane Curtin. I mean, that's an R -- that's an R-list comedian. I mean, they -- they're exhausting it. But my piece of advice for the Democrats is what I said when I was doing \"Red Eye\" during Obama -- the Obama thing, was to be positive and fun about what you're doing. Have a good time, enjoy -- if you're out of power, you can still find -- and I'm going to bring up somebody. I know -- I think AOC is a positive force for the Democratic Party, because when I look at her, I see a positive person."
