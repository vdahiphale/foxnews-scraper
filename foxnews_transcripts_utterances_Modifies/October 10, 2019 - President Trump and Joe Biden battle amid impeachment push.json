He's going to board Marine One, head to Andrew Air Force Base, and then hightail it to Minneapolis because he has a big rally there tonight. Took questions on a range of issues. We're going to take it on the table.  Jesse, let's start with Minnesota. The president's team has put a lot of resources on the ground. In fact, I read today, one of the state of Democratic chairs said they've never seen a Republican who has put this much resources on the ground at this point in the election. I understand that the Trump campaign is 20 full-time hires already, they're looking to do about a hundred. And the president wants to flip Minnesota to be a Republican state in the 2020 election. What do you think?",

So Democrats in state have to not only be on defense but they're fighting incumbency, and they're having a really hard time with the feel that they have whether it's Joe Biden or Elizabeth Warren taking back Democrats who voters for Trumps in those blue states like Michigan and Wisconsin. And so they're looking at the math and saying where can we pick up some electoral seats if we were to lose a place like Michigan, for example, back to the Democrats, but that's something he's not afraid to do before, and they're looking at the map and they have a hundred million plus dollars --",

I think what you don't account for here is there is no single Democrat in the field that can be identified both in terms of being attacked by Trump, but also in terms of voters getting behind and, of course, the Democratic machine we're promoting.  So what you have to look at then is polls. And right now in the polls, Trump loses to everybody. He loses to Biden. He loses to Sanders. He loses to Warren.

You know, this is -- it's basically saying, you know, we're done here, get out. I do have to comment -- Juan brought up this poll and I've been seeing this poll everywhere, and I know it's a Fox News poll, but we've got to point out that it's weighted toward Democrats. From what I've seen, it's 48 percent Democrats, 40 percent Republicans, 12 percent others, so it's weighted for that. Also, it is being taken at the fever pitch of media coverage about a single topic, so what do you expect? You've got all the Democrats plus or minus 3 percent saying they want him out, OK? That's not a big finding. That's not a surprise.   In a month from now when all this stuff fades, let's see where it is now.

And the Kurds should have known that we were there, it was transactional, it was tactical, and it was temporary. However, any president knows that -- not all decisions are going to be agreed by with everybody else, but the decision-making process should be one that can be respected. In this case, it was very hard to understand how it happened all of a sudden, and now he's talking about mediation. He just said in a press conference as I'm walking out, now we're maybe going to mediate, but they lost -- the Kurds lost 100 people last night in the fighting.

They want him to be able to do what he needs to do to fulfill campaign promises, and to do what he -- like, we defeated ISIS. But the, we, is very interesting. We had very few people there.

I mean, come on -- and then we pulled out and left his people to die, and went back in and save the people again. So this happens all the time. Right now to say that we abandon the Kurds, I think it's not really saying what actually happened. We let the Kurds have a third of Syria. They had the entire northeast of Syria where 90 percent of the oil reserves are, and all of the great agricultural land. We're talking about a very small section right now and it's right in between the pipeline that runs north of Turkey to sell oil to the Europeans. Turkish people, they just want to make sure they have that pipeline lock down. All I care about is we have the ISIS fighters guarded in the prisons, and that's all I care about.

I mean, that is a concern. And ISIS fighters going to Europe is a direct threat to the American people. P We just indicted the nicest guy a month ago who went to Syria, trained as a sniper, and came back and was living in Brooklyn planning additional attacks in the United States. So you say alliances don't last forever. That is true. The alliance with Turkey as a member of NATO has to be looked at because Turkey told the president that they wouldn't be bombing civilians, and as they went into this they've already killed civilians in the last day.  They said they wouldn't go after the Kurds, they're doing that. They're bombing hospitals. And they're not holding up their end of the deal.

We're going to take it on the table. Jesse, let's start with Minnesota. The president's team has put a lot of resources on the ground. In fact, I read today, one of the state of Democratic chairs said they've never seen a Republican who has put this much resources on the ground at this point in the election. I understand that the Trump campaign is 20 full-time hires already, they're looking to do about a hundred. And the president wants to flip Minnesota to be a Republican state in the 2020 election. What do you think?"

And Omar, I do believe, is hurting them in Minnesota. If you look at the numbers too, the Democrats really have to play defense in Minnesota. They're not used to playing defense in Minnesota. He's going to make them play there. He's going to make them play -- and again in Pennsylvania, and also in New Mexico. Places where they're not used to having to spend money and time. And they don't have a lot of time, and they definitely don't have a lot of money to spend defending these places. So, I think it will be a big rally tonight."

So Democrats in state have to not only be on defense but they're fighting incumbency, and they're having a really hard time with the feel that they have whether it's Joe Biden or Elizabeth Warren taking back Democrats who voters for Trumps in those blue states like Michigan and Wisconsin. And so they're looking at the math and saying where can we pick up some electoral seats if we were to lose a place like Michigan, for example, back to the Democrats, but that's something he's not afraid to do before, and they're looking at the map and they have a hundred million plus dollars --"

So you can see something changing. I think what you don't account for here is there is no single Democrat in the field that can be identified both in terms of being attacked by Trump, but also in terms of voters getting behind and, of course, the Democratic machine we're promoting. So what you have to look at then is polls. And right now in the polls, Trump loses to everybody. He loses to Biden. He loses to Sanders. He loses to Warren.

I mean that's like publishing Peter Schweizer in the New York Times, it's like Trump putting Rosie O'Donnell in his cabinet. You know, this is -- it's basically saying, you know, we're done here, get out. I do have to comment -- Juan brought up this poll and I've been seeing this poll everywhere, and I know it's a Fox News poll, but we've got to point out that it's weighted toward Democrats. From what I've seen, it's 48 percent Democrats, 40 percent Republicans, 12 percent others, so it's weighted for that. Also, it is being taken at the fever pitch of media coverage about a single topic, so what do you expect? You've got all the Democrats plus or minus 3 percent saying they want him out, OK? That's not a big finding. That's not a surprise. In a month from now when all this stuff fades, let's see where it is now.

You can call it misguided, but at least admit it exists, but the media won't. It's repetition 24/7 to avoid real truth about a new era. When, in which, we've seen the highest household median income in history, punishment of China for oppressing Muslims, continued prison reform, record employment for women and minorities, and now attempts to draw down foreign wars, that the media find such things trivial says it all about the media. It's not hawks versus doves, it's them versus you. They can't stand you, and I bet the feeling is mutual.

Commanders- in-chief had to make really tough decisions, and nothing is black-and- white. These are always shades of gray and it's very complex. And the Kurds should have known that we were there, it was transactional, it was tactical, and it was temporary. However, any president knows that -- not all decisions are going to be agreed by with everybody else, but the decision-making process should be one that can be respected. In this case, it was very hard to understand how it happened all of a sudden, and now he's talking about mediation. He just said in a press conference as I'm walking out, now we're maybe going to mediate, but they lost -- the Kurds lost 100 people last night in the fighting. So, I think that the critic of the president on the right, they have his best interest in mind. They don't want him to have -- to be criticized. They want him to be able to do what he needs to do to fulfill campaign promises, and to do what he -- like, we defeated ISIS. But the, we, is very interesting. We had very few people there. We've had the Kurds were actually on the ground doing the work for us and they lost 11,000 people. And the Kurdish leaders, they also had to send letters to their people."

And then Trump had to come in and clean it up and bombed everybody and promised the American people he wasn't going to stay. He's trying to keep a campaign promise. I agree with Dana, alliances don't last forever. I mean, we're allied with Saddam Hussein, or shaking his hand, and next thing you know we're invading his country and hanging him. I mean, come on -- and then we pulled out and left his people to die, and went back in and save the people again. So this happens all the time. Right now to say that we abandon the Kurds, I think it's not really saying what actually happened. We let the Kurds have a third of Syria. They had the entire northeast of Syria where 90 percent of the oil reserves are, and all of the great agricultural land. We're talking about a very small section right now and it's right in between the pipeline that runs north of Turkey to sell oil to the Europeans. Turkish people, they just want to make sure they have that pipeline lock down. All I care about is we have the ISIS fighters guarded in the prisons, and that's all I care about. And if I was the president, I'd just ship them all to Antarctica, but that's why I'm not president."

So the question is, how are they going to get in and make sure that the thousands -- the tens of thousands of ISIS fighters aren't just going to walk right out, and as the president said go to Europe. I mean, that is a concern. And ISIS fighters going to Europe is a direct threat to the American people. P We just indicted the nicest guy a month ago who went to Syria, trained as a sniper, and came back and was living in Brooklyn planning additional attacks in the United States. So you say alliances don't last forever. That is true. The alliance with Turkey as a member of NATO has to be looked at because Turkey told the president that they wouldn't be bombing civilians, and as they went into this they've already killed civilians in the last day. They said they wouldn't go after the Kurds, they're doing that. They're bombing hospitals. And they're not holding up their end of the deal. So I'm just a little bit confused about the president's statement that he wants to take troops out, which is fine, that something he said he would do, consistent --"

And if you're of the idea that you do not want American forces to be deployed on the ground, you have to have alliances on the ground. And if the Turks did something but the Kurds did more when it came to fighting ISIS. And I think 11,000 dead Kurdish fighters in terms of how small their population is -- and giving them the land that they were occupying is a pretty good deal considering what they did for us and limiting the attacks that happened on American soil --"

It's because the book that broke the Lauer's story also reportedly contains more damaging information on NBC execs like how network executives knew about the former NBC host behavior before he was fired but didn't stop it. The book also claiming that NBC caved to pressure from Harvey Weinstein. He reportedly had the network spike a story about alleged sexual assault. Katie, what you hear from this Ronan Farrow book is that NBC, you know, is on the way now to saying that they're -- that Farrow didn't have the facts, he didn't have the sources, he didn't have people on the record when he left NBA. And he's now making it out that somehow they didn't back him up, but, in fact, they're saying he didn't have the story. Should they just come clean? How are we to make sense of this?"

This has not has played out in the court of law yet with the new allegations that we've heard about, so sometimes the details get a little muddled. But in terms of the accountability at NBC is well documented now that they did spiked that story that Ronan Farrow was writing about what was going on with Weinstein, and now he's had people following him around, intimidating him, and trying to squash what was in the book, so he deserves credit for moving forward with it despite those threats. But I think being skeptical of this kind of reporting is good. Until you've actually read what's in the book."

But part of what Farrow is arguing is that there was an exchange going on between NBC and the parent company of the National Enquirer that they were saying, we have stuff on Matt Lauer and NBC is saying, well, we'll keep that quiet and we won't do Weinstein.

I mean the narrative is, is that NBC covered up for Lauer, covered up for Weinstein, then leaked the Access Hollywood tape against Trump and then pushed Billy Bush out, because he was a threat to Lauer. The whole thing is really sloppy and ugly coming from the supposed, you know this peacock network that's supposed to be pristine and perfect. But if you look at it the last couple of years, you know Lester Holt's in a dogfight with David Muir, he's losing to him now. Megan Kelly, they lost a ton of money on her. And it's not like Seinfeld and F.R.I.E.N.D.S. are running the world anymore. I mean they're in second place. CBS is number one now. So, they have to take a look at the leadership. I think Andy Lack, if he can't control this and Comcast might say, you know hit the road. I mean there's some bright spots, they've got the Olympics coming up. They have football and it's an election year, so they're going to make a lot of money next year and that's what it's all about, it's all about profit."

Then I got worried about holding down the Dodgers so the game could go to extra innings, but in the top of the 10th, Howie Kendrick came to the plate and this happened. It was no dream.
