There has been increased threats of violence. January 6 was an obvious manifestation of that. But I see it every day, every week. I hear it in the venom that is directed at me and at my staff on a daily basis from people who believe they somehow have the right to make those sorts of threats, as if it's somehow part of political speech.

It's not entirely clear where the votes are for that at this point. Obviously, Republicans think that more than enough has been spent at this point. Obviously, they allocated $1.9 trillion in COVID relief money just last spring. And a lot of folks are asking, where did that money go, as people are scrambling to find testing in this country, and have been unable to do so? And so there was thought that there would be negotiations over the Christmas holiday between the White House and Senator Joe Manchin on perhaps a slimmed-down version of that Build Back Better Act that Manchin has held up basically by himself. He threw cold water on that idea when he came back to the Hill this week. He said there have been no conversations about a slimmer or new-and- improved Build Back Better Act. And so it's not entirely clear whether the White House and Senator Manchin are in a cooling-off period or where things exactly stand. But when you look at Manchin, the West Virginia Democrat, he seems to be the person who's holding up the idea of changing the rules in the Senate to perhaps change federal voting laws, something that Republicans say should be determined by the individual states. He's also seen as the person who is standing up and stopping that Build Back Better Act pumping another $2 trillion or so into the economy, when there are inflation concerns in this country. And so a lot of people on the conservative side of things are seeing Manchin as a huge hero, basically stopping a runaway agenda on the left. But, obviously, the Democratic Party is quite frustrated that one of their own may be stopping them from spending a whole lot more and getting President Biden's agenda across the finish line, Neil.",

We're going to get a little bit of snow. And this storm isn't going to be that bad overall. That said, we have had major car accidents and pileups across parts of Kentucky already, places that maybe aren't so much used to so much snow. Heaviest of the snow so far has been down across areas of Tennessee and into Kentucky. Nashville, the snow was mostly over for you, around three or four inches around town. To the north of that, still snowing in Kentucky, where Northeastern Kentucky, along Interstate 64, is seeing major car pileups. Now, this snow on the ground is new snow there across parts of Kentucky. But we still have some snow on the ground across the D.C. area from the storm that brought all of those problems across I-95 just a couple of days ago. That snow is on the ground, temps a little bit warmer right now. We're going to get another coating of snow. It's not going to be certainly as bad as this last storm. And overnight, tonight, we see that snow across New York City from Philly to New York City by tomorrow morning, heavily in across areas around the Boston area. We do have winter storm warnings back across parts of West Virginia. That will probably be the bullseye from this storm, as well as coastal areas of New England. So, Boston up towards Portland, Maine, is where we're going to probably be seeing the heaviest of the snow. Cities from Philadelphia to New York, one, two, three inches of snow, maybe an outside four or so. And the heavier snow will be a little bit farther off towards the east, so eastern ends of Long Island, Cape Cod and the islands, coastal parts of Maine. That's where we're going to probably be seeing the heaviest of the snow from this. It's going to be rough going tomorrow morning, if you're heading out to go back to work. But just be careful. Go slow. It's not a blockbuster storm by any means. That said, a little bit of rain comes in after this weekend. And then the bottom drops out temperature-wise. We will see the coldest temps we have seen so far this winter Monday into Tuesday, very, very cold across parts of the Northeast -- Neil.",

I don't think that will happen again. But President Carter makes an important point. There's a coarsening of political dialogue. Coarsening is a kind way to put it. There has been increased threats of violence. January 6 was an obvious manifestation of that. But I see it every day, every week. I hear it in the venom that is directed at me and at my staff on a daily basis from people who believe they somehow have the right to make those sorts of threats, as if it's somehow part of political speech.

It wasn't just an attack on one party or another. It was an attack on all of us. We were all at risk. We all could have suffered great harm. And, as a nation, we suffered that harm. And that should always be separate from the debates that we should have about our different perspectives on those big issues.

I'm interpreting it that way. Maybe I'm wrong, but to say that we made you have to realize that this is going to be with us a while.

One of the things that came up is that we have many more potential treatments, between pills from Merck and Pfizer, recommended third, fourth booster shots that Israel is saying have been effective at building antibodies there.

Fully vaccinated, right now, by the old definition, means just completing the primary series.

In fact, there's talk of providing still more relief for businesses and restaurants, pubs, that sort of thing.

A lot of these establishments are saying, we're in a world of hurt, and we need more help. So there's a push on Capitol Hill to provide another $68 billion to such businesses. Mike Emanuel has the latest on where that is going. Hey, Mike, good to have you. Where is this going right now?"

      "speaker": "MIKE EMANUEL, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Well, Neil, there are other conversations under way to talk about whether that is needed to provide more aid to businesses amid the Omicron surge. It's not entirely clear where the votes are for that at this point. Obviously, Republicans think that more than enough has been spent at this point. Obviously, they allocated $1.9 trillion in COVID relief money just last spring. And a lot of folks are asking, where did that money go, as people are scrambling to find testing in this country, and have been unable to do so? And so there was thought that there would be negotiations over the Christmas holiday between the White House and Senator Joe Manchin on perhaps a slimmed-down version of that Build Back Better Act that Manchin has held up basically by himself. He threw cold water on that idea when he came back to the Hill this week. He said there have been no conversations about a slimmer or new-and- improved Build Back Better Act. And so it's not entirely clear whether the White House and Senator Manchin are in a cooling-off period or where things exactly stand. But when you look at Manchin, the West Virginia Democrat, he seems to be the person who's holding up the idea of changing the rules in the Senate to perhaps change federal voting laws, something that Republicans say should be determined by the individual states. He's also seen as the person who is standing up and stopping that Build Back Better Act pumping another $2 trillion or so into the economy, when there are inflation concerns in this country. And so a lot of people on the conservative side of things are seeing Manchin as a huge hero, basically stopping a runaway agenda on the left. But, obviously, the Democratic Party is quite frustrated that one of their own may be stopping them from spending a whole lot more and getting President Biden's agenda across the finish line, Neil."

    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

But it's the times in which we live. But I'm curious, do we know where he stands on this? Do we know whether this has any chance of passage? Republicans say, we don't need it, we have got plenty of still unspent funds out there."

      "speaker": "EMANUEL",

So, I haven't gotten a firm readout from him exactly on where he is on that $68 billion. But I'm old enough to remember when $68 billion was a whole lot of cash. Now we throw around trillions in this town, and so interesting times here in Washington."

I'm interested in what led to January 6 most importantly. What is -- what were the circumstances? What did the former president know prior to January 6? Because what's most important, even more than accountability for that day, is that we don't have anything like that happen again. So, we're making some really good strides.

And the second he went there, he basically denied top cover to anybody that wanted to step out and say the truth, and really brought the former president's political fortunes back to life. It's disappointing from a leadership perspective. And, as a guy that attended Sunday school almost every week as a kid, the truth matters, and we're not telling people the truth."

      "speaker": "KINZINGER",
      "utterance": "You know, I think, at so many points in the last year, the intervening four or five years, as President Trump was kind of rising up to get elected, there were always moments he seemed like he was going to be down and out, and he wasn't. And I think, from a political leader perspective, they began to fear their own base. And this is a key. As leaders, yes, we need our base to elect us. We need our people to elect us. But part of the two-way street is that -- of that is, we have to lead people as well. It is a responsibility. It's a unique responsibility. And I think too many people became fearful. We have a two-year election cycle. So you're always in one. They became fearful of losing that job. And you can convince yourself, I will just stay quiet, so that I survive, because somebody maybe with much more conspiracy-driven attitudes will replace me. The problem is, now is the time. Now is the time where we just need to stand up and tell the people that we represent the truth. They deserve that. They don't deserve more and more e-mails trying to take their $20 or $30 away for a Stop the Steal movement based in complete nothingness, of which none of that money actually went to stopping the steal."

But that's why they start to go underground, be a little quieter. Here's the other thing, Neil, that I think is interesting. I guarantee you, if you put truth serum into every Republican member of Congress, all but maybe one or two, just because I got to put some slop in there, would tell you that the election was legitimate, Joe Biden won, and the election wasn't stolen. Yes, it angers people to hear it that don't want to hear it, but that's the truth. The problem is, why are those people not telling their folks the truth? That is our basic and foremost responsibility as members of Congress. So, I will stand on an island. I will take arrows. That's fine. I don't care. But I can look at myself in the mirror and know I told the truth. And that, to me, is what matters more than anything."

What we know is that, for 180-some minutes, he watched television and watched the attack unfold. I can tell you, at a basic level, that is abdicating your oath to office to defend the Constitution against enemies, foreign and domestic. That's the basic. Now, if he was gleeful, and did he know stuff leading up to January 6, that's what I can't answer. That's what we hope to be able to answer. And I think that will show the difference between an incompetent or a president frozen in inaction vs. a president that knew what was coming. I think that will be key. We don't have that yet. We will get there."

I think, if -- imagine if he's back on Twitter, and, every day, it's a new fight you're trying to pick, and trying to unify a country, when we're facing real enemies like China, we're facing Russia on the border of Ukraine, Iran with a nuclear program, and we're more interested with fighting the other political party than we are in actually defending American interests. I think that only gets worse, Neil. And I think, quite honestly, people's faith in democracy erodes.

There's a certain generation that can remember when rates were a heck of a lot higher than that. Let me show you something that goes back to early 1981, October, I should say, 1981, when a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage would set you back for 18.6 percent. So you can imagine a couple years later, when my wife and I bought our first condo, and we were paying 16.5 percent, we thought we were financial geniuses. So your sort of view and your age comes into play here. But that is a big jump for people who have been getting used to maybe two-something mortgages now or three-something mortgages.

Right now, someone could buy a very expensive house and, because rates are so low, actually have a monthly payment much lower than someone who had a far less expensive house five, 10 years ago, one of the reasons the housing market is booming.

But these mortgages based off the 30-year, I don't think they're going to move that much. Now, they will go higher, there's no doubt about it. And there will be a psychological factor initially. But, also, we could get a sense that if anyone has been holding out that the train is leaving the station. So, oddly enough, you might actually spur some folks who have been sitting on the fence.

      "speaker": "RICK REICHMUTH, FOX NEWS CHIEF METEOROLOGIST",
      "utterance": "I mean, we have had more snow across parts of the South this winter than we have across the Northeast. It is pretty amazing. So it's January. We're going to get a little bit of snow. And this storm isn't going to be that bad overall. That said, we have had major car accidents and pileups across parts of Kentucky already, places that maybe aren't so much used to so much snow. Heaviest of the snow so far has been down across areas of Tennessee and into Kentucky. Nashville, the snow was mostly over for you, around three or four inches around town. To the north of that, still snowing in Kentucky, where Northeastern Kentucky, along Interstate 64, is seeing major car pileups. Now, this snow on the ground is new snow there across parts of Kentucky. But we still have some snow on the ground across the D.C. area from the storm that brought all of those problems across I-95 just a couple of days ago. That snow is on the ground, temps a little bit warmer right now. We're going to get another coating of snow. It's not going to be certainly as bad as this last storm. And overnight, tonight, we see that snow across New York City from Philly to New York City by tomorrow morning, heavily in across areas around the Boston area. We do have winter storm warnings back across parts of West Virginia. That will probably be the bullseye from this storm, as well as coastal areas of New England. So, Boston up towards Portland, Maine, is where we're going to probably be seeing the heaviest of the snow. Cities from Philadelphia to New York, one, two, three inches of snow, maybe an outside four or so. And the heavier snow will be a little bit farther off towards the east, so eastern ends of Long Island, Cape Cod and the islands, coastal parts of Maine. That's where we're going to probably be seeing the heaviest of the snow from this. It's going to be rough going tomorrow morning, if you're heading out to go back to work. But just be careful. Go slow. It's not a blockbuster storm by any means. That said, a little bit of rain comes in after this weekend. And then the bottom drops out temperature-wise. We will see the coldest temps we have seen so far this winter Monday into Tuesday, very, very cold across parts of the Northeast -- Neil."

By the way, if you're keeping track of this stuff, 2,000 more flight cancellations today, I think we're up to close to 20,000 flights canceled since around Christmastime here. So it's a nonstop thing. What's going on? Ben Baldanza joins us, the former Spirit Airlines CEO. Ben, great to see you again. Happy new year. What the heck is going on here?"

    {
      "speaker": "BEN BALDANZA, FORMER CEO, SPIRIT AIRLINES",
      "utterance": "Neil, it's great to see you again. And you're right about that number. It is almost 20,000 since Christmas Eve. You know, what happens is the combination of traditionally higher sick calls that airlines get during this time, combined with Omicron. Then you have some pilot union leaders at one big airline telling their crews, even if you think you're exposed to someone with COVID, you should not go to work. And when you have that kind of paranoia, then what you have is lots of people not coming to work, and, in hindsight, airlines just having too many flights scheduled for the number of people that they have to fly the flight. The more proactive airlines, Neil, have been canceling ahead of time, so at least they give people a day or two to plan."

    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "But it's really soured the industry's reputation. And I'm just wondering, just as it's getting back up on its feet and travel has gotten busy again, this could do some harm for quite a while, don't you think?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BALDANZA",
      "utterance": "Well, it could. And they're going to have to fix that with low pricing again. And if you remember, we had a summer where we saw similar kinds of issues, lots of cancellations."

      "speaker": "BALDANZA",
      "utterance": "Then Thanksgiving worked pretty well for the industry. There weren't a lot of problems. And some people were thinking, well, maybe the airlines learned from the summer. But now we know that there's just not a good alignment between the people who decide what flights to fly and the operators who actually have to make it happen. And that's got to get back together. The good news, though, Neil, is that January and early February are really weak times for travel. There's not a lot of leisure travel at that time."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BALDANZA",
      "utterance": "Well, I guess it would be pick a route that has enough frequencies that, if they cancel one or two, you could still rebook the same day. Or the others would be to book far enough beyond the holiday, if possible. It's now after the holidays, really. And since there are going to be fewer flights, because there's weaker demand right now..."
