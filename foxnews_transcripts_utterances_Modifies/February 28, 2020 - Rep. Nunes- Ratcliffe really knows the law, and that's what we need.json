It's about resilience and I think Apple maybe a special case as well since they arguably are the most successful U.S. company to ever penetrate the Chinese market. They get 20 percent of their sales there but then they're also hobbled by the fact that they assemble more than 50 percent of their iPhones so they might be a unique case, Martha. But I think the stock market action on Friday also is a positive because they didn't usually panic and fall off the cliff on a Friday and weekend if there really was a lot of fear.

But I think we can help at least encourage them to form a bipartisan caucus to get Democrats and Republicans in a room to start working on regular order. For example, regular order means that we used to use the subcommittee and committee process to address our differences, to compromise, to actually pass legislation. Oversight legislation, policymaking. Senate doesn't do that anymore. And passing budgets, you don't do that anymore. You don't pass appropriations bills. So, the Senate is really failing. And it's not one person's fault, it's not a president's fault, it's not a party's fault. This has been coming. And we've allowed it to get to this critical point where we've got to do something about it because it can only function our government, our three coequal branches of government when each branch is playing its role. And the Congress is just not playing its role now. And that letter that we wrote, and as you know, we had many Republicans and Democrats, many Republican leaders, former leaders, we had a former chairman of National Republican Committee Bill Brock signed that letter. So, this is a bipartisan effort. Because I think what always govern or tried to govern every one of us who signed that, we're there because of the American people.

So what is his take on the impact of this longer term?"

Only five companies in history have had that type of influence and Tim Cook sounding actually positive because things are actually getting better in China. Take a listen, Martha."

Meaning, they might tweak a few knots but nothing wholesale when it comes to their supply chain and operating in China and they've seen this before. They say our supply chain has survived a lot of natural disasters like hurricanes, like fires. It's been intact. It's about resilience and I think Apple maybe a special case as well since they arguably are the most successful U.S. company to ever penetrate the Chinese market. They get 20 percent of their sales there but then they're also hobbled by the fact that they assemble more than 50 percent of their iPhones so they might be a unique case, Martha. But I think the stock market action on Friday also is a positive because they didn't usually panic and fall off the cliff on a Friday and weekend if there really was a lot of fear. Instead, we actually saw some buying Martha in the last 15 or 20 minutes of the trading session."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

You know, it seems to me when you look at what the statement that Goldman Sachs put out, that they're basically not going to assume any earnings growth for American companies in 2020 as a result of this and a number of the firms on Wall Street really sort of you know sending signals that I think obviously the market overall over the last several days read as some real caution signals. I think it's kind of tough to know who to believe."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LI",
      "utterance": "Well, we heard from Tim Cook and he says look, have things really change that much in four weeks? Not really. I mean in fact, I think the jobs number point to a very strong U.S. economy. China isn't falling off a cliff. It seems like China is actually getting better at containing the coronavirus. You saw the lowest amount of new cases being reported today compared to the 2000 numbers that you always get. So there is - I would say that what we've seen in SARS and also back in 2003 and also what was on with 911 when stock markets fell 12 to 13 percent each time after that, they tend to recover and markets reward those that stick in these tough times."

But it really depends on how long the impact lasts and it's schools closed or theme park closed and I realize you know, I'm just sort of playing devil's advocate here because you know, there's a lot of big question marks still to be figured out here."

      "speaker": "LI",

It's just a late consumption probably after this coronavirus is contained."

I think that you know this might not be a bad time to actually start maybe looking at some of the blue chip stocks. But you're also right Martha that this does have a real economic impact. Obviously, we've seen in China where factories are closed down and where you see schools closing down.

I'm not sure that people are worried about a guy who's anti-investor and wants to raise capital gains and dividend taxes and anti-business but fundamentally, you know one of the things I looked at was what has happened in the past Martha, when we've had other you know, SARS and Ebola and other kinds of viruses. And what you find is you get a big sell off like we've had this week and then as soon as you get either a treatment or you know fall off in the cases, the market goes right back up again so I tend to think that's what we're -"

Corn prices, cotton prices, copper prices, oil prices, they're falling and that's because of this year. The Fed should have had that - headed that off. Now they are probably Martha, the betting is that when they meet in March, the Fed will actually cut interest rates but if you're going to - why wait till March?

That's a pretty serious issue that came up on 911 that the FBI didn't know what the CIA was doing and that perhaps if they had and I remember George Tenet writing about this, if they had been talking to each other, we might have known what was coming. So don't we need someone and doesn't that person need to be -"

That's why - that's why the DNI was stood up and created but what's happened, it's happened with all bureaucracies is they become bloated and now you have something that was supposed to be - I was there, I voted to create it. The original reason to create it was for it to be a strategic planning arm really to look and make sure that everyone is communicating. What they started to do is they started a duplicate efforts. In addition to that, you also have to look at the problems that we've had in terms of trying to get documents, trying to get things declassified. John Ratcliffe is the one who was in the middle of all of uncovering what really the - what I call, the dirty cops did at DO J and FBI. He was one of the most reliable people that we had."

Here's a - Chairman Adam Schiff said this. The President and Vice President don't inspire confidence and because the President has made so many false statements about so many things, you really can't rely on the White House says Chairman Adam Schiff.

It's finally happening in Ukraine, is that what's happening?"

They can wish it away if, they can build narratives that they like but the truth of the matter remains that the Democrats paid operatives to go to Ukraine and dig up dirt on the Trump campaign. And took an unprecedented step to have even the ambassador, Ukrainian ambassador, here in Washington DC, a diplomat, no less take shots at the Republican candidate for President so the fact that there were definitely shenanigans that went on Ukraine, that is a fact."

This certainly is an issue that would bring people together. The people of this country would expect their leaders, Republican, Democrat, to work together on something and I don't think it helps anybody or gets us to a solution or gets us to where we need to be when we go after each other than these - these rank just raw partisan ways."

You know this is a moment where you put all that aside and we pull together. If you've got a good idea for what we should do, bring it to the fore, and let's - you know, let's find the best solutions here. How can this group of former senators have an impact on the folks who are over there right now?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HAGEL",
      "utterance": "Well, they're in charge. They're the 100 senators now that are running the show and the 70 senators that wrote that letter recognize that. And we were very careful not to go back into our background and say things were so well done we were there. It was imperfect as well. But I think we can help at least encourage them to form a bipartisan caucus to get Democrats and Republicans in a room to start working on regular order. For example, regular order means that we used to use the subcommittee and committee process to address our differences, to compromise, to actually pass legislation. Oversight legislation, policymaking. Senate doesn't do that anymore. And passing budgets, you don't do that anymore. You don't pass appropriations bills. So, the Senate is really failing. And it's not one person's fault, it's not a president's fault, it's not a party's fault. This has been coming. And we've allowed it to get to this critical point where we've got to do something about it because it can only function our government, our three coequal branches of government when each branch is playing its role. And the Congress is just not playing its role now. And that letter that we wrote, and as you know, we had many Republicans and Democrats, many Republican leaders, former leaders, we had a former chairman of National Republican Committee Bill Brock signed that letter. So, this is a bipartisan effort. Because I think what always govern or tried to govern every one of us who signed that, we're there because of the American people. And our interest is above politics, it's got to be. We take an oath of office to the Constitution of this country. Not to a political party, not to a president. But to the country. And that should be our focus."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HAGEL",
      "utterance": "Well, I am. But also, after reminding myself just go back to 2016 when Donald Trump came on the scene and there were very few people in the Republican Party, the news media, who said that Donald Trump had much of a chance of getting the nomination, let alone being elected. But there is something going on in our country. It's going on in every western democracy and that's a lack of confidence and trust in our institutions. Specifically, our politics, and government in Washington. But it's everywhere. In the media, it's everywhere. That lack of confidence. And when you've got that volatility, uncertainty out there, you are going to have people like Bernie Sanders, a socialist, appeal to a lot of people on the left and right because they feel that they've been left behind. Same, I think very much the same base that President Trump appealed to, these elitists in Washington and the east coast, they're not taking care of us, they're not watching out for us. And so, when you've got that kind of political environment, then the volatility rules, and political environments always dominate. They always do."

But what I was going to say to your answer about socialism, there is a generational gap here. Younger Americans do not have the same historical idea about socialism than older Americans do."

And I am looking out my window and I don't like that. So, it was a totally lost cause. This four-star general said you are a honorary marine now. That sand you blew in the air was only about eight inches thick and under that he said was solid Karl (Ph) rock. So, when we came in to land, we could not dig foxholes with our little shovels and so on. And so, 500-pound bomb holes were there made foxholes for us and you saved us. And I said, really? Iwo Jima is a great thing in my life."
