      "sentences": "Good Sunday morning, everyone. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. Straight ahead right here on \"Sunday Morning Futures\": breaking news this morning, an exclusive audiotape from an insider of Spygate.  Plus, an exclusive declassified FBI brief which could open up a whole new Senate inquiry into the FBI's action on the Russia hoax. Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Lindsey Graham is here with breaking news on a new inquiry into why the FBI mislead the Senate on the dossier and the subsource coming up.  Also ahead, my exclusive interview with the man who first connected Carter Page with informant Stefan Halper. And why was Halper being paid hundreds of thousands of dollars just months before the FBI secured a warrant to spy on the Trump campaign through Carter Page?  Steven Schrage is here, sharing his story from the inside for the first time ever, with an exclusive audiotape that he says is the smoking gun in the Michael Flynn case. Plus, the president ends the stimulus madness, signing four executive orders into law to keep coronavirus aid flowing, even if Congress leaves for recess. GOP House Leader Kevin McCarthy is here with the insight on the COVID-19 relief measures from the Oval Office and their impact, plus his expectations for Joe Biden's running mate. We should know soon.  Then, breaking news on China this morning, as the Communist Party makes another power grab, this time on the Senkaku Islands in Japan -- the very latest plans from the United States ahead of a ban being lifted on fishing in the South China Sea next week. Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton investigates with us. Then: It is just 85 days away from America voting for its next president. Sean Hannity is here with predictions and a look at his new book.  All that and a lot more, as we look ahead right here, right now on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\"   All that coming up, but, first, the explosive newly declassified documents that could indicate fresh criminality. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham will reveal them right here for the first time, fresh off of his grilling of Sally Yates at this week's hearing, when the former deputy attorney general dropped the bombshell about Jim Comey.",

And this is the report they prepared before the briefing, and they did to the Senate Intel Committee, the FBI did, what they did to the FISA court. They misled the hell out of them. They said that there's no evidence from the subsource to suggest that Steele fabricated anything in the dossier. Actually, the subsource said, it was all bar talk, hearsay speculation, and conjecture, and the whole sexual activity of the president was made in jest. So they completely misrepresented to the Senate Intel Committee in 2018 what the subsource had told the FBI in 2017.  That is a new crime, a different crime, and I'm going to write a letter to Christopher Wray and ask him, who gave the briefing to the Senate Intel Committee in 2018, and how could they be telling the Senate Intel Committee in 2018 a bunch of lies, when they knew better?",

And that's why I commend the president for taking the action to ban TikTok in America if it is not wholly owned and operated by an American parent company. I encouraged the administration about a year ago to conduct the security review that ultimately led to this decision. That's because, to most Americans, TikTok seems like a harmless, fun, short-form video app, but behind that app on your phone is a vacuum of data of everything on your device, contacts, e-mails, text messages, photographs, social media posts, even browser history, keystrokes, and location data. That all goes back to servers in China, where it can be accessed by the Chinese Communist Party for decades to come. That's why, if TikTok is going to operate in the United States, it has to have an American parent and be wholly owned and operated, not just the servers and the data, but all of the source code, the algorithms, the engineers. There can be no lingering ties to China. And I think we have to be reasonably skeptical about any American companies to do that. They have to demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the U.S. government, that they can server all those ties. Otherwise, these software companies will have to be banned in America, for the safety and the privacy of Americans, especially our kids.",

That's why the military has recently forbidden its service members from using TikTok even on their personal devices, because imagine all the sensitive information and text messages and photographs and social media posts that the Chinese Communist Party could use as leverage to manipulate or even blackmail those young Americans. Or think about the kind of profiles that they are building on Americans that will be used for decades to come. And we have no idea how they're going to be able to use that information.

They sit atop oil and gas. China, as you say, now has had a presence around those islands for the longest period of time since 2012, the last time there was a flare-up. And, notably, China is saying that they are going to lift the ban on fishing around those islands next Saturday. If that happens, I would predict that you would see a large number of fishing vessels, many of which are going to be cloaked -- or, actually, are going to be, in reality, Chinese coast guard or even Chinese navy, probably armored up and ready to fight back against Japan's desire and intent to enforce its longstanding claim to those islands.

I don't believe Stefan Halper even knew Carter Page was going to be at the conference until I e-mailed him. We had talked about people. But what happened was, before the conference, if you look at it, a few weeks ago, Christopher Steele had been hired by a Clinton campaign contractor. And then the spark that I think really set this off was when Stefan Halper, Christopher Steele's old boss Richard Dearlove, and Page were all together. And Trump was portrayed, to my surprise, as this national security threat. And that's when the interest really started to bubble in terms of where this took off.",

There's a theory about how that played out. The key part and I think the real smoking gun in all of this is, all these tentacles lead back to this small group, including Stefan Halper at the center of Spygate, Christopher Steele at the center of Russiagate, Stefan Halper's FBI handler. None of the Senate has subpoenaed these or called these people to talk in four years. I think that's the real smoking gun. How are these people being protected?

So, again, it seems something that really needs to be investigated. One of his students was also working with Ignatius at The Post, Bob -- Robert Costa.

Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Lindsey Graham is here with breaking news on a new inquiry into why the FBI mislead the Senate on the dossier and the subsource coming up. Also ahead, my exclusive interview with the man who first connected Carter Page with informant Stefan Halper. And why was Halper being paid hundreds of thousands of dollars just months before the FBI secured a warrant to spy on the Trump campaign through Carter Page? Steven Schrage is here, sharing his story from the inside for the first time ever, with an exclusive audiotape that he says is the smoking gun in the Michael Flynn case. Plus, the president ends the stimulus madness, signing four executive orders into law to keep coronavirus aid flowing, even if Congress leaves for recess. GOP House Leader Kevin McCarthy is here with the insight on the COVID-19 relief measures from the Oval Office and their impact, plus his expectations for Joe Biden's running mate. We should know soon. Then, breaking news on China this morning, as the Communist Party makes another power grab, this time on the Senkaku Islands in Japan -- the very latest plans from the United States ahead of a ban being lifted on fishing in the South China Sea next week.

And this is the report they prepared before the briefing, and they did to the Senate Intel Committee, the FBI did, what they did to the FISA court. They misled the hell out of them. They said that there's no evidence from the subsource to suggest that Steele fabricated anything in the dossier. Actually, the subsource said, it was all bar talk, hearsay speculation, and conjecture, and the whole sexual activity of the president was made in jest. So they completely misrepresented to the Senate Intel Committee in 2018 what the subsource had told the FBI in 2017. That is a new crime, a different crime, and I'm going to write a letter to Christopher Wray and ask him, who gave the briefing to the Senate Intel Committee in 2018, and how could they be telling the Senate Intel Committee in 2018 a bunch of lies, when they knew better?"

They're dumping it all on Comey. And that's probably the right thing to do. Eventually, I'm going to call Comey in and ask him, how could you keep signing warrant applications against Carter Page in April and June of 2017, when your agency knew in January and March of 2017 the dossier was a bunch of garbage?"

When that critical money came through for the small businesses that went to the employees -- remember the PPP? -- and we were running out of money, she held it up again in that famous video in front of her refrigerator for ice cream that she didn't care.

That's what we need to do, get people back to work. The real challenge and the pain here that the Democrats could not find common ground is when it comes to the small businesses.

Will the Chinese surveillance and espionage ever be eliminated from TikTok at this point?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "COTTON",
      "utterance": "Maria, TikTok is like a Trojan horse on American cell phones. And that's why I commend the president for taking the action to ban TikTok in America if it is not wholly owned and operated by an American parent company. I encouraged the administration about a year ago to conduct the security review that ultimately led to this decision. That's because, to most Americans, TikTok seems like a harmless, fun, short-form video app, but behind that app on your phone is a vacuum of data of everything on your device, contacts, e-mails, text messages, photographs, social media posts, even browser history, keystrokes, and location data. That all goes back to servers in China, where it can be accessed by the Chinese Communist Party for decades to come. That's why, if TikTok is going to operate in the United States, it has to have an American parent and be wholly owned and operated, not just the servers and the data, but all of the source code, the algorithms, the engineers. There can be no lingering ties to China. And I think we have to be reasonably skeptical about any American companies to do that. They have to demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the U.S. government, that they can server all those ties. Otherwise, these software companies will have to be banned in America, for the safety and the privacy of Americans, especially our kids."

      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",

But you just went off how -- went through a line of things that TikTok being on your phone can get, just wipe all of the things on your phone and send it back to the CCP. What would the Chinese Communist Party do with that information? What is the threat? What can they -- how can they hurt us with our own information?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "COTTON",
      "utterance": "There's many threats, Maria. So, first off, TikTok has been around for several years now. That means that young Americans who were using it are now in their early 20s. Some of those are in sensitive positions in our military or in the federal government or in industry or national laboratories on -- working on cutting-edge projects. That's why the military has recently forbidden its service members from using TikTok even on their personal devices, because imagine all the sensitive information and text messages and photographs and social media posts that the Chinese Communist Party could use as leverage to manipulate or even blackmail those young Americans. Or think about the kind of profiles that they are building on Americans that will be used for decades to come. And we have no idea how they're going to be able to use that information. And then, finally, just that vast trove of data helps them in developing advances in things like artificial intelligence and machine learning. That is a huge benefit in the 21st century technology economy."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "So, my question on this story is, how many employees from TikTok will be melded into Microsoft? I mean, we have seen over and over again how the CCP is able to steal information from the inside, whether it's Motorola, with all of those engineers working for Motorola and sending stuff back to Huawei years ago, or, most recently, Harvard, or Cleveland Clinic. The CCP has been either able to identify people within institutions to send info back or actually get -- hire people and get Americans to do it. So, how many people from TikTok will end up working for Microsoft? Do we know that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "COTTON",
      "utterance": "Maria, I think the default answer should be zero, whether it's Microsoft or Twitter or any other company that makes a bid for TikTok, because, as you say, the Chinese Communist Party has a long history of using insiders in our companies, in our laboratories, in our colleges, of stealing technology. So, it's up to any prospective purchaser of TikTok to demonstrate to the United States government that they will not have any lingering ties to China. And that includes Chinese-based employees, in addition to all of the software and hardware."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",

      "speaker": "COTTON",

So, it'll be up to the technical experts in our government to assess what Microsoft or TikTok or any other purchaser might do.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "All right, I want to move on to what China has -- is now doing in Japan. We continue to see the CCP doing power grabs. First, it was India, gaining territory in India. Now you have got a conflict over here in Japan, right around the Senkaku Islands. And this is the longest continued presence along the Senkaku Islands since 2012. Also, China is expected to end the fishing ban in the South China Sea. We're expecting U.S. vessels there in the upcoming weeks. Tell me what's going on with this latest power grab of the Communist Party."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "COTTON",
      "utterance": "Yes, Maria, I think you're right that this is just a continued instance of the pattern that China has over the last six months of using this pandemic for cover to take aggressive action against our neighbors. As you say, they essentially invaded India and killed 20 Indians a couple months ago. They also cracked down on Hong Kong. And now they are once again up to no good in the Senkaku Islands. This is a small set of islands just to the north of Taiwan, to the east of China, on -- or in the East China Sea. They sit on very critical commercial routes. They have very rich fishing waters. They sit atop oil and gas. China, as you say, now has had a presence around those islands for the longest period of time since 2012, the last time there was a flare-up. And, notably, China is saying that they are going to lift the ban on fishing around those islands next Saturday. If that happens, I would predict that you would see a large number of fishing vessels, many of which are going to be cloaked -- or, actually, are going to be, in reality, Chinese coast guard or even Chinese navy, probably armored up and ready to fight back against Japan's desire and intent to enforce its longstanding claim to those islands. So, we need to make it very clear to China that we will uphold our defense treaty with Japan and that those islands are rightfully belong -- they are rightfully controlled by Japan, and they should be settled only by arbitration and by negotiation, not by force."

And my intent was always to have a conference that looked at presidential campaigns and national security risks. I had no idea that it would blow up into this. Halper was not that engaged, up until the point where he crossed paths with Page and Christopher Steele's former MI6 boss Richard -- Sir Richard Dearlove. At that point, he seemed to really focus on Page, and really try to isolate him and kind of ingratiate himself with the Trump campaign in ways that seemed like a real turning point. But how Page wound up there with Halper is really a comedy of errors. And it was something where we were looking for someone from the Trump campaign to make sure the Trump campaign was represented. And it just kind of happened to fall in his lap that Page landed there."

I wanted to make sure, if we had Madeleine Albright on one side, we had a Trump representative on the other side. I don't believe Stefan Halper even knew Carter Page was going to be at the conference until I e-mailed him. We had talked about people. But what happened was, before the conference, if you look at it, a few weeks ago, Christopher Steele had been hired by a Clinton campaign contractor. And then the spark that I think really set this off was when Stefan Halper, Christopher Steele's old boss Richard Dearlove, and Page were all together. And Trump was portrayed, to my surprise, as this national security threat. And that's when the interest really started to bubble in terms of where this took off."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCHRAGE",
      "utterance": "Yes, I have never heard of that in an academic setting, providing that much compensation for these types of reports. One thing I will say that was quite unusual was, even after Carter Page had been kind of smeared improperly as a -- quote, unquote -- \"Russian spy,\" Stefan Halper would profusely thank me for introducing to him. And I never really understood that. But once I saw these massive payments kind of corresponding to when he was surveilling Page and Papadopoulos, which I learned about in 2018, there was obviously -- could be a connection there. There's a theory about how that played out. The key part and I think the real smoking gun in all of this is, all these tentacles lead back to this small group, including Stefan Halper at the center of Spygate, Christopher Steele at the center of Russiagate, Stefan Halper's FBI handler. None of the Senate has subpoenaed these or called these people to talk in four years. I think that's the real smoking gun. How are these people being protected? And how are we at a point so close to the election, and with Flynn's hearing coming up, that no one has called these people and gotten to the bottom of this? And the information I provide..."

      "utterance": "Yes. So, let's talk about that, because you actually recorded Stefan Halper. He was aware that you recorded him, because you used to do recordings. But this is on January 10, 2017, two days before there was a leak in The Washington Post that General Flynn was going to be investigated about the Logan Act. And you recorded Stefan Halper talking about Flynn. Let's roll that recording right now."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "So, what do you think was going on here, Steven? Do you think Halper was working for the FBI or the CIA and getting paid by the Office of Net Assessment to dirty up Flynn and dirty up Trump campaign officials? How did he know Flynn was about to blow up two days before it was in The Washington Post?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCHRAGE",
      "utterance": "Right. And some of this is things that I believe based on interacting with him for a long time, but they are beliefs. It was very odd, because I had told him extensively that Flynn was incredibly close with President Trump. At the time, as it's been reported, the FBI was about ready to pull its investigation on January 4, before the Oval Office meeting was -- met where it was -- the Logan Act and Flynn was discussed. So I don't think he had any independent reason to expect that this would happen to Flynn. He had also bragged to me and talked to others that David Ignatius was one of his big press media contacts. So, again, it seems something that really needs to be investigated. One of his students was also working with Ignatius at The Post, Bob -- Robert Costa. So, the fact that this has not been investigated, that no one has called them to testify and looked at this, I think, is as shocking as what's happened."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Well, what about you? You told me you spoke with John Durham. Somebody else told me that they thought you were disseminating the dossier. Are you involved in this?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCHRAGE",
      "utterance": "No, I had no idea at all. I mean, this has really upended my life. I was actually about to fly out for my wedding when the stories broke that my Ph.D. supervisor for a long time was this FBI spy known as the Walrus. And since that time, I have tried to uncover that. I have worked with investigators to try to do this. But with this Flynn information I discovered a few weeks ago, and the fact these investigations have not moved so far, I felt I needed to come forward before the Flynn hearing."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "So -- yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCHRAGE",
      "utterance": "And, frankly, the fact that some people have been spreading rumors about other people leaking it, I think there were quite a few Republicans involved in leaking this that I have found out through these different processes that have not been revealed. So, I think there's a lot of people trying to cover the tracks of what happened to start this thing. And I think that's why it's so critical that we get to the bottom of it."

      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "And you did talk to John Durham, correct?"
    },

      "speaker": "SCHRAGE",
      "utterance": "I did. And I did tell him a couple weeks ago, I said, I'm happy to continue to help, but I need to go public, because I'm concerned about how long this is taking. This shouldn't be political about Democrats and Republicans. This is about officials undermining our democracy. And it needs to be known long before the election."

And I will tell you what I -- you -- the work that you have done exposing the deep state, the abuse of power, the corruption, the spying on a president, the dirty dossier, you know, you have the whole cast of characters. And it is remarkable that they all knew. They knew everything. There was nothing there. And they allowed this to continue.

You're the leader of the free world. He does not -- you know, it was a fair question for Reagan in '84, the age question. Now it's a fair question for Joe Biden. Does he have the mental alertness, the mental acuity, the physical strength, the physical stamina to do this job? And if this was a traditional campaign, would he even survive? I have my doubts."

Frank Marshall Davis, community organizer, ACORN, Alinsky, black liberation theology, the Reverend Wright, Ayers and Dohrn, you know, two unrepentant domestic terrorists with Weather Underground. That's the home in which Barack Obama started his career. Remember, Obama, there were moments. We would get flashes.

But now the party has now gone so hard left. We saw this with impeachment. We saw this with the Russia hoax. They will lie with abandon. They don't care. The ends justifies the means.
