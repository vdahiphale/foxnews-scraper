Welcome to this breaking news edition of HANNITY.  Tonight, CBSN News, \"60 Minutes\" caught red-handed spreading outrageous lies about the Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, but even Democrats now, they are out there defending him and debunking CBS's lies. We will break it all down. And we have zero -- a brand new tape, by the way, of zero experience Hunter. He's now giving interviews and giving the most bizarre, baffling, confused answers to avoid admitting ownership of the hard drive from hell. Ric Grenell will react to that.  And, of course, the border catastrophe caused by Joe Biden, the one that they put a gag order on the media on and Border Patrol on. Yeah, it's getting worse tonight. We'll have exclusive reporting from our own Lara Logan. But, first, tonight, the endless hate, rage, hysteria, misinformation from Joe Biden, the media mob, Democrats, big tech, the woke corporate cowards, it's now hitting, if you can believe it new levels of derangement and psychosis because the outright lies that are being spewed about Georgia's new voting law and proposals in Texas, it exposes, just how corrupt just how bitterly partisan our major institutions are and how they become.  They're like, well, Pravda, pure state-run propaganda outlets and they are less interested in truth than ever before. So here on this program, we're going to do the job the mob and the media will never do and we will separate back from fiction for you and lay out what the law is and what it is not, and we will expose how abusively biased the media is, the double standards are, the misinformation campaign being waged against election integrity. Oh, yeah, and Delaware's voting laws far more restrictive than the new Georgia law.   We begin where Joe Biden began his lies. This bill does not end voting hours early, Joe, if you're awake, I doubt it. In fact, it creates more early voting, more days to vote, more flexibility to vote and adds another Saturday to vote and even keeps the precious ballot drop boxes that Democrats love. Here's South Carolina Senator Tim Scott pushing back against all of the left's election lies. Take a look.",

And yes you're allowed to bring food and water when you vote and yes election workers can hand it out also just not partisan organizations within 150 feet from the voting booth.   The new law also requires a voter ID or any state issued id or Social Security number to even get an absentee ballot, which is simple common sense. Should, of course, be a requirement for the preservation of the sanctity of the ballot and to ensure that Georgians and Americans have faith in their election process and that they in, the end, will have confidence in its results. And you know what else? You know think about what you need to show an ID for. Let's say you want to go visit Joe at the White House. You want to go to visit go to the White House, you need a picture ID. You want to go to the U.S. Capitol, visit the people's house, meet your congressman or congresswoman, yeah, you need a picture ID. Go to the Democratic National Convention, get on an airplane, buy a house, apply for a mortgage, buy alcohol, buy cigarettes even, buy my famous jewel pods like here.  Or if you want to apply for food stamps, apply for a job, apply for welfare programs. If you want to apply for Medicare or Medicaid, apply for unemployment. If you want to drive, buy or rent a car, purchase a gun, adopt a pet, rent a hotel room, pick up a prescription at your drugstore, donate blood, purchase some cold and allergy medicines like, oh, Allegra-D, and on and on and on. And furthermore, voter ID is overwhelmingly popular. Look at this poll from the \"A.P.\". It found a whopping percent of you the American people, you approve requiring photo IDs to vote.  But Joe Biden, the Democrats, they don't want you to know these facts. Sadly, he got caught once again playing the race card, dividing this country, is fueling nothing but vicious, divisive racial rhetoric about Jim Crow and voter suppression with zero evidence and no facts behind it.  And Biden's lies are so bad that even \"The Washington Post\" is calling him out for his lies. He got four Pinocchios for his claims about voter suppression. Now, this is the same Biden, you know, the one that said we're going to put you all back in chains and you can't go to a 7-Eleven or Dunkin Donuts unless you have a slight Indian accent, or what he said about President Obama. For the first time, you got an African-American that's clean, articulate and bright. Man, that's storybook.  And earlier today, our own Peter Doocy pressed circle back Jen Paki on the issue.

And get this, the irony, George's voting law is far, far, far less restrictive than Joe's beloved home state of Delaware. For example, Delaware has no in-person early voting. Georgia has 17 days of in-person early voting. Delaware requires specific excuses if you want to vote absentee. In Georgia, anyone can vote absentee.  In Delaware, there are no ballot drop boxes and Georgia drop boxes are still available under the new law and one box per county is required by the new law. And by the way, it's the same Joe Biden, remember he's the guy lying about Jim Crow 2.0? That's the same Joe Biden who is worried about our schools if they became integrated becoming, quote, racial jungles. That's when he partnered with the former Klansmen to stop that from happening. Joe Biden, the same person that worked with Robert KKK Byrd preventing the integration of schools and calling out black youth as predators on our streets, and said if you don't vote for him, you ain't black. Now, where was the outrage from all these pathetic woke corporations like Major League Baseball, Delta Airlines, American Airlines, Coca-Cola, on all of this? Now, 200, apparently, corporations, you want to get involved in this game? Get ready because it'll happen.   Why the hell did any of these companies get involved in the first place with no knowledge? But give Joe Biden a total pass in terms of his history. And why do they want to amplify lies about what this law is and is not, and use it as another excuse to lie smear and besmirch conservatives? Did any of these companies actually read the law? I doubt it.  And by the way, do they have any idea what it actually does? I doubt that too. Did they just surrender to the mob of the woke extremists and cancel culture? Because they are a bunch of corporate cowards who would rather demonize you, we, the American people, and spew lies and get yelled at by loud liberals on Twitter. And I have a specific message for the Commissioner Rob Manfred of the MLB. Well, why are you going to bat against what is better voter integrity in Georgia than Delaware, Joe's state, or New York, Schumer's state? Why are you taking the all-star game out of Atlanta which is going to cost Georgia and specifically Fulton County, Cobb County Democrats, yeah, a hundred million dollars in revenue? Are you really that spineless? Are you really that stupid?  Because the league apparently has no problem well, MLB, they do business in China and we're learning tonight that MLB is bolstering its ties with one of China's largest tech companies which is backed by, yep, CCP, and actually crack down on an NBA executive back in 2019 who supported the pro- democracy movement in Hong Kong.  And, by the way, can you pick up will call tickets for a baseball game, sporting event, concert if you don't have a picture ID? No, you cannot. Senator Marco Rubio had this strong message for the commissioner, saying in a statement, quote: I'm under no illusion that Major League Baseball will sacrifice business revenue on behalf of its alleged corporate values. Similarly, I'm under no illusion that you intend to resign as a member from Augusta National Golf Club. To do so would require a personal sacrifice as opposed to the woke corporate virtue signaling of moving the all-star game from Atlanta.  And why is Joe Biden not being held accountable for his role in starting and fueling the entire fire? Peter Doocy asked circle back Jen Psaki to explain that. Take a look.",

What this does is strengthen and allow more people to vote. What we've seen down here, Sean, and you've been down here. You work down here.  What we've seen since we implemented voter ID over the past 10 years, over the past four cycles, minority participation in Georgia has improved. It's gotten better by double digits. More minorities have participated in our elections over the past few cycles than ever before.  But yet, you have people like Senator Raphael Warnock and Stacey Abrams and others claiming voter suppression mainly in Democratic counties. That's the funny part about this whole thing, but what they're doing is they're actually practicing voter suppression because they're making everybody believe that it's hard to vote.

Jim Crow does not exist anywhere in this country. You don't have Bull Connor. You don't have German shepherd dogs chasing people in the streets.

They have weaponized it.  I want Joe Biden and Stacey Abrams to know one thing, I'm a black guy. I got a voter ID. I got a driver's license. It's not hard for minorities to get a photo ID because you want election integrity, Joe Biden. So what they're doing, Sean, is they're playing the race card and using the race card and weaponizing Jim Crow, it scares people. And I'll use a page from Donald Trump's playbook. We have to fight back. We have to call Joe Biden and Stacey Abrams for what they are, liars.  See this -- see this ID card, it's easy. All you do, you walk up and get one in Georgia, if you don't have one, they'll give you one.

It had nothing to do with political donations which, by the way, Publix is a huge grocery chain. It gives money to Republicans and to Democrats. So, CBS took a two-minute statement from the governor, reduced it down to a mere seconds and then took out all of the parts where DeSantis shreds the fake news narrative. Now, Publix fired back in a statement, calling the hit piece false and offensive. Furthermore, the director of the Florida Division of Emergency Management, a Democrat, also slammed the report, explaining that Publix was recommended by the Florida Department of Health as other pharmacies were not ready to begin the vaccine rollout.  And it gets even worse for \"60 Minutes\", the Democratic mayor, not Republican, the Democratic mayor of Palm Beach County, David Kerner, says \"60 Minutes\" reporting is not just based on bad information but that it is intentionally false and Kerner points out minutes refused what he offered to get the Democratic mayor's exculpatory statement that contradicted entirely that \"60 Minutes\" hit piece based on lies. And, of course, is anyone surprised that the totally corrupt partisan media mob would smear the best Republican governor in the country instead of -- oh I don't know -- covering the massive scandals surrounding New York Governor Cuomo or Murphy or, I don't know let's see Whitmer or what happened to Newsom out in California. Anyway, that March 25th order that killed all those nursing home patients and his team in New York's efforts to cover it all up to protect his image, to protect his multi-million dollar book deal, avoid scrutiny from federal investigators, \"60 Minutes\", CBS if they had any integrity at all would issue a full complete retraction and apology for their smear against Governor DeSantis. If they have any interest in covering any actual corruption and actual scandal -- well, they should head up to Albany, New York, and start asking some tough questions there. But don't hold your breath. Also developing tonight, Senate parliamentarian ruled today that Democrats can use budget reconciliation to bypass a GOP filibuster on their massive spending plans, opening up the possibility that Biden's so-called non- infrastructure infrastructure package could be passed by a simple majority, a complete total power grab. Now, the good news is the pushback against the failed political establishment in both parties is intensifying. For example, new poll, incumbent Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski trailing primary challenger Kelly Thsibaka by 15 points, following Murkowski's vote in January to convict former President Trump, and the unconstitutional impeachment sham.

I think the most troubling thing -- and I'm doing two podcasts at Gingrich 360, one tomorrow and then -- or one on Wednesday, one on Thursday, about this whole Georgia situation. The one on Thursday really grew out of our research and I came to realize that Joe Biden has a history -- going back at least to the Bork nomination under Ronald Reagan -- of smearing and lying and going after people in vicious personal ways.

And despite the obvious conflicts of interest, he says it was not a mistake to take the lucrative seat on the board of the Ukrainian company Burisma, despite his father's position as the Obama administrator's lead on Ukrainian policy at the time. Remember, he had zero experience in Ukraine, zero experience in energy, gas, oil, none whatsoever. And while there, it's plenty of evidence implying the contrary. Hunter claims he never gave Joe any money from his corrupt business dealings. Now, zero experience Hunter is also under federal investigation for a number of financial dealings which began with the FBI seizure of his laptop, from a computer repair shop owner, a guy by the name that we have interviewed, John Paul Mac Isaac.

And since you've been discussing COVID, what about the fact that the federal government have not been operational or functional since COVID began. There are a number of personnel in very important agencies like the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Defense, with strategic responsibilities, both offensive and defensive, who have security personnel who operate at the top secret level who have been at home. They have been sent home and they have been sitting there for going on a year, some of them. And they are just phoning it in once a week most of the time. You can't do it top-secret security job when you are phoning it in from home. So, what is happening to our national security? What is happening with regards to terrorists crossing the border? They will tell you that there have not been any terrorist attacks. So, that's not entirely sure. And also, there are people in terror watches that have been stopped, and at least one known very significant terrorist from Yemen. So, you know, as long as we keep having an argument about what is real and what is not real, which is kind of like an insane asylum, we are not really talking about the things that matter and why this was planned by the administration, and why they wanted such a mass influx over the border.

The real outrage in my opinion is the degree to which the D.C. mayor minimized this and called it a crime of opportunity and posted ways that people can avoid having their cars back (ph) for crying out loud.

Welcome to this breaking news edition of HANNITY. Tonight, CBSN News, \"60 Minutes\" caught red-handed spreading outrageous lies about the Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, but even Democrats now, they are out there defending him and debunking CBS's lies. We will break it all down. And we have zero -- a brand new tape, by the way, of zero experience Hunter. He's now giving interviews and giving the most bizarre, baffling, confused answers to avoid admitting ownership of the hard drive from hell. Ric Grenell will react to that. And, of course, the border catastrophe caused by Joe Biden, the one that they put a gag order on the media on and Border Patrol on. Yeah, it's getting worse tonight. We'll have exclusive reporting from our own Lara Logan. But, first, tonight, the endless hate, rage, hysteria, misinformation from Joe Biden, the media mob, Democrats, big tech, the woke corporate cowards, it's now hitting, if you can believe it new levels of derangement and psychosis because the outright lies that are being spewed about Georgia's new voting law and proposals in Texas, it exposes, just how corrupt just how bitterly partisan our major institutions are and how they become. They're like, well, Pravda, pure state-run propaganda outlets and they are less interested in truth than ever before. So here on this program, we're going to do the job the mob and the media will never do and we will separate back from fiction for you and lay out what the law is and what it is not, and we will expose how abusively biased the media is, the double standards are, the misinformation campaign being waged against election integrity. Oh, yeah, and Delaware's voting laws far more restrictive than the new Georgia law. We begin where Joe Biden began his lies. This bill does not end voting hours early, Joe, if you're awake, I doubt it. In fact, it creates more early voting, more days to vote, more flexibility to vote and adds another Saturday to vote and even keeps the precious ballot drop boxes that Democrats love. Here's South Carolina Senator Tim Scott pushing back against all of the left's election lies. Take a look."

      "utterance": "How can you have a legitimate conversation about something so sacred as a voting? How can you distort the facts so terribly that you're willing -- you're willing to bring -- to bring back the concept of a poll tax or the concept of Jim Crow? You only do that when you have nothing to stand on. Don't weaponize race in a powerful and destructive way when so many people fought and died so that I could be your senator, so I can stand here and have a conversation with you."

      "utterance": "And furthermore, instead of having two standards, two-tiered signature verification system, the bill in Georgia actually strengthens the absentee ballot process so we have the same standard for every ballot in the state of Georgia in person voting, absentee voting. And yes you're allowed to bring food and water when you vote and yes election workers can hand it out also just not partisan organizations within 150 feet from the voting booth. The new law also requires a voter ID or any state issued id or Social Security number to even get an absentee ballot, which is simple common sense. Should, of course, be a requirement for the preservation of the sanctity of the ballot and to ensure that Georgians and Americans have faith in their election process and that they in, the end, will have confidence in its results. And you know what else? You know think about what you need to show an ID for. Let's say you want to go visit Joe at the White House. You want to go to visit go to the White House, you need a picture ID. You want to go to the U.S. Capitol, visit the people's house, meet your congressman or congresswoman, yeah, you need a picture ID. Go to the Democratic National Convention, get on an airplane, buy a house, apply for a mortgage, buy alcohol, buy cigarettes even, buy my famous jewel pods like here. Or if you want to apply for food stamps, apply for a job, apply for welfare programs. If you want to apply for Medicare or Medicaid, apply for unemployment. If you want to drive, buy or rent a car, purchase a gun, adopt a pet, rent a hotel room, pick up a prescription at your drugstore, donate blood, purchase some cold and allergy medicines like, oh, Allegra-D, and on and on and on. And furthermore, voter ID is overwhelmingly popular. Look at this poll from the \"A.P.\". It found a whopping percent of you the American people, you approve requiring photo IDs to vote. But Joe Biden, the Democrats, they don't want you to know these facts. Sadly, he got caught once again playing the race card, dividing this country, is fueling nothing but vicious, divisive racial rhetoric about Jim Crow and voter suppression with zero evidence and no facts behind it. And Biden's lies are so bad that even \"The Washington Post\" is calling him out for his lies. He got four Pinocchios for his claims about voter suppression. Now, this is the same Biden, you know, the one that said we're going to put you all back in chains and you can't go to a 7-Eleven or Dunkin Donuts unless you have a slight Indian accent, or what he said about President Obama. For the first time, you got an African-American that's clean, articulate and bright. Man, that's storybook. And earlier today, our own Peter Doocy pressed circle back Jen Paki on the issue. Let's take a look."

But \"The Washington Post\" gave that claim four Pinocchios because that part of the law gives counties the option to extend voting hours.

      "utterance": "Circle back propaganda Psaki -- he got caught red-handed, Joe got caught red-handed. They're lying. And get this, the irony, George's voting law is far, far, far less restrictive than Joe's beloved home state of Delaware. For example, Delaware has no in-person early voting. Georgia has 17 days of in-person early voting. Delaware requires specific excuses if you want to vote absentee. In Georgia, anyone can vote absentee. In Delaware, there are no ballot drop boxes and Georgia drop boxes are still available under the new law and one box per county is required by the new law. And by the way, it's the same Joe Biden, remember he's the guy lying about Jim Crow 2.0? That's the same Joe Biden who is worried about our schools if they became integrated becoming, quote, racial jungles. That's when he partnered with the former Klansmen to stop that from happening. Joe Biden, the same person that worked with Robert KKK Byrd preventing the integration of schools and calling out black youth as predators on our streets, and said if you don't vote for him, you ain't black. Now, where was the outrage from all these pathetic woke corporations like Major League Baseball, Delta Airlines, American Airlines, Coca-Cola, on all of this? Now, 200, apparently, corporations, you want to get involved in this game? Get ready because it'll happen. Why the hell did any of these companies get involved in the first place with no knowledge? But give Joe Biden a total pass in terms of his history. And why do they want to amplify lies about what this law is and is not, and use it as another excuse to lie smear and besmirch conservatives? Did any of these companies actually read the law? I doubt it. And by the way, do they have any idea what it actually does? I doubt that too. Did they just surrender to the mob of the woke extremists and cancel culture? Because they are a bunch of corporate cowards who would rather demonize you, we, the American people, and spew lies and get yelled at by loud liberals on Twitter. And I have a specific message for the Commissioner Rob Manfred of the MLB. Well, why are you going to bat against what is better voter integrity in Georgia than Delaware, Joe's state, or New York, Schumer's state? Why are you taking the all-star game out of Atlanta which is going to cost Georgia and specifically Fulton County, Cobb County Democrats, yeah, a hundred million dollars in revenue? Are you really that spineless? Are you really that stupid? Because the league apparently has no problem well, MLB, they do business in China and we're learning tonight that MLB is bolstering its ties with one of China's largest tech companies which is backed by, yep, CCP, and actually crack down on an NBA executive back in 2019 who supported the pro- democracy movement in Hong Kong. And, by the way, can you pick up will call tickets for a baseball game, sporting event, concert if you don't have a picture ID? No, you cannot."

Similarly, I'm under no illusion that you intend to resign as a member from Augusta National Golf Club. To do so would require a personal sacrifice as opposed to the woke corporate virtue signaling of moving the all-star game from Atlanta.

There's nothing controversial about wanting free and fair elections. There's definitely nothing controversial about showing an ID to vote unless of course you want to cheat. So why have major corporations chosen to sell out and surrender to the Democrats lies a misinformation campaign? Are these companies now, will they be as principled and outspoken against those '22 Winter Olympics in Beijing? Are they going to be sponsoring those Olympics in China? And will Joe ask the Olympics be to be moved to another country? It's bad business. It's pathetic virtue signaling it's a massive hypocrisy and double standard and we will continue to expose it here on this program. Here with reaction, Republican congressman from Georgia, Doug Collins. FOX News contributor, civil rights attorney, Leo 2.0 Terrell. Sir, Doug, we'll start with you. This is Georgia. I don't know, I've read the law in Delaware, Joe's home state. I read the new law in Georgia, and, boy, it seems like Georgia is far more liberal, if you will, in allowing voting and encouraging voting for everybody. I don't see those same things in Joe's home state, do you?"

What this does is strengthen and allow more people to vote. What we've seen down here, Sean, and you've been down here. You work down here. What we've seen since we implemented voter ID over the past 10 years, over the past four cycles, minority participation in Georgia has improved. It's gotten better by double digits. More minorities have participated in our elections over the past few cycles than ever before. But yet, you have people like Senator Raphael Warnock and Stacey Abrams and others claiming voter suppression mainly in Democratic counties. That's the funny part about this whole thing, but what they're doing is they're actually practicing voter suppression because they're making everybody believe that it's hard to vote. And the truism is, it's not hard to vote. You just got to want to vote, and Georgia's law strengthens that and makes it secure."

My question is he's comparing this to Jim Crow. You've examined the law and you've been a civil rights attorney for decades. You tell me, which state has better laws and is Joe, does he now have a moral obligation, does Major League Baseball have an obligation, does corporate America have an obligation to pull out of the 2022 Beijing Olympics?"

Sean, they have weaponized the term Jim Crow. I want people to know this as a civil rights attorney -- Joe Biden has lied to the American public. Jim Crow does not exist in Georgia. Jim Crow does not exist anywhere in this country. You don't have Bull Connor. You don't have German shepherd dogs chasing people in the streets. And what Joe Biden has done, he has devalued the civil rights movement by calling the Georgia law which is much more expansive than Delaware, which is much more expansive than New York, calling the Georgia law Jim Crow on steroids. They have weaponized it. I want Joe Biden and Stacey Abrams to know one thing, I'm a black guy. I got a voter ID. I got a driver's license. It's not hard for minorities to get a photo ID because you want election integrity, Joe Biden. So what they're doing, Sean, is they're playing the race card and using the race card and weaponizing Jim Crow, it scares people. And I'll use a page from Donald Trump's playbook. We have to fight back. We have to call Joe Biden and Stacey Abrams for what they are, liars. See this -- see this ID card, it's easy. All you do, you walk up and get one in Georgia, if you don't have one, they'll give you one. So, Joe Biden owes this nation an apology for devaluing those people who really went through hell during the civil rights movement in the '50s and '60s."

When you're looking at that and then you act surprised when the Major League Baseball pulls out the all-star game, when you act surprised that people are doing this when you're the one costing jobs, Stacey Abrams, Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff are disasters for Georgia because they buy into this lie that that people are too ignorant to know how to vote. Leo hit it perfectly. It is easier to vote. You can get the ID, you can go do that. So, yes, we're looking at what we can do down here and we're going to continue to fight because this is wrong. I'm tired of my state being used by a senator who doesn't understand he's supposed to fight for us. And when it's the truth, it's easy to fight for us, Raphael Warnock, quit spreading the lies."

It's unconstitutional. It would mean no voter ID anywhere in the country, more massive mail-in voting, felons voting, more ballot harvesting, create a perfect storm of election chaos. Nobody will ever have confidence in any results. This is at the same time Republicans are standing strong, standing with their base and standing up to the media mob and just like Florida Governor Ron DeSantis last night, now totally smeared with a totally false out of context purposely so dishonest hit piece by the hard-hitting news magazine \"60 Minutes\" of left-wing propaganda. Now, get this -- they completely edited out his answer about vaccine distribution in Florida to push what are false claims about a plate of pay scheme with the grocery store that helped inoculate the people in Florida.

It had nothing to do with political donations which, by the way, Publix is a huge grocery chain. It gives money to Republicans and to Democrats. So, CBS took a two-minute statement from the governor, reduced it down to a mere seconds and then took out all of the parts where DeSantis shreds the fake news narrative. Now, Publix fired back in a statement, calling the hit piece false and offensive. Furthermore, the director of the Florida Division of Emergency Management, a Democrat, also slammed the report, explaining that Publix was recommended by the Florida Department of Health as other pharmacies were not ready to begin the vaccine rollout. And it gets even worse for \"60 Minutes\", the Democratic mayor, not Republican, the Democratic mayor of Palm Beach County, David Kerner, says \"60 Minutes\" reporting is not just based on bad information but that it is intentionally false and Kerner points out minutes refused what he offered to get the Democratic mayor's exculpatory statement that contradicted entirely that \"60 Minutes\" hit piece based on lies. And, of course, is anyone surprised that the totally corrupt partisan media mob would smear the best Republican governor in the country instead of -- oh I don't know -- covering the massive scandals surrounding New York Governor Cuomo or Murphy or, I don't know let's see Whitmer or what happened to Newsom out in California. Anyway, that March 25th order that killed all those nursing home patients and his team in New York's efforts to cover it all up to protect his image, to protect his multi-million dollar book deal, avoid scrutiny from federal investigators, \"60 Minutes\", CBS if they had any integrity at all would issue a full complete retraction and apology for their smear against Governor DeSantis. If they have any interest in covering any actual corruption and actual scandal -- well, they should head up to Albany, New York, and start asking some tough questions there. But don't hold your breath. Also developing tonight, Senate parliamentarian ruled today that Democrats can use budget reconciliation to bypass a GOP filibuster on their massive spending plans, opening up the possibility that Biden's so-called non- infrastructure infrastructure package could be passed by a simple majority, a complete total power grab. Now, the good news is the pushback against the failed political establishment in both parties is intensifying. For example, new poll, incumbent Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski trailing primary challenger Kelly Thsibaka by 15 points, following Murkowski's vote in January to convict former President Trump, and the unconstitutional impeachment sham. Here with reaction to all of it, former speaker of the House, FOX News contributor, Newt Gingrich.

As DeSantis continues to emerge as one of the best governors in the country, he'll get more of this treatment. But the American public's pretty smart and they see through all that when \"Time\" had me as scrooge with tiny Tim's broken crutch on the cover of \"Time\", what that actually signaled to our voters was, oh, Gingrich is for welfare reform. So that part doesn't bother me. I think the most troubling thing -- and I'm doing two podcasts at Gingrich 360, one tomorrow and then -- or one on Wednesday, one on Thursday, about this whole Georgia situation. The one on Thursday really grew out of our research and I came to realize that Joe Biden has a history -- going back at least to the Bork nomination under Ronald Reagan -- of smearing and lying and going after people in vicious personal ways. Again with Clarence Thomas in the Bush administration, and now, of course, with this most recent thing, where -- when you're a liberal Democrat and \"The Washington Post\" gives you four Pinocchios because you lied so thoroughly and then two nights later he goes on ESPN and he lies again. And it's really an amazing story about sort of a lynch mob attitude trying to attack Georgia when, in fact, the Georgia bill is more open, more reforms longer voting hours. The things set about are just plain lies. For example, you wouldn't be able to give people water that's just not true. The bill says that the poll officials can you give you water --"

And despite the obvious conflicts of interest, he says it was not a mistake to take the lucrative seat on the board of the Ukrainian company Burisma, despite his father's position as the Obama administrator's lead on Ukrainian policy at the time.

But, Sean, this is a game in Washington that the rest of us outside of Washington see and are sick and tired of watching. Hunter Biden, I want to read this to you. He said, not one serious journalist could ever come to the conclusion that I did anything wrong. Now, this is the game that they play. He pretends like nobody has fingered him for any wrongdoing. But yet, we know that he lied on his gun application. We know that. These are facts. And yet no reporter pushes back on him in Washington, D.C. It's this game of circle and we've got to come to the end of this. Somebody's got to push back in Washington and hold Hunter Biden to account. We know he's lying."

Yeah, if the last name was Trump on this, my gosh, there is more here to condemn Hunter Biden and at least invite response from the administration more so than there ever was with the witch hunt that was the Russian collusion. I mean, lying on the 44-73, you and I would be sitting in a jail cell pain a five-year fine with a 10-year sentence, Sean, and you know that. Rick would, too. We would all be sitting in jail if we did what he did. He was an addict. He was an addict when he was filling out the form. He was an addict when he -- apparently, his gun, Hallie Biden stole his gun and deposited it, and this very nice gourmet grocery store right across the street from the school, which is according to apparently a current law in that state, considered a class B misdemeanor for the manner in which it was deposited. But, Sean, the bigger thing is this is right and privilege. My gosh, for all of the discussion on white privilege or privilege, period, there is no privilege, Sean, like progressive privilege. There's no privilege like that Biden privilege. You can snort parmesan cheese out of your shag carpet and lose a computer and sign a drop slip for it, and still be taken seriously when you say, I don't know, that may have been mine. You can lie on a 44-73 and yet you can still then come out with a book right after your dad gets into the White House and go on a rehabilitation tour for your public image. It's a Biden privilege."

What we're doing is we are having an argument about what you are actually seeing with your eyes and hearing about is real or not real, whether it is a crisis or not a crisis, whether it was created by Joe Biden's administration or not created by them, instead of having a conversation about this very significant national security implications of having such a wide open border. And since you've been discussing COVID, what about the fact that the federal government have not been operational or functional since COVID began. There are a number of personnel in very important agencies like the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Defense, with strategic responsibilities, both offensive and defensive, who have security personnel who operate at the top secret level who have been at home. They have been sent home and they have been sitting there for going on a year, some of them. And they are just phoning it in once a week most of the time. You can't do it top-secret security job when you are phoning it in from home. So, what is happening to our national security? What is happening with regards to terrorists crossing the border? They will tell you that there have not been any terrorist attacks. So, that's not entirely sure. And also, there are people in terror watches that have been stopped, and at least one known very significant terrorist from Yemen. So, you know, as long as we keep having an argument about what is real and what is not real, which is kind of like an insane asylum, we are not really talking about the things that matter and why this was planned by the administration, and why they wanted such a mass influx over the border. You can't be concerned about COVID and have an open border like this. Those two things are mutually exclusive."

He's an Uber Eats driver, immigrant from Pakistan. Now, D.C. prosecutors reportedly planning on offering the 13 and 15-year- old suspects a plea deal that will allow them to be convicted as juveniles, which would mean they can't be jailed past the age of 21. And despite the charge of a felony murder, carjacking, armed robbery, the two could be released far earlier if they are deemed, quote, \"rehabilitated.\" Here with reaction, FOX News legal analyst, Gregg Jarrett, nationally syndicated radio talk show host, Larry Elder.

      "utterance": "Well, Sean, if you look at the D.C. laws, it is awfully difficult to see what kind of latitude the prosecution even had. If you're a 13-year-old, even if you kill somebody, you cannot be prosecuted as an adult. If you are a 15-year- old, you can only be prosecuted as an adult if the judge allows it. And the judge will only allow it if there is, quote, no prospect of rehabilitation at the juvenile court level. The real outrage in my opinion is the degree to which the D.C. mayor minimized this and called it a crime of opportunity and posted ways that people can avoid having their cars back (ph) for crying out loud. And CNN referred to this as an accident. And, finally, Sean, one wonders whether or not the 15-year-old would have got this soft deal, the 15-year-old had been a male instead of a female. But I don't think the prosecutor had a whole lot of latitude right here unfortunately because of the way the laws written."
