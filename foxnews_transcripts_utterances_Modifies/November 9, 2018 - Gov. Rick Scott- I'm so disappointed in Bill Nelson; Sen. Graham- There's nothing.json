Welcome to the special edition of \"Hannity.\" A crisis is brewing on Southern Florida tonight, days after Republican Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis secured victories in each of their statewide races. Thousands of new ballots magically appearing seemingly out of thin air, all in deep blue Democratic districts only. And since election night, over 15,000 new votes have been unearthed in Palm Beach County. Tens and tens of thousands more mysteriously discovered in Broward County, all in violation of Florida law.  And now, the state is bracing for recounts in both the Senate and the governor's races. Rick Scott, the governor, the senator-elect, will join us in a moment. He's alleging that rampant fraud is at play.  And now, Broward County supervisor of elections Brenda Snipes is facing serious claims of election malfeasance. We'll have a full report on her and reveal her shady past tonight.  Plus, we'll have the latest news out of the razor tight Senate race in Arizona. And we'll call out conspiracy TV, MSNBC's chief election night anchor after public promoting far left anti-Trump protests organized by the radical group MoveOn.org. We'll also show you how President Trump is responding to crazy Jim Acosta's latest unprofessional behavior.  All right. Sit tight, buckle up, it's Friday night. Time for our breaking news opening monologue.",

Thousands of uncounted ballots, they're just turning up in Broward County and Palm Beach Counties only. In other words, only Democratic votes. These 15,000 votes were mysteriously found in Palm Beach County. And in Broward, it is far worse.   On election night, the county reported roughly 634,000 votes, which they are supposed to do. Two days later, Thursday morning, that number somehow got move up to 695,000. Then later in the day, over 10,000 more votes just magically turned up. Several thousand more votes were just located hours later. And it continues on and on from there, magically just keep going up, up, up. Florida state law states, quote: the canvassing board shall report all early voting, all tabulated vote by mail results to the Department of State within 30 minutes after the polls close. The law continues, quote, the canvassing board shall report with the exception of provisional ballot results updated precinct election results at the department, at least every 45 minutes until all results are completely reported. Now, Florida has 67 counties, 65 of those counties complied fully with the law on election night, including, by the way, the hurricane ravaged areas in the Panhandle.   As of today, we have no idea where these votes were coming from. Why were they missing for several days? Where have they been? Why was Florida and federal election laws obviously violated? They didn't pay attention to any of them. We didn't even know how many votes were left. We don't know now exactly.  Governor Rick Scott is sounding the alarm, rightly so, along with Marco Rubio. Take a look.",

It has opened the door for lawyers to come here and try and steal a seat in the United States Senate and Florida cabinet.  Now, Senator Rubio's warning must not be taken lightly. It's getting worse by the hour. Tonight, we're facing a serious issue, a chain of custody issue with Broward County because, oh, they found 83,000 votes after the initial election night canvass? Here we are 72 hours later?  Those votes, at this point, can't be trusted. There is tight control now over voter access, security, and custody, because these votes cannot be traced to the actual voter. The time, the location, the law compels the state to dispose of these ballots. In other words, we have no documented way to know in any way if, in fact, these ballots are legitimate or where they are coming from. This means, you know, some kind of malfeasance -- by the way, nothing new from Broward County or Palm Beach County. Now, the supervisor of elections there, her name is Brenda Snipes, we'll have a full report on her later. She has a long history of misconduct. In August, a judge ruled that Snipes systematically mishandled mail-in absentee ballots. And in 2016, a court found that Broward County broke both state and federal laws by illicitly destroying ballots.  But Brenda Snipes wants Floridians to think that their votes are in good hands. Why couldn't she do what the other 65 counties in Florida did? And that is, obey the law. Take a look.",

She's obviously not respecting the laws of Florida or, of course, country. It's been proven over and over again. No one will ever know the true validity of this vote. Now, it's impossible.   And today, rightfully, angry Floridians were gathering outside of the Broward County election office demanding answers. And just breaking, hours ago, a judge ruling Broward County violated the constitution of Florida. They didn't follow the open records laws, and demanded that election officials hand over important details about the newly discovered ballots. The judge also made no ruling yet on the claims of corruption and the legal fight is far from over tonight.  And also tonight, we still have more questions than answers.

We need them in Broward County, and Palm Beach County. And, of course, nothing new from the cheating Democratic Party. Just think about this. It's really just a page out of Hillary Clinton's playbook on how to rig or steal an election. Remember, when she fixed the DNC super delegates against Bernie Sanders and more? Remember, Donna Brazile admitted to such, had to make that uncomfortable call to Bernie Sanders and made it impossible for him to ever win. It was all rigged.  Remember when the Clinton campaign before the general election in 2016 -- oh, yes, Marc Elias, the attorney for Clinton, the attorney now leading Democratic cause down in Broward County. Well, don't forget, he's the guy that used Clinton campaign money. They went into a law firm, Perkins Coie. They funneled the money to Fusion GPS.  It wasn't about legal bills. It was about creating a dirty dossier full of lies about Donald Trump, by the way, throughout the highest levels of government and then sending that information out to the American people. Why? To malign the candidate Donald Trump. Why? So they will get extra votes. Why? To cheat in an election.  Don't forget, that information was disseminated by the top levels of government. It's practically at this point the Democratic motto, when you can't beat them, just cheat them. We'll have more throughout this show. Governor Rick Scott will join us in a few moments.   We'll also have an important update on Arizona. We'll tell you more about who Brenda Snipes really is.  Now, the Senate race between McSally and Sinema, that's too close to call, but a deal now has been worked out a few hours ago regarding many of the contested ballots. We'll have an update on that coming up. But first, let's turn to the developing story about a pretty obvious partnership between NBC News and the controversial far left group known as MoveOn.org. Remember on Wednesday, MSNBC's chief conspiracy theorist, who refers to herself as a journalist, an election night anchor over at NBC, Rachel Maddow, urging her supporters to take part in nationwide anti-Trump protests, tweeting: It's happening. This is the break, in case of an emergency plan to protect the Mueller investigation. 5:00 p.m. local time, protest tomorrow, Thursday, November 8. We knew this would happen at some point. The day has arrived.   And then Maddow also tweeted out a list of the protest locations, and last night, many far left Trump haters answered the call and participated in the left's break the glass of urgency moment that they call it. Anyway, these protests took place in 60 cities organized by MoveOn.org. So, NBC has aligned themselves now with MoveOn.org, the same group that referred to General Petraeus, an American hero, as general betray us, during his successful surge efforts in Iraq. It's the same group that compare President Bush to Hitler, in an ad that was condemned by the ADL. It's the same group that accused John McCain of wanting to send everyone's children to war.   And MoveOn.org also partnered with activist Linda Sarsour during the women's march. A known anti-Semite, and Move On funded and promoted the 2016 Chicago protests outside of a Trump rally. That's the one that became violent. It forced the campaign to cancel the event.  And tonight, there you have their big star over at NBC News, election night coverage host Rachel Maddow denying organizing the anti-Trump protest with Move On? Well, we just saw the tweets. She's claiming she's merely reporting. No, she's telling people, this is the time, the break the glass moment. So, give us a break. If reporting that something is happening is the same thing as organizing it, I'm happy to take credit for organizing the new Trump family patent on what, you know, Chinese, whatever. Anyway, the resignation of, what, Spiro Agnew, that was a tough one but I'm a diligent organizer.  It's total B.S. It's a total lie. It's a total con job, just like the lie that she claims to be a journalist. That statement is a lie. Of course, we all know Maddow isn't a reporter. She's not a journalist, even though her network trots her out to be their anchor on election night. She's a Mueller-obsessed anti-Trump conspiracy theorist who's constantly and wrongly predicting Trump's eminent demise. Any second now, it's going to happen.  Of course, all part of Russia collusion and the witch hunt, with no evidence, but ignores all the evidence we have about Hillary and her bought and paid for Russian lies that, of course, was used to commit fraud on a FISA court four times, used to misinform the American people before the 2016 election, used as part of a media leak strategy to get Robert Mueller appointed, part of the insurance policy.  She's whipping her followers into a frenzy. Sadly, with Mueller's probe seemingly coming to a close -- well, I guess they are about to be in for a whole lot of disappointment.  So, of course, now, we have MSNBC, and their new partners, MoveOn.org, and you've got CNN, fake news, foaming at the mouth over Sessions' departure. Many even claiming that the Acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker is going to derail the Mueller investigation. The president said yesterday that's not happening. And while Democrats are fueling more baseless Russia hysteria, more conspiracy theories, President Trump fired back today. When asked if he wants Whitaker to rein in the special council, here's what he had to say.",

It's going to play out and when it does, President Trump will be able to move on, if you will, to use a phrase, unencumbered by conspiracy theories aimed to delegitimizing his presidency, although, I got to warn you, they're just going to create new ones. They'll be created by Maxine Waters, Jerrold Nadler, Adam Schiff and company, and Nancy Pelosi.  Finally, tonight, before we go, we have an update from the ongoing Jim Acosta saga. As you know, earlier this week, he acted in a completely unprofessional, combative way, even making contact with a White House intern. As you can see there, she's trying to say your questions are over. The president told you to sit down. How many times does a president have to say enough, enough, enough, enough? Just rude. Another example of his egregious, you know, self-serving narcissistic behavior and now, his White House pass, sadly, has been revoked. And Jim's boss, fake news CNN head, is now standing behind his embattled Trump hater spewing some Trump hate on their own, writing in a statement, quote: The president's ongoing attacks on the press have gone too far. They are not only dangerous, they are disturbingly un-American. And earlier today, President Trump responded to the attack against him and Acosta's terrible conduct against him. Let's listen in.",

But look, you know, she's speaking her mind. If people thought she was not a political person, obviously, this abuses them of that notion. But I would also suggest that she's also very angry at the wrong person. Not the Clinton campaign in particular but Sidney Blumenthal is the one who created this in a way for the 2008 campaign. Of course, the Hillary adviser, he had worked in the Clinton White House and was with the Clinton Foundation. And he went to McClatchy news service bringing this up, about this argument which, of course, most of us found absurd that he was not born in this country. So, she also should just actually never forgive Sidney Blumenthal. But beyond that, it's also interesting, though, that her husband, and I'll remind you, in this exchange, she, of course, made it personal about him. The president talked about the military. He talked about their impact on something for this country. But her husband, then, during his term, accused Donald Trump and his rhetoric of helping ISIS do its job. So there is the man that he is accusing of being complicit in mass murder and terrorism and I think that maybe there would be a worry about the impact on Barron Trump, a boy at the time, but that seems to not be a concern here.",

Welcome to the special edition of \"Hannity.\" A crisis is brewing on Southern Florida tonight, days after Republican Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis secured victories in each of their statewide races. Thousands of new ballots magically appearing seemingly out of thin air, all in deep blue Democratic districts only. And since election night, over 15,000 new votes have been unearthed in Palm Beach County. Tens and tens of thousands more mysteriously discovered in Broward County, all in violation of Florida law. And now, the state is bracing for recounts in both the Senate and the governor's races. Rick Scott, the governor, the senator-elect, will join us in a moment. He's alleging that rampant fraud is at play. And now, Broward County supervisor of elections Brenda Snipes is facing serious claims of election malfeasance. We'll have a full report on her and reveal her shady past tonight. Plus, we'll have the latest news out of the razor tight Senate race in Arizona. And we'll call out conspiracy TV, MSNBC's chief election night anchor after public promoting far left anti-Trump protests organized by the radical group MoveOn.org. We'll also show you how President Trump is responding to crazy Jim Acosta's latest unprofessional behavior. All right. Sit tight, buckle up, it's Friday night.

Thousands of uncounted ballots, they're just turning up in Broward County and Palm Beach Counties only. In other words, only Democratic votes. These 15,000 votes were mysteriously found in Palm Beach County. And in Broward, it is far worse. On election night, the county reported roughly 634,000 votes, which they are supposed to do. Two days later, Thursday morning, that number somehow got move up to 695,000. Then later in the day, over 10,000 more votes just magically turned up. Several thousand more votes were just located hours later. And it continues on and on from there, magically just keep going up, up, up."

Now, Florida has 67 counties, 65 of those counties complied fully with the law on election night, including, by the way, the hurricane ravaged areas in the Panhandle. As of today, we have no idea where these votes were coming from. Why were they missing for several days? Where have they been? Why was Florida and federal election laws obviously violated? They didn't pay attention to any of them. We didn't even know how many votes were left. We don't know now exactly. Governor Rick Scott is sounding the alarm, rightly so, along with Marco Rubio.

It has opened the door for lawyers to come here and try and steal a seat in the United States Senate and Florida cabinet. Now, Senator Rubio's warning must not be taken lightly. It's getting worse by the hour. Tonight, we're facing a serious issue, a chain of custody issue with Broward County because, oh, they found 83,000 votes after the initial election night canvass? Here we are 72 hours later? Those votes, at this point, can't be trusted. There is tight control now over voter access, security, and custody, because these votes cannot be traced to the actual voter. The time, the location, the law compels the state to dispose of these ballots. In other words, we have no documented way to know in any way if, in fact, these ballots are legitimate or where they are coming from. This means, you know, some kind of malfeasance -- by the way, nothing new from Broward County or Palm Beach County. Now, the supervisor of elections there, her name is Brenda Snipes, we'll have a full report on her later. She has a long history of misconduct. In August, a judge ruled that Snipes systematically mishandled mail-in absentee ballots. And in 2016, a court found that Broward County broke both state and federal laws by illicitly destroying ballots. But Brenda Snipes wants Floridians to think that their votes are in good hands. Why couldn't she do what the other 65 counties in Florida did? And that is, obey the law. Take a look."

She's obviously not respecting the laws of Florida or, of course, country. It's been proven over and over again. No one will ever know the true validity of this vote. Now, it's impossible. And today, rightfully, angry Floridians were gathering outside of the Broward County election office demanding answers. And just breaking, hours ago, a judge ruling Broward County violated the constitution of Florida. They didn't follow the open records laws, and demanded that election officials hand over important details about the newly discovered ballots. The judge also made no ruling yet on the claims of corruption and the legal fight is far from over tonight. And also tonight, we still have more questions than answers. Earlier today, here's what President Trump had to say about this dubious situation in Florida, which, by the way, this has gone on for years which we'll tell you about in a minute. Take a look."

It's really just a page out of Hillary Clinton's playbook on how to rig or steal an election. Remember, when she fixed the DNC super delegates against Bernie Sanders and more? Remember, Donna Brazile admitted to such, had to make that uncomfortable call to Bernie Sanders and made it impossible for him to ever win. It was all rigged. Remember when the Clinton campaign before the general election in 2016 -- oh, yes, Marc Elias, the attorney for Clinton, the attorney now leading Democratic cause down in Broward County. Well, don't forget, he's the guy that used Clinton campaign money. They went into a law firm, Perkins Coie. They funneled the money to Fusion GPS. It wasn't about legal bills. It was about creating a dirty dossier full of lies about Donald Trump, by the way, throughout the highest levels of government and then sending that information out to the American people. Why? To malign the candidate Donald Trump. Why? So they will get extra votes. Why? To cheat in an election. Don't forget, that information was disseminated by the top levels of government. It's practically at this point the Democratic motto, when you can't beat them, just cheat them. We'll have more throughout this show. Governor Rick Scott will join us in a few moments. We'll also have an important update on Arizona. We'll tell you more about who Brenda Snipes really is. Now, the Senate race between McSally and Sinema, that's too close to call, but a deal now has been worked out a few hours ago regarding many of the contested ballots. We'll have an update on that coming up. But first, let's turn to the developing story about a pretty obvious partnership between NBC News and the controversial far left group known as MoveOn.org."

    {
      "speaker": "Remember on Wednesday, MSNBC's chief conspiracy theorist, who refers to herself as a journalist, an election night anchor over at NBC, Rachel Maddow, urging her supporters to take part in nationwide anti-Trump protests, tweeting",
      "utterance": "It's happening. This is the break, in case of an emergency plan to protect the Mueller investigation. 5:00 p.m. local time, protest tomorrow, Thursday, November 8. We knew this would happen at some point. The day has arrived. And then Maddow also tweeted out a list of the protest locations, and last night, many far left Trump haters answered the call and participated in the left's break the glass of urgency moment that they call it. Anyway, these protests took place in 60 cities organized by MoveOn.org. So, NBC has aligned themselves now with MoveOn.org, the same group that referred to General Petraeus, an American hero, as general betray us, during his successful surge efforts in Iraq. It's the same group that compare President Bush to Hitler, in an ad that was condemned by the ADL. It's the same group that accused John McCain of wanting to send everyone's children to war. And MoveOn.org also partnered with activist Linda Sarsour during the women's march. A known anti-Semite, and Move On funded and promoted the 2016 Chicago protests outside of a Trump rally. That's the one that became violent. It forced the campaign to cancel the event. And tonight, there you have their big star over at NBC News, election night coverage host Rachel Maddow denying organizing the anti-Trump protest with Move On? Well, we just saw the tweets. She's claiming she's merely reporting. No, she's telling people, this is the time, the break the glass moment. So, give us a break. If reporting that something is happening is the same thing as organizing it, I'm happy to take credit for organizing the new Trump family patent on what, you know, Chinese, whatever. Anyway, the resignation of, what, Spiro Agnew, that was a tough one but I'm a diligent organizer. It's total B.S. It's a total lie. It's a total con job, just like the lie that she claims to be a journalist. That statement is a lie. Of course, we all know Maddow isn't a reporter. She's not a journalist, even though her network trots her out to be their anchor on election night. She's a Mueller-obsessed anti-Trump conspiracy theorist who's constantly and wrongly predicting Trump's eminent demise. Any second now, it's going to happen. Of course, all part of Russia collusion and the witch hunt, with no evidence, but ignores all the evidence we have about Hillary and her bought and paid for Russian lies that, of course, was used to commit fraud on a FISA court four times, used to misinform the American people before the 2016 election, used as part of a media leak strategy to get Robert Mueller appointed, part of the insurance policy. She's whipping her followers into a frenzy. Sadly, with Mueller's probe seemingly coming to a close -- well, I guess they are about to be in for a whole lot of disappointment. So, of course, now, we have MSNBC, and their new partners, MoveOn.org, and you've got CNN, fake news, foaming at the mouth over Sessions' departure. Many even claiming that the Acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker is going to derail the Mueller investigation. The president said yesterday that's not happening. And while Democrats are fueling more baseless Russia hysteria, more conspiracy theories, President Trump fired back today. When asked if he wants Whitaker to rein in the special council, here's what he had to say."

And he wrote in 2016, Hillary, yes, she's lucky she wasn't indicted. But in no way is anyone talking about meddling with the Mueller witch-hunt. It's going to play out and when it does, President Trump will be able to move on, if you will, to use a phrase, unencumbered by conspiracy theories aimed to delegitimizing his presidency, although, I got to warn you, they're just going to create new ones. They'll be created by Maxine Waters, Jerrold Nadler, Adam Schiff and company, and Nancy Pelosi. Finally, tonight, before we go, we have an update from the ongoing Jim Acosta saga. As you know, earlier this week, he acted in a completely unprofessional, combative way, even making contact with a White House intern. As you can see there, she's trying to say your questions are over. The president told you to sit down. How many times does a president have to say enough, enough, enough, enough? Just rude. Another example of his egregious, you know, self-serving narcissistic behavior and now, his White House pass, sadly, has been revoked."

When you're in the White House, this is a very sacred place to me. This is a very special place. You have to treat the White House with respect. You have to treat the presidency with respect.

Criticism, by the way, is not an attack on the First Amendment. And, by the way, had they acted respectfully, he would still be in there.

We won that lawsuit today. So we're looking forward to getting that information. We are -- you know, we've hired the right lawyers. We have Gibson Dunn, who won -- argued the case with Bush versus Gore successfully. Their lawyers, Bill Nelson's lawyers who is trying to steal this election, he -- they went to federal court today trying to get the certification postponed. They were not able to do that. So, basically tomorrow, my win will be certified by the court subject to a recount, assuming I'll be less than the 40,000-some votes needed for -- to do a recount. And then we'll just keep going. They're going to -- I mean, it looks like they are going to do everything they can to steal this election. I'm so disappointed in Bill Nelson, a career politician who's been there forever, and all he's doing now is he's hired Hillary Clinton's lawyer to say, and his lawyer said it, I'm here -- I'm here to win this election.

They should have gone in there and shut this place down because again, they are just violating laws left and right, which she's been found to do.

I'll never forgive him for what he did to our United States military by not funding it properly. It was depleted. Everything was old and tired. And I came in and I had to fix it and I'm in the process of spending tremendous amounts of money, so I'll never forgive him for who he did to our military. I'll never forgive him for what he did in many other ways, which I'll talk to you about in the future."

      "speaker": "BRUCE",
      "utterance": "You know, considering the environment that we've got, right? You would think that she would think twice about the nature of that kind of rhetoric. But look, you know, she's speaking her mind. If people thought she was not a political person, obviously, this abuses them of that notion. But I would also suggest that she's also very angry at the wrong person. Not the Clinton campaign in particular but Sidney Blumenthal is the one who created this in a way for the 2008 campaign. Of course, the Hillary adviser, he had worked in the Clinton White House and was with the Clinton Foundation. And he went to McClatchy news service bringing this up, about this argument which, of course, most of us found absurd that he was not born in this country. So, she also should just actually never forgive Sidney Blumenthal. But beyond that, it's also interesting, though, that her husband, and I'll remind you, in this exchange, she, of course, made it personal about him. The president talked about the military. He talked about their impact on something for this country. But her husband, then, during his term, accused Donald Trump and his rhetoric of helping ISIS do its job. So there is the man that he is accusing of being complicit in mass murder and terrorism and I think that maybe there would be a worry about the impact on Barron Trump, a boy at the time, but that seems to not be a concern here."

This is the same Michelle who came from Chicago, who went to Princeton, who went to the White House. She's one of the most well-known women in the world. She's a globe traveler and multimillionaire. And yes, she made that statement in 2009 for the first time in my adult life I'm now proud of my country. Where else in the world could you achieve so much? Only in America."

Poverty, no jobs, the future gone, all their money was gone, no money in their pocketbook. Doctors are gone. Hospitals are gone."

President Trump is putting America first. He's remembering the forgotten men and women, you just mentioned a number of startling accomplishments that we have recognized under this president because of tax cuts and roll back of regulations and it's about America first. We are open for business."
