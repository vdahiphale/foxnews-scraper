No divergent ideas are allowed and sometimes they are pretty viciously intolerant of any political differences then and end up watching deeply personal and destructive attacks against anyone who violates their orthodoxy. Most recently, someone like a Kanye West or Justice Brett Kavanaugh. They felt their scorn. Tonight, as we barrel toward the midterms, we will reveal the latest attacks and the possible political fallout. Tucker Carlson, Raymond Arroyo, Corey Lewandowski and Howie Kurtz all here and many more.  But first, the odious Kanye West pilon (ph). The outrageous attacks on Kanye West continue as the left pulls its hair out over this meeting that Kanye had yesterday with President Trump. Now check this out, MSNBC guest Michael Eric Dyson, you have seen him a lot on cable news. He pretty much called Kanye just too stupid to talk to the president on any issues regarding race and trying to give the president cover on what he really is, I guess, just a white nationalist.

I just have to go back to what Michael Eric Dyson said, white supremacy by ventriloquism.  Now, to me when hear that, Leo, I mean, just set aside politics. If a conservative said that about an African-American celebrity who was liberal, who was showing up with Obama or Clinton or anyone on the left for that matter, there would be hell to pay.  But because Kanye is in the oval with the president, it is okay to call it a minstrel show, call him stupid, call him insane. And now, he is just a dummy with Donald Trump operating his dummy body.

Most recently, someone like a Kanye West or Justice Brett Kavanaugh. They felt their scorn. Tonight, as we barrel toward the midterms, we will reveal the latest attacks and the possible political fallout. Tucker Carlson, Raymond Arroyo, Corey Lewandowski and Howie Kurtz all here and many more. But first, the odious Kanye West pilon (ph). The outrageous attacks on Kanye West continue as the left pulls its hair out over this meeting that Kanye had yesterday with President Trump. Now check this out, MSNBC guest Michael Eric Dyson, you have seen him a lot on cable news.

All right guys, great to have you all on. Thanks for joining me. And now, Leo, let me start with you. I just have to go back to what Michael Eric Dyson said, white supremacy by ventriloquism.  Now, to me when hear that, Leo, I mean, just set aside politics. If a conservative said that about an African-American celebrity who was liberal, who was showing up with Obama or Clinton or anyone on the left for that matter, there would be hell to pay.

He was coming out and saying, we don't want stop and frisk. So, he was actually acting I think in a proactive way for what he happens to believe. I want to go though to Pastor Scott. Pastor, again, I think there is an enormous amount of progress that can be made on race relations. And I think it is going to probably come from new people. It's not going to come from probably anyone on this panel. It is going to come from new thinkers, people from different walks of life. And it is going to bust the old stereotypes.

I am seeing somebody come out of the psychiatrist office and I know they must be nuts or coming out of the counselor's office and they must be crazy. And so they are going to avoid those kind of places so they don't get those kind of labels, and they are not going to get the kind of treatment you were just talking that we know really will work."

CNN contributor Tara Stmayer said he was a token negro. I haven't heard that phrase in decades. And so, it is rooting in the notion that if a black person -- black people who are for somebody like Donald Trump, they can't know what they are talking about. They are completely misinformed there, they have serious issues and all of that. And that, you know, they no longer have a monopoly.

And what we saw last week in Washington is hundreds of people being arrested, people clawing at the doors of the Supreme Court, running people out of restaurants, screaming at staff members who work for the government.  That never transpired when the Democrats were in office.  Never once did I see David Axelrod be thrown out of a restaurant because the Republicans are so angry at the policies.  Never once did I see Democrat senators have to be removed from restaurants or cabinet officials because the crowd was so outrageously screaming at them because of the policies, because we don't do that. And I remember the Tea Parties well.  I took place in them.  I participated in them.  Not only were they orderly and they were concerning and they were very well thought out, but in the end, there was no mess.  We didn't light cars on fire as a sign of our angst or disgust.  We left in an orderly fashion."
