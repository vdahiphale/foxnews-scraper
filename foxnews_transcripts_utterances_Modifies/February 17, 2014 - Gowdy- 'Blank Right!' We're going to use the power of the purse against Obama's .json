The Constitution gives us power over the purse. So we have appropriation bills that are going to be coming to the House this spring. We ought to strip money away from this executive branch, because our framers gave us that exclusive right to do so. If one branch overreaches then maybe the other branch ought to stick up for itself. Thirdly, we can go to the judicial branch. We do have standing when it comes to vote nullification, which is what ObamaCare is. You can go to the judicial branch and ask them to stop. But most importantly, we can go to your viewers. Your voters -- almost 500 representatives are up every two years. Our framers did that on purpose. And we can say, you know he what, you can fix it. You can fix executive overreach or legislative under reach by throwing them out.",
