FBI's Andrew McCabe, in addition to his wife getting all of this money from M, Clinton puppet. For scoring at home, that's Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe, who gave campaign contributions to Mrs. McCabe who is running for office. He, McCabe, was using allegedly his FBI email account to promote her campaign. You obviously cannot do this. These are the people who were investigating Hillary Clinton.

      "utterance": "Before we get to all that, we've got some breaking news we have to deal with. First of all, President Trump is on a tear this weekend sending out repeated tweets attacking the deputy director of the FBI. There was one tweet this morning. FBI's Andrew McCabe, in addition to his wife getting all of this money from M, Clinton puppet. For scoring at home, that's Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe, who gave campaign contributions to Mrs. McCabe who is running for office. He, McCabe, was using allegedly his FBI email account to promote her campaign. You obviously cannot do this. These are the people who were investigating Hillary Clinton. Question, is that helpful for the president to repeatedly attack top officials of the FBI?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHORT",
      "utterance": "Chris, I think the president believes that the American people have a right to know what happened with that investigation. As you mentioned, in that tweet, I think people need to remember this, Terry McAuliffe, the governor of Virginia, is perhaps the Clinton's closest political friend. He gives $700,000 contribution to McCabe's wife when she was running for office. At the same time, they were launching investigation in Hillary Clinton. The American people have the right to know that. McCabe is announcing it looks to move forward and move on, and we wish him well."

    {
      "speaker": "SHORT",
      "utterance": "Yes. But I think it's also important to segregate that and separate it from the special counsel, because the White House is cooperating every single way with that investigation. And after millions and millions of dollars, no collusion has been proven. So, the president is saying we need to have -- we need to know that our civil servants are doing the honorable thing and it's important the American people know what happened in that investigation."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "I want to be clear, though, because he has attacked, in various tweets, not just McCabe, but also James Baker, the general counsel of the FBI, Peter Strzok, the lead investigator, Lisa Page. Is he saying that there are some bad apples at the FBI, or is he saying that there's a fundamental structural problem with political bias?"

      "speaker": "SHORT",
      "utterance": "I think he's very pleased to have Christopher Wray now running the FBI. He is very pleased with the changes that are taking place. But at the same time, we put all of our faith and confidence in the Department of Justice and the FBI, knowing that there should be no bias there. He's making a point that we need to make sure there's no bias. I think there are serious concerns about whether or not there was or not during the Hillary Clinton --"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "OK. That's just one breaking news story. There's also a story on today's front page of \"The New York Times\" that reports that in an Oval Office meeting last summer about immigrants flooding into the U.S., President Trump said about people from Haiti, quote: They all have AIDS, and immigrants from Nigeria would never go back to their huts. What's your response to that and also to a federal judge in Seattle this weekend partially lifting, again, the president's travel ban?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHORT",
      "utterance": "So, a couple of issues there. I was not in that meeting but the people in the meeting say that those comments never happened. And so, I have no belief that that actually transpired. But let's talk about the temporary protected status for a second, because it's an important case. The people from Haiti with the earthquake that happened roughly two years ago under temporary protected status. We have tens of thousands of people from Honduras and from Nicaragua from a hurricane that happened in 1999. Tens of thousands of people under temporary protected status. The president has again and again made the case that our immigration laws, Congress needs to change these laws, as opposed to continue six-month extension of people that are here from 10 or 20 years ago, Chris."

    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHORT",
      "utterance": "Well, in 2017, Chris, let's look all, first, that the president accomplish. The first president to get a Supreme Court justice confirmed in the first 100 days. The first president to get 12 circuit court judges confirmed in his first year. The first one to deliver on significant tax form since 1986. The first one to rollback regulations with 15 times, signing legislation in the Congressional Review Act. Only once before in our history that a president used Congressional Review Act to roll back. So, it's been an exciting 2017. But we have a lot to do in 2018. I think you'll see the president roll out infrastructure plan in January and the president has already invited Leader McConnell and Speaker Ryan to Camp David in the first weekend of January to make sure we are all on the same page for what our priorities are for 2018."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "But, while both parties want a trillion dollar program over the next decade, there's a big difference. The White House talks about $200 million in federal money with the rest coming from state and local governments and private investment. Democrats want the whole $100 trillion (ph) in federal funds but you say that you've already given that money away to corporations for your tax bill. So, given those huge differences, where is the basis for compromise?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHORT",
      "utterance": "There is no doubt, Chris, there's a pathway for them (ph). Both Democrats and Republicans say that infrastructure is crumbling and we need to fix it. But the big question remains, will Democrats but politics aside and actually work with us? They need to meet us halfway. So far, when you talk about confirmations and our appointees to serve in the administration, in all since George H.W. Bush, there were 32 filibusters on nominees. We had 64 in our first year, twice as many of 20 years combined. We've got twice as many in one year. Democrats have looked to obstruct this administration every chance they can get. The question for them is, will they actually partner with us to try to do things for the American people?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "All right. On infrastructure, they want all federal money, you want only $200 billion with the rest coming from state, local and private. They say the private would be a corporate giveaway. So, where's the deal?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHORT",
      "utterance": "I think that -- I'm not going to get in front of the president. His plan (INAUDIBLE) in January, Chris. But I'm very confident, we've had conversations with Democrats. I think there's a willingness on the policy to get there. The question remains, will politics prevent it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "OK, let's talk about another area with politics because I think it's fair to say there's a deal to be made on immigration. The Democrats want the DREAMers, the young people who came into this country as children as illegal immigrants to get some permanent legal status. In return, what are you asking for in terms of border enforcement? And does there have to be at least some funding for the president's border wall?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHORT",
      "utterance": "Chris, the president put forward to Congress when he said that the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals was not constitutional. He put forward to Congress the principles he wanted which included border security. It included interior enforcement and included a couple additions to ending chain migration. Those were things we asked for. We put that forward to Congress months ago. We are waiting for Congress to provide to us a proposal and get it done. But you're right, the president very much wants a deal here. He wants to solve this problem."

    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "But in fact, much of Obamacare remains, subsidies to help buy coverage. Medicaid expansion and gives coverage to more than 10 million Americans. Protection for pre-existing conditions. The fact is, this a week, we learned that almost 9 million people enrolled in the federal Obamacare exchange. So, isn't the president just flat wrong when he says that Obamacare has been repealed?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHORT",
      "utterance": "No, I think the president is right in saying the heart has been repealed and that was individual mandate. That's what most Americans found most offensive for the government to dictate to you, to say, we are going to require you to buy something whether you wanted or not. There's a certain element of freedom that we still believe and cherish in this country. And that was the root of Obamacare."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "But we're still going to have millions, more than 10 million people who are going to get their health care coverage through Obamacare, through the expanded Medicaid, still going to get paid by the subsidies, still going to get the protections of pre-existing conditions. Obamacare is still here, sir."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHORT",
      "utterance": "Obamacare continues to collapse. The estimates where there would be 20 million more today than there. So, yes, there are 9 million have signed up, but it's way short of the estimate. It continues to fall apart. It continues to collapse. What the administration is looking to do is to shore up the markets through administrative actions that we can take, such as you saw, the president signed executive order allowing associated health plans that more people can pool their resources together to help lower premiums. We will continue to see us take administrative action on Obamacare."

      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "In the end, 128 countries ignore the president's threat and voted against his new policy. But the fact is the only country besides Israel that gets as much as a billion dollars in foreign aid that he's talking about perhaps doing away with, our two allies, Egypt and Jordan. So, was he really mean what he says about cutting aid either to countries like Egypt and Jordan, or to the U.N. itself?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHORT",
      "utterance": "There are a couple very important things that happened in the United Nations this week and you are covering one of them, and that is recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Keep in mind, in 1995, Congress voted overwhelmingly that's what the American position would be, and vote again 90-0 with 10 abstentions last year. It is a policy that is represented by many Americans. The president followed through on a campaign promise. Also last week, there was about 15-0 will put additional sanctions on North Korea. That is something that's been underreported. The president's leadership with Ambassador Haley in bringing the United Nations together and isolating North Korea, that is far more important to what our national security objectives are."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",

      "speaker": "SHORT",
      "utterance": "I'm not going to get ahead of the president, but I think the countries that continue to thwart the will of us (ph) and refuse to partner with us, they should be cognizant of the president's delivering on his promise that he's made before."

We have disaster relief for the people of Texas and Florida, California and Puerto Rico. We have the immigration issues that need to be dealt with now. And I think the manner in which that is handled can set the stage for Congress, Democrats and Republicans, working together.

The president has made it more difficult but we need to get together and we have Democrats and Republicans working together. On infrastructure, absolutely we want to get an infrastructure bill done.

      "speaker": "CARDIN",
      "utterance": "Well, first, as it's been pointed out, the United States recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, the Congress did that in 1995. The country has a right to determine its own capital. I don't think it was a controversial move, but the manner in which he handled it without using diplomacy, without trying to advance the peace process, using this to put other issues on the table so he could get the Palestinians and Israelis talking together, that I think was the mistake. So, the reaction the United Nations I think was expected. I don't know whether it's useful to make threats. We do watch how the countries in the United Nations vote on our resolutions. We always do that. But I think the manner in which the president handled this is not in our best national security interests."

Security Council on Friday imposing new sanctions against North Korea, including sharp new limits on petroleum, shipments to North Korea. And the vote got the support of both China and Russia. It was 15-0 on the Security Council. Doesn't that indicate that the Trump administration diplomacy to try and build up international support against North Korea is working?"

    {
      "speaker": "CARDIN",
      "utterance": "That was a good move. That was a major accomplishment. I give our team a lot of credit for getting that done. They're pretty strong additional sanctions to be imposed against North Korea because of their continued testing of ballistic missiles. So, that absolutely was a strong move forward and it was great to see China and Russia join us in that. It now needs to be followed up with diplomacy, where we get China and the United States working with the same strategy with North Korea, to find a way that we can ease the tension and get North Korea to change directions. It's a good first step."

It's a clear message to Russia that we will not allow them to continue to compromise the sovereignty of Ukraine. Russia will continue to push as far as they can.

Has he lost his credibility as he traveled the world representing this country?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARDIN",
      "utterance": "In many respects, our foreign policy is inconsistent. We'll have a policy coming out of the State Department or coming out from people that are representing the White House and then have the president come out with a tweet that totally undermines that. We saw that in North Korea when Secretary Tillerson was pursuing diplomacy and then the president undercut his ability with a tweet. I think we found from the president, he doesn't always support his team and therefore we have an inconsistent message. We have distant America -- we say America first. It looks like America in isolation. America has lost its leadership on many key issues. That's certainly true in climate change, where we were not as present as we should have been on talks. China came in and took a lot of the leadership that should have been with the United States. We see the United States being excluded from a lot of the discussions globally and that's not helpful to our national security."

The Dow Jones average is up almost 25 percent since the Trump inauguration. ISIS has lost 97 percent of the land it once controlled in Iraq and Syria. For all the controversies, for all the questions about this administration, when you look back on all of that, hasn't President Trump had a pretty good year?"

And that there were seeds planted by both Democratic and Republican administrations that have caused us to continue to grow. But as we do that, there's a lot of Americans who have been left behind. I think that's the key challenge. We have a shrinking middle class. We got to focus on a growing middle class. And I think there was a missed opportunity on this tax bill where it helped basically large corporations and high income people. If we could have focused on middle income, we could have I think grown or helped grow the middle class, which would have been good for our future. Things are good, they could be better. Let's concentrate on middle income families."

The Justice Department has been investigating possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia for a year and a half. Really two questions. First of all, do you feel any urgency to wrap this up, to remove the cloud over our president if it can be removed? And secondly, what do you think of the tweets and it's continued this week on the attacks against the FBI?"

On the foreign policy side of things, ISIS has been really the sweet spot for the administration this year. They've -- the United States military has decimated their strongholds in Iraq and Syria, essentially denying them any claims to legitimate caliphate. The challenge on this and many other issues is that the world, at the risk of sounding trite, the world is a complex place today and the nature of all the threats we face as a nation are changing. They're evolving very quickly. So if we take ISIS an example -- as an example, we have had great success militarily. The new front in the war on terror, next year and beyond is really going to be in cyberspace. So the question is, how quickly can the administration adapt? How can they take these policy successes and translate them in the future?"

To me, when you think about Ronald Reagan, it was the ability to negotiate in times across the aisle. I don't think Trump has that. I'm not sure I can point to one Republican who would say he voted for the tax bill because of Trump. I think the deals were struck by, for example, in the Senate, McConnell, Anwar drilling for Lisa Murkowski, you know, something of a promise on health care going to Susan Collins of Maine, something promised about immigration reform to Jeff Flake. That's the so-called swamp that Trump once promised to drain. Actually McConnell, I think, has poured some water and muck into that swamp."

But then again, much of the coverage has also been fairly harsh because, as we've already alluded to, the opening stanzas of this presidency, the first eight months, ten months were very, very off-kilter. And he had a hard run getting started. So much of the coverage that was harsh was unfair.

Much disagreement on the tax cut, but we're going to see, as we know in tax cuts, it depends on outcomes. The condition of the economy is good now, supposedly. We will see. So that can't be measured. So, at the same time, there's been a lot of turmoil in the Trump presidency. One of the people I talked to called it a chaos furnace. And there's a lot of truth in that. And that's Trump style.

And I think what he is -- you know, the end of the year always offers this opportunity to sort of talk about lessons learned and I think one of the -- one of the things the administration has done well is that they've learned to adapt some fairly outlandish policy ideas to suit the swamp and to suit the Congress and they've become -- like there's no better example than the travel ban, the president's believed travel ban. If you look at the first version, it was fairly outrageous. Everything from what it said on paper to how it was rolled out. We go from there to the second and then the third version has sort of passed without much controversy. And what they're doing their is trying to, I think -- you know, they're coming to terms with the fact that the president doesn't have all the prerogative in the world and if he wants to get these fairly controversial things through, he's going to have to learn to adapt."

But they have a big rhubarb to settle among Republicans before they figure out what they're going to do there because they made a lot of promises to ideologically desperate Republicans in order to get the tax bill passed. That bill is coming due really in January through March as they have to deal with DACA, illegal immigrants who are brought to the United States as minors. They have to deal with questions of fixing Obamacare or patching Obamacare for the year. Different promises to different people.

Supreme Court decisions in the Nixon case saying, you, as the investigator, have the power to get the evidence. In the case of Nixon, it was the tapes. So Mueller presumably can get all evidence and testimony on this. So we don't know where it's going to go. I think one of the big problems here is our business, the media. You see the declarations about, oh, we know this is going to lead to impeachment or the declarations that it's going to be over, it's going to go away.

That's the really serious investigation. But I think in the discussion about and what is somebody who's done this for, God, 47 years, there is, in the media, this polarization of -- and people attacking Trump and the kind of self- satisfaction and smugness and ridicule, which I think does not work at all. And on the other side, oh, Trump is totally right, this is innocent. This is some sort of jihad against him. And I think we need to turn that down and listen to facts.

But I don't think the question of whether or not we're going to war with the North is it all settled at this time. I hope you're right and I'm wrong. On Russia, the investigation aside, I think the U.S./Russia bilateral relationship has taken a nosedive.
