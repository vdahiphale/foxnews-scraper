This is what they're doing. I want to read this. This is the lead from the San Diego Union Tribune. A group of around 100 people trying to illegally cross the border, Sunday, near the San Isidro port of entry threw rocks and bottles at the U.S. border patrol agents who then used pepper spray.   This was November 25. 2013, right? 2013, five years ago when President Obama was in power, nobody seemed to care. Where is Obama and Biden and Clinton holding now? They approved of this. Here's the -- the problem with this, they are playing upon the emotions of people. These may be good people, I agree, but they're being used. They're being used.

Everybody knows we have judges with political leanings. That's when Chucky steps in. As the media drooled over Roberts, Chuck angled for some spotlight with this tweet, I don't agree very often with Chief Justice Roberts, especially his partisan decision. But I'm thankful today that he almost alone among Republicans stood up to President Trump and for an independent judiciary.  So in one breath, Chuck made Trump's point perfectly. A chief justice makes partisan decisions. Then he notes Roberts' political party, revealing that Chuckie labels judges too. Now, that's not just comical, it's progress. It used to take days between people mocking Trump over what he says, than then admitting he was right.  Now it's collapsed into mere seconds. Or as Dummy Chuck says, Trump's wrong and here's why I agree with him, which revealed something key. It's not that Trump's critics have a problem with the truth. They have a problem with Trump saying it, which is why it his own criticism of Trump's truth, Schumer accidentally for once spoke it too. Maybe he didn't mean to. But when the only thing left to say is what Trump's been saying, you had no choice, so well done, Chuck. It's like you sat in Trump's lap while he moved your mouth.

It's not the security guards fault that he has to protect the bank, and that's what they've tried to do. The activist tried to create this conflict as a way to inflame society. This is what they're doing. I want to read this. This is the lead from the San Diego Union Tribune. A group of around 100 people trying to illegally cross the border, Sunday, near the San Isidro port of entry threw rocks and bottles at the U.S. border patrol agents who then used pepper spray. This was November 25. 2013, right? 2013, five years ago when President Obama was in power, nobody seemed to care. Where is Obama and Biden and Clinton holding now? They approved of this. Here's the -- the problem with this, they are playing upon the emotions of people. These may be good people, I agree, but they're being used. They're being used.

And that's why our economy has proliferated and they want to engage in that. Having said that, the people who are throwing rocks and bottles and putting children's lives at risk, as individuals, they should be ashamed of themselves, because what's going to happen, it's going to justify the hardline immigration tactics that the members of this administration would like to impose. And that is a very unfortunate, unintended consequence of that behavior. Having said that, we have to look at this and say why are -- they're bigger caravans, why are there more people? Is it just because we have more work and we're in an economic boom right now, or is there something else? And are these people being played as puppets by groups?

Like, that's not why they are there. I also agree with the need to try to solve the problem at its source because if you're being a good neighbor and, Geraldo, like, to your point on the bigger issue of what's happened in the past several decades in these countries, does America have a responsibility to try to help with law and order and economic development?

And the Democrats seem to be unwilling to talk about the border security issue because they want to talk about the other issue. But clearly, both of these things have to be talked about at the same time. Another thing just to keep in mind, this Saturday is the inauguration of the new president of Mexico. And there's going to be a lot of attention.  There's a lot of media focus.

Everybody knows we have judges with political leanings. That's when Chucky steps in. As the media drooled over Roberts, Chuck angled for some spotlight with this tweet, I don't agree very often with Chief Justice Roberts, especially his partisan decision. But I'm thankful today that he almost alone among Republicans stood up to President Trump and for an independent judiciary.  So in one breath, Chuck made Trump's point perfectly. A chief justice makes partisan decisions. Then he notes Roberts' political party, revealing that Chuckie labels judges too. Now, that's not just comical, it's progress. It used to take days between people mocking Trump over what he says, than then admitting he was right.  Now it's collapsed into mere seconds. Or as Dummy Chuck says, Trump's wrong and here's why I agree with him, which revealed something key. It's not that Trump's critics have a problem with the truth. They have a problem with Trump saying it, which is why it his own criticism of Trump's truth, Schumer accidentally for once spoke it too. Maybe he didn't mean to. But when the only thing left to say is what Trump's been saying, you had no choice, so well done, Chuck. It's like you sat in Trump's lap while he moved your mouth.

I also have an issue with some of the things the Democrats have said about the president in regards to this partisan infighting in terms of immigration. But we're going to get to that in a little while. Of course, there are different ways of interpreting the Constitution, and it's not necessarily liberal, and it's not necessarily conservative.
