Democrats all last year said we're running concentration camps at the border. I think Kamala Harris said Jussie Smollett was the victim of a modern day lynching. Hillary Clinton said the Trump rallies remind her of lynchings. Cuomo, just said last week on a radio show, the N-word. Not to mention Bill Maher said the N-word last year.

It's unbelievable. And then they leak out these little pieces of information. That's why the president's process point is one that I think is pretty effective. The Democrats saying that they want to -- that they might carry this on. I think it does two things for Democrats. It distracts their base into thinking that they're being tough on the president. And it also prevents their base from realizing, oh, my gosh, having the House is not enough. You don't have enough power to actually do anything if you only have the House. So, those are two things that work in favor of the Democrats to keep this process going, but they do run a risk that people will just get tired of it. They're not -- they're not able to pay attention. And the selective leaking out every day of little bits of testimony, maybe it was explosive but how would we ever know if they do it all behind closed doors?",

Do you think this was an intentional ploy to bring up a disgraceful part of our era? We could just ask him. We could ask -- instead of relying on the media to mind read him, why don't you ask him. I'll tell you this right now. Trump is a terrible racist because you have record unemployment for blacks, Hispanics, and women. He signs a bill to upgrade Martin Luther King's birthplace for a national park. He signs criminal justice reform that free 3,000 people, many of them minorities so they can return to their families. Signed executive order to make historical black colleges and universities a financial priority. And then, the Republican Senate passed anti-lynching legislation after 200 attempts.

But, I know what he's saying, everybody gets the analogy about impeachment that they're doing this like a mob action in the middle of the night without due process rights. Everyone has reported it. The Democrats have admitted it. The witnesses can't be seen by Republicans. You can't see evidence. You can't even see transcripts. It's all been done in the dark. That's what he was trying to say. And it just bothers me that -- you know, yesterday on the show we talk about a Democrat comparing Trump to the Nazis, calling him Hitler. Democrats all last year said we're running concentration camps at the border. I think Kamala Harris said Jussie Smollett was the victim of a modern day lynching. Hillary Clinton said the Trump rallies remind her of lynchings. Cuomo, just said last week on a radio show, the N-word. Not to mention Bill Maher said the N-word last year. And I do believe it was Barack Obama who just endorsed someone in black face in Canada. But the point is for Democrats to get on their high horse today and lecture other people about racially charged rhetoric or historically insensitive language is so preposterous. And they need to look themselves in the mirror and just ask themselves am I a total hypocrite? Because I don't care when my side uses this language or when I myself use this language. I only try to weaponized this language to hurt the opposing party. And that's all that's going on here."

      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",

So, Dagen, to part of what Jesse was saying, which was a powerful argument, lynching is not a constitutional process but impeachment is a constitutional process by which, you know, the Congress holds a powerful executive to account for any kind of wrongdoing, so why the analogy?"

Nevertheless, he traffics in outrageousness and people are taking the bait, number one. Number two, what people are outraged by is the most formidable constitutional power of then declaring war is an impeachment process. And they're trampling on the Democrats are -- Democratic norms and the institutions of this country, and will come to bite them in the you know what."
    },

      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",

So, you know, Dana, today there was something to be -- for the president to distract people from, which was Bill Taylor, the U.S. ambassador, went before the House, and according to the news reports, because we haven't seen exactly what he had to say, he said that there was evidence of a quid pro quo."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "Right. So I think that the Democrats keep having -- every day they have a new witness, and then they leak out little bits of the testimony, and you have members of Congress that are in there, mostly Democrats, they come out and they say, whoa, I am -- I have never seen anything like it. It's unbelievable. And then they leak out these little pieces of information. That's why the president's process point is one that I think is pretty effective. The Democrats saying that they want to -- that they might carry this on. I think it does two things for Democrats. It distracts their base into thinking that they're being tough on the president. And it also prevents their base from realizing, oh, my gosh, having the House is not enough. You don't have enough power to actually do anything if you only have the House. So, those are two things that work in favor of the Democrats to keep this process going, but they do run a risk that people will just get tired of it. They're not -- they're not able to pay attention. And the selective leaking out every day of little bits of testimony, maybe it was explosive but how would we ever know if they do it all behind closed doors?"

      "utterance": "Yeah -- I mean, you left out Jerry Nadler, actually, used the same terminology when he was discussing Bill Clinton, referring to that. Oh, thank you for having that up there like. And the effort to impeach Clinton, he compared it to a lynch mob. So everybody kind of does this. Analogies are never perfect. But, you know what the thing is -- here's the thing. You know, can you read Donald Trump's mind that he meant to offend blacks? Do you actually think that that's what he's doing? Do you think this was an intentional ploy to bring up a disgraceful part of our era? We could just ask him. We could ask -- instead of relying on the media to mind read him, why don't you ask him. I'll tell you this right now. Trump is a terrible racist because you have record unemployment for blacks, Hispanics, and women. He signs a bill to upgrade Martin Luther King's birthplace for a national park. He signs criminal justice reform that free 3,000 people, many of them minorities so they can return to their families. Signed executive order to make historical black colleges and universities a financial priority. And then, the Republican Senate passed anti-lynching legislation after 200 attempts. He's one of the worst racists ever."

According to reason.com, they're proposing a new social justice infused curriculum that would focus on \"power and oppression\" within math. Fine. I mean, does two plus two really equal four? Or does two plus two equal white privilege? By the way, that plus sign looks like a cross, a violation of the separation between church and state. But who needs hard math anyway to build bridges and roads? Nothing but scars on the beauty of nature. We can just feel our way around a river. Bring galoshes. But I'm too old to care. Look what math has done to my body one year at a time, but still I do rely on engineers who did actual math before this postmodern dreck reduced the hard sciences to room temperature silly putty. But if I had brats, I'd move the hell out of Seattle to a place that rewards literacy and timetables. Because if we start thinking that math is secondary to ideologies dictated by useless grad students who can't read or write, the world stops working. The wings on your plane may start flapping and the tires on your car may start believing in a flat earth. Engineers and mathematicians keep us moving, but once the workplace becomes the woke place, how will you get to your gender studies class then? By the way, Jesse, this is just a proposal.

So, a mother of two, she had a sleepless night because she was convinced there was a ghost baby in bed with her son. Maritza Elizabeth, she spotted this infant ghoul's face staring straight at her to her 18-month-old son's baby monitor after she put him to bed and his crib. And at first, she thought she was - her eyes were just playing tricks on her. She tried to ignore it, but the image continued to creep her out. So, she went into her son's room. She couldn't get a good enough look. And she was really upset about it. Well, it turns out her mind was put at ease when she realized that her husband just forgot to put the mattress protector on when he changed the sheets, and the ghost face was just a baby's face on like the label."

Here are 91-year-old sweethearts Leonard and Shirley Matties of Burlington, Colorado. Dana, still in love after all these years. And so, Shirley got dressed up in a radiant pink gown for the anniversary. The nurses at the senior living center organized a photo shoot on this special date for them. The couple has seven children in addition to grandchildren and great grandchildren. One daughter says that while Shirley now has dementia, she has no problem recognizing one person, Leonard, the man she calls, \"the love of her life.\" Love to love you. Isn't that wonderful?"

A dog named Dwayne the Rock Johnson was the real MVP. It beats seven other corgis for the cutest touchdown ever. This is only the second annual corgi cup, but I have a favorite corgi on the Internet.
