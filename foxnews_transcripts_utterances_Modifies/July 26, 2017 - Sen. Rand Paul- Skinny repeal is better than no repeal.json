So I think it's a good news that more Republicans actually supported clean repeal. It's disappointing, though, that many Republicans who promised to vote for repeal, already had voted for this repeal, chose this time not to vote for it.",

But what we have to try to do is rip out as much of the terrible distortions that ObamaCare has caused and then we fight on. But ObamaCare really has destroyed the insurance market. And it's going to get worse. But we should try to do everything we can to repeal now. And if we had passed the near complete repeal that I was for today, what would have happened is, Democrats would have been forced to come to the table and they would have been forced to negotiate on some kind of replacement.  Right now, they're not forced to do anything because, even if we get skinny repeal, I still don't think they are going to come to the table to negotiate.",

The president interview with The Wall Street Journal left open the possibility that he still very much wants to see tax cuts and wants to see the corporate rate, for example, cut to 15 percent, but it necessarily wouldn't be across the board in his eyes. He opened the possibility of the rich not getting any tax break. In fact, he had an interesting line. If there's upward revision, it is going to be on high-income people.   That got some people here saying, is he talking about a tax hike for the rich? How do you feel about all this?",

The top 1 percent pay 33 percent of the income tax. Top 10 percent of income earners pay 60 percent of the income tax.  If you're in the top 50 percent, that is $75,000 and above for personal income, you pay 96 percent of the income tax. So, if you tell the American people I'm only cutting it on the middle class below $75,000 a year, you're not going to cut any taxes, because not much of the taxes are being paid in that category. So, the bottom line is, we have made the tax code more and more progressive over time. The people on the low end have been removed from the tax rolls and the people on the upper end have continued to get higher and higher taxes.   The bottom line is, when you cut the taxes for rich people, it helps everybody in the economy, because what happens is, you leave more money in the economy. I would cut everybody's taxes, but I would also cut those who are in the wealthy category because they pay the bulk of the taxes.",

It shouldn't be about who has money. If you work hard and you get more money than your neighbor because you sell more of your services or your products, that's capitalism. That means you have been rewarded by people freely and voluntarily buying your stuff.  I'm not jealous of the Walton family -- I wish I were the Walton family -- but I'm not jealous of them because they built a bunch of great stores, had a great transportation system, and sell things that people want and voluntarily buy. That's America. And we should reward that with the success, which is you will make more money than your neighbor if you sell more stuff. And -- but so we shouldn't then say, oh, we're not going to cut their taxes, because, in the end, if the business owners don't get a tax cut, the business owners don't create more jobs, and we all work for somebody richer than us.",
