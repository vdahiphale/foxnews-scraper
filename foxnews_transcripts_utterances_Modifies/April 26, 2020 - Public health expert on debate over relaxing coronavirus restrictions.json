We're very sympathetic to all the people that are out of work. But there is enhanced unemployment, there's the PPP, there's direct deposits. This is going to put (ph) a lot of liquidity.

And there has been a lot of focus on these bigger companies, public companies. We came out with new guidelines. We made it clear they shouldn't have applied. They're paying back the money.

Ben, there are reports this weekend that President Trump is going to cut back on the number of White House briefings and cut back on his appearances at them. Do you think that's smart? Do you think these briefings have begun to backfire politically on the president? BEN DOMENECH, CO-FOUNDER, \"THE FEDERALIST\": I think that it does make sense to cut back a little bit on these briefings as much as we do get some information out of them and many times we've seen them just go off the rails and back and forth in battles between the president and those in the press. But I think that what we really need at this moment is seriousness and we need more seriousness from these briefings. Just given your interview with Oklahoma's governor right now, I think that a lot of people are still operating under some false premises about the kind of challenges that we're facing, the idea that we're going to ramp up mass testing, that we're going to have it in a conference of level very shortly. The idea that a vaccine is going to come within the next few months as opposed to 12 to 18 or even more.

And we are putting in a unprecedented amount of fiscal relief into the economy. You're seeing trillions of dollars that's making its way into the economy and I think this is going to have a significant impact."

      "speaker": "WALLACE",

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office now projects GDP will shrink by 5.6 percent total this year. Unemployment will end 2020, they project, close to 12 percent. And your former company, Goldman Sachs, says the global hit will be four times worse than the 2008 Great Recession. Question, are all those independent experts wrong?"

So all these models are based upon health assumptions, how quickly we reopen, so we'll see. My own opinion is, again, we have unprecedented amount of liquidity in the system. We're very sympathetic to all the people that are out of work. But there is enhanced unemployment, there's the PPP, there's direct deposits. This is going to put (ph) a lot of liquidity. And as businesses begin to open you're going to see demand side of the economy rebound."

But the first round, I think it was $250/$300 billion, the sign-up for that ran out in 13 days. How long do you think this next tranche of $310 billion is going to last? And can you guarantee that big corporations, for instance like Ruth's Chris that got money the first time around, eventually pay it back, but did get money won't even get money this time?"

And the fact that we ran out of money just goes to show the success of this. Now let me put this in perspective, in the first round over a million companies had workers of 10 people or below. And there has been a lot of focus on these bigger companies, public companies. We came out with new guidelines. We made it clear they shouldn't have applied. They're paying back the money. So I think you're going to see this move in the right direction and I think you're going to also see in this round the average loan size go down significantly."

    {
      "speaker": "MNUCHIN",
      "utterance": "Chris to me it's not a matter of how long it lasts, the -- actually I think the sooner the money is dispersed the better. So the first round impacted about 30 million workers. I think this round will be about the same. That will be close to 50 percent of the private workforce. So I actually hope we run out of money quickly so we can get the money into the workers' pockets. And, again, in this round we're making it clear that small businesses have access. We've signed up a lot of CDFIs. We're signing up more of them. So we're going to make sure that this is distributed fairly."

The bill first passed 96 to O (ph) and this one was unanimous consent in the Senate. So my comment on this is, this will be something that both the Senate and the House debate. It will be something that we discuss on a bipartisan basis. The president has heard from governors. He wants to speak to governors. This is something we'll consider. But our focus right now is really on execution and -- that's what we're focused on and if we need more money -- as I've said, this is a war. We'll win this war, if we need to spend more money we will, and we'll only do it with bipartisan support."

Let me pick up on that last point because with all of the money that's already gone out, the national debt will, by the end of this year, exceed the gross domestic product, the total output of the economy, it will be over 100 percent of GDP which has always been considered a kind of redline for stable economies. How much do you worry about a debt in excess of 100 percent of GDP?"

So if you look at the portion of the budget that we're actually allocating to interest it's extremely low and we're locking in long term rates to make sure this additional money we've locked up for a long period of time. Overtime that is something we're going to need to look at and we're going to need to look at overtime how we deal with that issue.

We have reached a plateau nationally at this point. I mean, trends can change over time, but at this point we have a plateau in new cases per day. Unfortunately, it's a very high plateau. We still are seeing about 30,000 new cases of COVID-19 every day in the United States and still are seeing something on the order of 2,000 deaths per day. So we are not through -- out of the woods by any means, in terms of this pandemic, but at least we have reached a kind of a stable number of new infections and the number of people who are dying from this illness."

If we change our social distancing policies and depending on how well states get prepared for the easing into the reopening, that could change outcomes quite a bit. But the leading models at the moment protect anywhere from 58,000 deaths to 110,000 deaths in the next month in the united states. I think no one is really modeling beyond that.

    {
      "speaker": "INGLESBY",

And about another third of the country, there seems to be a leveling off. And only a minority -- in a minority of the country the numbers are actually coming down day by day. And so I -- I don't think it's likely that we will be at that position by Memorial Day, but even more importantly, wherever we are in the epidemic, this virus is going to be with us until we have a vaccine. So as we ease up on social distancing measures and economies begin to very carefully reopen, we are at risk of recurrence or re-spikes in the illness in the epidemic. So I think everyone needs to be aware that, even as we're beginning to open up again, there is a -- a clear chance of a rise in cases in states that are doing that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "Let -- let's talk about that, because a number of states, as you know, are beginning to reopen spas, salons, gyms, even restaurants. Is that safe for people -- you know, you talk about a spot where people are giving massages, a salon where people are filing people's nails are cutting their hair. Is that safe for people to be that close, at this point, if they're wearing masks and gloves?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGLESBY",
      "utterance": "I don't think it's going to be possible for anyone to say something is safe, you know, completely safe at this point. Because the virus is very transmissible between people and because some people don't have symptoms, at least -- either in the beginning of the illness or maybe even at all during their illness. But we can say some things are safer than others, and businesses that have small numbers of people are probably safer than businesses that have very large numbers of people. And the closeness of the interaction, that also is a factor. So if people are going to be closely interacting, they should be using personal protective equipment if that's available in their state. And outdoors will be safer than indoors. So there is a range of different -- there are going to be a range of different risks that businesses face, and it's important for all businesses now to be trying to understand their risks and making plans for how to diminish the risks as best they can within their own business and their own operations."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGLESBY",
      "utterance": "No, it's not enough. And the reason why is because we're not testing a lot of the mild and moderate illness that isn't -- people who aren't sick enough to be in the hospital. And so all those people are not getting counted and they aren't necessarily having their contacts traced or told to isolate in their own homes. So we're missing a lot of the illness in the country. Until we get that under control, we're going to continue to have lines of transmission that we can't see. And beyond that, many businesses are now really beginning to think about how diagnostics might factor into their reopening plans. And we just don't have diagnostic testing available on large scale for businesses. We're still focused on diagnosing the sickest people, those in nursing homes, health care workers, which is completely appropriate, but they're a small fraction of the number of people that we're going to need to test to really find all the illness and to get the economy moving in the right direction again."

I want to ask you about another White House guideline, and that is a steady decline in the number of new cases over the course of two weeks. I want to put some stats on the screen. Oklahoma is coming down from its peak but had a 26 percent increase in new cases in the last week. And it went, over the course of the last week -- the numbers jumped from a low of 29 new cases last Sunday to over 100 new cases just this past Thursday and Friday. Should a state with those kinds of numbers be reopening now?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGLESBY",
      "utterance": "You know, I would be very cautious about doing that. I think we've seen -- there's an example in the papers this morning about a state in Japan that reopened quickly in March after a few weeks of low-ish numbers and three weeks later rebounded to the point where they have to now close their economy down again. So I think it's going to be important to really go slowly. For those states who do reopen, I think it should be done very carefully with a lot of monitoring of both hospitalization rate, ICU rate, death rates. So at this point only about five states in the country, to my count, have had two weeks of decline, so only about two weeks in the -- two states -- or five states, rather, in the country, have met the gating criteria laid out by the White House."

      "speaker": "INGLESBY",

Two studies that have come out so far have suggested it is possibly more harmful than helpful and possibly dangerous. So I don't think anyone should be taking hydroxychloroquine unless they are in a randomized controlled trial that's being carefully studied. And the second point is that I think the -- the most important thing now in terms of medicines and vaccines is to follow where medical leaders and scientific leaders guide us. They are doing the studies. These studies take time. These medicines can actually hurt people. So there is a harm that could potentially --"

You know, I've issued 15 executive orders since March 15th, when I first declared the state of emergency, but it was but to build capacity in our hospitals, to make sure we didn't over run our health care system, it was to build supply for PPE and it was to flatten the curve. The facts in our state are, March 30th we had -- we peaked at hospitalizations with 560 across the state. Today we have 300 across the state in our hospitals. And so we think it's time for a measured reopening. But I've been very clear with Oklahomans that coronavirus is still in the United States and it's still in Oklahoma, so we have to continue with the social distancing, but we will start taking some measured reopening in a phased, measured approach."

There were four gates that we've met. And the facts are, we have been on a steady decline since March 30th in hospitalizations and we have 300 across our state. And that's when we decided to have a measured reopening. We're always going to be data driven in Oklahoma. We're watching it. We -- I have put up 80 different mobile test sites across the state. We currently ranked 25th in the nation in number of testing. And it is time for a measured reopening. But I also told Oklahomans that we'll be data driven. We'll continue to watch the trends. And if the percentage of tests start increasing or hospitalizations start increasing, that we'll kick back one of those phases and we can obviously reserve the rights to back up if we need to. But we believe it's the time to have a measured reopening."

These are barbershops. These are folks like in Midwest City that have been in business for 50 years. And next Friday, on May 1st, is when where going to have a limited reopening for churches, if they -- if they follow social distancing and have every other pew, some in restaurant dining, we're going to spread the tables out six feet apart, mask up, do temperature testing. So we have a list of guidance for those restaurants that want to start opening. And, again, we're going to be data-driven. But I'm -- I'm -- we will not make decisions in Oklahoma, what we're seeing on television or what we're seeing happening in other states. And the facts are, we've gone from 560 hospitalized people on March 30th, today we have 300 across the state. We built capacity. We now have 4,600 hospital beds for Covid-related patients."

And the two guiding principles that I told Oklahomans we're going to use to -- through this whole process was the health and safety of Oklahomans, number one, and then mitigate the loss to our economy and get our workers back working as quickly as possible. We're data-driven. I can't speak to what's happening in other states. But in my state, we're seeing the trending go down. Our testing is going up. Our tracing. We put 80,000 -- 80 different testing sites up. We've tested over 55,000 folks. Our positive tests right now are 6.3 percent. And, again, 300 hospitalized cases across the state with a capacity for 4,600. We think it's a -- it's a reasonable time to reopen."

But the mayors of a number of the big cities say reluctantly they are going to reopen because they say since you've opened up the state, they -- if -- if the town next door has reopened and they can't protect their -- their residence anyway.

I'm putting guidance for the whole state because, as you know -- but I've never been heavy-handed with the mayors in different locations. I've let them make decisions based on their communities.

      "utterance": "President Trump igniting a storm of controversy this week when he suggested the coronavirus might be vulnerable to injections of disinfectant. And it's time now for our Sunday group. Cofounder of \"The Federalist,\" Ben Domenech, Katie Pavlich, editor of townhall.com, and Mo Elleithee of Georgetown University's Institute of Politics and Public Service. Ben, there are reports this weekend that President Trump is going to cut back on the number of White House briefings and cut back on his appearances at them. Do you think that's smart? Do you think these briefings have begun to backfire politically on the president? BEN DOMENECH, CO-FOUNDER, \"THE FEDERALIST\": I think that it does make sense to cut back a little bit on these briefings as much as we do get some information out of them and many times we've seen them just go off the rails and back and forth in battles between the president and those in the press. But I think that what we really need at this moment is seriousness and we need more seriousness from these briefings. Just given your interview with Oklahoma's governor right now, I think that a lot of people are still operating under some false premises about the kind of challenges that we're facing, the idea that we're going to ramp up mass testing, that we're going to have it in a conference of level very shortly. The idea that a vaccine is going to come within the next few months as opposed to 12 to 18 or even more. And that something that I think we need to start wrestling with, not just at the gubernatorial level, but at the presidential level as well, giving some of this tough talk to the American people about the trade-offs and the risks we're going to face."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "MO ELLEITHEE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Well, I think it depends who we're talking to. And we've seen that time and time again. We've even seen that in these White House briefings where, if you listen to the medical experts, they -- you're not getting a lot of happy talk from them, you're getting a lot of sobering talk from them, whereas you here the political leaders, when they're at the podium, and they're trying to -- to be a little bit more aspirational I think in best case scenarios. Look, I think the briefings have gone off the rails and I think -- which is too bad because we do need them. We do need to hear from our leaders. We need to hear from our public health professionals. I hope that the White House continue the briefings, but maybe puts more of the spotlight on Dr. Fauci, on Dr. Birx, on the public health professionals, bring in relevant policymakers when they're translating the public health situation into what we're doing and maybe a little bit less of the self-congratulatory tone that we've seen help derail some of these things in the past."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "Katie, then there's the question of how fast to reopen the country, which has become one of the big questions. And a lot of people, I think it's fairly to say, were surprised this week because the president has really talked up reopening the country, the cure can't be worse than the -- than the illness. But when it came to brain Kemp, the governor of Georgia, who reopened on Friday, a number of things, particularly personal care businesses, the president took him to task."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KATIE PAVLICH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Right, which I think proves that this is not just political for President Trump. He's listening to people who are around him on the White House Coronavirus Task Force who are talking about the health implications of this. But it's not that the president is just berating Governor Brian Kemp for -- for no reason. I mean the White House did put out a series of phases that they believe that states and local governments should take to meet the criteria of making sure that the cure is not worse than the disease. And on the topic of the briefings and whether we continue to go forward with them and the federal government's response, you know, we are in another phase here now with the economic fallout of what is going on. And states and local governments, this has really move to their arena and they are the ones who are going to have to make decisions for their localities moving forward. Unemployment is a major problem for state governments around the country. They had to deal with that. And they're also hospital consequences and consequences for long-term instability in terms of mental health, addiction for these local jurisdictions that they are weighing as a risk to opening up the economy as this virus continues."

Not just the pandemic, but the economic lockdown as well. I think one area in particular to keep an eye on is the behavior of China in the past couple of weeks as it relates to Hong Kong. They have locked up a number of human rights demonstrators, people who were engaged last fall in all types of protests against the government in Beijing. We're going to continue to see regimes around the world behave in ways that they know that they can maybe get away with when America is distracted."

But this week he talked about China's bullying, which includes not only what's going on in Hong Kong, also pressure they're putting on Taiwan and also seeming to expand their authority and control over the South China Sea. What do we do about China, Katie?"

They've been hoarding personal protective equipment. They're being aggressive in the South China Sea and geopolitically they are, quote, Joe-nating (ph) personal protective equipment that is faulty to a number of European countries that is then, in return, had to be returned because it does not work properly. The way that you deal with China, I've talked to a couple of senators actually this week on background, they have said that they do have legislation in the works to bring back manufacturing of pharmaceuticals and incentivizing big companies to bring their businesses back from China and some types of deregulation so that it's easier for American companies to function and produce in America than it is to function in China. China is not sorry about what they have done and they are taking every advantage of the current situation to advance their goals long-term."

This is a time when we do need to hold them accountable, but we do need their help. We need to work together. And we're just not equipped to do that right now."
