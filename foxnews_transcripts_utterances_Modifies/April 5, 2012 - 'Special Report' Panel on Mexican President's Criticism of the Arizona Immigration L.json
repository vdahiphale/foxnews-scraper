Bret, do you know how much Mexico does to stop illegal immigrants from entering the United States? Zip, zilch, nothing. So then he lets them in against our laws and then criticizes our laws which might crack down on them.   Look, if I go to Mexico and I lose my passport and I can't show it when they want to show it to me at a hotel, which they would require it, I'd be in big trouble. And yet he thinks asking someone who has already been stopped by a policeman, by for some other reason, a traffic stop or something, asked about, asked to show documents that he is here legally in the country, that that is a huge affront.

You stay away from nationalizing an election and stay away from Obama and Pelosi and the Democratic agenda in Congress, you have a chance.

He had the president of Mexico here and had to pay a certain amount of lip service and welcome him to a manner he's accustomed and should be treated. He also has Hispanic Americans and Hispanics in Congress he needs to throw a bone to. They clearly want comprehensive reform, immigration reform. He has got to appeal to them. And then the Arizona law, which polls show is fairly popular. More than 60 percent of the American public thinks this is good thing. I think the president has to — it's a delicate balancing act for him."

I don't think he has the Democrats. He said there is probably 12 Senate Democrats that don't have any interest in looking at this, and certainly not in 2010. Comprehensive immigration reform, there is no time for it and there is no appetite for it."

President Calderon said he wanted to be respectful of the policy of the United States. And then he was disrespectful. This is a man who has no standing to criticize American policies on immigration. Bret, do you know how much Mexico does to stop illegal immigrants from entering the United States? Zip, zilch, nothing. So then he lets them in against our laws and then criticizes our laws which might crack down on them. Look, if I go to Mexico and I lose my passport and I can't show it when they want to show it to me at a hotel, which they would require it, I'd be in big trouble. And yet he thinks asking someone who has already been stopped by a policeman, by for some other reason, a traffic stop or something, asked about, asked to show documents that he is here legally in the country, that that is a huge affront. Look, President Calderon has no standing to criticize Arizona or the United States on this issue."

I think it will become an issue because I think Obama before his election campaign will want to appease the Hispanic constituency that's left on the issue. But I think it's a loser. In the long run, I think Republicans, the Karl Rove idea that Hispanics are a growing population and you don't want to alienate them, and that's why he was in favor of comprehensive reform. But in the shorter run, in the next year or two or three with these amazingly high numbers supporting the Arizona law, it's a loser. I think Republicans would welcome a debate on this in 2011 and '12."

Yesterday, we learned that Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano had not read — they both said they glanced at it. We don't know whether President Obama read it or not. He talked like he looked at the statute actually, but no one asked about it. There is bit of a disconnect about what is being said and what is actually in the law."

To build a wall that hasn't been built along the southern border, or at least increase the security many times to stop illegal immigration. If you don't do that first, you don't get comprehensive reform. And if President Obama wants that he better understand that."

He said he would have voted against the Obama Democratic health care bill. He said he would have voted against cap and trade. This is a guy who got to the right of the Republican candidate and accused the Republican of being a tax raiser. So look, a Democrat — and it's true. If Democratic candidates do that, repudiate their own party all over the country, they will win a lot of seats."

And I think the message that the Democrats got on Capitol Hill today beyond the fact that, oh, my goodness, maybe it's not the tsunami we thought it would be in November, was, hey, you guys need to run your district. What I'm going to be interested to see is how they re-calibrate or how they go forward. Are they going to say, all right, we'll stick to the plan for the safe votes and we're not going to force, you know, don't ask, don't tell and immigration reform and some of the really sticky toxic issues down the throats of the vulnerable members that really they can't afford to take them."

But I think it's reminiscent of what happened in New York 23 in the elections last November where Republicans swept in Virginia and they swept in New Jersey statewide races. But the one race they lost was a House race, which was localized. The issues were localized. Here again, across the board, it was a good night last night for Republicans, but this House race, I think it demonstrated if you run in your district on local issues, you stay close to the ground. You stay away from nationalizing an election and stay away from Obama and Pelosi and the Democratic agenda in Congress, you have a chance. I think that there was hubris among Republicans, and I would be included on, this on election night on January 19th after Massachusetts. It's not a slam dunk that it will be a complete sweep in November."
