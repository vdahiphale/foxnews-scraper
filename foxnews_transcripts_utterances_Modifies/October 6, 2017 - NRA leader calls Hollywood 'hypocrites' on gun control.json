I mean, if you took out every gun from every movie you'll have a lot of people walking around like this. But I don't know if there's a correlation between violent movies and violence. What I do know, if you look, there's a lot of literature on video games. And the reason why young mask shooters have such a high kill ratio, even though they are in the military at all is because the best training program you can buy is a first-person shooter video game. So you have these kids that do head shots and -- that's an interesting correlation that links a billion dollar industry with something pretty ugly that nobody wants to talk about. I think that both sides can be right on this. I think the NRA is correct. I mean, every gun -- wherever there's a gun ban, murder rates go up. So we know that a lot of these laws don't work. And the only people who obey these laws are people who obey laws. So that's no effect on the criminal.",

If you knew there was an additive that you put to a food that made the food toxic and you knew that, you would take it off the market. So you can both be right on this.

JASON CHAFFETZ, \"THE FIVE\" CO-HOST: Well, there's almost as many guns as there are people in the United States. I happen to own five of them. I'm a member of the NBA. And nobody is going to come and take my guns away. And the good people who are law-abiding citizens have a constitutional right to have one. That's the obvious. But there are things that we can do regarding mental health and populating the database, the national database with those that don't have the mental capacity to distinguish right from wrong. We need an ATF director. We've only had one Senate-confirmed ATF director since 2006. So there are a lot of things that we can do -- wouldn't necessarily solve, you know, Las Vegas, but there is common ground. And instead of polarizing this and say, we have to get everything and other people say we're not going to do anything.

And so, they're frustrated that legislation always comes on the heels of something like this mass shooting, which, as I agree, we should do what we can, but if it's not actually prevent these type of mass shootings, then why should we infringe other people's rights?  KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, \"THE FIVE\" CO-HOST: Well, right. And of course, people would like to, you know, paint a fresh stroke across and say, it's the NRA, it's their fault, and people who are gun owners in America, you know, you bear the burden here. But the NRA came out with very responsible and said, listen, let's put this to the ATF, like the Congressman said. They're the ones that should be making the determinations as to whether or not it is legally comply with the current laws and are within those restrictions. Otherwise, what you have is one failed attempt after the next to politicize the issue, take it to Congress, put legislation, and say, OK, we've done something. We feel good about it. And try to ban, you know, bump stocks.   But then, guess what? There's going another form of innovation and then you're going to take it to legislation again, then outlawed that. So you have to have some streamlined to the process which is the ATF. But then politics comes into play again because you haven't been able to get people properly confirmed in that area. So you just really just shows and highlights the inefficiently of dealing with legislation, dealing with Congress. But at the same time, you can't just do something and react in a way because there's a powerful emotion and a devastating loss of life and you say we're going to legislate, and little by little chip away at the Second Amendment right. I mean, this was legal. He had twelve, it's outrageous. Let's look at this individual like they're doing -- doing a deep dive on his entire life and background and seeing everything about him, what he did, what he purchased, who he associated with, because there is an explanation here for why this happened.",

That's the bottom line. I think she's tapping into a sort of a feeling, you know, that's out there to be distinguished. Greg, we started talking about this the other day when President Obama talked about people clinging to guns and religions, he was using that as a put down to people that weren't voting for him, or for conservatives, or people that support the second amendment are actually in support of the Constitution.   Next thing I wanted to touch on was there is a 2005 law called the protectable of lawful commerce and arms act, and it was brought forward in the '90s and early 2000 because the amount of litigation towards gun manufacturers to protect them from frivolous lawsuits and not hold them accountable. If they had legally complied and put forward an item like a bump stock that was legal at the time, they can't be held responsible for loss of life in terms of the liability. However, they will be held responsible and the law will not protect a defect in a manufacturing, and that's how you distinguish it.",

It takes time for the police to get there. It takes them 70 minutes, in some cases, or longer or shorter. But -- the only variable that reduces death is the time it takes to get a second gun there.

I mean, if you took out every gun from every movie you'll have a lot of people walking around like this. But I don't know if there's a correlation between violent movies and violence. What I do know, if you look, there's a lot of literature on video games. And the reason why young mask shooters have such a high kill ratio, even though they are in the military at all is because the best training program you can buy is a first-person shooter video game. So you have these kids that do head shots and -- that's an interesting correlation that links a billion dollar industry with something pretty ugly that nobody wants to talk about. I think that both sides can be right on this. I think the NRA is correct. I mean, every gun -- wherever there's a gun ban, murder rates go up. So we know that a lot of these laws don't work.

Whatever the process is, I'm not an expert. It doesn't hurt to say, OK, let's stop this. If you knew there was an additive that you put to a food that made the food toxic and you knew that, you would take it off the market. So you can both be right on this. And I do understand people can make these. And by the way, you can shoot a gun without these stocks. There's a technique for doing it, so this isn't going to prevent these things, but it might reduce it or make it harder. I don't see why you can't be on both -- both can be on the same side on this."

JASON CHAFFETZ, \"THE FIVE\" CO-HOST: Well, there's almost as many guns as there are people in the United States. I happen to own five of them. I'm a member of the NBA. And nobody is going to come and take my guns away. And the good people who are law-abiding citizens have a constitutional right to have one. That's the obvious. But there are things that we can do regarding mental health and populating the database, the national database with those that don't have the mental capacity to distinguish right from wrong. We need an ATF director. We've only had one Senate-confirmed ATF director since 2006. So there are a lot of things that we can do -- wouldn't necessarily solve, you know, Las Vegas, but there is common ground. And instead of polarizing this and say, we have to get everything and other people say we're not going to do anything.

And that was their frustration yesterday that law-abiding citizens who -- and member of the NRA that know how to properly use weapons are not necessarily the ones who are doing these crimes, these types of mass shootings. And so, they're frustrated that legislation always comes on the heels of something like this mass shooting, which, as I agree, we should do what we can, but if it's not actually prevent these type of mass shootings, then why should we infringe other people's rights? KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE, \"THE FIVE\" CO-HOST: Well, right. And of course, people would like to, you know, paint a fresh stroke across and say, it's the NRA, it's their fault, and people who are gun owners in America, you know, you bear the burden here. But the NRA came out with very responsible and said, listen, let's put this to the ATF, like the Congressman said. They're the ones that should be making the determinations as to whether or not it is legally comply with the current laws and are within those restrictions. Otherwise, what you have is one failed attempt after the next to politicize the issue, take it to Congress, put legislation, and say, OK, we've done something. We feel good about it. And try to ban, you know, bump stocks. But then, guess what? There's going another form of innovation and then you're going to take it to legislation again, then outlawed that. So you have to have some streamlined to the process which is the ATF. But then politics comes into play again because you haven't been able to get people properly confirmed in that area. So you just really just shows and highlights the inefficiently of dealing with legislation, dealing with Congress. But at the same time, you can't just do something and react in a way because there's a powerful emotion and a devastating loss of life and you say we're going to legislate, and little by little chip away at the Second Amendment right. I mean, this was legal. He had twelve, it's outrageous. Let's look at this individual like they're doing -- doing a deep dive on his entire life and background and seeing everything about him, what he did, what he purchased, who he associated with, because there is an explanation here for why this happened."

And it's not going to be, essentially, just laws. I'm fine. Go after the bump stocks. The fact is you don't need one of those to fire a gun as an automatic. There are ways you can get around that. It's very easy. So this is again is a symbolic gesture. And a lot of these laws are symbolic gestures. And the problem with symbolic gestures is they replace action. So you think, oh, we've got this thing done and everything is good. Instead of actually thinking about real prevention, which is high-tech prevention, using drones so that when you have an outdoor event, you have swarming drones that protect the people out there, who can look around, because that's where the next threat is.

That's the bottom line. I think she's tapping into a sort of a feeling, you know, that's out there to be distinguished. Greg, we started talking about this the other day when President Obama talked about people clinging to guns and religions, he was using that as a put down to people that weren't voting for him, or for conservatives, or people that support the second amendment are actually in support of the Constitution. Next thing I wanted to touch on was there is a 2005 law called the protectable of lawful commerce and arms act, and it was brought forward in the '90s and early 2000 because the amount of litigation towards gun manufacturers to protect them from frivolous lawsuits and not hold them accountable. If they had legally complied and put forward an item like a bump stock that was legal at the time, they can't be held responsible for loss of life in terms of the liability. However, they will be held responsible and the law will not protect a defect in a manufacturing, and that's how you distinguish it."

But there's research out there that shows that arm citizens responding to mass killings or mass attack rampage, rampage killings, result in one eighth of the casualties. And the reason is obvious. It takes time for the police to get there. It takes them 70 minutes, in some cases, or longer or shorter. But -- the only variable that reduces death is the time it takes to get a second gun there. So, you know, it's the non-gun owning families living in areas where people own guns that should be grateful because there might be somebody in your neighborhood that owns a gun."

If other countries think that Donald Trump is so serious that he will go after North Korea if they cross a red line, I think that can be helpful.

And as he talked to them, he said now watch this. If my move my hand like this, all the cameras are going to go off.

They're not going to work for law enforcement? And I'm sorry, but the Obama administration is the one that released 86,000 people that were here illegally, got caught committing a crime, then instead of deporting them, release them back out into the public, 86,000.

Until there's senseless loss of lives because you're creating a gap into communication between the feds and between local law enforcement, so that people who are on the ground with the most information about who the people are in their states and who are committing the crimes now cannot talk to the feds to let them know and communicate. So then we're going to see more crimes like the loss of life of Kate Steinle. So how is the governor going to feel about that? When crimes like that that can be prevented -- OK, because of the revolving door, because everyone takes his hands off approach because they care more about politics and public safety and lives, this is what the result is going to be.

Meantime, police confirmed reports of explosives found in Paddock's car, along with 1,600 rounds of animation. The plan may have been to detonate a car bomb. The explosives were not in the form of pipe bombs or other IEDs. And there are reports today that Paddock's girlfriend, Marilou Danley, has told investigators that recently Paddock has occasionally woken in the middle of the night agitated, moaning, and he also apparently has gained a lot of weight recently and also became obsessed with Danley's ex-husband.

And I think it's because they're feeling a little bit frustrated, because this wasn't somebody that left any kind of real digital footprint to give some clues as to who he was associating with. And that's why they're doing this deep dive, going back so many years. Also especially concentrating on the last five years in terms of any contacts, any associates, any affiliations. That's why his girlfriend was so important and integral to the investigation. Because right away, they were able to get some of his items, you know, personal items and telephones, et cetera, to see what's on there. But this is obviously a person of very high intelligence. There's something that went wrong. There was some kind of catalyst or some kind of intervening factor, incident, association, contact that he had and also perhaps a different change in his mental state. But what we see is that he wasn't criminally insane to the point that he wasn't able to premeditate and plan and carefully think out and try some different venues in terms of booking rooms, making charges in advance to be able to do this, versus some of the cash items we talked about on Dana's show, purchasing homes for large, hundreds of thousands of dollars, three hundred and, you know, fifty thousand dollars."

We can't. That's not who we are as Americans. That's not what we can do. But we also have to recognize that we have a ton of soft targets in America, right? Every, you know, huge sporting event, concert. And most people don't want to stand in line in a magnetometer for three hours before the concert, right?"

Could've been a brain tumor like Charles Woodman in the Texas tower. But he deliberately, it seems to me, left -- he disappeared. And I think that this might be just an exercise in \"What if I could do this\" and a purely evil thing that -- and if somebody puts their mind to it and that mind has a high I.Q., they could do it. Having said that, hardening soft targets should be an industry. It should be an industry as big as the entertainment industry, media, academia. It should be a major. You should be overpaid for it.
