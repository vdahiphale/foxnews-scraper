That nuclear attack that they say wasn't a purposeful attack on that facility, and it's done no harm, has now excited worldwide alarm. The secretary of state saying it is an inexcusable potential nuclear catastrophe barely averted. Europe feels the same way. Britain leading a charge to have the U.N. look into all of this, all of this on the same day we realize that NATO has gone ahead and done what pretty much everyone thought it would do, but Ukrainians hoped it would never do, rule out a no-fly zone over Ukraine. Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto. And this is \"Your World,\" and what a world today, as the Russian assault on Ukraine widens and gets more targeted, creeping toward Kyiv, this at the same time, we're learning that the European Union is looking at additional sanctions, and controversy brewing in Washington on getting the president on board with making sure no Russian oil makes its way into this country. He's even getting that pressure from fellow Democrats. We are on all of it with Benjamin Hall in Kyiv with the latest and how those there now are getting worried very, very worried. We have also got the British ambassador to the United States, Karen Pierce, back with us to assess what we can do and what the Western world is trying to do to avert the crisis from getting even worse than it is, and Jennifer Griffin at the Pentagon and, again, making official a no-fly zone is not coming to Ukraine. We begin right now with Benjamin Hall in Kyiv -- Ben.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Neil, hi. Look, you're absolutely right. There's no doubt that Putin's forces are making a push, a significant push around the country. We see it from the north, the south, the east, cities like Kharkiv, which have been bombed extensively, Mariupol now surrounded, that move towards Odessa, and still pushing towards Kyiv. One of the big concerns still is that nuclear facility, not so much for the threat of a nuclear accident or for Putin to weaponize that, but for the power it gives him. This is a nuclear station that controls 25 percent of this country's energy. And it allows him to effectively turn off power to so many people right now in the dead of winter. It gives him power and influence over this war, just another weapon in his arsenal. But his arsenal, of course, is multifaceted, and it is strong. And we have seen those attacks continue on urban areas, continue on civilians, a school being hit. A few schools have been hit, but another one which almost destroyed the whole thing. Hospitals also have been hit. Yesterday, we heard about civilians; 33 died in Chernihiv in a strike. So there's no doubt there's an escalation going on at the moment. Russian tanks also now continuing to move into the Kyiv area. And we have seen that very much in the last couple of days. We talked a lot about the convoy, the 40-mile-long convoy which was heading down. Was it stalled? Did it break down? Were there logistical problems? Well, it does seem as if it is waiting on the border of Kyiv waiting to come in. And here inside the city, there is that feeling that it might come and it might come soon. It's certainly a lot more of an active night in the city itself. And I can tell you, if we just come back to the scene here, that it's been a night. Every sort of half-hour, we hear thuds of artillery. We have heard some gunfire not too far away from us. We have seen the occasional flash on the horizon, so certainly more action tonight than we have seen for the last few nights, some people saying that the cloud cover has lifted today. We have had significant cloud cover over the last couple of days. People here in Kyiv, frankly, are afraid. They're afraid of when Russia might come in, but they're defiant too. They're going to fight back. You walk around the streets here and they are empty. This is usually a bustling city of three million. But there are no one -- there's no one out today. The barriers are up, the sandbags are up, the tank traps are up on every corner. The only people you see now are soldiers bracing, bracing for what might come next. But the feeling is that Vladimir Putin might start softening up this city before a ground invasion. And perhaps that's what we're starting to see tonight with those artillery thuds and the flashes that we see -- Neil.",

Ambassador, very good to see you again. Obviously, things are getting, to say dicier there is an understatement. But, effectively, NATO made clear today that they are not opting for a no-fly zone, as many Ukrainians had hoped. Ukrainians are saying, while they understand that, many of them fear that it could be a mistake, and that it's only going to encourage dangerous behavior by Vladimir Putin and a green light for that, that will ultimately threaten other NATO countries, NATO countries down the road, and that it's a longer-term mistake.

Unfortunately, the Russians have air superiority. And all our experience tells us that you can't impose no-fly zones against an adversary with air superiority in the region. And, moreover, that would bring NATO into direct confrontation with Russian military forces. And NATO has been very ready to stress to the Russians that NATO is not a threat to Russia. We will, however, defend our territory. That goes to your second point. We have moved NATO reinforcements, including British reinforcements, American reinforcements, into NATO's southern and eastern flank. And we are ready to defend NATO territory. NATO is not a threat to Russia, however. Very disturbing to see the attack on the nuclear power station from Russia. It looks like Russia just wants to find new ways to violate international law.",

And that tribunal will hold individuals responsible for the attacks on civilians in Ukraine, for the attack on the power station, which is against the Geneva Convention, fundamentally the laws of war. And the significance of that is that Russian generals on the ground now in Ukraine are individually accountable for what awful acts, atrocities are being committed on the ground. And in addition to the Human Rights Council, the International Criminal Court has decided to open an investigation into alleged war crimes in Ukraine. That's something we were closely involved in with 37 other partners. That went through yesterday, so, again, a sign of international condemnation and outrage and horror, but also steps that will eventually lead to individual responsibility and accountability, not just for President Putin, but for his generals.",

But it has not deterred him. And now we're learning that the Russians are unaware of what's going on.

I think it is degrading his ability to wage the war. We have seen that by the slowness and the difficulties and the obstacles the Russian military are actually encountering in Ukraine, alongside, of course, that heroic resistance of the Ukrainian people. As far as the Russian people go, we have always known that President Putin would cut off sources of information to them. One of the tasks I think that lies ahead is, how do we get that information into Russia? But I think, if you look at some of the Russian families who've already lost sons and daughters to the fighting, I think they well understand exactly what it is that President Putin has sent their children to, and they don't like it.

They were being done under duress, and the best that they could get were some words, empty words, from the Russians about setting up humanitarian corridors. We have seen no evidence of it yet.

But, again, those are outside of Ukrainian airspace. NATO and the U.S. stopped flying in Ukrainian airspace the second that the Russians began the war and began their invasion, because there was so much flying in the air and there is contested airspace.

And that deconfliction line was set up at European Command headquarters in Stuttgart under the command of the supreme allied commander, General Tod Wolters. It's staffed by a lower staffer, but it goes directly to the Russian Ministry of Defense. But what is alarming is that we have no confirmation that that hot line was used last night at that moment of crisis when the fire broke out and the gunfire and attack on that nuclear facility. We don't have any indications that the hot line was used. And if any time there was a moment where a hot line could be used. We also learned at the press briefing today that General Mark Milley and the defense secretary, Lloyd Austin, have not spoken to their counterparts since this has started.

I normally don't like to bore you with too many, many charts. Sometimes, I do that on FOX business. But this is an interesting commodities chart. It charts everything, from wheat, and soybeans, barley, corn, and all that other stuff, to lumber and, of course, oil. It is now at the highest point it's been since 1970, when Richard Nixon was president. And you talk about oil prices running up. Take a look at what's gone on with wheat and corn and soybeans. And that is in this short period the run- up that will not stop. Take a look what happened to oil today, up better than eight bucks, this week alone, this week alone, up 26 percent. Since before the crisis, it has effectively doubled. No wonder all the major market averages were down.

We're stopping the advances from the northeast. We're stopping the advances in the east. Nobody was expecting the Ukrainian forces to be doing this well. We're having some problems in the south, one of which is the report that you had on the power plant. About the power plant, by the way, it's in a place called Enerhodar, which is a tiny little town that basically is a one-horse town. It does nothing else except serve the nuclear power plant. Before the Russians came in, civilians walked out in the streets and greeted them and said: We want nothing to do with you. And if you walk in, we will resist. That was the reason that they bombed the place, because they were expecting to just walk in and occupy. They haven't been able to do that. And they're not going to be able to do that. This country could be overrun, but it will never be occupied. There is no possibility of this country ever being occupied. In order to occupy, you have to have a population that will actually listen to what you have to say, listen to your orders. The Russians are invaders. They will never be listened to. So, today's no-fly zone refusal basically means that we're on our own. We're fighting. But it also means that Putin is going to escalate. And you, Americans, I'm sorry, but you're not going to be able to avoid this fight, because the next point after he sees that he can't occupy the place, he is going to escalate further He's going to do an attack on NATO, He's going to do an attack either on the Baltics, or on Romania, or on Bulgaria or somewhere else. It's not something -- all you have done is postponed the fight, and probably made it nuclear. That's reality. This place is not giving up.

      "utterance": "Last night, the Russians attacked it. Today, they own everything around it. That nuclear attack that they say wasn't a purposeful attack on that facility, and it's done no harm, has now excited worldwide alarm. The secretary of state saying it is an inexcusable potential nuclear catastrophe barely averted. Europe feels the same way. Britain leading a charge to have the U.N. look into all of this, all of this on the same day we realize that NATO has gone ahead and done what pretty much everyone thought it would do, but Ukrainians hoped it would never do, rule out a no-fly zone over Ukraine. Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto. And this is \"Your World,\" and what a world today, as the Russian assault on Ukraine widens and gets more targeted, creeping toward Kyiv, this at the same time, we're learning that the European Union is looking at additional sanctions, and controversy brewing in Washington on getting the president on board with making sure no Russian oil makes its way into this country. He's even getting that pressure from fellow Democrats. We are on all of it with Benjamin Hall in Kyiv with the latest and how those there now are getting worried very, very worried. We have also got the British ambassador to the United States, Karen Pierce, back with us to assess what we can do and what the Western world is trying to do to avert the crisis from getting even worse than it is, and Jennifer Griffin at the Pentagon and, again, making official a no-fly zone is not coming to Ukraine. We begin right now with Benjamin Hall in Kyiv -- Ben."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BENJAMIN HALL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Yes, Neil, hi. Look, you're absolutely right. There's no doubt that Putin's forces are making a push, a significant push around the country. We see it from the north, the south, the east, cities like Kharkiv, which have been bombed extensively, Mariupol now surrounded, that move towards Odessa, and still pushing towards Kyiv. One of the big concerns still is that nuclear facility, not so much for the threat of a nuclear accident or for Putin to weaponize that, but for the power it gives him. This is a nuclear station that controls 25 percent of this country's energy. And it allows him to effectively turn off power to so many people right now in the dead of winter. It gives him power and influence over this war, just another weapon in his arsenal. But his arsenal, of course, is multifaceted, and it is strong. And we have seen those attacks continue on urban areas, continue on civilians, a school being hit. A few schools have been hit, but another one which almost destroyed the whole thing. Hospitals also have been hit. Yesterday, we heard about civilians; 33 died in Chernihiv in a strike. So there's no doubt there's an escalation going on at the moment. Russian tanks also now continuing to move into the Kyiv area. And we have seen that very much in the last couple of days. We talked a lot about the convoy, the 40-mile-long convoy which was heading down. Was it stalled? Did it break down? Were there logistical problems? Well, it does seem as if it is waiting on the border of Kyiv waiting to come in. And here inside the city, there is that feeling that it might come and it might come soon. It's certainly a lot more of an active night in the city itself. And I can tell you, if we just come back to the scene here, that it's been a night. Every sort of half-hour, we hear thuds of artillery. We have heard some gunfire not too far away from us. We have seen the occasional flash on the horizon, so certainly more action tonight than we have seen for the last few nights, some people saying that the cloud cover has lifted today. We have had significant cloud cover over the last couple of days. People here in Kyiv, frankly, are afraid. They're afraid of when Russia might come in, but they're defiant too. They're going to fight back. You walk around the streets here and they are empty. This is usually a bustling city of three million. But there are no one -- there's no one out today. The barriers are up, the sandbags are up, the tank traps are up on every corner. The only people you see now are soldiers bracing, bracing for what might come next. But the feeling is that Vladimir Putin might start softening up this city before a ground invasion. And perhaps that's what we're starting to see tonight with those artillery thuds and the flashes that we see -- Neil."

Ambassador, very good to see you again. Obviously, things are getting, to say dicier there is an understatement. But, effectively, NATO made clear today that they are not opting for a no-fly zone, as many Ukrainians had hoped. Ukrainians are saying, while they understand that, many of them fear that it could be a mistake, and that it's only going to encourage dangerous behavior by Vladimir Putin and a green light for that, that will ultimately threaten other NATO countries, NATO countries down the road, and that it's a longer-term mistake.

Unfortunately, the Russians have air superiority. And all our experience tells us that you can't impose no-fly zones against an adversary with air superiority in the region. And, moreover, that would bring NATO into direct confrontation with Russian military forces. And NATO has been very ready to stress to the Russians that NATO is not a threat to Russia. We will, however, defend our territory. That goes to your second point. We have moved NATO reinforcements, including British reinforcements, American reinforcements, into NATO's southern and eastern flank. And we are ready to defend NATO territory. NATO is not a threat to Russia, however. Very disturbing to see the attack on the nuclear power station from Russia. It looks like Russia just wants to find new ways to violate international law."

      "speaker": "PIERCE",

Security Council that your reporter alluded to just now, including from the International Atomic Energy authority. But in one way, I don't know whether it's worse that they meant to hit the power station or whether that they hit it accidentally, in other words, they don't have their data under control, they don't have their targeting under control. But, fundamentally, the problem is that Russia has invaded Ukraine, and it needs to turn its tanks around and go home."

    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Now, under the leadership of Boris Johnson, of course, the prime minister of Britain, the U.N.'s top human rights body is looking into this one, wants to even separately establish a commission to look into human rights abuses. And joining this attack on this nuclear facility adds yet another piece of evidence of that. Where is this going? I mean, when you look at human rights abuses and all of this, in the middle of an ongoing attack, Vladimir Putin must just shrug his shoulders. What do you think?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIERCE",
      "utterance": "I think if Putin behaved in an ordinary way, we'd never be in this situation. So I take your point. But as an expression of global condemnation, what the Human Rights Council is doing is very helpful. And it does mean that evidence will be collected, and one day it will be given to a judicial tribunal. And that tribunal will hold individuals responsible for the attacks on civilians in Ukraine, for the attack on the power station, which is against the Geneva Convention, fundamentally the laws of war. And the significance of that is that Russian generals on the ground now in Ukraine are individually accountable for what awful acts, atrocities are being committed on the ground. And in addition to the Human Rights Council, the International Criminal Court has decided to open an investigation into alleged war crimes in Ukraine. That's something we were closely involved in with 37 other partners. That went through yesterday, so, again, a sign of international condemnation and outrage and horror, but also steps that will eventually lead to individual responsibility and accountability, not just for President Putin, but for his generals."
    },

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Would these sanctions that are in effect and the punishments that Britain and the European Union have put on Vladimir Putin, do you expect them to stay in effect, no matter how Ukraine works out, and we hope well - - it looks obviously unpredictable for the moment -- but that these measures you have taken against Putin and Russia stay if he stays, if he doesn't go away?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIERCE",
      "utterance": "They're not particularly -- the sanctions are not expressly linked to President Putin personally, except for the sanctions that are on him and Foreign Minister Lavrov, of course. Fundamentally, the sanctions are about degrading his ability to spend money to wage this war. So they will stay as long as the war is being waged."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "But it hasn't degraded his ability, right? Does that worry you? And I know, to be fair, not all of these have kicked in. But there does seem to have been some strategy ahead of this for him to plan for this, build up enough sovereign funds or hide them away or get them out of the reach of bankers. We don't know. But it has not deterred him. And now we're learning that the Russians are unaware of what's going on. They can feel it at banks and waiting on long lines and all of that and having limited access to their money, but, beyond that, we're told overwhelming number of Russian citizens see this as a Western cabal against their country. What you think of that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PIERCE",
      "utterance": "Well, I think, obviously, deterrence didn't work, but it was right to try. When we saw that deterrence hadn't worked, the G7 countries in particular, U.S., U.K., Europe, Japan, Canada, we put a sweeping sanctions on the Russian economy. I think it is degrading his ability to wage the war. We have seen that by the slowness and the difficulties and the obstacles the Russian military are actually encountering in Ukraine, alongside, of course, that heroic resistance of the Ukrainian people. As far as the Russian people go, we have always known that President Putin would cut off sources of information to them. One of the tasks I think that lies ahead is, how do we get that information into Russia? But I think, if you look at some of the Russian families who've already lost sons and daughters to the fighting, I think they well understand exactly what it is that President Putin has sent their children to, and they don't like it. And it is our job to try and bring that home to the majority of the Russian people."

I know there has been this agreement between the countries, that is, Ukraine and Russia, to have this humanitarian carve-out here to protect those trying to leave the country, to get aid into the country. But what's to stop the Russians from saying, that's not aid, that's military supplies? Then what?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JENNIFER GRIFFIN, FOX NEWS NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Well, Neil, we have just -- we haven't seen any evidence that the Russians have begun to establish any of those humanitarian corridors. Remember, those negotiations with the Ukrainian leaders who went up to Belarus to meet with them for two -- they have been there two times. There are three sets of meetings that are supposed to take place. They were being done under duress, and the best that they could get were some words, empty words, from the Russians about setting up humanitarian corridors. We have seen no evidence of it yet. And, again, I think, as Ambassador Pierce said, it's going to be back to trust, but verify. The problem is, NATO is not going to set up those humanitarian corridors. They're not going to set up a no-fly zone. Officials have explained to us that that would put them in direct conflict with the Russians, unless, of course, the Russian to ask NATO to come in to do that. But I doubt that it's going to happen -- Neil."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "So taking a look at what's happening, and how the Pentagon sees it -- and we understand you and I have talked about this for quite some time here about Ukrainians' hope against hope that maybe a no-fly zone could be established over Ukraine. NATO making it official, echoing what we thought and what you have reported, it's not happening. But I do want to -- and I did speak to John Kirby yesterday. I was made aware -- and you know this far better than I -- that that doesn't mean we're not flying around the country and checking things going on there. And I was trying to get how close we get to Ukraine when we do that. But I imagine the skies immediately around Ukraine are busy. I'm just wondering what you're hearing on that front."

But, again, those are outside of Ukrainian airspace. NATO and the U.S. stopped flying in Ukrainian airspace the second that the Russians began the war and began their invasion, because there was so much flying in the air and there is contested airspace. The Ukrainians still have parts of their air force still intact. That's kind of miraculous at this point in time."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "GRIFFIN",
      "utterance": "But the NATO forces are not flying inside -- even surveillance flights inside Ukraine. What's interesting, Neil -- and we have been reporting on this -- is that deconfliction hot line that was established on March 1. We got more details about that today. And that deconfliction line was set up at European Command headquarters in Stuttgart under the command of the supreme allied commander, General Tod Wolters. It's staffed by a lower staffer, but it goes directly to the Russian Ministry of Defense. But what is alarming is that we have no confirmation that that hot line was used last night at that moment of crisis when the fire broke out and the gunfire and attack on that nuclear facility. We don't have any indications that the hot line was used. And if any time there was a moment where a hot line could be used. We also learned at the press briefing today that General Mark Milley and the defense secretary, Lloyd Austin, have not spoken to their counterparts since this has started. So the lack of communication and ability to deconflict between Russia and NATO is still quite significant, despite that telephone hot line having been set up."

      "utterance": "To raise a point -- and I'm sorry to belabor all these other side issues here, but that attack on the reactor, and whether the Russians accidentally or deliberately were strategizing that, it came within 1,500 feet from the reactor. That's as close as you can get."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GRIFFIN",
      "utterance": "Neil, you can't -- you can't really overstate how serious that was last night. And you heard the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations say that a disaster was narrowly averted. But Russian troops are now in control of the largest nuclear power plant in Europe. And it is not clear that they have experts there that know how to run that facility. They likely have kept some of the Ukrainian experts there keeping it online. But will this become a weapon in Russia's attempt to pressure the Ukrainians, to pressure Europe? It is still very, very dangerous. And there are 15 other nuclear facilities like that in Ukraine, and including Chernobyl, which Russia has control of right now."

I normally don't like to bore you with too many, many charts. Sometimes, I do that on FOX business. But this is an interesting commodities chart. It charts everything, from wheat, and soybeans, barley, corn, and all that other stuff, to lumber and, of course, oil. It is now at the highest point it's been since 1970, when Richard Nixon was president. And you talk about oil prices running up. Take a look at what's gone on with wheat and corn and soybeans. And that is in this short period the run- up that will not stop. Take a look what happened to oil today, up better than eight bucks, this week alone, this week alone, up 26 percent. Since before the crisis, it has effectively doubled. No wonder all the major market averages were down. In case you're counting, that's the fourth straight down week for stocks, and all because we don't know where this is going. We just know where prices are going. And they're going up and up and up. More after this."

That help is not coming. We are not touching the air zone over Ukraine. We will get her reaction to that tomorrow, Saturday.

We're stopping the advances from the northeast. We're stopping the advances in the east. Nobody was expecting the Ukrainian forces to be doing this well. We're having some problems in the south, one of which is the report that you had on the power plant.

There is no possibility of this country ever being occupied. In order to occupy, you have to have a population that will actually listen to what you have to say, listen to your orders. The Russians are invaders. They will never be listened to. So, today's no-fly zone refusal basically means that we're on our own. We're fighting. But it also means that Putin is going to escalate. And you, Americans, I'm sorry, but you're not going to be able to avoid this fight, because the next point after he sees that he can't occupy the place, he is going to escalate further He's going to do an attack on NATO, He's going to do an attack either on the Baltics, or on Romania, or on Bulgaria or somewhere else. It's not something -- all you have done is postponed the fight, and probably made it nuclear. That's reality. This place is not giving up.

      "utterance": "We have absolutely no plans to invade Ukraine. It's hype, it's hysteria. The West is spreading misinformation. Well, I'm sorry, how can one believe a single word that's coming from the Kremlin? Unfortunately, one cannot. I mean, this is a regime that is broken, all boundaries, all norms of international law. So, they say they're going to allow a humanitarian..."

      "utterance": "So, if he doesn't honor this, Ambassador, if he doesn't honor it, to your point -- let's say he's not going to allow aid to come in, because he will say, well, it's military aid that's coming in, I won't allow it. The situation gets worse. How do we respond to that?"

      "utterance": "Well, as of today, there is humanitarian aid that is flowing in. The problem is that it's not getting to all the population centers that need it, especially in the east in places like Kharkiv and Kherson. And so we're going to have to continue to work at that. But the West is dedicated to providing Ukraine with the arms to defend itself, with weapons, with other forms of assistance. And humanitarian aid is being prepositioned and is actually flowing across the border. But a no-fly zone, as you know..."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "But if you're getting that in, you're getting it into areas controlled by the Ukrainians -- you mentioned Kherson and some of these others that have now since fallen to the Russians. So can aid get to those regions?"

      "speaker": "CARPENTER",
      "utterance": "Well, it's going to be difficult. And that's why we have got to try to get a humanitarian pause, so that the supplies can reach those affected areas. But I'm not sure that President Putin is interested in that. I mean, he continues to escalate, despite the fact that now Russia has struck so many civilian targets. He doesn't seem to care. He just continues to go and go and go. And so we will continue to ratchet up the costs for this barbaric attack on Ukraine. And you're already seeing it. I mean, the Russian, not just the stock market, but the Russian economy is going to take a huge hit in the coming days and weeks."
