He has got as much information as he can. We will go around the table and talk about this a little bit. And, again, Greg, it's remarkable that she was found, 88 days. We don't know a lot how she escaped or how she was being held, but they did find what they think could be the shotgun that murdered her parents.",

Some of the things that stuck out for me, though, I was expecting this to be someone that knew them. And the Sheriff coming out and saying as of right now, no social media connection known, nothing to suggest that there has been contact. There was contact with the suspect and her or her family. Although he did say that the parents worked, I believe, at the same plant. I'm curious that's going to lead to something that maybe the suspect did know them. The Sheriff clearly saying that Jayme was the target, not necessarily sure if she was being stalked. But something's going to come out here, I think, that we're going to discover about the story, because it's a very strange wind-down, to see. And I'm just glad she's OK.

This girl had been missing for three months. Everybody assumed the worst, that she started playing with the puppy.

The thing here is, they don't disagree on the issue. Chuck Schumer believes in border security. He voted for it. He agrees that fencing works. Donald Trump believes that it works. Barack Obama is out there, has been talking about this humanitarian crisis. This is not about the issue on immigration. This is about Donald Trump. This is about the fact that he made it front and center and these Democrats can't stand him and they are making the political fight. They don't want him to be able to run in 2020 and say that he fulfilled a campaign promise. And they don't want him to be right. So if anyone is making this political, it's the people on the left. And they need to make a decision. Look, he is within his authority. I think it was good that he brought up this Emergencies Act of 1976 and talked about his authority to do it. It wasn't a threat, but he was saying listen, if you force me, I'm going to do this, this is not a manufactured crisis.   And all these Democrats talking about race, it always makes me laugh when they say that. More than 51 percent of border patrol agents are Hispanic. This is not about what color you are, whether you're white or you're brown. This is not about that. This is about drugs, this is about human trafficking. And anyone who makes this about race is really, really pathetic in my eyes and doesn't have a strong argument. And maybe, the more they're making that point about race, when President Obama and Chuck Schumer or Nancy Pelosi were all fighting for border security, and voting for border security, no, they weren't. They're making it about race because once again, that is a campaign talking point that they need against Donald Trump. It's a lame and it's not going to stick.",

Because right now, there is just too much intransigence on the side of the Democrats, they are not negotiating. Donald Trump is the only one negotiating and they're not. Let's just think about what happened yesterday, when he was down at the border of McAllen and they have the border patrol agents say that in just one day, they apprehended 135 individuals. In one day. That means they probably missed some. And they were from 41 different countries besides Mexico and Central America. The Chinese, Romanians, Pakistanis. This is not about race, this is about any human being that comes across.   If you are at a party and all of a sudden you don't recognize that person or that person -- you don't recognize that person, it's your house. Who are these people? And then you say, hey, who are you, where are you from? And they go, you know, I just let myself in the backdoor. It was unlocked. That's just not the way to run a party. It's not a way to run a country. And every American can understand that. You just want a sense of who is in your own house and who is in your own country.  Dana said yesterday, and I just want to double down on that, there are cracks that are beginning to show within the Democratic caucus. I saw another interview with the House Democrat that said sure, I'd be willing to vote for a little border patrol fencing, or fencing for the border patrol, that's fine.

For me, and he's just sitting back and saying, I will wait, until you guys tell me what he'll sign. And so, I think that Chuck Schumer can't get it done, so he is like please, Mitch McConnell, bail me out. No, thanks, I think that's actually really a dumb thing to do. The other thing is that the president said something today. The Democrats should have said it, let's do that. He tweeted this morning about h1b visas. This is for your high-tech people, your smarts, like all those brainiacs that you want to have. And he said, I have an idea, why don't we provide you a path to citizenship. Don't go to other places. Come to America, we want you. Why don't they take him up on that deal?  For $5.7 billion, you get border security plus you get some of the things you wanted, dreamers and other things, administration -- administrative law judges.

Political terrorism is when you believe that what is worse than a humanitarian crisis where children are exploited, women are raped, and federal workers go without paychecks, what is worse than that is compromising with Donald Trump. That's actually political terrorism. And it's really refreshing to see so many leftists, you know, cry racism about slowing -- slowing -- illegal immigration, not stopping it. And ignoring how the influx of the illegal immigration actually depresses wages and jobs for minorities. Somehow, they overlook that.  That's all I got.

You've been watching a press conference by the Barron County Sheriff, Chris Fitzgerald, there, taking as many questions as he can on the remarkable story of Jayme Closs escaping her captivity, being found safe and alive. He has got as much information as he can. We will go around the table and talk about this a little bit. And, again, Greg, it's remarkable that she was found, 88 days. We don't know a lot how she escaped or how she was being held, but they did find what they think could be the shotgun that murdered her parents."

I can't imagine how traumatizing this must be for a kid and now her new reality, I know she is with her aunt, reunited with her family. Some of the things that stuck out for me, though, I was expecting this to be someone that knew them. And the Sheriff coming out and saying as of right now, no social media connection known, nothing to suggest that there has been contact. There was contact with the suspect and her or her family. Although he did say that the parents worked, I believe, at the same plant. I'm curious that's going to lead to something that maybe the suspect did know them. The Sheriff clearly saying that Jayme was the target, not necessarily sure if she was being stalked. But something's going to come out here, I think, that we're going to discover about the story, because it's a very strange wind-down, to see. And I'm just glad she's OK. It's actually incredible what she's been through and where she's at right now."

So it's a part now they can really put together and bases. And secondly, that he had shaved his head, again not only to avoid detection, but to avoid leaving here at the scene. And on the touching part that Jedediah was saying, not only is she in good shape, but apparently, when she went into the home of these two people, Kristin and Peter Kasinkas, who said that the wife said it was like seeing a ghost. This girl had been missing for three months. Everybody assumed the worst, that she started playing with the puppy. And that, to me, that's a great sign of her mental health and mental stability, and again, evidence, as you were saying, Dana, that this young woman saved herself, she found a way out."

Very premeditated by shaving his head to eliminate any sort of forensic evidence as well. You know, I just think, right now, everybody is going to flood the zone with producers from 2020 and from Dateline and they're just trying to score an interview with this young girl. And I hope we give her some time to heal before she's ready to come forward. And I know the generosity of this country is going to be there for her, whether it's financial or any type of generosity.

The thing here is, they don't disagree on the issue. Chuck Schumer believes in border security. He voted for it. He agrees that fencing works. Donald Trump believes that it works. Barack Obama is out there, has been talking about this humanitarian crisis. This is not about the issue on immigration. This is about Donald Trump. This is about the fact that he made it front and center and these Democrats can't stand him and they are making the political fight. They don't want him to be able to run in 2020 and say that he fulfilled a campaign promise. And they don't want him to be right. So if anyone is making this political, it's the people on the left. And they need to make a decision. Look, he is within his authority. I think it was good that he brought up this Emergencies Act of 1976 and talked about his authority to do it. It wasn't a threat, but he was saying listen, if you force me, I'm going to do this, this is not a manufactured crisis. And all these Democrats talking about race, it always makes me laugh when they say that. More than 51 percent of border patrol agents are Hispanic. This is not about what color you are, whether you're white or you're brown. This is not about that. This is about drugs, this is about human trafficking. And anyone who makes this about race is really, really pathetic in my eyes and doesn't have a strong argument. And maybe, the more they're making that point about race, when President Obama and Chuck Schumer or Nancy Pelosi were all fighting for border security, and voting for border security, no, they weren't. They're making it about race because once again, that is a campaign talking point that they need against Donald Trump. It's a lame and it's not going to stick."

      "utterance": "I think the end game is some external event is going happen, it's going to shake-up the dynamic. Because right now, there is just too much intransigence on the side of the Democrats, they are not negotiating. Donald Trump is the only one negotiating and they're not. Let's just think about what happened yesterday, when he was down at the border of McAllen and they have the border patrol agents say that in just one day, they apprehended 135 individuals. In one day. That means they probably missed some. And they were from 41 different countries besides Mexico and Central America. The Chinese, Romanians, Pakistanis. This is not about race, this is about any human being that comes across. If you are at a party and all of a sudden you don't recognize that person or that person -- you don't recognize that person, it's your house. Who are these people? And then you say, hey, who are you, where are you from? And they go, you know, I just let myself in the backdoor. It was unlocked. That's just not the way to run a party. It's not a way to run a country. And every American can understand that. You just want a sense of who is in your own house and who is in your own country. Dana said yesterday, and I just want to double down on that, there are cracks that are beginning to show within the Democratic caucus. I saw another interview with the House Democrat that said sure, I'd be willing to vote for a little border patrol fencing, or fencing for the border patrol, that's fine. It's starting to slip and the mainstream media is doing as much as they possibly can to keep that from happening."

There's a poll yesterday that showed this question, who do you blame for the shutdown, 51 percent the president, 35 percent Democrat, 5 percent Mitch McConnell, which means that he is actually -- he has a higher approval rating than he has taken the blame for this issue. For me, and he's just sitting back and saying, I will wait, until you guys tell me what he'll sign. And so, I think that Chuck Schumer can't get it done, so he is like please, Mitch McConnell, bail me out. No, thanks, I think that's actually really a dumb thing to do. The other thing is that the president said something today. The Democrats should have said it, let's do that. He tweeted this morning about h1b visas. This is for your high-tech people, your smarts, like all those brainiacs that you want to have. And he said, I have an idea, why don't we provide you a path to citizenship. Don't go to other places. Come to America, we want you. Why don't they take him up on that deal? For $5.7 billion, you get border security plus you get some of the things you wanted, dreamers and other things, administration -- administrative law judges. I do want to point this out though, we can still have a little bit of fun. You guys remember yesterday. We showed you this from Jim Acosta, down at the border. Take a walk -- take a look."

There are no migrants trying to rush toward this fence here in the McAllen, Texas, area. As a matter of fact, there are some other businesses behind me along this highway.

Political terrorism is when you believe that what is worse than a humanitarian crisis where children are exploited, women are raped, and federal workers go without paychecks, what is worse than that is compromising with Donald Trump. That's actually political terrorism. And it's really refreshing to see so many leftists, you know, cry racism about slowing -- slowing -- illegal immigration, not stopping it. And ignoring how the influx of the illegal immigration actually depresses wages and jobs for minorities. Somehow, they overlook that. That's all I got. This crisis is now a circus, and a circus has two ingredients. Right? Clowns and children. The children are the politicians. The clowns are the media. And they just indulge each other.
