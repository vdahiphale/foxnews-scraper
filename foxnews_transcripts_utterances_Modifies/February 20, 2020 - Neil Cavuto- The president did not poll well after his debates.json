But at that Hope for Prisoners event in Las Vegas this afternoon, just a few minutes ago, actually, the president had a lot to say, including he believes that Roger Stone deserves a new trial because of the fact that he thinks that the forewoman in the jury in the original trial was tainted, and that the president thinks that ultimately Roger Stone probably will go free.

But Roger Stone, his attorneys and the president think that the jury forewoman in the initial trial, a woman named Tomeka Hart, who ran as a Democrat for Congress back in 2012, was biased against the president and therefore biased against Roger Stone.

      "sentences": "Hey, Neil. Good afternoon to you.   Well, this was a long sentencing today. We're talking about almost two-and- a-half-hours with Judge Amy Berman Jackson. And the final sentence, 40 months, which is just three years and four months, a lot less than the original suggestion from the Department of Justice that suggested seven to nine years to put Roger Stone behind bars.  Now, Stone left the courthouse quiet. As John mentioned, he is under a gag order. He's no stranger to cameras and likes to talk and share his story. But he's not doing that in this case. He is honoring that gag order. Judge Amy Berman Jackson repeatedly, Neil, admonished Roger Stone for lying in the courtroom. She said that Stone brought this all upon himself. I want to read a quote.  She said -- quote -- \"This is not campaign hijinks. This is not Roger just being Roger. He lied to Congress. He lied to our elected representatives.\"  Now, the judge is delaying the execution of the sentence, not something we normally see, because she has to rule on that new motion that John mentioned for a new trial. There's a potential political bias with that juror that was just discussed. It could grant him a new trial. Now, the original four prosecutors in the case, Neil, that had prosecuted this case from the beginning, they quit after that seven-to-nine year sentence came down from the Department of Justice, after, I should say, the attorney general's office said it was too harsh.  These prosecutors walked out. So there were two new prosecutors today from the Department of Justice arguing there. A spokeswoman for Attorney General Bill Barr insists that, even though President Trump has been complaining about it on Twitter, that has nothing to do with what he said.   Now, I want to tell you this, that a source at the Justice Department does say that Attorney General Bill Barr is happy and believes that Roger Stone should have been convicted back in November.  As far as where we go now, it's going to be an interesting process, Neil. We have to wait to see if Judge Amy Berman Jackson will grant Roger Stone a new trial. And then, as you just saw from President Trump out in Vegas, he will make his determination -- back to you.",

But that didn't stop him from greeting coal miners in West Virginia for a primary, albeit in a very expensive suit, but he went there. And then there's Franklin Delano Roosevelt, flush with funds spilled from one of the richest families in America. He would meet with farmers hard-hit by the Depression, and to this day is known as a champion of the common man, even though he was anything but. To historian Burt Folsom and GOP pollster Lee Carter on maybe the part that Michael Bloomberg is forgetting, but he shouldn't.

Now, I think that, with Mayor Bloomberg, you're dealing with someone who doesn't really like people. You can see that he gets annoyed by people, he gets flustered by people. So he has to find a way to authentically connect. And so my advice to him would be to lean into who he is and say, listen, I have never been a people person. I'm a policy person. Or say whatever it is that he is, but let us know that. Lean into your weakness. Lean into your strengths. And that, to me, is what authenticity is.

The president, as you pointed out at the top of this deal, going to sit back and watch this process play out, then -- quote -- \"At some point, I will make a determination.\" And if that isn't a head-tilt toward a possible pardon for Roger Stone if he doesn't get a new trial, or if the outcome of a new trial were to be another conviction, I don't know what is -- Neil."

      "utterance": "Hey, Neil. Good afternoon to you. Well, this was a long sentencing today. We're talking about almost two-and- a-half-hours with Judge Amy Berman Jackson. And the final sentence, 40 months, which is just three years and four months, a lot less than the original suggestion from the Department of Justice that suggested seven to nine years to put Roger Stone behind bars. Now, Stone left the courthouse quiet. As John mentioned, he is under a gag order. He's no stranger to cameras and likes to talk and share his story. But he's not doing that in this case. He is honoring that gag order. Judge Amy Berman Jackson repeatedly, Neil, admonished Roger Stone for lying in the courtroom. She said that Stone brought this all upon himself. I want to read a quote. She said -- quote -- \"This is not campaign hijinks. This is not Roger just being Roger. He lied to Congress. He lied to our elected representatives.\" Now, the judge is delaying the execution of the sentence, not something we normally see, because she has to rule on that new motion that John mentioned for a new trial. There's a potential political bias with that juror that was just discussed. It could grant him a new trial. Now, the original four prosecutors in the case, Neil, that had prosecuted this case from the beginning, they quit after that seven-to-nine year sentence came down from the Department of Justice, after, I should say, the attorney general's office said it was too harsh. These prosecutors walked out. So there were two new prosecutors today from the Department of Justice arguing there. A spokeswoman for Attorney General Bill Barr insists that, even though President Trump has been complaining about it on Twitter, that has nothing to do with what he said. Now, I want to tell you this, that a source at the Justice Department does say that Attorney General Bill Barr is happy and believes that Roger Stone should have been convicted back in November. As far as where we go now, it's going to be an interesting process, Neil. We have to wait to see if Judge Amy Berman Jackson will grant Roger Stone a new trial. And then, as you just saw from President Trump out in Vegas, he will make his determination -- back to you."

But at the end of the day, in Super Tuesday states like Texas, he's up on television. He's got 17 offices that have opened up. He's got 150 people on staff here.

It's a little bit more difficult for a Michael Bloomberg, who's one of many, not a president yet, and this was really the audience's first chance to get an impression.

Any campaign, any good campaign -- and he has some top-notch people around him -- you do opposition research on your own candidate.

Now, that doesn't mean he can't come back. But the reality is, he probably would have been better to have waited until the next two debates take place, and then, when it's down to a smaller group, get into it.

Should taxes have already been online for weeks? Absolutely. That was a gimme. There were many bombs. As you said, it was -- many blunders. And I think that he's -- I think he's uncoachable. I think that Donald Trump had disastrous debate performances. Many answers were so cringe-worthy. You just couldn't even believe he was still standing on the stage. And he's president. So I don't think debates kill off normal candidates who do not have a billionaire juggernaut machine. And I think that the truth is, the people watching last night, donors, who are not going to -- he's not -- Bloomberg not going to take their money anyway -- the pundit class and Democratic primary activists voters, I think the most people are going to be reached by Bloomberg's ads online and in the digital space more than people who watch the debates. In addition to that, he is targeting really important communities that are not heard from other -- not targeted and communicated with by other Democrats. He has the money to go into small places, African-American voter clusters in Mississippi and all these places where his campaign is reaching out to them and saying, what's important to you? This is going to matter in the delegate-rich contests in March."

Mustafa, we're also hearing from Elizabeth Warren's campaign that she's been raising a lot more money just since I printed those figures out, apparently raising more than $5 million, she said, since she set foot on the debate stage. She has raised her goal to $12 million. We should also point out that this follows Bernie Sanders campaign saying it had raised close to $3 million within hours. I'm sure his fingers might be up or around there as well. So, for these two candidates, Bernie Sanders needed it less, Elizabeth more needs it more. That was a game-changer for them, wasn't it?"

He's got over four-million-plus donors. So every time he has something that happens in his campaign, there's a cultivated base of donors that get activated. For Elizabeth Warren, she had a very strong night, in that she attacked every single person on stage other than Bernie Sanders, right, and even got him a little bit."

Because we have a full employment in our economy right now at 3.6 percent, that means that we are now attracting the long-term unemployed who are coming back to work. Let me say that differently. The black labor force participation rate is up under President Trump. Not only is the unemployment down, but the number of African-Americans working are up. Not only are the number of African- Americans working up, but the wages are up. Not only are the wages up. The jobs are increasing."

They were on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship. They had been hospitalized for coronavirus for more than a week. Exit screening of the other passengers is expected to last through Friday. Those who test positive are isolated at local hospitals. In Cambodia, health officials have cleared the remaining passengers from the Westerdam to return to their home countries after all 781 tested negative. This group had been held back after one passenger became ill with COVID-19 after she had already left the country. Today, most of the remaining U.S. travelers evacuated from Wuhan, China, by the State Department were released from quarantine at three U.S. military bases. One evacuee who tested positive remains hospitalized. Today, Chinese officials expressed optimism as they reported continued declines in the number of new cases in that country. But international health officials say it's too early to tell whether it's a permanent trend. And, Neil, today, both Kuwait Airways and Iraq Airways suspended flights to Iran, after Iran reported the deaths of two citizens from coronavirus -- Neil."

Meanwhile, China's communist government is under growing criticism for the way it has been handling this whole reporting of the virus.

I guess the link between the two, at least initially, is how they initially responded. And it's troubling and it's eerily similar. GORDON CHANG, AUTHOR, \"THE COMING COLLAPSE OF CHINA\": Yes, certainly, because you both -- in both situations, you had communist governments. And, essentially, their reaction, of course, is to suppress information. They suppressed information, until they could no longer do so. And in both cases, you had only grudging admissions. And China has been doing that. China's reaction now has been compared to the SARS reaction in 2002-2003. There's been basically no improvement. If there's been any sort of change at all, it's because China has more social media right now. And so Beijing did have to react. But we do know that, for three weeks in December, three weeks in January, there was a cone of silence over this virus."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, so who says that Mike needs to take a hike? Maybe just needs to take a cue from some other pretty wealthy politicians who went on to become president. John F. Kennedy came from a lot of wealth. He is arguably considered the richest of all our presidents. Millions back then would be worth billions right now. But that didn't stop him from greeting coal miners in West Virginia for a primary, albeit in a very expensive suit, but he went there. And then there's Franklin Delano Roosevelt, flush with funds spilled from one of the richest families in America. He would meet with farmers hard-hit by the Depression, and to this day is known as a champion of the common man, even though he was anything but. To historian Burt Folsom and GOP pollster Lee Carter on maybe the part that Michael Bloomberg is forgetting, but he shouldn't. Lee, what do you make of that, that these were two men, FDR and certainly JFK, among our wealthiest presidents who didn't wear it on their sleeve, and somehow were able to get through and appeal to the common man or woman at the time?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LEE CARTER, REPUBLICAN POLLSTER",
      "utterance": "So, I think the thing about JFK and Ronald Reagan is that they actually really enjoyed people. They got their energy from people. This is a part of who they were. And so I think they knew that if they engage with the real people, the regular people, the typical people, that actually was going to help them. Now, I think that, with Mayor Bloomberg, you're dealing with someone who doesn't really like people. You can see that he gets annoyed by people, he gets flustered by people. So he has to find a way to authentically connect. And so my advice to him would be to lean into who he is and say, listen, I have never been a people person. I'm a policy person. Or say whatever it is that he is, but let us know that. Lean into your weakness. Lean into your strengths. And that, to me, is what authenticity is. This just seems like a man with a tin ear and a lot of money. I mean, he's basically saying, listen, my tax return is bigger than your tax return. I mean, it was a preposterous statement. The whole night, he seemed out of touch. And I think what he has to realize is how he comes across. And I think it'd be really disarming if he were just to acknowledge it."

    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

What I liked about the JFK films he had is, he's going to West Virginia and then talking to coal miners in a very expensive suit, in other words, saying, I'm not going to do anything fake for you. I just want to meet with you. I am who I am. And, Burt Folsom, one of the things I notice -- and I can extend this even to Ronald Reagan. Though not a billionaire, he was a very accomplished, very wealthy former Hollywood actor, to say nothing of the two-term California governor."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "FOLSOM",
      "utterance": "Well, Reagan did have a touch and a human touch. He enjoyed people. He enjoyed being around people. And that was apparent. The same thing with Franklin Roosevelt and maybe to a lesser extent Kennedy. One thing to remember is that, although Roosevelt and Kennedy were rich, not as rich as Bloomberg, but very rich, they went into politics from the get-go. So they developed the skills to master the political arena."

    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "FOLSOM",
      "utterance": "Well, absolutely. Roosevelt, for example, couldn't earn money. When he went into business, whether it's the lobster business, the photography business, or wanting to do airships, instead of airplanes, or the farm at Hyde Park in his hometown. He failed. And -- but he was successful being around people. He was persuasive. He was charismatic, as was Reagan and to a large extent Kennedy too. Bloomberg lacks that completely. And it showed. He also refused to own his wealth. When Barry (sic) Sanders said, hey, you're worth more than the bottom 125 million Americans, he needed to say something like, yes, and I paid more taxes than about 160 million Americans."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

He is not a charismatic man. He is not meant to be in front of the camera. He's meant to be behind the scenes making things happen. He needs to find a message about who he is, what he's accomplished, and tell us what he's going to do for us. He's so presumptive that he feels like, when he comes out there, it just doesn't resonate. And when you're -- when you're with a candidate that works, it's somebody that seems like he's having fun. And he just -- he's got to have a little fun with us."

Second, even if you have a program that appears to be a good one, how do we know that the money will be wisely spent? How do we know that it will have a real impact on an orphanage, on education programs, water treatment, food for the hungry? I mean, these are not only locating the programs in Africa, Asia elsewhere, but making a determination independently. Camille and I have the responsibility that the money will be protected, it will be used for those purposes, it will not be wasted, and it's going to be a challenge, no question."

There's a very effective United States association of families who lost loved ones. Reaching out to them, reaching out to the families themselves, frankly, asking the government in these countries what might be a good -- a good opportunity or a good program. We want to make sure that the families are heard on this, because the families have projects and programs that they think will best memorialize the memory of the lost loved ones, and we want to try and accommodate them if we can with programs that will be safe and secure."

Because you took a different approach after 9/11, not to equally distribute the funds, but based them on the money lost for the families. In other words, an Aon executive vs. a fireman. There's going to be a disparity in compensation. And such was the case of the disparity in rewards afterwards."
