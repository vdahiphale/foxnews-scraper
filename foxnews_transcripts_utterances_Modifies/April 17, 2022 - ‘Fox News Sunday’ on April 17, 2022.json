But I would go and actually see our own troops there, the 82nd Airborne, that's responsible for bringing the supplies in, down to the Black Sea the day before they shot at that Russian ship. It is a remarkable what is being done, but what I took away most from all of it is the fortitude of the Ukrainian people and the devastation of what is happening that Russia is doing, the targeting of children, of women. This is going to get stronger and rougher, and what really needs to happen is Ukraine is not asking for American men and women to fight. All they're asking for is the weapons to defend themselves.

And the Texas governor sends busloads of migrants to Washington's doorstep amid a backlash over plans to end COVID restrictions at the border. We'll talk to White House COVID response coordinator, Dr. Ashish Jha, about changing COVID rules as well as vaccines for kids, boosters, and how to plan for travel. Then, a DNC vote this week puts Iowa's first in the nation status in doubt ahead of 2024. We'll ask our Sunday panel what's driving the push to change how Democrats pick their presidential nominee.

Another week of hopes dashed for a White House trying to bring its policy successes to the forefront as the war on Ukraine dominates headlines. The U.S. is sending millions of new security assistance as Russia presses the besieged city of Mariupol and prepares former clashes in the east. At home, Americans continue to feel the affective rising prices and a rise in COVID cases is raising concerns about return of restrictions just as summer arrives. This as lawmakers gear up for bruising midterm battles. In a moment, we will speak with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy.

We are in the western side of the country, just four Russian missiles were intercepted here yesterday and this morning, we are in front of this Greek Catholic Church that is taking in refugees from all over this country. And in Ukraine right now, there is a growing sense of dread, because Russia has indicated it is going to increase the number of missile attacks in and around Kyiv and also Russian troops have pulled out of Kyiv and Western intelligence officials say that they are likely regrouping, expected to possibly renew attacks on Ukraine with an even greater force than what we've seen so far. FOX News spoke one-on-one with the head of the military in the Donetsk region, he says Russian forces are expected to mount a surge in the east to take control of the Donbas region."

Ukrainian President Zelenskyy is also warning once again that the world must be worried about Russia's nuclear threat. Moscow has also formally warned the United States that we need to stop sending weapon systems here or there will be, quote, \"unpredictable consequences\". And at this Greek Catholic Church, one young woman, a refugee from Mariupol, told us her grandparent's were murdered, she escaped that town and she was unable to recover her grandfather's body because his apartment building was so badly damaged. And also, Mike, during the services right now we can hear explosions in the distance.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCCARTHY",
      "utterance": "Yeah, I just came back from a bipartisan trip to Poland, Romania, and to Brussels. Not only did we sit there and go to the border and down to the Black Sea, it's extraordinary what these countries are doing. Remember, these countries are doing all this humanitarian aid, taking millions of Ukrainians in into their homes, while at the same time they had increased their spending above 2 percent of GDP to protect their military and what's going on. But I would go and actually see our own troops there, the 82nd Airborne, that's responsible for bringing the supplies in, down to the Black Sea the day before they shot at that Russian ship. It is a remarkable what is being done, but what I took away most from all of it is the fortitude of the Ukrainian people and the devastation of what is happening that Russia is doing, the targeting of children, of women. This is going to get stronger and rougher, and what really needs to happen is Ukraine is not asking for American men and women to fight. All they're asking for is the weapons to defend themselves. If we would have taken those actions earlier instead of waiting until after Russia invaded, they probably never would have invaded had we done that sooner."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "EMANUEL",
      "utterance": "You said the president acted too slowly on Ukraine and say the U.S. should keep sending weapons. Just this week, the president announced $800 million more in military assistance. The United States has now sent $2.6 billion in security assistance, including shipment after shipment of weapons. What more should the commander-in-chief be doing?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCCARTHY",
      "utterance": "Well, I had this discussion with President Biden long before when he just would threaten sanctions after Putin entered. I believe Putin never worried about the sanctions. He only looks at could he be deterred from entering Ukraine. Ukraine was craving the ability to defend themselves. Had we moved the weapons to Ukraine earlier, that they could defend themselves, it would have saved thousands of lives and probably the decision of Putin not to enter. And then after Putin entered, we had President Biden tell us, well, the sanctions take a long time to work. And then the president denied Ukraine and denied Poland for providing MiGs to Ukraine to protect themselves on a flyover. All of that is a wrong action going forward. But what we need to do is learn from here, provide the weapons to Ukraine, but also look to the future of what China is doing. Taiwan has been waiting more than a year for weapons they've already purchased to defend themselves."

      "utterance": "No, there's a strong support for NATO moving forward. Always has been. NATO is on the process of defending themselves but the one thing we need to make sure these NATO countries spend the money, more than 2 percent. In Romania, they're sending 2.5 percent."

      "utterance": "There is a desire there because they see on the forefront, on their borders, what is happening. We haven't seen any atrocities like this before since World War II. And there's no think -- thought that Putin is going to stop here. What has Putin done? He's consolidated his troops. He's brought in one of the most ruthless generals out of Syria with one of the worst reputations to start entering, to try to take over the Black Sea, to control Ukraine, their inability to provide food to the world as well. This affects everybody. That's why we should stand up for Ukraine and provide them the weapons to defend themselves or Putin cannot continue to do these atrocities."

      "utterance": "Is there any chance Republicans are a little overconfident this year?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCCARTHY",
      "utterance": "No, we're not overconfident, but the one thing you have to look at, why is the president's approval numbers are so low? It's the wasteful, irresponsible spending that has led to higher prices and inflation. It's the irresponsible actions of this president along the border that has led to an immigration and the fentanyl crisis. It's the irresponsible policies of this administration that has led to dangerous streets, ineffective schools, that has got to stop. But it's got to be more than just to criticize them. What Americans want, need, and deserve is a clear, common sense alternative. And that's what's happening with the House Republicans. We will provide to the American public a commitment to America, one that could stop this runaway spending that causes in inflation. That we're able to become energy independent, not dependent on Russia or any other country for our energy, and lower the price of fuel. We will make our streets, our schools safe again. We will secure our border to stop this immigration crisis, but more important, to stop the fentanyl that is coming into America. We just found that fentanyl is now the number one cause of death for Americans between the ages of 18 and 45."

      "speaker": "MCCARTHY",
      "utterance": "And it's not because Americans are taking more drugs. They are actually taking less. It's more dangerous of what's coming across this border. That's the difference of why the president's approval ratings are so low, and that's why America will make a new course and Republicans will take the majority."

    {
      "speaker": "MCCARTHY",
      "utterance": "There are fewer competitive districts because we've just gone through redistricting. So -- and there's fewer seats for Republicans to win. In the last election, there were 30 Democrats sitting in seats that Trump carried, only 13. If you look at Virginia, Virginia for governor -- the governor to win there and to turn the House, he had to win Democrats seats. That's why we need people to join with us. If you believe these irresponsible policies are wrong, you want a new direction, you want to hold visit administration accountable, I believe -- join with us and we can hold this administration accountable and make the next century the American century."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "EMANUEL",
      "utterance": "To the GOP agenda, you've said House Republicans will put out proposals this fall on key agenda items, fighting inflation, increasing domestic energy production and securing the southern border. But if you take the House back, you still have a Democrat in the White House. How will you get to actual consensus and get bills signed?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCCARTHY",
      "utterance": "We'll pass them out of the House, but I believe going through this current administration and these poor policies -- remember what happened after 1994. We balanced the budget, we reformed welfare, and you did that with a Democrat in the White House after they had a rude awakening when the American public spoke very clearly that they wanted a new agenda and a new transformation. The other thing that comes with a new majority is you're able to hold this in administration accountable. We're able to stand up to an attorney general who goes after parents and calls them terrorists if they want to go to a school board meeting. We're able to actually find, why did we have 13 new Gold Star families based upon the peeling out of Americans out of Afghanistan? We can look at the IRS releasing taxpayers' filings."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "EMANUEL",
      "utterance": "Some suggest with divided government -- if we get divided government, that that's an opportunity to actually get big things done. Do you think there is any opportunity out there to tackle a major issue like, say, the nation's debt?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCCARTHY",
      "utterance": "We have -- not only can we, we should, and we will. This is one of the biggest problems. Even look at Democrats -- and this is why I believe it's capable of doing. Steve Rattner, who was a counselor to the Treasury Department under Obama, he said the $1.9 trillion American bill that the Democrats passed is probably going to go down as one of the most extraordinary mistakes in policy. We need to have sound fiscal policy, stop the irresponsible spending to curve inflation and make America in a stronger path. But it's not just to balance the budget, you have to pay off the debt."

      "speaker": "EMANUEL",

      "speaker": "Congressman Bob Good says, quote",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCCARTHY",
      "utterance": "Well, there's -- it's very clear, they believe in the rule of law as well. We're not playing political games about some phone call what somebody thought are made up Russia collusion. What we're looking at is real policies about that's harming America. Today, you have an administration that tells every American flying, they have to continue to wear a mask. But now he looks at the border and raises Title 42. And to your viewers, what that means is if a border agent finds somebody coming across the border illegally, they send it back to their country. He wants to lift that in a time that we have COVID as well. That's irresponsible in his policies moving forward. But we will always go to the rule of law and wherever it rises, we will hold him accountable to that. But we have tried to make sure that he does not lift Title 42. We have a number of Democrats, but we have a discharge petition that only needs a couple, a handful of Democrats to sign and it can pass the floor. This is what we need to make sure to protect not just our border from the illegal immigration crossing and this crisis, but this is where the fentanyl is coming in, from China and others. Plus, we are catching people on the terrorist watch list --"

And that's really becoming in doubt. But the question for the next election will be, can we afford it? Can we afford these Democratic policies not just on the border, when it comes to inflation, when it comes to crime, when it comes to gasoline, when it comes to foreign policy? In a short time frame they've had one party control, we have inflation higher than we had in 40 years. We have gasoline prices higher than we've ever had before. The disrespect around the world based upon this president's actions and lack thereof on foreign policy. We have children on streets and neighborhoods that feel unsafe anymore. That has got to stop, and the only way we can do that is going to the polls, firing Pelosi, and sending a really clear message."

We've never seen ourselves in this position with so many challenges out there in America since the late '70s, and we watched it time and time again. With the right policies, with the country united together, with our conference united, we can tackle any problems out there. Our problems are too big to fight among ourselves and think so small.

He was really clear that he thinks this is a good environment for Republicans, the best in many, many cycles, and you saw Speaker McCarthy just talking about that. They think they have a strong message. They think this is a good moment for them. But he is really sounding a warning though about electability and saying that they need to, you know, nominate candidates that can win in general elections, and if you put up candidates who are unfit, unacceptable to a big group, that's a problem. And you've seen that in past cycles. You know, an example of people like Todd Akin or other candidates like that that the GOP had issues with. So I think that's the question and that's the thing he's trying to draw attention to. There are certainly some people we could talk about up there we can talk about. Eric Greitens in Missouri, whose ex-wife has accused him of abuse. You know, he's denying that and moving forward, but there are some candidates out there that people are anxious about."

He knows full well that the political environment is very strong for Republicans, but he also remembers that when Republicans don't nominate strong candidates, when they have divisions within the party, it can cost them otherwise winnable races, and that's what's keeping Mitch McConnell up before these midterm elections."

If at the end of the day you have a number of these candidates lose, what does that tell us about Donald Trump's strength within the coalition of the right going forward, particularly in a situation and cycle where you're going to have a lot of people end up winning and really changeup the conference in ways that, you know, may not make it a more Mitch McConnell- esque party and may become a more Trumpian party just by the dint of the people who were running this time."

We may see a wave, but it's going to be on the back of a lot of super close elections, and I think that's a reflection of just how polarized we are. But on this point that we've been discussing with how the Republican primaries are going to play out, one thing I think we have learned is that Donald Trump's popularity or unpopularity is not transferable down ballot unless Republicans make it so, unless Republicans are talking about him. If Democrats are just talking about Donald Trump heading into the fall, that's not going to be a good thing for them. But if Republicans are talking about Donald Trump and Donald Trump is coming into these states, if he's going into Nevada, if he's going into Ohio and getting bear hugs from the Senate candidates there, that's what Mitch McConnell is worried about.

Hospitalizations are very low. And the CDC scientists determined that that Title 42 is not necessary at the border. And, by the way, that goes into effect in late May.

So I think people over 60 should be getting it. And 50-59, I think it's dependent on risk profile. Talk to your doctor. It's much more of a closer call.

And you have, you know, a situation generally in media where a lot of people are taking these things on because they believe that they're important, just as Elon Musk is saying there. Look, I think this is going to be a fascinating thing to watch play out. And whether Twitter succeeds and their poison pill strategy approach of preventing him from buying the company, what that does to their stock is going to be a fascinating thing to watch. But I wonder how big of a change could happen if you had Twitter go back to being the way that it once worked where more free speech was allowed, there was a wider latitude of allowance and you didn't have this kind of crushing form of private censorship, which is really what it is, that prevents people from being able to speak freely or feel like they're actually, you know, heard when they speak. I think that that could be a major change and it has enormous, political implications as well."

      "utterance": "It's a lot of bluster whenever Elon Musk is involved. But, look, I think this is a proxy battle over politics as much as Twitter's business model. Ultimately, I -- there's some real concerns about censoring newsworthy stories that Twitter and other social media companies have done, and that's legitimate, and it should be discussed and debated. But the big question is, is Donald Trump going to get back on Twitter? Are we going to have a free-for-all like we saw in the past? And I think that is the subtext of a lot of this Twitter debate."

      "utterance": "Well, that's -- that's what I want to hear from Elon Musk, right? Like, Elon Musk is out there saying, I want to make Twitter this -- this paradigm of free speech, but I also want to make it entirely -- completely trusted and get rid of the spam and the bots. Well, Twitter has been talking but that. Twitter's been trying to do that. I'm not saying it's done it well. But that proves how hard it is, right, for a private company to walk that line. We have seen the abuse of Twitter by spammers, by bots, and it has free speech implications in tackling that. So, stop -- if I -- the old communications guy in me would give -- giving Elon Musk a little free advice, like, stop being a Twitter troll right now and get out there and explain what you mean by this."
