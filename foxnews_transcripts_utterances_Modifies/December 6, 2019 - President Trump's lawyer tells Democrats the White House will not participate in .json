      "utterance": "Hello, everyone, I'm Juan Williams, along with Emily Compagno, Jessie Waters, Martha MacCallum and Gregory. It's five o'clock in New York City. This is \"The Five.\" A lot of breaking news to get to, so let's begin. A major showdown over impeachment. The White House telling Democrats it will not participate in next week's hearings. Michael Bloomberg calling out his 2020 rivals, and Joe Biden picking another fight. We're going to get to all of that. But first: A Fox News alert. At least three people are dead, and several others wounded after a gunman opened fire at the Naval Air Station in Pensacola, Florida. Authorities say he was a Saudi aviation student, and the FBI is now taking charge of the investigation, looking into whether the attack is terror-related. Jonathan Serrie is standing by with the latest. Jonathan?"

      "speaker": "Jonathan Serrie",
      "utterance": "Hi, Juan. As far as this morning's attack goes, they believe the gunman acted alone, and so, the immediate threat has been eliminated. However, the base remains closed as the active investigation continues into the circumstances that led to this morning's violence. Naval air station Pensacola went on lockdown as reports came in of an active shooter in one of the classrooms. Escambia County deputies responded, shooting and killing the gunman. The Navy confirms four people have died, including the gunman. At least seven others were hurt. The facility, which is home to the Blue Angels, also hosts military students from around the world. And U.S. officials have identified the gunman as a Saudi national. Florida Republican Senator Rick Scott is calling for a full review of U.S. military programs that train foreign nationals on U.S. soil. President Trump spoke with the Saudi king earlier today, says King Solomon told him the Saudi people are angered by the barbaric actions of the shooter and those actions do not reflect the views of the Saudi people. Juan, back to you."

      "speaker": "Juan Williams",
      "utterance": "Jonathan, thank you for that report. Now onto our other top story. President Trump's lawyer telling Democrats the White House will not participate in Monday's impeachment hearing. This comes as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is raising questions about the Democrats' motives for investigating President Trump. Take a look at this."

    {
      "speaker": "Al Green",
      "utterance": "A president can be impeached more than once. We can still investigate other issues. And when the president has committed additional offenses, and my suspicion is that he will, we can take those before the Senate. There is no limit on the number of times the Senate can vote to convict or not a president. No limit to the number of times the House can vote to impeach or not a president."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "Greg Gutfeld",
      "utterance": "Oh, I am. I mean, the White House won't participate. We should do the same. Because now, what he's just said is that the Dems in the media look at impeachment as like an unlimited game of corn hole or bean bag. It's as long as they can keep throwing it, there's no reason to stop because there are no consequences to this action. Why stop? They're at the blackjack table playing with our money. So, there has to be consequences, meaning that we have to look and see when this is all over and done with, and it will be, we have to look at what are the consequences? What are the abuses of power that they're participating in right now? We've got to figure out how to remove senators and congressmen. The threat to civilization is what they're doing right now. And the best part about this is today, massive job numbers, record low unemployment, the best economy in my lifetime. And I'm like 35. Good news for the Dems and good news for the media is kryptonite to them. You look at CNN, how dreadful it is for them to report that good news. It's eating them alive, so they cling to impeachment like a long-lost lover because it's the only thing they have that keeps them afloat."

They hate him because they can't beat him. He's not a threat to civilization. I mean, look at this suit you're wearing. See how expensive that is? I don't even know what Gutfeld spent on dinner last. This is the height of civilization. Everything is fine."

    {
      "speaker": "Jesse Watters",
      "utterance": "Listen, Trump is not a threat to civilization, he's a threat to the Democrats power, and that's what this is about. By pumping Trump up to make him look like he's the biggest and the baddest man out there, he does feel like he's the biggest and baddest man. It's almost helping him, and it's helping his supporters. And they get it wrong every time. They're like bad weathermen that say there's going to be a Cat 5 hurricane month after month after month, and then every time it's downgraded to beautiful and sunny. And that's why we don't trust these people anymore, because they're constantly wrong. Now, think about what they've done in terms of abuse of power, and you just mentioned that. They've now accessed Rudy Giuliani's phone records after they raided the last lawyer Trump's had office, and they wiretapped his presidential campaign."

Imagine if Lanny Davis, crooked Hillary's lawyer's office had been raided, his phone records have been seized, his phone calls were tapped. That would have been bananas. But this is just like any other day."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Juan Williams",

      "utterance": "Oh, because I see Giuliani is in the Ukraine right now. Martha, let's go back to Nancy Pelosi, because my friends here say, \"Hey, you know, she's making this out to be civilization is at stake with Trump. This is ridiculous.\" But I noticed Nancy Pelosi has never lost a vote. And next week, you're going to be on the camera a lot because it looks like she's going to call for an impeachment vote."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Martha MacCallum",
      "utterance": "Yeah. I find the pacing very interesting here. Everybody can't wait to get this over with at this point. I think the American people, and I know Greg Gutfeld, are included in that. But, you know, look, the definition of civilization is society, culture, and a way of life. I think she's working very hard to convince people and her verbiage on this has been escalating over the last several days. It's, you know, it's grievous. It's an insult to the constitution. Now, the entire civilization is beginning to crumble because of this. And I think that that is a ramp up not only to her own Democrat constituency, but to these people that The Washington Post thinks are undecided in the middle, who you have to start to lasso and make sure that they get it, because they're very upset that the reporting isn't doing a good enough job. I just think the fact that she's speaking in these terms makes it very clear that she is concerned that it's not strong enough to get it over the finish line."

But there's no indication from Schiff that he ever subpoenaed the records. So, the question is, where do these phone records come from? And was it, as Jesse suggests, maybe an overreach on the part of investigators?"
    },

      "speaker": "Emily Compagno",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. And there's a specific point to that that I want to talk about. Did you guys see this morning Congressman Eric Swalwell?

And there's a lot of Americans that have that felony conviction and that record. And for him to display that hubris, which I'm sure he displayed as a prosecutor, I'm sure justice for him wasn't collaborative. I'm sure it was just seeking convictions. That's what we're dealing with, and that is why the Democrats don't care, especially him as their poster child, don't care about the FISA abuse of power. They don't care if the government is surveilling its citizens as long as the citizens are the GOP, and they're Republicans on the Hill. And he tells the president to grow? I want him to grow up. I want the Democrats to grow up. He tells the president he says, \"You're wasting taxpayer dollars on pressuring foreign powers.\" No, you're wasting my tax dollars. All of them."

This isn't really about their candidates. It's about Trump. Trump is not that much different in age, but it's so obvious in terms of energy and spirit. There is a gulf. I mean, he's like, Trump isn't much younger, but he's like a diner cup of coffee, a bottomless, bottomless energy. I was going to say something else, but I stopped. But if you look at, if you compare people his age, look what he did to Robert De Niro. Right. He turned him into a sputtering jackass. Biden pretends he's Clint Eastwood in Gran Torino.

And contrast that along with Biden's message of the looming recession with the last Democrat to win the White House with Obama's message, \"Hope and Change.\" And obviously, half the country rolled their eyes, but it resonated clearly and especially with the Democrats.

And I think that caveat is important here, because it basically dovetails in with why the program worked in New York, which is essentially providing -- that's right -- providing that resource. But I have to point out that, you know, that the bleeding-heart approach and that oversimplification is basically saying, \"Look, the poor soul has nowhere to go.\" Right? And then there's the law enforcement angle, which is, \"Well, I go to the park, I don't feel like having, you know -- stepping on a needle or having diarrhea thrown in my face,\" like what just happened in Los Angeles. And we have the Eric Garcettis and the Gavin Newsoms that say, well, all we have to do is throw billions at the singular approach, which is providing new housing, ignoring that it's a complex multifactored issue. We need those resources to treat drug addiction, to address the domestic and international drug supply, mental health, and law enforcement. And without that acknowledgement of all of those factors, we're still going to get the de Blasios which are just pouring money into a ridiculous part of the equation."

Now he does something, and people say, \"Well, we don't like what he does.\" And I must say, I'm with you, Emily. I don't like the idea that you ship homeless people off. I just think, you know, these are vulnerable people. You don't want to abuse them in any way or treat them like that. But I will say that when I watched the federal official on Fox & Friends, I think you were doing that interview, my question is, \"Okay. So, where's the federal government? Where's the federal energy?\". I think Greg and I've been over this with Dr. Drew, and Dr. Drew was saying what you're saying. It's a multi-dimensional issue with people who are drug addicts, people who have mental issues, and you've got to have some kind of investment. I don't think you can ignore the need for investment, but you need real solutions, real ideas. It's not about picking on the homeless or picking on some Democratic mayor or a Democratic state and saying, \"Oh, it's those liberals and they're softy issues.\" No, I think it's all of us that have to deal with this in an era of high-income inequality."

They are coming from somewhere else, and they could find a place to live, so it's not about housing. It's not about economic inequality. Right? There are people that have really smart solutions. I give credit to de Blasio. He got part one, right, relocation. But he didn't have part two, which is a temporary residence in which they can camp, have access to clean water, and amenities and have people figure it out. That's what they're doing."

I think we talked about Sunrise, which is an organization, and Dr. Drew's talked to the people in San Diego about turning --getting homeless into, you know, city owned land in which you can get them clean, and then you can approach them, separate the mentally ill from the non-mentally ill, the people that actually do want to get off the streets, because that's the reality we're not talking about here, is that there are some that don't want to get off the streets. Some of them are mentally ill and do not -- and reject the idea that they're mentally ill, which is actually a disease in itself when you deny your own mental illness. There are people who are there for drugs, there are people there just because of the lifestyle when they're young. So, there are all these different types and we have to stop. We have to stop criticizing people with ideas that aren't controlled by the government as somehow poking fun at the homeless or targeting the homeless when they're actually trying to help.

And those issues need to be addressed in a compassionate way. I completely agree. And with housing, which I think Ben Carson has worked on doing in California and the projects and he's been doing.
