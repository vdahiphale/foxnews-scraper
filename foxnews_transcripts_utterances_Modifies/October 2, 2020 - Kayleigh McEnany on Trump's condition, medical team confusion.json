That would be from a local live truck probably parked on Constitution Avenue shooting back against the South Lawn. Just in front of the tale of the helicopter is assembled the White House press pool. That's the photographers and the camera men who will be getting pictures of the president as he exits the South Portico there.   Again, it is possible that the president could stop to talk for just a second, tell us how he's feeling. We wouldn't blame him if he doesn't.

The president took a mask out and said, look, I've got a mask right here and I'm ready to wear it when I think I should. But I don't need to wear it or -- and don't wear it so much.  And then, kind of mocked Joe Biden, and said, you know, he's got this big mask on all the time, and he speaks in -- into very small groups of people with, you know, circles around him. You know, I think he took some shot at Biden that he can't attract a crowd. But, you know, that's -- that the handling of the virus is going to come back. It's interesting because back in March and April, that was the subject, and then, of course, we have race and law and order and violence. And then, with the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the Supreme Court. I think COVID-19 now goes back to the top of the political agenda.

But now, President Trump is coming here as a precautionary measure.

And you can hear Marine One landing right now just behind me. It should be touching down literally within the next few seconds. But here is that statement from Kayleigh McEnany. She said, \"President Trump remains in good spirits, has mild symptoms, and has been working throughout the day. Out of an abundance of caution, and at the recommendation of his physician and medical experts, the president will be working from the presidential offices at Walter Reed for the next few days.\" And so, a lot of people don't know this, but there is an entire suite, an entire complex inside this massive military hospital strictly for moments like this. It hasn't been used much, but it has been used in the past. President Ronald Reagan actually stayed here overnight in 1989 after he had a minor surgery. And so, there is this whole suite of very secure offices. There's places for the president to eat, sleep, work, and receive treatment. And so, the White House taking great pains to stress that President Trump is coming here out of an abundance of caution, just in case, you know, things spiral out of control quite quickly, as we know with this virus that can happen. And it has happened to a lot of people who test positive for COVID-19.

But the detail that struck me the most was as he boarded the helicopter, when he got to the top of the steps going into Marine One, he tapped his hand on the railing of the stairs.

This happens a lot when the president is moving around town either via motorcade or when he is landing via Marine One. But there really is a different feel out here tonight. There are dozens of members of the White House press corps standing on the street. And what's really notable is I'd say there's about 100 people that have gathered right outside Walter Reed, as Marine One was touching down here. And they were standing on the other side of the street, and as Marine One started to touchdown, they all ran across the street and crowded by this fence just behind me to try to see whatever glimpse they could of President Trump landing here just hours after testing positive for COVID-19. We always say presidents come here quite frequently. This is where they come when they are receiving minor medical procedures are when they have to have a surgery, as President Ronald Reagan did back in the late 1980s. But to have a president of the United States touching down here where he's not just going to be here for the next few hours. The White House press secretary said he's going to be staying here for the next few days. And to have him touching down in the middle of this pandemic, it is one of the more surreal and odd developments in a year that has already been incredibly surreal and odd. And so now we really just set up shop here right outside Walter Reed because this is where President Trump is going to be working. It's where he's going to be sleeping. And it's where he's going to be receiving treatment. And for those of that don't know, inside Walter Reed, there is this entire suite, this entire complex, very secure complex that is set up exactly for a moment like this. It really hasn't been used all that much of the past, but it was made for a moment like this, and now it's going to be put to good use. And I will say so many of the president's recent trips to places, they're very loud affairs. When you cover a Trump rally, everyone is cheering. When you cover a protest, you get the opposite reaction. But here the mood, very quiet, very somber, nobody really talking or saying anything, Bret.

Biden says he meets four times a week with a group of specialists and experts in public health, and those are the kind of people that he is consulting, while pushing off his trip this morning to when they are deciding whether or not he should go or not. Notable today, he never took his mask off the entire time that he was speaking. He spoke through a surgical mask. It was pretty easy to understand what he was saying, but he made a point to never take it off. He's in a habit at events like these of wearing it a lot. In fact, I was an Alliance, Ohio, when he got off the train the morning after the debate. And he walked right up to a microphone and started talking for three or four minutes. And his aides were in the back doing this motion, telling him it's OK to take it off when you are socially distance and you are delivering your remarks in a microphone. But he is in a habit of doing that, made a point not to take it off today. He also did not really go hard at President Trump the way that he does when he makes these trips every day or two. Something else that's going to change here in Michigan, and really the last couple weeks we've been going swing state to swing state. Every time you turn on the TV, no matter what is on, there are negative ads. A lot of them are blaming President Trump for failed leadership during the pandemic. But now that President Trump is suffering from COVID-19, they are not going to hit him with that or with anything else. They are pulling the negative ads for now, a Biden campaign sources told me a few minutes ago. And so things are changing. But there has been a reversal of roles because early on in the days of the pandemic locked down, we spent a lot of time in Wilmington, Delaware. Joe Biden told us in the summer, it was early July, that he didn't think he had to leave because no matter what he said, if he was in Delaware, close to home, it got the same coverage as going to a swing state. But today he is campaigning, like President Trump was in the beginning, and President Trump now is in the hospital. So it's a real reversal of roles, but it also goes to show how important states like Michigan are to Biden. They thought long and hard about whether or not he was going to come here. They slimmed down his schedule, they had a socially distance event. He came, talked for about 20 minutes, did a couple local interviews, and headed right back home. Bret?",

But things are changing very quickly. And so in terms of future debates, the ground rules are negotiated up until just a few hours before the candidates actually walk out. If there is a reason that President Trump cannot safely attend, it is possible that a ground rule could be worked out for him to participate and to debate Joe Biden remotely. But that would be a real heavy lift because, again, anytime that there is a change made to something like a presidential debate, it has to go through the commission, and then both campaigns have to consent to it. And they are nowhere close to that right now. As of right now, it seems like they are planning on going.

But for something like putting Biden and Harris together, we don't know if that is going to happen. The two of them are very, very rarely in the same place at the same time. I believe the convention and then the memorial service for Ruth Bader Ginsburg are the only two times in the last six weeks, seven weeks that they have been in the same place at the same time.

I think from a personal standpoint, though, the president saying he is going to have the best of care, and he will there at Walter Reed. But I think that personally in his mind he's concerned about the road ahead. And one of the reasons why I believe that is because a good friend -- well, not a good friend, but an acquaintance, a real estate colleague of his from New York, a fellow named Stanley Chera, died from coronavirus disease back in April. And the president has talked about this a couple times at coronavirus briefings, but when I was with him in Ypsilanti, Michigan, fly back on Air Force One, he invited me to come up to his office in the front. And he retold the story. Stanley was fine one day, then he heard that he had coronavirus disease, and then a day or two later he heard that he was in the hospital. A day or two after that, the president heard that he was on a ventilator, and then the president talked to his family to say how is Stanley doing? And apparently he had died. And I think that that event really hit the president very deeply. That was, if you recall back in the spring, a moment where the president's view of coronavirus really changed. It became very personal for him. So I think somewhere in the back of his mind as he goes out there to Walter Reed for what undoubtedly is some of the greatest medical care anyone can receive anywhere in the world, he's got that story of Stanley Chera and what happened to Stanley in the back of his mind, which I think is why the president is not playing any games with this. And when his physician suggested he go up to Walter Reed so that he could have that quality of care seconds away, not a helicopter ride away, the president was happy to oblige his physician and go up there, Bret.",

And you want to make sure, particularly since he is in that category of elevated risk, given his age and his physical stature, that you want to have top-notch medical care seconds away, because God forbid, and we know with this virus it's capricious, it affects people in different ways. If the president were to start to have a more severe episode of coronavirus disease, you could get him into a high-tech medical situation quickly. For all we know, the president may sort of just wait this out in that suite of offices, but have his medical teams on standby. Or if the president were to suddenly become severely ill, the intensive care unit would be only steps away as opposed to helicopter ride away. And I think that it's prudent that out of an abundance of caution they do this, because we still don't know all of the ways in which coronavirus works. We have a much better understanding of how the disease can progress. We have a much better understanding of things that we can use to treat patients who have it. I was very intrigued to see that the president got a dose of this experimental Regeneron antibody therapy. That is not widely available. The president got it through compassionate use. And as well he's taking simple things like zinc and vitamin D, and what is essentially the generic version of Pepcid, and then a baby aspirin as well, because we know that blood clotting can be a problem. We know that how your stomach reacts to things can be a problem. We know that vitamin D deficiency can cause a greater degree of coronavirus disease. And we know that zinc is good at preventing viral replication, or at least slowing it down. It also boosts your immune system. So the president does seem to be in good hands. I am sure they have remdesivir on hold should the president need it. He hasn't talked about hydroxychloroquine, though he did say that if he ever got coronavirus he would probably go to that well again. But I think at the moment, Bret, it's probably safe to say they are holding off on that one, at least for the moment.",

Speaker Nancy Pelosi this morning said she thought it actually did change the dynamic, that it really refocused everyone involved in these talks, showing what a vicious disease this COVID-19 is. And we know that she spoke for more than an hour this afternoon with Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin. We're hearing there are still significant differences, but there was a change in tone this afternoon from Majority Leader Mitch McConnell back in Kentucky saying that he thought they were getting closer to an outcome. And you know McConnell very well, as I do, and he is not one for hyperbole. So if he says they are getting closer to an outcome, that is significant. Also on the House floor today, Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, Democrat of Maryland, said that he thought the talks might produce a deal this weekend. He said they wouldn't have a vote Monday or Tuesday because they would need to produce any agreement into legislative language. So we are hearing from both sides a significant push forward after it looked like they were stuck last night. And so perhaps this national story, this national drama of seeing our president and First Lady test positive for this dreadful disease that's affected so many American families, maybe it's forced everybody back to the table to get serious about cutting a deal.

I think the partisan politics can be set aside, we can return to that in a few days when we know better the condition of the president.

I think if you are Mike Pence, I think you should be quarantined. I think people in the line of succession should certainly be quarantined in case what we are all hoping for, a speedy recovery, a mild case, doesn't happen. You have Army medical doctors who are going to be attending to the president who may have to make some very difficult decisions about the president's ability to continue to serve the country the way that he has been serving the country.

He may also not feel up to it -- up to it either. Just a note for you about that shot that you're looking at, that's a shot that we normally don't see. That would be from a local live truck probably parked on Constitution Avenue shooting back against the South Lawn. Just in front of the tale of the helicopter is assembled the White House press pool. That's the photographers and the camera men who will be getting pictures of the president as he exits the South Portico there. Again, it is possible that the president could stop to talk for just a second, tell us how he's feeling. We wouldn't blame him if he doesn't. But you remember that iconic photograph from the Reagan administration, Ronald Reagan and Nancy Reagan in the door of Marine One waving as he was being whisked off to Walter Reed Army Medical Center as it was knows at the time for colon cancer surgery.

You also have to remember that he's getting a medication like this polyclonal antibody, that needs to be monitored for any potential side effects. So, the combination of giving him that medication in conjunction with any other signs and symptoms that they need to monitor, the proper way is to do it in the hospital.

And what they do is they eat up the virus. The whole point of this antiviral therapy if you will is to minimize the viral load so that there's no secondary effects coming from the coronavirus that can -- you know, impact a significant side effect in his lungs or in his heart. So, I think that this is a very good therapy. The preliminary results that came out early this week shows a very positive results. And I think that it's the right thing to do."

    {
      "speaker": "ALVAREZ",
      "utterance": "Well, a couple of things. He's 74 but he doesn't look 74. And I'm sure physiologically speaking, he probably feels like a 55, 60-year old individual. He doesn't have any negative vices. He doesn't drink. He doesn't smoke and he's very active physically. You know, so, all of that plays a lot of positive things for him. I think the on -- one of the factors of course for the president is that he's -- you know, he has been burning the candle on both ends with this election. You know, he's out and about going to 200,000 meetings a day. So, that runs you down at the end of the day. So, when you get the virus -- you know, he -- they complain about the mild symptoms. Mild symptoms and coronavirus are all the same. You know, you get the fever, you get the tiredness, the fatigue, loss of appetite, your smell goes away. So, if that's the worse, that you have right now with his physical -- you know, physical attributes of being so active and relatively healthy aside from everybody's talking about his weight. You know, but everything else being equal, I think he should recover."

They're going to be monitoring his oxygenation. If he doesn't have any major complaints of any chest discomfort or shortness of breath or anything like that, and it's just the low-grade temperature that goes away maybe one day, maybe comes back the next day. If that's the worst of it, then he's going to be fine. But the next 72 hours are very important."

Those are the things that for anybody -- you know, you should go to the hospital. But in general terms, if you're relatively healthy, the young, if you don't have any underlying medical conditions like chronic diabetes or hypertension or cardiovascular disease, this goes away."

    {
      "speaker": "ALVAREZ",
      "utterance": "Yes, I mean, all of those things improve the immune system. You know, Remdesivir is one of the other drugs and you know, it could have gone both ways. They could have started him and Remdesivir there's utilization for that in early phases of coronavirus. And it's like a Tamiflu if you will for people that have been familiar with let's say with Tamiflu, it minimizes the viral side effects. But in this case, they chose something a little bit stronger, that's for sure, it's a little stronger medication but it's very effective but at the same time, as I said, because it is in phase two of trial, this is why I'm sure the doctors including the company suggest that you know what, it's better to monitor him in the hospital since we gave him the medication. Let's just make sure that he doesn't get any side effects and, you know, everything is on the up and up."

The vaccine trials are ongoing, they seem to be very positive, multiple vaccines. So that is happening as we speak. When is the vaccine going to get approved? When is it going to be distributed? People talk at the end of the year, the first quarter of next year but it's going to happen. We're talking about -- you know, less than a year for sure. I think that all the things with the masks and the social distancing and the cleaning and all of that is very positive. And people should still continue to follow that. But you know, this is going to -- you know, this is important because it is the President of the United States and attention must be paid. But at the same time, his message is -- you know, we've been going in the right direction. And right now, what every American should do is pray for his health, first lady's health, and you know, let's stick together as a nation because we were heading in the right direction."

And there was quite a disagreement between the president and former Vice President Biden about how to handle it. And one of the specific questions we talked about was masks. And I talked about the fact that the president has been much more reluctant to use masks. And Vice President Biden has seemed to wear a mask almost all the time. The president took a mask out and said, look, I've got a mask right here and I'm ready to wear it when I think I should. But I don't need to wear it or -- and don't wear it so much. And then, kind of mocked Joe Biden, and said, you know, he's got this big mask on all the time, and he speaks in -- into very small groups of people with, you know, circles around him. You know, I think he took some shot at Biden that he can't attract a crowd. But, you know, that's -- that the handling of the virus is going to come back. It's interesting because back in March and April, that was the subject, and then, of course, we have race and law and order and violence. And then, with the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the Supreme Court. I think COVID-19 now goes back to the top of the political agenda. And in terms of just the political facts, if you look at the polls, people tend to trust president -- Vice President Biden more by about 10 points than President Trump on that issue. So, it's not especially one that -- I think that Trump campaign wants to have on the top of people's minds right now."

Donald Trump has been -- you know, in constant motion during his four years, and I think has worn out the press corps and his staff with his times on the campaign trail. So, you know, I think a lot of us are fascinated to see just what he looks like when he walks out from the Diplomatic Reception Room in the White House and takes those steps over to the -- to Marine One -- to the helicopter. You know, is it the -- that Donald Trump of old, that maybe he has a -- isn't feeling so good, but it still has that same vigor, we sure hope so. Or is he somebody who's -- you know, we see the physical effects. I'm going to say this and I -- and I want to make it clear, I'm in no way criticizing or casting any doubt about the Trump White House and the information they've been giving us. But you asked about Reagan, and there was a tendency during Reagan's illnesses to sugarcoat it and to underplay it, and we would find out after the fact it was more serious. And because of that experience, and I have no reason to believe it's true of this White House, but I always have a take, you know, any statements by the White House about the president's in good spirits, and you know, mild symptoms with a considerable grain of salt."

But I think there's going to be tremendous interest in what exactly are his symptoms, how he's feeling, and there's going to be a lot of pressure on him to actually speak to either reporters or address the nation.

I think it's a time for people to show restraint. I mean, we've lived through 2020 in a global pandemic. And the near-collapse of the global economy we've seen our cities on fire, we've had real racial tension. It's been, obviously, a strained and strenuous year. And everything has been turned up to 11.

But I do think that following on your reporting out of the White House and what Dr. Alvarez was saying, I think it's important to remember that Walter Reed is precisely where the president of the United States should be today on a day when he's been diagnosed with COVID. That they -- it is set up. It is the entire operation is designed for exactly this, no matter how serious or how minor the president's symptoms wind up being. This is where he should be. And so, so, I think it's important to remember that. You know, on a personal note, obviously, it's heart-wrenching, and it's -- frightening to think of the president being vulnerable to some -- something that has been so horrible for so many people, and can be a devastating disease. You know the president -- you know, he's a tough guy, he is a fearless guy and, and I -- you know, obviously, join Steve and Mara and you and everybody else in sending up.

And right now, they're getting ready to play out this tape for the president heading to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. The president, according to the White House chief of staff was in good spirits. He made some phone calls today but was fatigued. And we had two statements from the White House physician today about his status, what he actually was taking, including a cocktail of antivirals that is not yet approved by the FDA. It's called Regeneron. And that the company put out a statement as well. Let's listen in. And there you see it. It actually was just President Trump, making that walk from the White House. The First Lady Melania Trump not with him, but obviously, wearing a suit and tie, and also that black mask also with him. The White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, also wearing a mask. He tested negative. We're told, the White House chief of staff did.

But now he's off to Walter Reed, and I think that, you know, we're going to see what happens when he takes this drug. They say it's out of an abundance of caution. NPR actually had several sources that said that in addition to being fatigued, the president did have a fever. How high it was, we don't know. But whenever the president of the United States goes to Walter Reed for anything other than a checkup, it's a really big deal. You heard earlier in the show, Joe Biden has pulled his negative ads. That was a sign of respect. I don't know if the Trump campaign will do the same thing. But this is a really important moment in this presidential campaign."

      "utterance": "Well, Bret, you can see Marine One just behind me. We heard it just moments ago. It should be landing here at Walter Reed any minute now. And you know, this is really the nation's premier military hospital. We often hear about it or see it in the news, when presidents come here to visit wounded troops that are staying here. But now, President Trump is coming here as a precautionary measure. And I just want to go ahead and read you the statement from the White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany in full, because it really does give you a sense of what we can expect over the next few days. And you can hear Marine One landing right now just behind me. It should be touching down literally within the next few seconds. But here is that statement from Kayleigh McEnany. She said, \"President Trump remains in good spirits, has mild symptoms, and has been working throughout the day. Out of an abundance of caution, and at the recommendation of his physician and medical experts, the president will be working from the presidential offices at Walter Reed for the next few days.\" And so, a lot of people don't know this, but there is an entire suite, an entire complex inside this massive military hospital strictly for moments like this. It hasn't been used much, but it has been used in the past. President Ronald Reagan actually stayed here overnight in 1989 after he had a minor surgery. And so, there is this whole suite of very secure offices. There's places for the president to eat, sleep, work, and receive treatment. And so, the White House taking great pains to stress that President Trump is coming here out of an abundance of caution, just in case, you know, things spiral out of control quite quickly, as we know with this virus that can happen. And it has happened to a lot of people who test positive for COVID-19. So, President Trump landing here at Walter Reed right now where he is expected to stay for treatment and work for the next several days. Bret."

But people who love President Trump and people who don't particularly like his politics, I think everybody can agree he's a master showman. He's a master of style and imagery. And I was struck by watching him walk between the White House to board Marine One. He gave a couple waves, he gave a couple of thumbs-ups. But the detail that struck me the most was as he boarded the helicopter, when he got to the top of the steps going into Marine One, he tapped his hand on the railing of the stairs. And that was very intentional I think by him. It's a way of him saying it's going to be OK, or at least from his perspective he feels like it's going to be OK."

      "utterance": "Bret, such a surreal scene out here. The entire street right outside of Walter Reed has been shut down. No surprise there. This happens a lot when the president is moving around town either via motorcade or when he is landing via Marine One. But there really is a different feel out here tonight. There are dozens of members of the White House press corps standing on the street. And what's really notable is I'd say there's about 100 people that have gathered right outside Walter Reed, as Marine One was touching down here. And they were standing on the other side of the street, and as Marine One started to touchdown, they all ran across the street and crowded by this fence just behind me to try to see whatever glimpse they could of President Trump landing here just hours after testing positive for COVID-19. We always say presidents come here quite frequently. This is where they come when they are receiving minor medical procedures are when they have to have a surgery, as President Ronald Reagan did back in the late 1980s. But to have a president of the United States touching down here where he's not just going to be here for the next few hours. The White House press secretary said he's going to be staying here for the next few days. And to have him touching down in the middle of this pandemic, it is one of the more surreal and odd developments in a year that has already been incredibly surreal and odd. And so now we really just set up shop here right outside Walter Reed because this is where President Trump is going to be working. It's where he's going to be sleeping. And it's where he's going to be receiving treatment. And for those of that don't know, inside Walter Reed, there is this entire suite, this entire complex, very secure complex that is set up exactly for a moment like this. It really hasn't been used all that much of the past, but it was made for a moment like this, and now it's going to be put to good use. And I will say so many of the president's recent trips to places, they're very loud affairs. When you cover a Trump rally, everyone is cheering. When you cover a protest, you get the opposite reaction. But here the mood, very quiet, very somber, nobody really talking or saying anything, Bret. And it really just feels like everybody here feels the gravity of the moment. Bret?"

      "utterance": "He is continuing to campaign in person, Bret, because the Biden brain trust is so confident in their ability to enforce very strict health and safety guidelines that are very COVID specific. Biden says he meets four times a week with a group of specialists and experts in public health, and those are the kind of people that he is consulting, while pushing off his trip this morning to when they are deciding whether or not he should go or not. Notable today, he never took his mask off the entire time that he was speaking. He spoke through a surgical mask. It was pretty easy to understand what he was saying, but he made a point to never take it off. He's in a habit at events like these of wearing it a lot. In fact, I was an Alliance, Ohio, when he got off the train the morning after the debate. And he walked right up to a microphone and started talking for three or four minutes. And his aides were in the back doing this motion, telling him it's OK to take it off when you are socially distance and you are delivering your remarks in a microphone. But he is in a habit of doing that, made a point not to take it off today. He also did not really go hard at President Trump the way that he does when he makes these trips every day or two. Something else that's going to change here in Michigan, and really the last couple weeks we've been going swing state to swing state. Every time you turn on the TV, no matter what is on, there are negative ads. A lot of them are blaming President Trump for failed leadership during the pandemic. But now that President Trump is suffering from COVID-19, they are not going to hit him with that or with anything else. They are pulling the negative ads for now, a Biden campaign sources told me a few minutes ago. And so things are changing. But there has been a reversal of roles because early on in the days of the pandemic locked down, we spent a lot of time in Wilmington, Delaware. Joe Biden told us in the summer, it was early July, that he didn't think he had to leave because no matter what he said, if he was in Delaware, close to home, it got the same coverage as going to a swing state. But today he is campaigning, like President Trump was in the beginning, and President Trump now is in the hospital. So it's a real reversal of roles, but it also goes to show how important states like Michigan are to Biden. They thought long and hard about whether or not he was going to come here. They slimmed down his schedule, they had a socially distance event. He came, talked for about 20 minutes, did a couple local interviews, and headed right back home. Bret?"

      "utterance": "So the University of Utah and the Commission on Presidential Debates are both saying they expect the V.P. debate, Kamala Harris against Mike Pence on Wednesday in the Salt Lake City area will go off. As for the debate after that, less than two weeks from now in Miami, we have spoken to some sources within the Trump campaign who as of a couple hours ago were expecting that was still going to be something that they would be prepared for. But things are changing very quickly. And so in terms of future debates, the ground rules are negotiated up until just a few hours before the candidates actually walk out. If there is a reason that President Trump cannot safely attend, it is possible that a ground rule could be worked out for him to participate and to debate Joe Biden remotely. But that would be a real heavy lift because, again, anytime that there is a change made to something like a presidential debate, it has to go through the commission, and then both campaigns have to consent to it. And they are nowhere close to that right now. As of right now, it seems like they are planning on going. But they will make those decisions about a big change or about somebody being off site only they really have to, Bret."

This is a seated debate, so it's just a matter of moving farther apart at the table. We should point out that Vice President Pence and Senator Kamala Harris both put out statements that they tested negative for COVID-19. So it appears, Peter, at this point that the V.P. debate is going forward, and then we'll see what happens going forward after that."

Neither one of them has been there in a very long time. And that is going to be something -- this event that was here earlier today, there were just really a handful of people in the crowd, not even really a crown, it's just a small group of invited frontline workers who were sitting outside a few feet apart and folding plastic chairs, which is exactly how the campaign wants these events to go, because they are really, really strict about social distancing. But for something like putting Biden and Harris together, we don't know if that is going to happen. The two of them are very, very rarely in the same place at the same time. I believe the convention and then the memorial service for Ruth Bader Ginsburg are the only two times in the last six weeks, seven weeks that they have been in the same place at the same time. And so we don't know if the developments with the president falling ill are going to make Democrats want to keep Biden and Harris apart yet. But they are scheduled less than a week from now for a rare event together in Arizona, a state that they are trying to flip."

He's, according the White House, receiving antivirals as well as seeing some mild symptoms, but we will wait to get an update from the White House physician. The walk out to Marine One from the White House with the president wearing a mask could now be the singular image of the coronavirus pandemic.

The president wanted to move past COVID and talk about the Supreme Court and the economy getting better, and his argument about why Joe Biden isn't fit mentally or physically to be the president. But instead his refocuses the campaign debate on COVID, and again, of course, on his leadership during the pandemic, the fact that until recently he didn't want to wear a mask. He said the COVID affects virtually nobody. And so it gets it back to an issue where Biden was stronger and the president was weaker. So in that sense, it's not good for him, for Trump."

But the campaign still has to go on, and there is still a big fight on very important issues that needs to be had between now and the election. But this is a clarifying moment. And I think that -- just think about what the news cycle has been filled with for the past 24 hours. It's been filled with a secretly taped audio of a conversation between the First Lady and a former friend about what she was saying, just nonsense. And think about all this discussion about trying to get President Trump to denounce people who -- white supremacists that he's already denounced. It's just, it's nonsense. And this is one of those moments, and I hope that everybody takes the opportunity to seize it, where it washes out all of that nonsense, and we can focus on the real important issues that face the country. And of course, as somebody who thinks that President Trump is doing a very good job, I believe that he's got a great case to argue on the economy, on the Supreme Courts, and also on his handling of the COVID crisis, something that we didn't -- a disease that didn't even exist as far as we know a year ago. So I think this is a good moment and it resets things. And I hope the net result is that the temperature goes down and we return to talking about issues that are important to the American people."

      "utterance": "I want to go to John Roberts on the North Lawn of the White House, obviously just getting that message recorded from President Trump. Do we know any backstory there, John, about who recorded it or when he did it?"

      "speaker": "JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Obviously he did it shortly before he left, Bret. And I think that the video sent a good signal, because there was speculation, if the president is going to Walter Reed then he has to be sick. He looked like he was a little bit fatigued. He looked a little bit drawn, but he looked like he was in good spirits. His voice was clear despite the fact that we're told he's got a little bit of congestion and he's running a slight fever. So I think that was reassuring to see the president still there, vigorous despite the fact that he is suffering from coronavirus and has mild coronavirus disease at this point. I think from a personal standpoint, though, the president saying he is going to have the best of care, and he will there at Walter Reed. But I think that personally in his mind he's concerned about the road ahead. And one of the reasons why I believe that is because a good friend -- well, not a good friend, but an acquaintance, a real estate colleague of his from New York, a fellow named Stanley Chera, died from coronavirus disease back in April. And the president has talked about this a couple times at coronavirus briefings, but when I was with him in Ypsilanti, Michigan, fly back on Air Force One, he invited me to come up to his office in the front. And he retold the story. Stanley was fine one day, then he heard that he had coronavirus disease, and then a day or two later he heard that he was in the hospital. A day or two after that, the president heard that he was on a ventilator, and then the president talked to his family to say how is Stanley doing? And apparently he had died. And I think that that event really hit the president very deeply. That was, if you recall back in the spring, a moment where the president's view of coronavirus really changed. It became very personal for him. So I think somewhere in the back of his mind as he goes out there to Walter Reed for what undoubtedly is some of the greatest medical care anyone can receive anywhere in the world, he's got that story of Stanley Chera and what happened to Stanley in the back of his mind, which I think is why the president is not playing any games with this. And when his physician suggested he go up to Walter Reed so that he could have that quality of care seconds away, not a helicopter ride away, the president was happy to oblige his physician and go up there, Bret."

      "utterance": "And we heard the president in that video, John, mention the First Lady is doing well. She obviously did not accompany him to Walter Reed."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ROBERTS",
      "utterance": "No. She is staying in the residence. Clearly the rules for the president of the United States are different than they are even for the First Lady. And you want to make sure, particularly since he is in that category of elevated risk, given his age and his physical stature, that you want to have top-notch medical care seconds away, because God forbid, and we know with this virus it's capricious, it affects people in different ways. If the president were to start to have a more severe episode of coronavirus disease, you could get him into a high-tech medical situation quickly. For all we know, the president may sort of just wait this out in that suite of offices, but have his medical teams on standby. Or if the president were to suddenly become severely ill, the intensive care unit would be only steps away as opposed to helicopter ride away. And I think that it's prudent that out of an abundance of caution they do this, because we still don't know all of the ways in which coronavirus works. We have a much better understanding of how the disease can progress. We have a much better understanding of things that we can use to treat patients who have it. I was very intrigued to see that the president got a dose of this experimental Regeneron antibody therapy. That is not widely available. The president got it through compassionate use. And as well he's taking simple things like zinc and vitamin D, and what is essentially the generic version of Pepcid, and then a baby aspirin as well, because we know that blood clotting can be a problem. We know that how your stomach reacts to things can be a problem. We know that vitamin D deficiency can cause a greater degree of coronavirus disease. And we know that zinc is good at preventing viral replication, or at least slowing it down. It also boosts your immune system. So the president does seem to be in good hands. I am sure they have remdesivir on hold should the president need it. He hasn't talked about hydroxychloroquine, though he did say that if he ever got coronavirus he would probably go to that well again. But I think at the moment, Bret, it's probably safe to say they are holding off on that one, at least for the moment."

      "utterance": "OK, John Roberts on the North Lawn, John, thanks. We heard from Dr. Manny Alvarez earlier. Let's go to Mike Emanuel on Capitol Hill. There is another coronavirus relief package underway, negotiations still continuing. And the question is, Mike, does this change that equation at all?"
    },

      "speaker": "MIKE EMANUEL, FOX NEWS CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Bret, great question. Good evening to you. Speaker Nancy Pelosi this morning said she thought it actually did change the dynamic, that it really refocused everyone involved in these talks, showing what a vicious disease this COVID-19 is. And we know that she spoke for more than an hour this afternoon with Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin. We're hearing there are still significant differences, but there was a change in tone this afternoon from Majority Leader Mitch McConnell back in Kentucky saying that he thought they were getting closer to an outcome. And you know McConnell very well, as I do, and he is not one for hyperbole. So if he says they are getting closer to an outcome, that is significant. Also on the House floor today, Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, Democrat of Maryland, said that he thought the talks might produce a deal this weekend. He said they wouldn't have a vote Monday or Tuesday because they would need to produce any agreement into legislative language. So we are hearing from both sides a significant push forward after it looked like they were stuck last night. And so perhaps this national story, this national drama of seeing our president and First Lady test positive for this dreadful disease that's affected so many American families, maybe it's forced everybody back to the table to get serious about cutting a deal. Bret?"

    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Yes, Mike, and from a Capitol Hill perspective, both sides of the aisle, at least for one day, seemed to send out wishes of get well and thoughts and prayers to the president, as opposed to what we usually hear in statements from both sides of the aisle."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "EMANUEL",
      "utterance": "Absolutely right. A lot of the president's harshest critics were extending their thoughts, their prayers for the president and First Lady from Chuck Schumer to Nancy Pelosi to Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio- Cortez. It was also interesting that this news that they had tested positive came out at 1:00 a.m., and there was no Capitol Hill reaction for hours, not until probably 9:00 a.m. eastern, like eight hours later, because I think lawmakers were trying to find the right tone to strike. What do you say at this point? It shakes up the country when the president of the United States has a health issue. This is a significant issue that has killed several hundred thousand of our fellow citizens. And so they wanted to strike the right tone, and so the right tone seemed to be let's all pray for the president and First Lady, hope for their speedy, a full recovery, and we can fight about the issues of the day another day."

Steve, you can't sugarcoat where the big issue on coronavirus is, and you wonder whether this moment will change the perspective of talking about it, of dealing about it in some way from this administration or from some of his supporters."

    {
      "speaker": "STEVE HAYES, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Yes, I think that's right. And you hope that the country can set aside partisanship. I think if you are hearing from partisan voices making partisan arguments at this point, it's a good check on whether you should be listening to them in the future. There are some people in our country who need to put partisanship on hold and need to focus on the jobs in front of them. I think the partisan politics can be set aside, we can return to that in a few days when we know better the condition of the president. But there are doctors, there are national security officials who need to be focused on doing their jobs regardless of the health of the president. I think if you are Mike Pence, I think you should be quarantined. I think people in the line of succession should certainly be quarantined in case what we are all hoping for, a speedy recovery, a mild case, doesn't happen. You have Army medical doctors who are going to be attending to the president who may have to make some very difficult decisions about the president's ability to continue to serve the country the way that he has been serving the country. So I think there are people who we need to be thinking about, need to be praying for, who have important jobs in front of them that are far outside of partisan politics."

      "utterance": "Mara, well wishes, I mentioned, from Capitol Hill but also from around the world. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who we remarked earlier had already been through his own battle with COVID-19, sending his best. Just moments ago, we got word from Kim Jong-un, saying that he offered his sympathy to the president and the First Lady, sincerely hoped that they would be recovering as soon as possible. You forget perhaps, that as the president goes to Walter Reed, the world continues. And there's a lot to worry about as president of the United States."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LIASSON",
      "utterance": "Right, there's a lot to worry about. And we are going to find out in the next couple of days, does he just do his regular job as normal from his suite of offices at Walter Reed, or are his symptoms severe enough that he is not able to do that? But it's interesting, there have been two other world leaders, Boris Johnson and Bolsonaro of Brazil who both friends of the president, but also who both got coronavirus. Neither of them were that close to a re-election campaign when they got it. So the president is in this very exclusive club of world leaders who have gotten this disease, and hopefully he will come through it just like them. But we're going to find out in the next couple of days how this effects his ability to govern. Also, his ability to want to get involved in those negotiations on Capitol Hill. He has signaled several times that he was willing to spend more money than Republicans on Capitol Hill seemed to be willing to, that he wanted individual -- more individual checks to go out to people the way they were in the first couple of relief bills. So it will be interesting to see now that it seems like they are making progress, does he want to get involved in that? So this is a -- this is a fraught moment."

    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",

      "speaker": "HURT",
      "utterance": "Absolutely, and if it's a moment that, as we talked about earlier, that kind of clarifies the politics, that's a good thing. Obviously, the president is among an exclusive number of world leaders who have contracted COVID, but he is now one man in over 7 million Americans who have contracted this disease. And the vast majority of them have survived, and obviously we are praying that the same happens to him and the First Fady."

That's it for this SPECIAL REPORT, fair, balanced, and unafraid. One more look at the president leaving the White House, going to Marine One as he heads to Walter Reed Medical Center.
