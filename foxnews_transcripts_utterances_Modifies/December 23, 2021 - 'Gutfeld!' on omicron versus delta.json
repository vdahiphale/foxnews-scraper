So, the Omicron variant sweeps across America and the world. And the data that's being collected about its severity is very encouraging. According to The New York Post, the early real world data, which is expected to be released before Christmas, found that Omicron is likely to bring on a mild illness with less serious symptoms in most people. It's a Festivus miracle, people. And a South African study, the only kind I read, suggests lower risk of hospitalization with Omicron versus Delta. Omicron is milder than Delta, a leaked U.K. government study finds. Well, this is welcome news to calm the frayed nerves of the American people. Right, mainstream media?",

      "sentences": "Now. no, its dominant now. OK. I guess -- I guess we're still going to have the fear merchants they continue spewing the only thing they know. Panic porn for their addicted and shrinking audience. But while the bad news junkies get their fix of fear, what do the rest of us do? And by rest, I don't mean just Republicans or red states or MAGA country. I mean, the growing number of average Americans who are waking up to reality. They're going out to stores, to restaurants, visiting with friends, or as the fear mongers would say, committing mass murder. So, let me get on my soapbox for a minute and say my fellow Americans, the end is near. End of the world? No. Hopefully the end of hysteria and fear. Messages of sanity are popping up in the most unlikely of places. Writing in the Atlantic, Yascha Mounk, who I assume is a member of the media elite. I mean, he is a professor who speaks four languages. He says, \"Omicron is the beginning of the end.\" \"Whatever damage Omicron might wreak in the immediate future, we will most likely soon lead lives that look a lot more like they did in the spring of 2019 than in the spring of 2020.\" Now, this is in The Atlantic, guys. If they were any further left, they'd be an oncoming traffic. So, why is that encouraging? Because their readers need to hear it. They need to hear it more than anyone else. They've been basting in their juices of their own hysteria for two years. Also, recently in The Atlantic, Matthew Walther writes, \"where I live, nobody cares about COVID,\" which is fair. Where I live, nobody cares about The Atlantic. He says, everyone he knows is going on about their lives. Ignoring all of the dire warnings and restrictions coming from public health officials. \"Many, if not most Americans are leading their lives as if COVID is over, and they have been for a long time.\" And I wholeheartedly agree. The question is, what to do? Just go on living our lives and letting there be two Americas? One sane and one insane? That didn't work for Korea. Governor Ron DeSantis is fond of calling his state the free state of Florida, while blue states continue crackdown and shut down. While seeing more coronavirus then a wet market full of pangolins. I should have said a Wuhan lab because that's the kind of guy I am. OK. Take a look at this picture. I snapped this at a movie theater couple of weeks ago. This was the opening weekend of a big Hollywood blockbuster. They really ruined the world we live in. Didn't they? People are either still terrified, or they're forgotten what living a normal life is like. And there are real consequences to this. Look, I'm not harmed by having a theater all to myself. But there are jobs, livelihoods, and lives that have been lost because of these interventions. They all did more harm than good. So, I don't want to just ignore the problem. I want to do something about it. But I don't want to scream and stomp my feet and engage in the kind of hysterical behavior that's happening on the other side. What to do? Mock them. We have to relentlessly make fun of these people. The ones in power, not the scared woman driving along with a mask on her face. It's the only way out and ridicule works. It's why Jimmy Fallon no longer works for Chippendales. Greg Gutfeld, the king of late night has shown us the way. The so-called experts have ruined the world. They now must be lampooned. Anthony Fauci just told us to disinvite unvaccinated family members from Christmas dinner. He's a fool. Don't get mad at him, laugh at him. It takes away his power, which we should have never given him in the first place. Dr. Kevorkian cured more patients than Fauci ever did. And his cure lasted longer. So, thank you, Greg. Let the force continue and long may you rain. And I'm not just saying that because you let me sit on your diminutive throne for the evening.",

If the Democrats were smart, they would bribe the Twitter to put Trump back on there. Because if Trump's on Twitter right now, Biden's probably polling at 53 percent because we're discussing the fact that he called probably an actress on Saturday Night Live a dog and that would get more media priority than the fact that inflation's at a 39-year high.

So, the Omicron variant sweeps across America and the world. And the data that's being collected about its severity is very encouraging. According to The New York Post, the early real world data, which is expected to be released before Christmas, found that Omicron is likely to bring on a mild illness with less serious symptoms in most people. It's a Festivus miracle, people. And a South African study, the only kind I read, suggests lower risk of hospitalization with Omicron versus Delta. Omicron is milder than Delta, a leaked U.K. government study finds. Well, this is welcome news to calm the frayed nerves of the American people. Right, mainstream media?"

Panic porn for their addicted and shrinking audience. But while the bad news junkies get their fix of fear, what do the rest of us do? And by rest, I don't mean just Republicans or red states or MAGA country. I mean, the growing number of average Americans who are waking up to reality. They're going out to stores, to restaurants, visiting with friends, or as the fear mongers would say, committing mass murder. So, let me get on my soapbox for a minute and say my fellow Americans, the end is near. End of the world? No. Hopefully the end of hysteria and fear. Messages of sanity are popping up in the most unlikely of places. Writing in the Atlantic, Yascha Mounk, who I assume is a member of the media elite. I mean, he is a professor who speaks four languages. He says, \"Omicron is the beginning of the end.\" \"Whatever damage Omicron might wreak in the immediate future, we will most likely soon lead lives that look a lot more like they did in the spring of 2019 than in the spring of 2020.\" Now, this is in The Atlantic, guys. If they were any further left, they'd be an oncoming traffic. So, why is that encouraging? Because their readers need to hear it. They need to hear it more than anyone else. They've been basting in their juices of their own hysteria for two years. Also, recently in The Atlantic, Matthew Walther writes, \"where I live, nobody cares about COVID,\" which is fair. Where I live, nobody cares about The Atlantic. He says, everyone he knows is going on about their lives. Ignoring all of the dire warnings and restrictions coming from public health officials. \"Many, if not most Americans are leading their lives as if COVID is over, and they have been for a long time.\" And I wholeheartedly agree. The question is, what to do? Just go on living our lives and letting there be two Americas? One sane and one insane? That didn't work for Korea. Governor Ron DeSantis is fond of calling his state the free state of Florida, while blue states continue crackdown and shut down. While seeing more coronavirus then a wet market full of pangolins. I should have said a Wuhan lab because that's the kind of guy I am. OK. Take a look at this picture. I snapped this at a movie theater couple of weeks ago. This was the opening weekend of a big Hollywood blockbuster. They really ruined the world we live in. Didn't they? People are either still terrified, or they're forgotten what living a normal life is like. And there are real consequences to this. Look, I'm not harmed by having a theater all to myself. But there are jobs, livelihoods, and lives that have been lost because of these interventions. They all did more harm than good. So, I don't want to just ignore the problem. I want to do something about it. But I don't want to scream and stomp my feet and engage in the kind of hysterical behavior that's happening on the other side. What to do? Mock them. We have to relentlessly make fun of these people. The ones in power, not the scared woman driving along with a mask on her face. It's the only way out and ridicule works. It's why Jimmy Fallon no longer works for Chippendales. Greg Gutfeld, the king of late night has shown us the way. The so-called experts have ruined the world. They now must be lampooned. Anthony Fauci just told us to disinvite unvaccinated family members from Christmas dinner. He's a fool. Don't get mad at him, laugh at him. It takes away his power, which we should have never given him in the first place. Dr. Kevorkian cured more patients than Fauci ever did. And his cure lasted longer. So, thank you, Greg. Let the force continue and long may you rain. And I'm not just saying that because you let me sit on your diminutive throne for the evening."

Anthony Fauci telling you to disinvite your unvaccinated family members, not to mention maybe they have some health problems. Maybe they have natural immunity, maybe they just don't need whatever he's selling. And he's putting a wedge between you and your family, because he wants you to rely on him more than you rely on your grandparents or your cousin, for example. There are two Americas. The rest of the country moved on a year and a half ago, once they really started to know because it's unlike D.C., the rest of the country can look at data and discern the difference between a one size fits all approach which has destroyed the country and look at that and say, look, am I at risk? Am I a risk factor? If I am going to take more precautions, if I'm not, I'm going to go live about my life. And this idea that we're now othering people that the president is saying that, you know, the unvaccinated class. If that language had been used in a different country three years ago, the state department would have condemned it as leading to something more problematic, right? And so, you know, we have to reject this. And how do you protest? Well, maybe if your city is implementing a vaccine card for a restaurant, maybe you just inconvenience you don't go to a restaurant for a year. You know, that -- that's the kind of thing that people have to do before these people stop. Because if you don't do anything and you just talk about it, then they're never going to stop."

And I think Joe Biden's are probably three or four points lower. I'll disagree with Dagen a little bit. Usually president's approvals are pushed by what people feel about the economy. With Joe Biden, he played such a big hand that Trump had caused this pandemic. And when he comes in, he's going to get it all solved. And the fact that we're going through this all over again, kids are worried about like, where they have dances and football games, and will they be able to go to school, they're going to be in mask forever. And the fact that, you know, these working people, they're starting to break. I mean, after a while, you want to go back to normal. And I think that has the biggest impact on his poll numbers. And here is the thing. Here is where Dagen is 100 percent right. He can't get out of it. Because the man can't talk. And he doesn't have the energy to do the job. And his number two, I don't know where she is. Where do they send her? Mars? She's nowhere to be seen."

And in flow - we're in real bad inflation now. If you saw the report on General Mills is going to raise prices 20 percent in January, we're not living at a time where you've got to turn tricks to afford a box of tricks. Like it's not supposed to work that way. And the thing that's killing Biden and the only thing that could actually save Biden, I mean this, is if they let Trump back on Twitter. If the Democrats were smart, they would bribe the Twitter to put Trump back on there. Because if Trump's on Twitter right now, Biden's probably polling at 53 percent because we're discussing the fact that he called probably an actress on Saturday Night Live a dog and that would get more media priority than the fact that inflation's at a 39-year high. I mean, the worst thing that ever happened to Democrats was Trump leaving the stage because all the focus is on substance for them and their substance is terrible."

And at number eight, it's Sean Hannity, can't argue with that. I can't or he'll put me in a headlock. George Stephanopoulos, also from ABC, and at six, Oprah Winfrey, never heard of her. And here's the top five. CNN Chief International correspondent Clarissa Ward. She was on the ground in Afghanistan for her coverage during the withdrawal of U.S. troops.

But now he's realized that this is just a beast that wants to get fed, and it'll devour anybody, even if you're a part of it because to Katie's point, these are just people looking to do something with all of the bile and hate inside of them. They're miserable people. And now that everybody in society kind of knows that it's become fashionable. It's almost like uniting the country. It's a piece of a common culture as we all hate these -- you know. And that's kind of what it is. And he did make a point, though, about how the NFL isn't really focusing on the treatment options and the health of COVID with their protocol rules.

According to Rolling Stone, the song is a smug mess of colonialism and racist stereotypes. And those are its best qualities. Number two, oh, was Maroon Five's version of \"Happy Christmas War Is Over,\" which I'm assuming is terrible because it's by Maroon Five. Lastly, Jessica and Ashlee Simpson's rendition of the \"Little Drummer Boy\" is the worst Christmas song.
