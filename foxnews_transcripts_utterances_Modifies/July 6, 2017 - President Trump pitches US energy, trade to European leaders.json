      "sentences": "President Trump in Warsaw, Poland, delivering a speech about 37 minutes long to a lot of applause from the Polish crowd there. Lofty rhetoric, some pointed lines about Russia, and as you heard, a commitment to Article Five. Some pundits, mainstream media included, are calling it one of the best speeches of Trump's presidency so far.  What about this and his trip that will take him to President Putin tomorrow. Let's bring in our panel: Charles Hurt, political columnist for \"The Washington Times,\" A.B. Stoddard, associate editor at \"Real Clear Politics,\" and syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer. OK, Charlie, there were a lot of lines in there that really struck a chord as far as painting a picture of a region that includes what's now called the Three Seas Initiative. These are all these countries that are surrounded by three seas as you take a look at the map, and trying to change the dynamic in that region, especially when it comes to energy and taking Russia out of the equation. CHARLES HURT, POLITICAL COLUMNIST, \"WASHINGTON TIMES\": I thought it was a tremendous speech. I thought, as you pointed out, there were a lot of great Reagan-esque lines in it. It was a friendly audience. It's an audience that wants to love America, wants to turn to America for guidance, has turned to America for guidance in the past. And if you think about eight years ago, this is about when President Obama was beginning his what a lot of people derisively called his apology tour, going around the world sort of apologizing for America and making excuses for failings that he sees about America.  This speech was very different from that. It was more like a Reagan sounding speech where he talked about the shared ideals. He called Poland the soul of Europe, and I think there is definitely a new sheriff in town.",

That is going to momentarily calm the waters with our European allies, but -- and his pitch for American energy was good.   It's just the real background tension of all these meetings about the different direction trade is going in, these different new alliances on trade, the discord, that we'll call discord that Merkel described over the Paris accord, we think these meetings are going to result in things. They don't immediately, and I think that the impact of his America first new direction against multilateralism and against global trade deals is yet to be felt.

This was a refutation root and branch of the ideas underlining the inaugural address, which was America first, the allies are parasites. We're now going to stick up for ourselves. There was none of that. It was the opposite. This was an ode to treaties and to alliances and even in some ways to trade. This is completely new.   And I thought the way he treated Polish history was amazing. Normally we harp on the depredations of the Nazis. Trump went out of his way to harp on the depredations of the Soviets both during the Second World War when they stood outside the gates of Warsaw and allowed it to be raised and destroyed by the Nazis in the uprising, and then heaping a program on how the Soviets treated Poland during the cold war. And then to top it off he talked about the monopoly of means, talking about the Russians. The use of monopoly and pressure in energy resources that's been going on, this was a very anti-Russian speech, very uncharacteristic of this president.

That did not go as planned. Of course, I don't believe they did in the first place. But the other thing that I think is interesting here is it was in America first speech, but it was the best incarnation of America first. It was about America in terms of the ideals that we all believe in, because we are a nation of ideas and radical ideas. And the reason Poland turns to the west and turns to America is because they have lived under the very dark opposite of those ideals. And so when you talk about America first, as Charles was saying, it is kind of Poland first, too, because we all share those ideals. And it was a great recitation of those ideals.",
