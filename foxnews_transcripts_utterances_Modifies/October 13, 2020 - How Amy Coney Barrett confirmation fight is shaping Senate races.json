Breaking tonight, U.S. Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett is vowing to bring no agenda to the bench should she get confirmed. Senators continue at this moment to question Barrett on a variety of hot button issues. We're monitoring the hearing for any news, we'll turn around those sound bites and they are about to take a break shortly during our show.  Today's questioning, obviously, more comfort -- confrontational than Monday's opening statements but nowhere near the last confirmation for Supreme Court justice that we heard on Capitol Hill.  Fox News chief legal correspondent, anchor at \"FOX NEWS @ NIGHT\" Shannon Bream has been up on the Hill all day and she has highlights right now.  Good evening, Shannon.",

Also today, the U.S. Supreme Court is stopping the census from continuing through the end of October at least for now. The Trump administration had asked the nation's High Court to suspend the district court's order permitting the census to continue.

So she parried pretty well throughout the day. And Democrats tried as hard as they could to get her on the record, but they didn't. I don't think they expected to.

The Democrats kept holding up these pictures of these people in terrible circumstances -- sick people, people in bad shape, and saying what would you do about that? But the question isn't whether the government or the court will do anything about that. The question before the court is whether the legislative remedies that are put forward to help these people are constitutional. It's a different set of questions. The Supreme Court is not a public charity or foundation. The Supreme Court decides on constitutionality. She had to keep reminding that. And the other thing, which is very interesting, and Mara said it's a foregone conclusion she will be confirmed. It's also pretty much, Bret, a forego conclusion that the Affordable Care Act will not be taken down as unconstitutional. Severability, which means you can take the piece out that is objectionable, means, and two conservative justices come out in favor of that, Alito and Kavanaugh, once you do that, the rest of the act can stand, because the presumption of the court is that legislatures should be allowed to do what they want to do.

      "sentences": "More than 215,000 of our fellow Americans have died, and millions more, including the president, Republican members of this committee, and more than 100 frontline workers here at the Capitol Complex have been infected. This pandemic has led to an historic economic crisis, causing millions of workers to lose their jobs without warning, and 12 million Americans have lost their employer-based health insurance. The Senate, I strongly believe, must be and needs to be laser focused on you, the American people to help you get through this pandemic. To do so, the Senate urgently needs to pass passing critical financial relief for those who are struggling because of this pandemic, and many are struggling. People need help. They need help to pay their rent or mortgage. Parents need help putting food on the table. The millions of American workers who have lost their jobs need help making it through the end of the month, and small businesses need help so they don't have to close their doors for good. But sadly, Senate Republicans have rushed to hold this Supreme Court confirmation hearing rather than help those who are suffering through a public health crisis not of their making. As I said yesterday, these priorities are not the American people's priorities. Since President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law, Senate Republicans' number one priority has been to tear it down. And remember, before the ACA, the Affordable Care Act, insurance companies held virtually unchecked power over our health care system. They could refuse to cover basic medical expenses like maternity care, like mammograms, like prescription drugs or hospital stays. Worst of all, if you were sick, they could deny you coverage altogether, and there is nothing you could do about it. Over the last nine years, Republicans in Congress have tried 70 times -- 70 times -- to repeal or roll back the ACA in the United States congress. In 2013, Senate Republicans were so desperate to stop its success that they shut down the entire government for weeks. After President Trump was elected, Washington Republicans spent nearly a year trying to repeal the ACA. But I will always remember the thousands of Americans from all over our country and all walks of life who crowded into the halls of the United States capital to require that lawmakers see their faces and understand how they would be hurt if there was a repeal of the Affordable Care Act. Brave activists in the disability community staged sit-ins on the Hill, seniors protested to keep prescription drugs affordable, mothers and fathers walked the halls with their children in strollers to show Congress the face of those who depended on the law, and doctors and nurses protested to protect their patients' access to the care they desperately need. Together with many of my colleagues, I joined civil rights and community leaders to speak to the thousands of people who gathered outside the capital, and they pleaded and the begged with lawmakers to do the right things. All these dedicated Americans demanding that their voices be heard, and they made a difference. They made a difference. History will remember that late night, thumbs down movement when the great, great John McCain denied Republicans the opportunity to repeal the Affordable Care Act. And now, following a decade of failure, Washington Republicans have realized that the Affordable Care Act is working too well and helping too many people to repeal it without facing serious political consequences. But what are they doing? After suffering the backlash they provoked by targeting the law in Congress, they decided instead to circumvent voters and try to strike down the Affordable Care Act through the courts. Right now, the Trump administration and Senate Republicans are urging the Supreme Court to strike down the entire Affordable Care Act and all of its patient protections. Republicans are scrambling to confirm this nominee as fast as possible because they need one more Trump judge on the bench before November 10th to win and strike down the entire Affordable Care Act. This is not hyperbole. This is not a hypothetical. This is happening. And here's what you have to know. People are scared. People are scared of what will happen if the Affordable Care Act is destroyed in the middle of a pandemic. There are more than 100 million Americans with pre-existing conditions like asthma and diabetes, heart disease, who know that they could be denied coverage or charged more by insurance companies if Donald Trump is successful in getting rid of the Affordable Care Act. And because of the coronavirus, more than 7 million people have now a preexisting condition that they didn't have earlier this year. Those who depend on the ACA are afraid of their lives being turned upside down if the court strikes it down. They know what could happen. And Judge Barrett, I will share with you in the American people a list -- no protections for preexisting conditions, higher costs for health care for women and people over the age of 50, young adults kicked off their parents' insurance, more expensive prescription drugs for seniors, insurance companies refusing to cover mental health care, insurance companies refusing to cover maternity care, no free mammograms.

The Trump administration had asked the nation's High Court to suspend the district court's order permitting the census to continue. It argued the head count needed to end immediately so the Census Bureau has enough time to crunch the numbers before congressionally mandated yearend deadline. Opponents insist minorities and others in hard to count areas would be missed of the census ends on time.

The Democrats kept holding up these pictures of these people in terrible circumstances -- sick people, people in bad shape, and saying what would you do about that? But the question isn't whether the government or the court will do anything about that. The question before the court is whether the legislative remedies that are put forward to help these people are constitutional. It's a different set of questions. The Supreme Court is not a public charity or foundation. The Supreme Court decides on constitutionality. She had to keep reminding that. And the other thing, which is very interesting, and Mara said it's a foregone conclusion she will be confirmed. It's also pretty much, Bret, a forego conclusion that the Affordable Care Act will not be taken down as unconstitutional. Severability, which means you can take the piece out that is objectionable, means, and two conservative justices come out in favor of that, Alito and Kavanaugh, once you do that, the rest of the act can stand, because the presumption of the court is that legislatures should be allowed to do what they want to do. So this notion that if she's confirmed she'll vote with the bad guys, the bad conservatives, it's going to be six-three to preserve the Affordable Care Act anyway. Kind of missing the point."

As Richard Fallon from Harvard said, Roe is not a super president because calls for its overruling has never seized. But that doesn't mean that Roe should be overruled. It just means that it doesn't smell in the fall handful of cases like Marbury versus Madison and Brown versus the Board that no one questions anymore."

I think because there is so little drama about the likely outcome here, I've been paying attention to each side, how they are using their time, particularly on the Democratic side. I think they're trying to make a few points leading up to the election to play to their strengths in the election. I think that Senator Feinstein was pretty effective. I know she's gotten some criticism from her own side, being maybe not up to the challenge anymore. I think she did a good job. Senator Durbin I think did a pretty effective job, as did Senator Coons. Other people were far less effective, I would point out. Sheldon Whitehouse from Rhode Island, who spoke for 30 straight minutes, the nominee did not say one word during his conspiracy theory. Senator Hirono was quite a feat to watch as well. So it's been a bit of a mixed bag today."

Nancy Pelosi seems very certain in her belief and her strategy that if she waits long enough, she'll get what she wants from the White House. The president has been all over the place, but lately his last landing spot has been that he wants a big deal, and I think he said $1.8 trillion, go big or go home."

Now, the president took the blame for pulling the plug on the negotiations just a couple days ago and then reversed himself, so this seems to be an opportunity for Democrats."

Now you tell us after $82 trillion, which is the estimate they put on what this cost, 150 million, mostly children, driven into poverty. More deaths than from coronavirus, children in underdeveloped countries because they lack food, water, and inoculation because things have been shut down. Not a good idea to have a lockdown. Wish you had said that a little earlier. It's been very costly here and around the world. Some of us thought that from the beginning. This should be getting a lot of attention, a lot of attention."

That's it for us, fair, balanced, unafraid. Martha will pick up on the other side."

      "speaker": "SEN. KAMALA HARRIS, (D-CA) VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE",
      "utterance": "More than 215,000 of our fellow Americans have died, and millions more, including the president, Republican members of this committee, and more than 100 frontline workers here at the Capitol Complex have been infected. This pandemic has led to an historic economic crisis, causing millions of workers to lose their jobs without warning, and 12 million Americans have lost their employer-based health insurance. The Senate, I strongly believe, must be and needs to be laser focused on you, the American people to help you get through this pandemic. To do so, the Senate urgently needs to pass passing critical financial relief for those who are struggling because of this pandemic, and many are struggling. People need help. They need help to pay their rent or mortgage. Parents need help putting food on the table. The millions of American workers who have lost their jobs need help making it through the end of the month, and small businesses need help so they don't have to close their doors for good. But sadly, Senate Republicans have rushed to hold this Supreme Court confirmation hearing rather than help those who are suffering through a public health crisis not of their making. As I said yesterday, these priorities are not the American people's priorities. Since President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law, Senate Republicans' number one priority has been to tear it down. And remember, before the ACA, the Affordable Care Act, insurance companies held virtually unchecked power over our health care system. They could refuse to cover basic medical expenses like maternity care, like mammograms, like prescription drugs or hospital stays. Worst of all, if you were sick, they could deny you coverage altogether, and there is nothing you could do about it. Over the last nine years, Republicans in Congress have tried 70 times -- 70 times -- to repeal or roll back the ACA in the United States congress. In 2013, Senate Republicans were so desperate to stop its success that they shut down the entire government for weeks. After President Trump was elected, Washington Republicans spent nearly a year trying to repeal the ACA. But I will always remember the thousands of Americans from all over our country and all walks of life who crowded into the halls of the United States capital to require that lawmakers see their faces and understand how they would be hurt if there was a repeal of the Affordable Care Act. Brave activists in the disability community staged sit-ins on the Hill, seniors protested to keep prescription drugs affordable, mothers and fathers walked the halls with their children in strollers to show Congress the face of those who depended on the law, and doctors and nurses protested to protect their patients' access to the care they desperately need. Together with many of my colleagues, I joined civil rights and community leaders to speak to the thousands of people who gathered outside the capital, and they pleaded and the begged with lawmakers to do the right things. All these dedicated Americans demanding that their voices be heard, and they made a difference. They made a difference. History will remember that late night, thumbs down movement when the great, great John McCain denied Republicans the opportunity to repeal the Affordable Care Act. And now, following a decade of failure, Washington Republicans have realized that the Affordable Care Act is working too well and helping too many people to repeal it without facing serious political consequences. But what are they doing? After suffering the backlash they provoked by targeting the law in Congress, they decided instead to circumvent voters and try to strike down the Affordable Care Act through the courts. Right now, the Trump administration and Senate Republicans are urging the Supreme Court to strike down the entire Affordable Care Act and all of its patient protections. Republicans are scrambling to confirm this nominee as fast as possible because they need one more Trump judge on the bench before November 10th to win and strike down the entire Affordable Care Act. This is not hyperbole. This is not a hypothetical. This is happening. And here's what you have to know. People are scared. People are scared of what will happen if the Affordable Care Act is destroyed in the middle of a pandemic. There are more than 100 million Americans with pre-existing conditions like asthma and diabetes, heart disease, who know that they could be denied coverage or charged more by insurance companies if Donald Trump is successful in getting rid of the Affordable Care Act. And because of the coronavirus, more than 7 million people have now a preexisting condition that they didn't have earlier this year. Those who depend on the ACA are afraid of their lives being turned upside down if the court strikes it down. They know what could happen. And Judge Barrett, I will share with you in the American people a list -- no protections for preexisting conditions, higher costs for health care for women and people over the age of 50, young adults kicked off their parents' insurance, more expensive prescription drugs for seniors, insurance companies refusing to cover mental health care, insurance companies refusing to cover maternity care, no free mammograms.
