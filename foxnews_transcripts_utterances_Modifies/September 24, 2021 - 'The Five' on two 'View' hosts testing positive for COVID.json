They have become vehicles for hate and disunity by pointing fingers at people who are just trying to do their jobs. I promise you, these people will pay. These people are not only innocent, and being subjected to a witch hunt created by the media and the Democrats.  They are doing their job protecting the border because this mindless invalid that we call a president isn't doing his job and he is in control of the people that helped him get elected. In any conflict that we have seen so far, Joe has never sided with the American citizen and especially Americans in law enforcement. Instead, he embraces left wing myths based on debunk stuff like this.   Remember the fine people hoax. This is actually worse than the fine people hoax. We nailed it before when he -- he is a shell of himself and he's operated by the far left in his party. He drowned seven children and three other people out of his sheer incompetence. And he is publicly more troubled by this image, this image that shows nobody being harmed, this one image of a border patrol officer who hasn't hurt anybody, and some of these officers have actually saved lives.  He cares more about this image than those dead people in Afghanistan. He should be on desk duty. He should be in bed duty for the remainder of his term. Everybody knows this is false. They know it's false. But they've once again, they've run to the idea of race as a way to distract from their ultimate failures. And they are throwing Americans under the bus.

Those comments between what President Biden said this morning as far as these people will pay and Mayorkas this afternoon, hours apart, then saying the investigation into what occurred has not concluded. Brandon Judd was on my program today, head of the Border Patrol Council ask very clearly, how can there be a fair investigation now that President Biden has weighed in in the way he has? It's a fair question, one that was pressed to the White House this afternoon. What stands out to me, though, is the flip from Mayorkas. Go back to his initial response, that these are images where nothing can be concluded other than they were -- they were employing the policy they've been trained to at the border.  He saw the public outrage. He came back and showed that he was outraged at those images. That's a real problem and I don't how the White House is going to defend this especially now that there's going to be an investigation.",

And if you look at what the questions were today the White House, Mayorkas has no plans to prevent this from happening. The administration has no plans to keep thousands of more people from coming to the border and camping under a bridge in a 100 degree.  But the media didn't care about this issue for months until they could use agents and law enforcement for a racial agenda. And when the photographer says, well, the photos can be misconstrued. With all due respect to him, they are only misconstrued if you are looking for a problem, if you're looking for something to distract away from spending $3.5 million, distracting from hundreds of Americans and green card holders who were stranded behind enemy lines in Taliban territory right now. And for them to go after regular everyday people like the border patrol and paint them as inhumane when they have dedicated their lives and go out every single day, not to just protect Americans but to rescue illegal immigrants who are breaking our laws is the first thing they do in this country is disgusting.",

They have become vehicles for hate and disunity by pointing fingers at people who are just trying to do their jobs. I promise you, these people will pay. These people are not only innocent, and being subjected to a witch hunt created by the media and the Democrats. They are doing their job protecting the border because this mindless invalid that we call a president isn't doing his job and he is in control of the people that helped him get elected. In any conflict that we have seen so far, Joe has never sided with the American citizen and especially Americans in law enforcement. Instead, he embraces left wing myths based on debunk stuff like this. Remember the fine people hoax. This is actually worse than the fine people hoax. We nailed it before when he -- he is a shell of himself and he's operated by the far left in his party. He drowned seven children and three other people out of his sheer incompetence. And he is publicly more troubled by this image, this image that shows nobody being harmed, this one image of a border patrol officer who hasn't hurt anybody, and some of these officers have actually saved lives. He cares more about this image than those dead people in Afghanistan. He should be on desk duty. He should be in bed duty for the remainder of his term. Everybody knows this is false. They know it's false. But they've once again, they've run to the idea of race as a way to distract from their ultimate failures. And they are throwing Americans under the bus.

Those comments between what President Biden said this morning as far as these people will pay and Mayorkas this afternoon, hours apart, then saying the investigation into what occurred has not concluded. Brandon Judd was on my program today, head of the Border Patrol Council ask very clearly, how can there be a fair investigation now that President Biden has weighed in in the way he has? It's a fair question, one that was pressed to the White House this afternoon. What stands out to me, though, is the flip from Mayorkas. Go back to his initial response, that these are images where nothing can be concluded other than they were -- they were employing the policy they've been trained to at the border. He saw the public outrage. He came back and showed that he was outraged at those images. That's a real problem and I don't how the White House is going to defend this especially now that there's going to be an investigation."

It is absolutely disgusting that the president of the United States will come out today, and not only say that people are going to be punished, but there hasn't been a thorough investigation unless you can watch this video and see exactly what happened and know that there is no need for an investigation, that the investigation itself is a punishment in a way to deepen the morale in a negative way at the border. And if you look at what the questions were today the White House, Mayorkas has no plans to prevent this from happening. The administration has no plans to keep thousands of more people from coming to the border and camping under a bridge in a 100 degree. But the media didn't care about this issue for months until they could use agents and law enforcement for a racial agenda. And when the photographer says, well, the photos can be misconstrued. With all due respect to him, they are only misconstrued if you are looking for a problem, if you're looking for something to distract away from spending $3.5 million, distracting from hundreds of Americans and green card holders who were stranded behind enemy lines in Taliban territory right now. And for them to go after regular everyday people like the border patrol and paint them as inhumane when they have dedicated their lives and go out every single day, not to just protect Americans but to rescue illegal immigrants who are breaking our laws is the first thing they do in this country is disgusting."

And I will admit, and I don't think that I am a, you know, a Trump derangement symptom suffer. When I first saw the images and this might just be from being someone who doesn't hang out on border patrol a lot, I thought like this looks really weird to me.

So, she's definitely not delivering press conferences anywhere so we had to watch to see what she was going to say, most particularly on the border. I'll let you know she finally was introduced 51 minutes into the show and that was the only thing she said about problems at the border, not the unprecedented number of migrants flowing over our southern border, not the horrible, inhumane conditions that thousands of Haitian migrants have been living in under that Del Rio bridge, it was those photographs, Jessica. That was, I mean, I'll call it shocking. I mean, she could have easily transitioned to 184 days. I look into it before I came out here this evening. One hundred eighty-four days ago she was in put -- in charge of the border. And she had nothing else to say on it? I thought that was shocking. The other thing cringeworthy, I don't know why they did it the way they did it, you know, they tested positive, the right thing to do is yank them off the set, throw to commercial, get them off there. Not the way they did the way that they did. They went to awkward questions from the audience about marriage advice, I don't know.

We all remember the stimulus weakest recovery since World War II. The problem for him now is credibility along with incompetence because Americans are being bombarded with these images of all these failures that he's causing, and then he's lying about what we are seeing in the images and that's what's creating the problem with the American people.

Biden does maybe one thing every other day and it's patently awful, like it's horrible. But he's only conscious maybe for 30 minutes. Imagine how bad this would be if he didn't nap, right? Imagine if he was conscious all the time how horrible it would be. This is the opposite of Trump. Everybody knew what they were getting with Trump, everybody did. If you hated him you knew what you're getting, if you like him you knew what you were getting. And he was going to fulfill the promises that he set out. Biden is sold America a bill of goods. And right now, we are beginning to see that. We're beginning to see that he is a conduit for far-left perpetrators and as that becomes more and more apparent and as parts of this country sadly fell apart, he is going to be less, less popular.

But I actually -- and maybe this is why I don't work in the White House because I have a different point of view on this. But I would go out there and I would say, I see every poll, and I know how you're feeling. And that's how Joe Biden won the primary against dozens of other people. He was like, I'm going to take the pulse of where the country is, and the country is a center-left place, right? That the people are overwhelmingly pro- choice, but they're for restrictions. Let's say we're not for open borders, are not for health care for people who are undocumented, they don't want to defend the police. And he went out there, and he won because of that. And the polls take the temperature of the country. And right now the temperature is not going to be like too hot or too cold, but people are not at 98.6 degrees. And I think recognizing that and just saying I'm making these decisions, and I understand that right now, you're not feeling great, right? Like inflation is bad.

She writes in the New York Times, \"He walked toward me and greeted me with a strong bear hug while lowering one hand to firmly grab and squeeze the cheek of my buttock. And she also has the receipts providing the times with a printed copy of an e-mail from Chris from that same night where he said he was ashamed of his behavior and apologize to her husband.

We saw how he handled his brother's scandals. He did not address them on his show or on air. We will see how he addresses this.

It's not where I come from. I don't think he's going to get MeTooed because CNN needs the guy. Their ratings are atrocious. He's probably the highest-rated guy on that network right now. And he can't even crack a million at that hour. And Lemons in trouble. He was accused of sexual misconduct with some guy out in the Hamptons just a couple years ago. Both of those things are probably being handled behind closed doors. But ABC might have issues too, because a lot of people are saying were there any settlements with Cuomo and other women while he was at ABC? We don't know that yet.
