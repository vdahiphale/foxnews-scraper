No surprise since even the Doltz (ph) who signed that letter claiming it was a Putin plot, including the keystone cops of National Security, Clapper and Brennan claim there's no evidence. So once hired to fair out disinformation, Clapper and Brennan now roll their own. I guess the meeting will jump on this and focus on the big man. Was it a quid pro quo how Hunter sought millions for pop in exchange whatever China wanted. Not so. Asking media to give equal time to Biden's real scandal after four years of pushing the bogus Trump once, that's like asking CNN's to cover their legal analysts Zoom habits.  The media is happy to chase a woman nodding to Trump in a town hall, but not any story that exposes their journalistic shortcomings. So outraged over 2016, they put America through hell, unleashing a non-stop parade of unsubstantiated direct (ph), starting with the Steele dossier and culminating and diverting resources with their sham impeachment as COVID spread.   Their obsession cost lives. And now, they refuse to cover this one story about how the Biden's put our nation's interests up for sale. How dare you waste our time? We have to track down a cop who wore a MAGA hat, a sorority girl critical of BLM on Instagram. That's the real story. But the scandal isn't just what Hunter did for dad and what dad knew. It's also how once gain the media decides what truths to bury. No wonder Americans despise the press. If only Hunter had come out and endorsed Trump, then he would be toast. All right, the two of us are here in New York City holding down the fort as they say.",

And we're going to see where this story goes. But you had Major Garrett with CBS tweeting out the DOJ, FBI believing that it is not Russian disinformation.

They've signalled that the president is going to bring this up, even if the debate moderator doesn't. And again, I go back to this idea that I find it a little bit strange that the Biden team has not done more to at least answer some of it, even if it was on background. Because one of things that Mike Pence did so effectively in the vice presidential debate is he drew Kamala Harris out on court-packing.  Because the Biden/Harris had refused to talk about court-packing so much, that by the time you had 100 million people watching, then he was able to lower the boom on that.

And that they are the prime actors on the global stage in terms of cyber espionage. But, you know, to me, all of the story is being blown up unnecessarily by a Trump campaign that is drowning. And they are trying to just flail and drag everybody else down with them. So I'm going to say this is a silly story. I am glad that people want to go on and on. But I would like to just point out some facts, Greg.  Today, we learned that, in fact, President Trump had a bank account in China and paid more taxes in China than he paid in the United States. I mean, that's a fact. That's what happened today. And today, we learned again that the president, the great deal-maker, can't get Mitch McConnell to agree on a stimulus plan to help the American economy at this juncture.

I don't feel good about the son of a VP selling access to his dad and his dad using taxpayer money to push policies to get his son rich. The American people don't like that. You know what else, Juan? The president was accused of awful things. He was spied upon. He was investigated. He turned over thousands of documents, had his family, his campaign, and his cabinet testify, do depositions for years, and they found nothing. Yet, they have some evidence on Joe for doing something super shady. Joe says it didn't happen, and then gets censored by the big tech. That's when you know you got him. Because what is the deal now? Anything that hurts Joe Biden before a campaign is Russia disinformation. Was Tara Reid Russian? Were the riots all summer, was that Russian? So now, if you have a story that you run that's bad for Joe, you have to have your copy editors at Twitter check it out.   You have to send the Hunter hard drive over to Silicon Valley so they can flush it out. That's not how these things work.

The president is always dealing with Democrats, whether they're moderators or people leaking about him in his own administration. So that's not the issue. He's going to go after Joe Biden for the pay-for-play with China. And Americans hate corruption. Welker will try to bail Joe out. You can guarantee that. And he's going to stay focused on it. I wouldn't listen to anonymous Republicans giving Donald Trump advice about how to win. Republicans lost two times in a row. I think Donald Trump knows how to win, and I think he should trust his instincts there. I do believe that he should really laser-focus on the economy. He can feast on Joe Biden's economic record. It is atrocious. He paints Biden as the pro- lockdown guy. He has got a fetish with lockdowns for some reason. That makes no sense.  And it was, Juan, supposed to be about foreign policy. But the president's foreign policy has been so good. It's not even a topic. Joe doesn't even bring it up on the campaign trail with the little circles of people around him watching because it has been pretty good. So we'll what happens. It is a crucial debate, though. I mean, this race has tightened in the battlegrounds. It's neck and neck.

So once hired to fair out disinformation, Clapper and Brennan now roll their own. I guess the meeting will jump on this and focus on the big man. Was it a quid pro quo how Hunter sought millions for pop in exchange whatever China wanted. Not so. Asking media to give equal time to Biden's real scandal after four years of pushing the bogus Trump once, that's like asking CNN's to cover their legal analysts Zoom habits. The media is happy to chase a woman nodding to Trump in a town hall, but not any story that exposes their journalistic shortcomings. So outraged over 2016, they put America through hell, unleashing a non-stop parade of unsubstantiated direct (ph), starting with the Steele dossier and culminating and diverting resources with their sham impeachment as COVID spread. Their obsession cost lives. And now, they refuse to cover this one story about how the Biden's put our nation's interests up for sale. How dare you waste our time? We have to track down a cop who wore a MAGA hat, a sorority girl critical of BLM on Instagram. That's the real story. But the scandal isn't just what Hunter did for dad and what dad knew. It's also how once gain the media decides what truths to bury. No wonder Americans despise the press. If only Hunter had come out and endorsed Trump, then he would be toast.

I didn't see that, Greg. I can be the one that checks for you. I do think that tomorrow night, regardless of whether media wants to cover it, President Trump is going to cover it. They've signalled that the president is going to bring this up, even if the debate moderator doesn't. And again, I go back to this idea that I find it a little bit strange that the Biden team has not done more to at least answer some of it, even if it was on background. Because one of things that Mike Pence did so effectively in the vice presidential debate is he drew Kamala Harris out on court-packing. Because the Biden/Harris had refused to talk about court-packing so much, that by the time you had 100 million people watching, then he was able to lower the boom on that. So I think that you could see something similar tomorrow night, and then everybody will be covering it."

And Russians were indicted that GRB group or whatever for not only getting involved in the U.S. elections in 16 but the French elections. And that they are the prime actors on the global stage in terms of cyber espionage. But, you know, to me, all of the story is being blown up unnecessarily by a Trump campaign that is drowning. And they are trying to just flail and drag everybody else down with them. So I'm going to say this is a silly story. I am glad that people want to go on and on. But I would like to just point out some facts, Greg. Today, we learned that, in fact, President Trump had a bank account in China and paid more taxes in China than he paid in the United States. I mean, that's a fact. That's what happened today. And today, we learned again that the president, the great deal-maker, can't get Mitch McConnell to agree on a stimulus plan to help the American economy at this juncture.

The emails show that there is influence-peddling from the VP while he was in office, and that there is a kickback scheme arranged by the son from Chinese bankers. I don't feel good about the son of a VP selling access to his dad and his dad using taxpayer money to push policies to get his son rich. The American people don't like that. You know what else, Juan? The president was accused of awful things. He was spied upon. He was investigated. He turned over thousands of documents, had his family, his campaign, and his cabinet testify, do depositions for years, and they found nothing. Yet, they have some evidence on Joe for doing something super shady. Joe says it didn't happen, and then gets censored by the big tech. That's when you know you got him. Because what is the deal now? Anything that hurts Joe Biden before a campaign is Russia disinformation. Was Tara Reid Russian? Were the riots all summer, was that Russian? So now, if you have a story that you run that's bad for Joe, you have to have your copy editors at Twitter check it out. You have to send the Hunter hard drive over to Silicon Valley so they can flush it out. That's not how these things work. Clapper and Brennan who lied about collusion evidence and then they were telling the truth about how there was no evidence of collusion behind closed doors. We're not going to fall for that again.

And, you know, one of the tactics here now is that this mute button. There is two minutes where the candidates will get uninterrupted talk. You know, in the first debate that didn't happen. And maybe that's not a great thing for Joe Biden. Sometimes, he doesn't get to the bell, at least that's what we saw in the Democratic primary, where he says you know what, I am done. We will see.

You could always make that case. But you don't need to know who her parents donated to, to know she is a Democrat. We have been watching her on MSNBC for years. She's clearly a Democrat. That's fine. The president is always dealing with Democrats, whether they're moderators or people leaking about him in his own administration. So that's not the issue. He's going to go after Joe Biden for the pay-for-play with China. And Americans hate corruption. Welker will try to bail Joe out. You can guarantee that. And he's going to stay focused on it. I wouldn't listen to anonymous Republicans giving Donald Trump advice about how to win. Republicans lost two times in a row. I think Donald Trump knows how to win, and I think he should trust his instincts there. I do believe that he should really laser-focus on the economy. He can feast on Joe Biden's economic record. It is atrocious. He paints Biden as the pro- lockdown guy. He has got a fetish with lockdowns for some reason. That makes no sense. And it was, Juan, supposed to be about foreign policy. But the president's foreign policy has been so good. It's not even a topic. Joe doesn't even bring it up on the campaign trail with the little circles of people around him watching because it has been pretty good. So we'll what happens. It is a crucial debate, though. I mean, this race has tightened in the battlegrounds. It's neck and neck. And I think the president just has to be disciplined, focused, and treat Joe like he treated Hillary at that second debate in 2016. Just be really fact-based and methodical, and he will do well."

So a great question that Kristen Welker could ask Joe or President Trump could ask Joe. Let's say you lose. What would say to the angry, upset population that are going out on the streets to reduce the chances of chaos and unrest and looting and arson and all of the things that we have experienced before? Because if Biden loses, he told us there is going to be more violence. So somebody has to got ask him.

And remember how high the gas prizes were under Obama and Joe Biden. I mean, he lied about, like, if you liked your healthcare can you keep it. I don't trust when he says he's not going to raise taxes for people making under 400K. What's he going to do with the money anyway? What's he going to spend it on, infrastructure? Whatever happened to the stimulus? Where did that money go, Joe? I mean, Nancy's been wanted to do infrastructure, I thought, for four years. But she can't do the deal with Donald Trump. What's she going to spend it on, healthcare? I mean, they already raised taxes with Barack Obama and healthcare premiums went up. Is he going to send the money to what, his donors so they can build some solar panels? No, we tried that already. Everywhere Joe Biden goes, the middle class gets hosed and the rich donors make out great. Look at Delaware. They lost all of their shipping jobs, their factories. Credit cards and the banks, they're doing great. I mean, look at the factories that we lost, the manufacturing jobs that were lost under the last eight years when Joe was in the VP office.

And he's got the senators all bollixed up and say it is a problem for America that they can't get this done, but that money was in there. And I do feel sorry for the Wall Street Journal editorial board because it must get very tiring to have to write Economics 101 every election cycle. I mean, this is pretty obvious. And I think that President Trump tomorrow night could say, look, Joe Biden wants to raise your taxes in the middle of a pandemic in a recession. I want to be able to provide you the freedom to get back to work safely, to provide for your families, and I am not going to raise your taxes or go back to a regulatory state because I want to get us back to the economy that we had before the pandemic.

This goes back to that theory that when something's broken, the Republicans usually are figuring out how to fix it because it takes -- it takes like logic and reasoning. The Democrats come later and then they break it again, and then the Republicans have to come in and fix it. Right now, the economy was broken by a novel virus. And the idea that taxing -- taxation is the answer is only because that's the answer the Democrats have with every problem. Its taxation, taxing the rich, especially because that's the easiest thing to say, and then the media will never ask those questions because they agree with the Democrats, which is why Trump has to bring it up in the debate, because Kristen Welker is not going to ask a critical question about taxes."

No, they're sending him to Philadelphia, because if you look at the early votes that have been returned, the ballots, the model show Blacks in Pennsylvania, only 10 percent requested ballots. That's not going to cut it. And remember the DNC speech, Barack Obama pleading with Democrats, request your ballots, request your ballots, you got a vote, vote, vote. Well, they didn't listen, because they didn't request and they're not turning them back. So, that's not good. And every time Barack Obama is not on the ticket, Democrats get shellacked. That's just history. But, you know, he will juice the base in Philly. I don't think it's going to do anything. They don't have a great ground game to turn these people out on Election Day. Biden has never delivered there. It's a COVID-19 situation. You're not going to be busing a lot of people around like you usually do. So, I just don't see it happening, and another four years of Donald Trump just takes a wrecking ball to the legacy of Barack Obama. It's already about 80 percent gone. And then you know what a second term of Donald Trump does, Juan? You finally get to the bottom of Obama gate."

But you know what, I can't -- I can't believe Barack Obama is enjoying this trip, right. And I imagine him coming to Philly for leaving Hawaii because Biden is in trouble. He looks like he's having as much fun as me in like an unconscious bias training session at H.R. He's just like this is -- he wishes that they had a candidate who had it in the bag and he wouldn't have to do this. So, I think he's just, you know, he's taken one for the team."

You know, I mean, he campaigned hard for the Florida gubernatorial candidates, for Bill Nelson for Senate down in Florida. He campaigned for Georgia governor Stacey Abrams and put his weight behind that. And he's late in the game, frankly, for Joe Biden. He's done some fundraising, but he's, it's kind of late. But he is, I agree with Juan, a star in the Democratic Party, and seen as such. But I also agree with Jesse. You're not going to Philadelphia unless you trying to play defense there or trying to get Pennsylvania over the edge and it's close there."

And it depends on which side of the paper you're more focused on. Some people are focused on the policy stuff. And for those people, they don't care about all that other."

But you will have to admit, it's not just Trump's personality that's caused a lot of the turbulence in the last four years. This constant clash with the media, with the Democrats, it's just -- it's warfare, open warfare 24/7 that does create a less than boring atmosphere."

I mean, the fact is that so many Americans want us to get back to normal, want to get away from the dismissive rhetoric that comes from this president and the Twitter tirades. So, they just want somebody who they can have faith and trust and think is a role model for their kids rather than someone they have to explain away to their children."

This exhaustion that people are complaining about are over tweets. Well, God help you. Turn off the damn Twitter machine then if you're so exhausted by Donald Trump. Oh, you poor little baby. You know there is going to be a shift. It's going to be a shift from bad words to bad deeds. Because the one thing we don't know about Joe is what he's going to do in the face of like the woke, the woke crowd, who want to drag America away from its capitalist origins into some kind of strange abyss in which we're all faced in this ongoing witch trial of oppression. What are we guilty of? And that's going to be the way the country is going to be under Joe, because he has no spine at all. Worry about the deeds. Don't worry about the words."

I think that there's something that people -- just keep -- bear with me, people, for a second, those watching. I understand that you're frustrated that it feels like the things are so divided, and you're looking for a role model. But I also honestly believe this, that if you are looking for a role model for your family, that you have to set the best personal example. Nobody else can do that for you. Like I think there are better ways to think about bringing people together than worrying about what's happening at the White House, on Twitter, etcetera, that a lot of this really comes back to how can you be the best possible role model for yourself, for your family, for your employees, for your neighborhood, for your community because that's really how America became great in the first place."
