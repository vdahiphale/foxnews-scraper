It's 5:00 in New York City and this is \"The Five.\" Get ready for masks to make a comeback even if you're vaccinated. Liberal cities are beginning to mandate them again as COVID cases from the delta variant surge across the country. And a new report says the White House is weighing whether it should shift guidance.  Aides reportedly talking to the CDC and one idea being considered is asking all Americans to wear masks when vaccinated and unvaccinated people are together indoors or at public places. Regardless of whether you have the shot, the White House pressed about it earlier today.",

And masks are not going to flatten the curve. They never did. It was the vaccines that did it. So you can't ask vaccinated Americans to wear a mask, it destroys vaccine confidence and it actually punishes you for getting the shot, for doing the right thing.  And they already destroyed vaccine confidence when they screwed up the J&J stuff and that what sent those vaccination rates way down. If Biden wants to destroy the recovery and ruin my summer and everybody else's summer, he will bring back the mandates and he will try to out Fauci to sell it and the CDC woman who's been wrong every single time.

Everything is an honor system based on trusting the individual. So I'm sorry, that's the way it's going to go. You know, the government should not invoke a mask mandate because Americans will follow laws, but they won't follow orders. And this sounds like an order and you can't take an order from a politician because they're liars and they're thieves, especially Pelosi.  I had a really good thing I wanted to say. Oh, this is the Gutfeld rule, the first person to violate an order is always the one who gave it, right?   That should be in Bartlett's quotations and if it's not, Bartlett is a comey pinko (ph). But we can't have our freedoms with strings attached. Another good quotation, I think. But the thing is, you can't promise an incentive for a very invasive action like a vaccine. It's like when you're a kid, the doctor always said, get this shot, you get a lollipop. The mask, having the masks removed was the  2021 version of the lollipop.

She said we need to follow the science here, Texas needs to change course and allow for universal mask wearing to prevent the spread of highly contagious delta variant especially as children under 12 cannot get vaccinated.

And that's what vaccinations do.   They keep you out of a severe case of COVID. They keep you out of the hospital. They keep you off a ventilator. And because we are over testing at this level, including six of those 12 Democrats, so everyone on that plane was vaccinated. Half of them ended up getting a milder asymptomatic case of COVID that we know about because we are testing so many people who are getting normal seasonal allergy stuff, flu things.  We also spent a year in a mask, so now we're being exposed to all these microbes that we were protected from for the last 12 months and everyone now has a cold. There's a big \"New York Times\" piece about why is the summer cold so bad this year. Because we wore a mask for a year, that does not mean you have COVID. Everyone who is dying, 99.7 percent, they're unvaccinated. We don't want to take away the incentive to get the vaccine by making everyone put the mask back on, but we do need to figure out a better strategy to get the hesitant people who are hanging on to that to get their shot.",

There are problems with the vaccination side effect data. It goes on and on and on. So, I don't know how they can make a call about this, quite frankly, at this point. Jessica also read the Marty Makary co-authored op-ed in the \"Wall Street\" - - in the \"Washington Post\" about we're over testing.

The White House always makes is motivated by political gain but even looking at mask mandates through blue colored -- deep blue colored glasses, this is stunningly stupid.

That's why they stopped it. It took him like a year to stop saying it. And also, he doesn't get any push back from the (inaudible) media. You saw Don Lemon just, you know, nodding along like he's listening to Josh Groban. Joe's like an undisciplined kid. He can -- he break things and throw tantrums but the dotting parents are the media and they're, oh, he's so adorable when he lies. Isn't that cute? Maybe he really believes that. No one will ever call him on it so the bigger problem here is I think that the Dems have turned a basic need into a political football and the people playing with that football are immune to the consequences of their action. They are behind gated communities, we say that over and over again, but there's a weird let them eat cake thing here, especially among the national news media.  It's not happening exactly outside their door so they don't really care. I think the solution will not come from Republicans because no one's going to listen to them. No one is going to listen to Fox. They're going to people like Jessica or Harold Ford. Moderate Democrats have to expunge the elite activist class who are deliberately subverting our nation by unraveling the basic tenants of justice.

And she -- I guess they're ignoring that. And they're also -- there's a bigger lie that's going on here. And, by the way, Joe Biden, and I say this over and over and over again. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris both proposed getting rid of cash bail. That is the revolving door that has caused a spike in crime here in New York and in other places. But they're all part of this liberal ecosystem, from the lunatics in Washington to the left wing -- the governors, the mayors, the city council, the district attorneys who have implemented these policies that pamper the perpetrators. Gavin Newsom said something yesterday and I want to push back on it. I forgot to yesterday. He said the evidence doesn't back it up. Over the last three decades, we've actually seen a significant decline in crime in his state and they say it about other places. You know why? Because there were policies in place that you have ripped up. He's talking about three decades where it was conservative policies that cracked down on crime. That put people in jail. And I just wanted to point out just like here in New York, in California, the violent crime rate was up last year, the rape rate fell but aggravated assault increased.

But you don't have to be part of the literal defunding monetarily of the police to defund the police. I mean, Democrats across the board have adopted the BLM message, the Black Lives Matter Movement. They didn't speak out last summer when cities were burning and they were causing $2 billion worth of damage which of course demoralized the police. They basically painted every single police officer in the country with this racism argument that if you're a white police officer, you're out to get black men every single time you wake up and put on your badge and go out on the street. That's demoralizing, which is why you're seeing these mass retirements, nobody signing up to do the job. And also, you know, it's amazing how Democrats have embraced BLM which is proven itself to not be a movement interested in black lives or else they would speak out, again, on all these crime that's happening in black neighborhoods, but really about enriching themselves and taking the country into more of a Marxist style of economy rather than the capitalist society we have now. And so, you don't have to say I support defund or dismantle like AOC or Ilhan Omar to be part of that movement.

He said spending $6 trillion will not increase inflation, it will decrease inflation. And then he cited Moody's. Now, never listen to Moody's. You know this. Moody's is a left-wing operation. Mark Zandi is a left-wing guy, donates to the Clintons, donates to all Democrats.

And then when it's done, you take them and put them in the dryer. And if you're really a pro, you take the fabric softener, and you push that in. How is that 17 percent of us don't know how to do that?",

It's 5:00 in New York City and this is \"The Five.\" Get ready for masks to make a comeback even if you're vaccinated. Liberal cities are beginning to mandate them again as COVID cases from the delta variant surge across the country. And a new report says the White House is weighing whether it should shift guidance. Aides reportedly talking to the CDC and one idea being considered is asking all Americans to wear masks when vaccinated and unvaccinated people are together indoors or at public places. Regardless of whether you have the shot, the White House pressed about it earlier today."

I just want to know where we stand. And the country does not know where Joe Biden stands on vaccines, on masks, and on delta. I was getting my hair cut the other day. When it was finished, the barber says, by the way, you know, you're in the media, you know things. I said you'd be surprised. And I said what, what was the question? And he said, what is the deal with delta and are they going to shut my barber shop down again here in New York?"

We were at record low in cases and then there was a small rise in cases, and they're calling it this huge spike. It's not. Deaths are at an all-time low. Repeat. All-time low. And masks are not going to flatten the curve. They never did. It was the vaccines that did it. So you can't ask vaccinated Americans to wear a mask, it destroys vaccine confidence and it actually punishes you for getting the shot, for doing the right thing. And they already destroyed vaccine confidence when they screwed up the J&J stuff and that what sent those vaccination rates way down. If Biden wants to destroy the recovery and ruin my summer and everybody else's summer, he will bring back the mandates and he will try to out Fauci to sell it and the CDC woman who's been wrong every single time. And it's just going to make everybody angry. And you can't do that while at the same time letting hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants pour in who haven't been vaccinated and shipping them to swing states. You cannot have both."
    },

      "speaker": "PAVLICH",

That's where I see this argument going."

What do you think -- what do you think -- you know, what do you think we do every day? The honor say we don't commit crimes, we cooperate with each other, we tell the truth, we try to do our best. Everything is an honor system based on trusting the individual. So I'm sorry, that's the way it's going to go. You know, the government should not invoke a mask mandate because Americans will follow laws, but they won't follow orders. And this sounds like an order and you can't take an order from a politician because they're liars and they're thieves, especially Pelosi. I had a really good thing I wanted to say. Oh, this is the Gutfeld rule, the first person to violate an order is always the one who gave it, right? That should be in Bartlett's quotations and if it's not, Bartlett is a comey pinko (ph). But we can't have our freedoms with strings attached. Another good quotation, I think. But the thing is, you can't promise an incentive for a very invasive action like a vaccine. It's like when you're a kid, the doctor always said, get this shot, you get a lollipop. The mask, having the masks removed was the 2021 version of the lollipop. We were promised a lollipop and now they're saying we're not going to give you a lollipop. Those are fighting words."

That seems like common sense. That's the honor system. Three, everyone by next year, lose 15 pounds.

She sent out a tweet saying that she thinks that everybody should be masked. She said we need to follow the science here, Texas needs to change course and allow for universal mask wearing to prevent the spread of highly contagious delta variant especially as children under 12 cannot get vaccinated. So, here she is coming to D.C. The Texas Democrats are spreading COVID all over the city and now she wants everybody else to be masked."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TARLOV",
      "utterance": "So, I think we need a language shift from getting COVID to getting severe COVID or getting hospitalized because that's really from the get go what we've all been trying to avoid. And that's what vaccinations do. They keep you out of a severe case of COVID. They keep you out of the hospital. They keep you off a ventilator. And because we are over testing at this level, including six of those 12 Democrats, so everyone on that plane was vaccinated. Half of them ended up getting a milder asymptomatic case of COVID that we know about because we are testing so many people who are getting normal seasonal allergy stuff, flu things. We also spent a year in a mask, so now we're being exposed to all these microbes that we were protected from for the last 12 months and everyone now has a cold. There's a big \"New York Times\" piece about why is the summer cold so bad this year. Because we wore a mask for a year, that does not mean you have COVID. Everyone who is dying, 99.7 percent, they're unvaccinated. We don't want to take away the incentive to get the vaccine by making everyone put the mask back on, but we do need to figure out a better strategy to get the hesitant people who are hanging on to that to get their shot."

They make no -- they don't distinguish between actually COVID causing the death or the child having COVID and dying from something else. There are problems with the adolescent hospitalization data. There are problems with the vaccination side effect data. It goes on and on and on. So, I don't know how they can make a call about this, quite frankly, at this point. Jessica also read the Marty Makary co-authored op-ed in the \"Wall Street\" - - in the \"Washington Post\" about we're over testing. But I want to speak for, allow me to speak for on behalf of maybe all vaccinated Americans, people who had COVID and have antibodies, about forcing us to wear masks. Bite me. It's not going to happen. Mask off. The White House always makes is motivated by political gain but even looking at mask mandates through blue colored -- deep blue colored glasses, this is stunningly stupid. You know, all the liberals last year who were the mask police, who were front -- yelling, streaking at people about getting masked up. They went in all their superiority and got vaccinated as well, and they're really happy not wearing a mask. You can breathe. You don't have chin acne. You don't have rosacea or styes on your eyes.

That's why they stopped it. It took him like a year to stop saying it. And also, he doesn't get any push back from the (inaudible) media. You saw Don Lemon just, you know, nodding along like he's listening to Josh Groban. Joe's like an undisciplined kid. He can -- he break things and throw tantrums but the dotting parents are the media and they're, oh, he's so adorable when he lies. Isn't that cute? Maybe he really believes that. No one will ever call him on it so the bigger problem here is I think that the Dems have turned a basic need into a political football and the people playing with that football are immune to the consequences of their action. They are behind gated communities, we say that over and over again, but there's a weird let them eat cake thing here, especially among the national news media. It's not happening exactly outside their door so they don't really care. I think the solution will not come from Republicans because no one's going to listen to them. No one is going to listen to Fox. They're going to people like Jessica or Harold Ford. Moderate Democrats have to expunge the elite activist class who are deliberately subverting our nation by unraveling the basic tenants of justice.

And she -- I guess they're ignoring that. And they're also -- there's a bigger lie that's going on here. And, by the way, Joe Biden, and I say this over and over and over again. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris both proposed getting rid of cash bail. That is the revolving door that has caused a spike in crime here in New York and in other places. But they're all part of this liberal ecosystem, from the lunatics in Washington to the left wing -- the governors, the mayors, the city council, the district attorneys who have implemented these policies that pamper the perpetrators. Gavin Newsom said something yesterday and I want to push back on it. I forgot to yesterday. He said the evidence doesn't back it up. Over the last three decades, we've actually seen a significant decline in crime in his state and they say it about other places. You know why? Because there were policies in place that you have ripped up. He's talking about three decades where it was conservative policies that cracked down on crime. That put people in jail. And I just wanted to point out just like here in New York, in California, the violent crime rate was up last year, the rape rate fell but aggravated assault increased.

So, if you don't arrest anybody or if you don't prosecute anybody it's not in the record and you can say, hey, look, the statistics are less than last year so therefore crime is going down. But you don't have to be part of the literal defunding monetarily of the police to defund the police. I mean, Democrats across the board have adopted the BLM message, the Black Lives Matter Movement. They didn't speak out last summer when cities were burning and they were causing $2 billion worth of damage which of course demoralized the police. They basically painted every single police officer in the country with this racism argument that if you're a white police officer, you're out to get black men every single time you wake up and put on your badge and go out on the street. That's demoralizing, which is why you're seeing these mass retirements, nobody signing up to do the job. And also, you know, it's amazing how Democrats have embraced BLM which is proven itself to not be a movement interested in black lives or else they would speak out, again, on all these crime that's happening in black neighborhoods, but really about enriching themselves and taking the country into more of a Marxist style of economy rather than the capitalist society we have now. And so, you don't have to say I support defund or dismantle like AOC or Ilhan Omar to be part of that movement. Democrats thoroughly embrace the movement, emboldening criminals and demoralize police officers across the country."

He said spending $6 trillion will not increase inflation, it will decrease inflation. And then he cited Moody's. Now, never listen to Moody's. You know this. Moody's is a left-wing operation. Mark Zandi is a left-wing guy, donates to the Clintons, donates to all Democrats. He predicted that Trump was going to sink the economy into a recession in 2018 and destroy three and a half million jobs, and predicted Barack Obama's recovery was going to be the hottest on record. So, never listen to a Democrat when they cite Moody's."

And when you look at the way that the Biden administration is importing millions of people, a.k.a. cheap foreign labor, which obviously suppresses the wages of American workers at a time when people should be going back to work. And then you had today Jen Psaki saying that it's a workers market. Well, why is it a workers market? You would think that after a pandemic, when a lot of people lost their jobs, you will be clamoring to get back to work to get back into the labor force. Instead, they're competing with the federal government who is paying people with hard-earned taxpayer dollars not to go back to work. And then they have the nerve to say, you need to pay $15.00 an hour, no matter which city you live in, no matter what economic situation your town may be in.

So, that's a -- that's a difference. It's like it didn't -- it had no impact on the game, but on the fans, it's like all the sanctimony, it's -- all this virtue signaling, it's worn off. I don't see them as American athletes anymore. I see them as a media -- self-important media creations. It's great for Rapinoe. I don't know if it's great for the sport or it's great for other players, but the self- righteousness of the woke athlete comes off as the opposite of the athlete persona. The athlete was always a hard-working, strong, silent, determined type. And now we have this kind of whiny, attention-seeking, I don't know, creature.

You're not going to see people from China or people from Iran, if they're in the Olympics. I don't have the whole list of tyrannical regimes that have athletes competing, but you're not going to see those people kneeling on the field because they'll be killed as a result. And it's -- you know, there are 69 countries in the world that criminalize homosexuality, many of them with the consequences of death.

So, this is not a new thing. I take Katie's point about the athletes who are predominantly doing this. But it is when we talk about all the time about what a special place we live and what a great community we're part of with these Western democracies, why is it this a good thing that we can also see us coming together especially at the Olympics, and everybody taking a need to say the world is not equal.

And this country is thirsty for patriotism. Conservatives will always be patriotic no matter who's president. Now, that Biden's president, Democrats feel patriotic again. So, let's unite. Let's win some golds. Because when I look at these women, I agree again with Greg, I hate to say that, it makes it harder for us to root for them. A lot of people, millions of Americans don't like to see that because they don't think oh, police brutality. They think, what a selfish athlete who maybe I won't clap for anymore.
