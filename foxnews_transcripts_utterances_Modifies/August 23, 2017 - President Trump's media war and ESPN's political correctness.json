Now, by now we know Trump's spiel: The media makes a big deal out of nothing. It craps a redwood from an acorn. But just before his rally, ESPN proved him right. They fooled a reporter from the UVA game because his name was Robert Lee. Yes. It sounded too close to Sara Lee and their pound cake goes straight your hips. Actually, they were worried his name might cause teasing because of the fuss over statues. How sad: Protecting a grown man from jokes. Is ESPN still a sports network? What is the sport, patty cake? Talk about hysteria. And it supports Trump's media analysis: When you react preemptively over a cowardly fear of something that doesn't exist, you are broken.   And the media thinks Trump is unstable? ESPN is trapped in a mirage were all things are viewed irrationally because the poor saps are held hostage to fear. Note: They are not literally held hostage, just a figure of speech. So, what's next, ESPN? Ban words like monumental or statuesque? What about players name Jefferson or Davis? But really, the story is a healthy sign: Once exposed, everyone did laugh at it. But it leads me to one question: Does ESPN still cover sports or just their asses?",

They fooled a reporter from the UVA game because his name was Robert Lee. Yes. It sounded too close to Sara Lee and their pound cake goes straight your hips. Actually, they were worried his name might cause teasing because of the fuss over statues. How sad: Protecting a grown man from jokes. Is ESPN still a sports network? What is the sport, patty cake? Talk about hysteria. And it supports Trump's media analysis: When you react preemptively over a cowardly fear of something that doesn't exist, you are broken. And the media thinks Trump is unstable? ESPN is trapped in a mirage were all things are viewed irrationally because the poor saps are held hostage to fear. Note: They are not literally held hostage, just a figure of speech. So, what's next, ESPN? Ban words like monumental or statuesque? What about players name Jefferson or Davis? But really, the story is a healthy sign: Once exposed, everyone did laugh at it. But it leads me to one question: Does ESPN still cover sports or just their asses?"

Under President Obama, I ran into people every day who thought America was heading to ruin under President Obama. Donald Trump was one of them. Now, Trump's in charge, there's another group that believes the world is going to end. The difference here is, they are in the media. They are looking for something that doesn't exist. They expect Donald Trump to stand up there and sue them. That's like expecting a qualifier to, you know, recite Shakespeare. It ain't going to happen. He's not your guy.

And that's what they are there to do. And she is absolutely free to express her opinion as is everybody else. But there could be a reaction to that, right? So, people think that they have gone way too far. I think that -- I just don't know if there is actually anything new. I did see something to Greg's point -- Katie Couric tweeted that she had watched the speech and then she said she reread the transcript this morning. She was more afraid for our country than ever. And I do think that that kind of over embellishment of the worries of the country are too much. But I also think that the attacks were, they went too far and I would have used the time much more effectively. Because that base is going to love him no matter what he says.

And as gentlemen do, they walked away from it and know they have to work together. They have a business relationship. That is probably a good thing. I took the President's comments last night about shutting down the government like he when he said fire and fury when he talked about North Korea. This is something - this is what he is saying. Look at the border yesterday. I think it's going to inch towards -- which he satisfied with the funding that Speaker Ryan has already put in. The house has already voted on twice.

One more thing, $1.6 billion going to the program is going nowhere? The senate doesn't even want to look at it, because they don't want to put a lot of these Republicans in the Border States don't want to vote for it. Obviously no Democrat will.

The football teams have the right not to hire him because it's like -- you don't want to alienate the people. But also for Foreman, it's a generational thing. He is looking at these young pups going they don't know how lucky they have it and how hard -- Colin Kaepernick, adopted by two loving parents who gave him every opportunity to succeed. They were white parents. He got the best of everything. I think George Foreman is going \"I wish I had that.\""

I stand by the NFL owners and teams that say they don't want him, they don't want him. No offense, I don't want him there before he took a knee."

They were going to protect them from the mob and now you have all these people out there trying to protect Colin Kaepernick and try to get him to have a job. Basically, whatever happened to personal responsibility? Is Robert Lee as a sportscaster, is he going to take some hits on social media and let it go? He wanted to do the job."
