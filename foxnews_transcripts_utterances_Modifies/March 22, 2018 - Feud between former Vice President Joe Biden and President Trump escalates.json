      "sentences": "That's convenient: a challenge that needs a time machine. I'd kick your butt, if I were in high school. Of course, Trump hits back saying Joe would go down fast, crying. Now, Biden was speaking at a college rally against sexual assault. His message: To urge responsibility for both men and women. But no one cares now because we've got a fight on our hand. Welcome to high school where the big men on campus taunt each other and everyone gathers around to watch. Mind you, the combined age of the combatants is like 150 years. If there's going to be a tussle, you're going to need pallet of Fixodent.  But it's so juvenile. And if I recall, it's always the people who boast of their physical prowess who are the least harmful. I'm pretty sure the last fight Biden was in was over a window seat in first class. Anyway, it was only a week ago that Dems were fretting over whether they had a fighter among them to match Trump. Jolting Joe headed the call. The problem is it's the least appealing part of Trump's behavior that his lifting and it's so fake. Plus, there's a lot of other good stuff you could steal from Trump: the fun rallies, support for law and order, the strong stance against terror. But to focus on the one thing that most people, including Trump supporters, only really tolerate because of the other good stuff Trump possesses, that's a miscalculation. And it's one Republicans love to see because most people are really bad at being Trump -- except Trump.  All right, Jesse. So what did you make of Joe Biden's tough talk. You think it's authentic or weird?",

I mean, the guy was not a consequential V.P. compared to a Cheney or to a Bush 41. And can you imagine, speaking of Cheney, if Cheney had said he was going to take Obama out on the schoolyard and beat him up? I mean, it would be all over the place.

And if you go to finding 44 which is on the website, the allegation is that the director of national intelligence, James Clapper, this is a person who oversees all the intelligence agencies and whose primary responsibility is the protection of classified information. They say the following, that he, quote, provided inconsistent testimony about contacts with the media, including CNN. And, of course, he's now a CNN contributor. And based on our reporting, the line of questioning by the committee focused on that Trump Tower briefing in January of 2017, which is when the president was told for the first time about the unverified Trump dossier. As you remember, that briefing was leaked to the media. And that's how we have the dossier story got into the mainstream. The efforts of Fusion GPS in the fall of 2016 to do that, really, had not been successful. But the leaking of the briefing at Trump Tower really accomplished that, Jesse.",

And by the way, I mean, this was a rally that was supposed to be about sexual assault on women. And you have Joe Biden out there and he's saying things like, you know, if I had been -- I've been in locker rooms my whole life. I'm a pretty good athlete. The guy that talked that way was usually the fattest, ugliest SOB in the room. I mean, if this how you talk at -- it was supposed to be about sexual assault on women and he goes way off on this tangent. And by the way, you know, his attitude about the whole -- not everything going on in the Me Too Movement, I don't think is any more welcome by millennials. And he's also stuck in the dark ages, and the idea that so many women look at all this as perpetuating this idea of women as victims? And he's talking about men. You've got to stand up and stop other men from assaulting women. And women, you've got, you know, go out and get your friends and take them back home.

And if you go to finding 44 which is on the website, the allegation is that the director of national intelligence, James Clapper, this is a person who oversees all the intelligence agencies and whose primary responsibility is the protection of classified information. They say the following, that he, quote, provided inconsistent testimony about contacts with the media, including CNN. And, of course, he's now a CNN contributor. And based on our reporting, the line of questioning by the committee focused on that Trump Tower briefing in January of 2017, which is when the president was told for the first time about the unverified Trump dossier. As you remember, that briefing was leaked to the media. And that's how we have the dossier story got into the mainstream. The efforts of Fusion GPS in the fall of 2016 to do that, really, had not been successful. But the leaking of the briefing at Trump Tower really accomplished that, Jesse."

It's a very important position, obviously, with the coordination between all the agencies, getting all the information from all of them and he has it. This is the guy who had it. So the suggestion here is we need to get more recording on this, because right now they're going through it and declassifying it to find out what else is in there. Is this a suggestion of impropriety, because he then signed later with CNN. This information came out after a meeting.

Some of these other places are saying, \"Wait a second. Leave us out of it. Don't put your mess onto us. We want to follow the law. We want to get the federal funding and money to help with this,\" because it's incredibly expensive endeavor to try to do all this and process, you know, people who are committing crimes, et cetera, and immigration issues and all the above.

I just don't understand, Juan, why you can't keep the illegal alien workers but just get out the illegal alien criminals. What's so hard about that? That is a reasonable compromise that I think most Americans want. We can have sympathy and understanding for people to come here to work, and we can figure out their citizenship later. But at the time, if you're going to commit a crime, you're going to get sent back and you're going to get reported to ICE, and they're going to lock you up in order to keep the community safe. Do you want thousands of Kate Steinles in California? I mean, ICE agents are there to protect people. They're there to protect Kate Steinle, and they're also there to protect Hispanics and illegal immigrants. I mean, a lot of illegal alien criminals prey on illegal immigrants. They don't want them there either. So it makes sense, in order to get these people out of there. California is just destroying itself."

I also think it's interesting when you see mayors in local municipalities saying -- bragging about the fact that they refused to cooperate with the feds. I didn't think you could do that. I mean, I remember learning in civics about the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution. And the fact that the feds are in charge. I mean, it's -- sure, you want to limit their powers, but when they're out there and they have a law, like something as simple as immigration and they're saying, \"Look, when you have somebody in custody who we want, because he needs to be deported, or she, and this is somebody who is in custody because they've broken a law, can you pick up a phone and let us know? We'll stop by and pick them up.\" And you have people like our great mayor here in New York City, cutting ads that I've watched in the back of a taxi, where he's bragging that he signed an order that he's specifically not going to cooperate with the feds. I don't know. Living in a city, doesn't make me feel good that my mayor is bragging about the fact that he's not going to cooperate."

And the big hypocrisy is, for a sanctuary city to exist safely, it has to rely on others who don't like sanctuary cities to protect them. So for a sanctuary city not to devolve into crime and chaos, you need to have ICE and other agents nabbing gang members and deporting criminals. Because -- because if you just let them into the sanctuary city, if you said, \"OK, you know, we're with you, we're with you,\" how long would the sanctuary last? It would turn into \"The Road Warrior\" in a matter of months. So your stance, your symbolic stance as a sanctuary city, is a fundamental live, because it is based on other people disagreeing with you and doing the work for you. So we are -- we are a nation of laws, because laws create freedom. If you do not believe that, look at any lawless society, like Somalia. You will have no laws, but you cannot go outside.
