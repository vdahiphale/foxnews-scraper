Reports surface of a big retirement at the FBI and North Korea starts talking tough again. Hello, everyone, I'm Trish Regan in for Maria Bartiromo and this is \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" Tax reform is done and it looks like infrastructure will be the president's next big push. He wants bipartisan support but will Democrats play ball?  I'll talk to former Congressman Jason Chaffetz. Also, there's word that embattled deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe may be gearing up for retirement. What's that mean for the allegations of anti-Trump bias at the bureau? Congressman Peter King will join me. And new saber-rattling from North Korea all of that and more as we look ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\"  Fresh off, President Trump's first major legislative victory, signaling and signing the tax overhaul into law. He's making a bold prediction about his next big initiative on Capitol Hill, infrastructure, saying it will get tremendous bipartisan support. But will the Democrats actually go along? Joining me right now, Jason Chaffetz, former Utah Congressman, former Chairman of the House Oversight Committee and a Fox News Contributor. So good to see you, Merry Christmas.",

The President also wants to build a wall and there are a lot in Congress that want to build a wall. And that's only about $1.8 billion but still -- well, something's got to give because if you're going to spend hundreds of billions of dollars in infrastructure where are you going to get that money? The House and the Senate passed a $47 trillion 10-year budget but there wasn't any cuts to spending, so conservatives actually will be on the hot seat probably more than -- for more than the Democrats.",

Where are you going to cut because there aren't many places that Congress has identified? I think it's the one story coming it of 2017 that really was a mystery to me, was just I couldn't believe that Republicans sort of gave up the mantle of fiscal discipline. I don't think you have to justify allowing the American people to keep their own money in their own wallets.

But that reconciliation tool is gone. Now you have to go and get 60votes.

I mean Democrats used to support the idea that they were going to reduce the corporate income tax. But then suddenly because now it's Donald Trump they were opposed to it.

But if you listen to Mick Mulvaney, the Head of the Office of Management and Budget, he presents to the President almost on a monthly basis, hey, look, this is where the real money is. It's almost three-quarters of the spending of the four-plus trillion dollars that we spent in this government but thus far the President has not wanted to tackle Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security.

He is a very, very close personal friend of the Clintons and a political ally.

But the bubble framework is really not correct to put against bitcoin. When you think of a company, right, and their stock price, if they produce X amount of units one year and the same amount of units the next year and the stock price goes up and the economic doubles and the economic productivity hasn't changed, the cash flows haven't changed of the company, we say that company is overvalued. But bitcoin is not a company. It is a network. And the value of networks is net cash law. It's N squared. So the amount of users on a network is N, and so if I'm the only person in the world who has a phone, then it's not very valuable. I can't call you. But if you buy a phone, you've actually increased the value of my phone inadvertently or not even knowing because now all of a sudden my phone is useful, same thing with the social network.

So if you look at bitcoin today at 300 billion, it looks like -- you know, and it's certainly appreciated quite a bit in the past year. But look, we've been saying this for the past five years when bitcoin was you know, $1 billion market cap, that bitcoin is a better gold. If you look at the properties of gold, they make gold gold like you know, scarcity, fungibility, divisibility, portability, bitcoin equals or surpassed gold across each category. so for example, gold is scarce, bitcoin is actually fixed at 21 million. It's divisible into a hundred million pieces. It's actually kind of hard to cut up bars of gold and they're hard to move. They're not nearly as portable. And part of this I think is a little bit of a generational thing. I hate to say that but if you talk to millennials or kids on the street, they don't want hardware. They want software. They get bitcoin, there's no explanation necessary, they don't talk about wanting to wear bitcoin or you know, why isn't bitcoin shinier?

Reports surface of a big retirement at the FBI and North Korea starts talking tough again. Hello, everyone, I'm Trish Regan in for Maria Bartiromo and this is \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" Tax reform is done and it looks like infrastructure will be the president's next big push. He wants bipartisan support but will Democrats play ball? I'll talk to former Congressman Jason Chaffetz. Also, there's word that embattled deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe may be gearing up for retirement. What's that mean for the allegations of anti-Trump bias at the bureau? Congressman Peter King will join me. And new saber-rattling from North Korea all of that and more as we look ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" Fresh off, President Trump's first major legislative victory, signaling and signing the tax overhaul into law. He's making a bold prediction about his next big initiative on Capitol Hill, infrastructure, saying it will get tremendous bipartisan support. But will the Democrats actually go along? Joining me right now, Jason Chaffetz, former Utah Congressman, former Chairman of the House Oversight Committee and a Fox News Contributor. So good to see you, Merry Christmas."

      "speaker": "REGAN",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHAFFETZ",
      "utterance": "Well if there's one thing that Democrats do it's spending money, so I don't think it will be trouble getting Democrats on board. I think the real worry is actually going to be the conservatives in the House and the Senate because you're also looking at about a $100 billion supplemental that will be used for hurricane relief. The President also wants to build a wall and there are a lot in Congress that want to build a wall. And that's only about $1.8 billion but still -- well, something's got to give because if you're going to spend hundreds of billions of dollars in infrastructure where are you going to get that money? The House and the Senate passed a $47 trillion 10-year budget but there wasn't any cuts to spending, so conservatives actually will be on the hot seat probably more than -- for more than the Democrats."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REGAN",
      "utterance": "Well you know as you pointed out rightly, so Democrats love to spend money, typically, so they should love this. I mean this is something that Chuck Schumer has been asking for, for years. If there's anywhere where these folks can meet in the middle in Washington D.C. Representative, you would think it would be infrastructure."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHAFFETZ",
      "utterance": "Yes, and it's going to come up quickly. January 19 is when the continuing resolution runs out but again, the question is if you're also going to go out and spend like I said close to $100 billion rebuilding Texas , Florida, Louisiana, and other parts that were hit by the hurricane, then how are you going to actually fund this? Where are you going to cut because there aren't many places that Congress has identified? I think it's the one story coming it of 2017 that really was a mystery to me, was just I couldn't believe that Republicans sort of gave up the mantle of fiscal discipline. I don't think you have to justify allowing the American people to keep their own money in their own wallets. But if you don't cut spending, then you're still going to rack up amazing deficits and I don't see how you get from here to there."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REGAN",
      "utterance": "Well some people look at the tax cut as a form of spending. Now the hope is it grows our economy enough and I think it will contribute to growth for sure. The question is how much growth, is it enough growth Representative, to actually make up for what it's going to cost and you know, as you look towards an infrastructure program, what that's going to cost."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHAFFETZ",
      "utterance": "Well look, if you went back to when President Trump was inaugurated and you said we were going to be north of three percent growth rate if you thought the stock market was going to be where it's at, everybody would have laughed. Everybody would have said no, President Trump is not going to be able to get anything done, get anything passed. Now President Trump has had an advantage so far in being able to use the tool of reconciliation where only has to get 50 people in the Senate to actually vote in favor of a tax package. But that reconciliation tool is gone. Now you have to go and get 60votes. And you're right that's where you've got to go find those eight Democrats in order to come along with your overall spending plan and they're going to push on immigration, they're going to push on other things too, not just the -- not just the infrastructure."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REGAN",
      "utterance": "Well Representative, if they do not move forward on immigration, I'm talking about the Democrats right now, isn't that going to haunt them politically come 2018? So if you're approaching this from just a shear political perspective, if you're Donald Trump and if you're the Republicans, don't you want infrastructure to be next? Because I'll tell you, if Democrats vote against that, they're seemingly voting against one of the basic things that they have been arguing for, for years."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHAFFETZ",
      "utterance": "Yes, again, I think they could get them on infrastructure. Where do you find the money? I don't know but it's going to be really difficult for the Democrats. At this point, they've been pretty much a stiff arm and a blockade saying, they're going to be no on anything that Donald Trump suggests. I mean Democrats used to support the idea that they were going to reduce the corporate income tax. But then suddenly because now it's Donald Trump they were opposed to it. So I think infrastructure is good common ground. Republicans haven't been bashful in spending money. Democrats like to spend money. The question is where are you going to get all of that money after spending all the money on the supplemental for hurricane relief?"
    },

      "utterance": "Yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REGAN",
      "utterance": "Entitlement reform, is that it -- I mean, you know when you look at the money we spend for example, on things like Medicaid, or -- these are the opportunities that we could take to start cutting and how much might it save us."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHAFFETZ",
      "utterance": "Well, it will save a lot if you can get rid of the waste fraud abuse but every administration talks about it and doesn't do much about it. I do think more block grants to the states letting the governors and state legislators be in control would be much more efficient and would actually save a lot of money. But if you listen to Mick Mulvaney, the Head of the Office of Management and Budget, he presents to the President almost on a monthly basis, hey, look, this is where the real money is. It's almost three-quarters of the spending of the four-plus trillion dollars that we spent in this government but thus far the President has not wanted to tackle Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security. They did make the progress on ObamaCare getting rid of the individual mandates but yes, that's where the money is."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REGAN",
      "utterance": "This is why once you get something, this is why entitlement reform is so difficult. I mean, once you give it, it's very hard, Representative, to take it back and no politician I would imagine wants to be in that position where they look like they're denying someone something that they had previously gotten. And he has said over and over again that he wouldn't go near Social Security and that Social Security would be safe for folks. So that would be challenging certainly for the President and for the Republicans I imagine if they tried to take some of those things away. Let me ask you this Representative, do you think the Democrats don't actually want the economy to do well?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHAFFETZ",
      "utterance": "You know, allowing the American people to keep their own money in their own pockets, I mean, Nancy Pelosi was calling that Armageddon, Chuck Schumer was just that (INAUDIBLE) the day. I mean, unanimously Democrats said we don't want the American people to keep more of their own money and their own wallets, so I don't know what it is they think they're going to -- they're going to run on. And if you look at where we're going to be six, eight, 12 months from now when we actually have elections, I think the -- I think the Democrats are overplaying their hand because anything and everything that Republicans do is somehow wrong. I don't see them coming to the table with alternatives or tweaks or saying, hey, here's what we would like to suggest to make the bill better. And I think that's you know, reflecting through to the American people."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REGAN",
      "utterance": "And people don't like that right? Americans don't like that. This is why they're so frustrated with Washington because no one was getting anything done. I mean, we saw eight years of that gridlock. That's why the federal reserve had to be so aggressive. There was no economic policy that was meaningful coming out of Washington. Now you're starting to see that and tax reform by most accounts is going to be quite stimulative to our economy, so I just question whether, you know you've got Democrats there who are sort of looking at this rather aggressively wishing that the market wasn't doing this well, wishing that the unemployment numbers were actually worse, wishing that wages would not increase because politically speaking, if there Republicans have a win with this, it makes it very difficult in '18"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHAFFETZ",
      "utterance": "When people are feeling good with their own pocketbooks, they've got a job, they're getting a promotion and you look at some of the indicators about homeownership and the way people are feeling confident in the economy, every one of those indicators under President Trump is going up in a positive direction and that's just the reality. And people vote locally, they vote on how they're feeling, how their company is doing, whether their friends are getting jobs and I'm just telling you, President Trump I think exceeded all expectations in 2017. He's buoyed going into 2018 but January 19, mark that date Trish because funding the government is going to be a battle royal and it's coming up before we know it."

      "utterance": "Yes, I mean, all the indications are that he is and yes, I think he should. There's been so many questions raised. I worked with Andrew McCabe over the years in my position on the Intelligence Committee and Homeland Security Committee but the issues that come up in the last you know, 16 months regarding the Hillary Clinton investigation, regarding the opening of the investigation of the Trump campaign and the, appear to be conflicts of interest that Andrew McCabe has have, to me, it's better for everyone that he does step aside. And again, maybe there's more to it than event at that but at the very least because of these apparent conflicts and contradictions, I think the time has come, yes."

    {
      "speaker": "KING",
      "utterance": "I don't even know if it came to the Ethics Committee. I don't know how or how much was disclosed. And it wasn't just he was getting people close to Hillary Clinton. It was probably very few people in politics closer to the Clinton campaign than Terry McAuliffe. I mean, I've known the Terry McAuliffe for years. He is a very, very close personal friend of the Clintons and a political ally. And the fact that he was steering 500, 700,000 whatever the number was to Andrew McCabe's wife in a hotly contested race in Virginia, to me that's such an apparent conflict on its face. I don't know how he stated it or how he was allowed to stay in it and how that doesn't marginalize him forever. And again the investigation into Hillary Clinton itself was so sensitive, was so vital and to have Andrew McCabe having any role in that at all to me goes against all -- you know, all of the ethical standards we should be having in the FBI and federal government. Let me just emphasize now, I think 99 percent of the people in the FBI outstanding Americans, what we are talking about is what was going on at the top."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REGAN",
      "utterance": "Look, I mean, and this is why people are so frustrated really with Washington because there is this perception, Representative, that there's a lot of cronyism, there's a lot of sort of greasing of palms and you know regardless of what this was, the reality remains that his wife, the woman who is likely the closest person to him in the world is getting a lot of money from Clinton's friends & associates and people that want to see Clinton succeed. And so you know that in and of itself you would think Representative, would be enough for him to say, OK, you know, we get a Chinese wall in my family and I either number one, can't allow my wife to take that money or number two, cannot be running this investigation."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KING",
      "utterance": "Right, that investigation and then right around that same time was the opening of the investigation against the Trump campaign which he also had an involvement. And again, we don't know all of the specifics yet. But if that investigation was premised on that dossier and on Carter Page, if that was the basis to have an unprecedented investigation into a presidential campaign, then that to me raises the most serious constitutional and civil liberties issues because that also would have involved then getting a FISA warrant which was really the most intrusive. I support FISA but that is the most intrusive type of investigation you can have and there has to be such strict standards met for that. And if they were basing it on a dossier which was put together in effect or commissioned by the Clinton campaign and Carter Page who had no real role in the campaign and everything he did was public, to base -- to use that as the basis for this unprecedented investigation and to have Andrew McCabe in any way involved in that raises again serious, serious issues that go beyond really. That to me is more significant than the Clinton investigation."

No member of the media, I mean, other than you know, late to the table BuzzFeed and you can question whether they are really a legitimate member of the media because to me no legitimate media organization would have printed that. But no real media organization went near that. And so what I look at is how is it that journalists knew that that was discredited but somehow our own FBI decided to take the thing as gospel? We don't know."

He's never been Prague on his life. If the FBI couldn't figure that out, then you know, what are they doing? So obviously there's no intent made to even look into the basic allegations in that dossier which would -- to me would have made the whole thing you know, incredible. And the fact that the FBI apparently there's reports they want to continue -- you know, they want to pay Michael Steel whose the person behind it, and then you have all of the relationships between you know, the organization putting the dossier together, people in the Justice Department, all of that. If there's any collusion issue here, to me it's the FBI, it's the Clinton campaign, it's the Russians for that matter because it could be very likely that Russians were feeding Steel information to use against Donald Trump and it was fake information."

Gordon, good to see you. This seems to be escalating once again very quickly. I guess I would ask you to tell us how can we -- how can we effectively deal with North Korea right now without actually having to use force?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GORDON CHANG, AUTHOR, NUCLEAR SHOWDOWN",
      "utterance": "Yes, I think there's a lot of things we can do Trish. So, for instance, President Trump can actually enforce his September 21 executive order which essentially tells the world if you do business with North Korea, you're not doing business with us. And that message has to be given to Beijing and we've got to be serious about it. The other thing is that large Chinese banks have been money laundering for the North Koreas. So far they've gotten a free pass. I don't think that we can allow that to continue. You know, we don't allow Colombian drug lords to launder money through New York City. We should not be allowing the Chinese to do that especially when they've been arming the North Koreas with all sorts of equipment and technology for their ballistic missile program and their nuclear weapons program. This is how we could actually solve this shorter the use of force."

They have the right intelligence there on the ground. They could actually influence this situation far more than we can from our standpoint. So our key then is influencing China. And we've gotten all indications that the President is trying to do that and is trying to work with China on this -- on this issue but what about treasury because you mentioned sanctioning banks? They sanction one Chinese bank, aren't their others they could go after? I mean, couldn't we actually if we really wanted to Gordon, say OK, no more trades with China until they deal with their problem which has become ours in North Korea."

He did that by disconnecting a small Chinese bank from the banking system by declaring it to be a primary money laundering concern under Section 311 at the Patriot Act. But we know that Bank of China, one of China's so- called big four banks has been laundering money for the North Koreans. That was said in a U.N. report from last year which talked about devising and operating a scheme in Singapore. It's clearly --"

      "speaker": "CHANG",
      "utterance": "Yes, and it's not just laundering money. It's not just giving technology to the North Koreans so they could use it against us. Also, you know, just a few days ago, a North Korean ship which was under U.N. sanctions, which means it can't go to any port outside of North Korea, it turned on its transponder in a port near Shanghai.

So what that's going to do is create a truly two-sided market which should reduce volatility in the long term and also increase price discovery and just make it easier for institutions and individuals to gain access and exposure to bitcoin with this contract because it's cash settled. You can buy it with cash and you settle out in cash. So you don't have to actually touch the underlying ordeal with bitcoin but you can get the investment exposure to it so it's just another financial product and easier way to get access."

      "speaker": "CAMERON WINKLEVOSS",
      "utterance": "Absolutely, yes. We've been working really hard to give Jamie Dimon an opportunity to short bitcoin and anybody who says that you know, it's a fraud or bubble. You can go now put your money where your mouth is and bet against it."

      "speaker": "T. WINKLEVOSS",

Now, you can actually, like Cameron said, you could bet against this so we encourage Jamie Dimon, we encourage him to personally bet against this bitcoin, take JP Morgan's balance sheet bet against bitcoin. We'll see what happens, but now they can do it instead of just sort of throwing stones."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "C. WINKLEVOSS",
      "utterance": "So it's a great question. So Bitcoin, we think of bitcoin as gold. And I think if you look at gold, some people point to an intrinsic value of gold but that really doesn't explain the value of gold. It might explain 10-15 percent of the actual value of gold. Gold has value because we all agree that it has value and we'll all accept gold and as a collective acceptance and value that way. Bitcoin in addition to being increasingly accepted around the world and more people coming into the system by the day has the mining network which is one of the largest computer networks in the world and it's backed by cryptography. A lot of people would look at the U.S. dollar or a government-backed currencies and say a government in -- has counterparty risk. The average lifespan of a currency is roughly 27 years. Look no further than the Zimbabwe dollar. They have I think a trillion dollar bill or a Venezuela. The history of most currencies is really terrible and so yes, living in the U.S. we look at the U.S. dollar and we say well what's wrong with that and it's a pretty decent value but in reality, most currencies out there fail."

      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Why not?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "T. WINKLEVOSS",
      "utterance": "Because we are here to talk about the bitcoin futures contract. We may discuss that later at some point."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Look, bitcoin this past weekend, opens with a thousand dollar spike, 1000 contracts trading hands in the first hour and exchange halt happened because of the volatility and the Web site crash, all in less than 24 hours. We know that the currency has risen more than 1,500 percent this year, actually 2,000 percent this year, so let me ask you, maybe Bitcoin is real but is it a bubble?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "T. WINKLEVOSS",
      "utterance": "Yes, it's a great question. People use the word bubble and we -- this is basically bitcoin's 20th bubble that you know, we came in five years ago. Remember when bitcoin was a bubble at $30, bitcoin was a bubble at $100, at 500, a thousand, 5,000, 10,000, now we're at a bubble at 17,000. You know, gold's been a bubble for thousands of years. But the bubble framework is really not correct to put against bitcoin. When you think of a company, right, and their stock price, if they produce X amount of units one year and the same amount of units the next year and the stock price goes up and the economic doubles and the economic productivity hasn't changed, the cash flows haven't changed of the company, we say that company is overvalued. But bitcoin is not a company. It is a network. And the value of networks is net cash law. It's N squared. So the amount of users on a network is N, and so if I'm the only person in the world who has a phone, then it's not very valuable. I can't call you. But if you buy a phone, you've actually increased the value of my phone inadvertently or not even knowing because now all of a sudden my phone is useful, same thing with the social network. If you look at Facebook, the first person at Facebook, lonely place, not much of a deal. All of a sudden a hundred people, you can connect with people, you can share stories, share pictures."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "That's a good analogy."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "T. WINKLEVOSS",
      "utterance": "So, it's classic network effects. A billion people on Facebook, that's a billion squared, right, so that's all of a sudden the value gets exponentially greater and that's how we value bitcoin. Money is a network. People believe in the U.S. dollar. It has more value. People believe in bitcoin, it has value. People believe in gold, it has value and that's not a linear increase. By definition, the more people that get in the bitcoin, it makes it more valuable and when we try and take like equities or stock bubble type frameworks to bitcoin, it's really -- it's misguided because it's a network."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Have you sold any bitcoins so far?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "C. WINKLEVOSS",
      "utterance": "Well we've definitely -- we purchased tickets to space with bitcoin a couple years ago on Virgin Galactic and we clearly overpaid for that. But look, we believe long-term that there's still a long way for bitcoin's value to go from here. We think that it is gold 2.0 and disrupting potentially gold which is a $6 trillion market cap. So if you look at bitcoin today at 300 billion, it looks like -- you know, and it's certainly appreciated quite a bit in the past year. But look, we've been saying this for the past five years when bitcoin was you know, $1 billion market cap, that bitcoin is a better gold. If you look at the properties of gold, they make gold gold like you know, scarcity, fungibility, divisibility, portability, bitcoin equals or surpassed gold across each category. so for example, gold is scarce, bitcoin is actually fixed at 21 million. It's divisible into a hundred million pieces. It's actually kind of hard to cut up bars of gold and they're hard to move. They're not nearly as portable. And part of this I think is a little bit of a generational thing. I hate to say that but if you talk to millennials or kids on the street, they don't want hardware. They want software. They get bitcoin, there's no explanation necessary, they don't talk about wanting to wear bitcoin or you know, why isn't bitcoin shinier? They really -- they want a -- they live in a digital world, they live in a 24/7 world, they're connected all the time, and bitcoin is money built for the internet that moves like information and e-mail and everything else. Gold is just the old world. It had its place, it's had a great 3,000-year run. And Bitcoin, you know has only been here for 10 years but it's really you know, cutting in quite a bit."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "T. WINKLEVOSS",
      "utterance": "Yes, I mean to say like that's obviously right. I mean, taking a break from the real world and going to the online world used to be how things were, now people take a break from the online world and step into the real world for like you know, be right back for like 10 minutes but they're really living most of their lives in a digital world."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "T. WINKLEVOSS",
      "utterance": "I mean, so when we first found bitcoin or first came across it, it sounds like a huge idea. It's kind of crazy and it's not crazy to be very skeptical and say sort of like I think Cameron just said you know, this is either like huge or total (BLEEP). You know, this is back in 2012, but kept learning, kept talking to people about it, kept asking questions, kept getting incredible answers back, and I just couldn't see how this couldn't work or wouldn't work. Maybe that's what makes us like a little bit different in the way we think about things. We're sort of optimist, and we want to dig deeper and we want to believe and look for that thing. We obviously get really passionate about it but you know, again, we really couldn't see how why we wouldn't be sitting here today five years ago, why we wouldn't be sitting here today talking to you having this conversation, so -- you know, that was sort of our thinking the whole time."

The amount of conversation and the amount of undermining of the FBI that's going on, on the basis of these kinds of things from the Peter Strzok text messages to what Andy McCabe's wife was doing in her own private life.

Maybe it's not the best timing hon for you to take the 500 grand. I mean because once again, it doesn't even have to be a conflict of interest. Sometimes it's simply the fashion of a conflict."

He had every opportunity to say no, it wasn't the Steele dossier or here's why the Steele dossier should be believed. And apparently he knows nothing and he wants to share nothing and why this stonewall? And now we're, you know, this has been going on a year and a half.

      "speaker": "TARLOV",
      "utterance": "Well why not? I mean, it's a good deal if it's growing to make life better for Americans across-the-board, why wouldn't we do that?"

      "utterance": "About a new bridge. It's not like saying that --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FREEMAN",
      "utterance": "Well, wait a minute, well, that's the bridge. Well, this is the other interesting thing. What Democrats want is they want to tell union workers we're going to build bridges but also tell environmentalists don't worry we're not going to build stuff so I think a plan that kind of makes them choose would be helpful."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TARLOV",
      "utterance": "-- roads and bridges and airports and our nation's infrastructure. If you tell environmentalists actually we're going to build pipelines all through the middle of the country, that's going to be a problem."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REGAN",
      "utterance": "You know what, if you build and you do it the right way and not the way we saw under the Obama administration, you do have an opportunity to add more stimulus if you would to the economy. So hopefully we get that four, five, six percent GDP growth this year and in 2018. It's so good to see you guys. Merry Christmas!
