But the inspector general found that no actions were taken that were influenced by political opinions. You know, it's against the law for the FBI or any other government agency to inquire as to the political opinions of people you're going to hire, as a head check. So, no, I don't see the necessity for any further investigation.  It is part of a sustained attack by the administration and its allies on the integrity of law enforcement agencies, the FBI, special prosecutor for the last two years to try to undermine the integrity and the credibility of our law enforcement institutions, and that's something that's very damaging to the country. And one of the things that we have to rectify. Let me add, again, regardless of whether the special prosecutor finds crimes, we know certain things. The public knows certain things. We know that the president asked the FBI director to go easy and to stop investigating some of his close associates like Michael Flynn. We know that the president fired the FBI director because he wouldn't give him the personal loyalty he demanded and because as he put it to NBC News, of the Russian thing. We know that a lot of the president's closest associates, his campaign manager, deputy campaign manager, national security advisor have been indicted and convicted of various crimes and we know the sustained attacks on our law enforcement institutions.

There are other investigations going on which he has farmed out to the Southern District of New York, Eastern District of Virginia and they may or may not. We do know, remember, in plain sight of a lot of collusion. We know, for example, that the president's son and his campaign manager were present in the meeting with the Russians to receive information which they were told in the invitation was part of the Russian government's attempt to help them in the election. We know that the campaign manager give targeting data, political targeting data to an agent of the Russian government."

    },

      "utterance": "Mr. Chairman, given how upset Democrats were in 2016 when then- FBI Director James Comey said he was not going to recommend charging Hillary Clinton but then that laid out the case against her, why should Attorney General Barr make the same mistake if he's not going to bring a case against Donald Trump and lay out all the information against him?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "NADLER",
      "utterance": "There's a fundamental difference. The Justice Department believes -- normally, that's a very good rule. If you don't have enough evidence to charge someone with a crime, you shouldn't sully their name. However, the Justice Department believes that as a matter of law, the president, no matter what the evidence, can never be indicted for anything simply because he is the president. If that is the case, then they can't hold him accountable, and the only institution that can hold the president accountable is Congress and Congress therefore needs the evidence and the information. Once you say that a president cannot be held -- cannot be indictable the matter with the evidence as a matter of law, to then follow the principle that you can't then comment on evidence or publicize is to convert that into a cover-up."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "Well, I want to pick up on that. You say if the attorney general does not turn over everything to the special counsel, that's a cover-up, which is a pretty charged phrase. I mean, couldn't it just be that he reads the regulations differently than you do, that it's not a cover-up of a crime? And secondly, I understand they're going to be two differences of opinions here, what are you prepared to do to get all the information you want?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "NADLER",
      "utterance": "Well, again, if the president cannot be indicted because as a matter of law, then the only way a president can be held accountable is for Congress to consider it an act if warranted. And Congress can only do that if it has the information. And for the department to take the position that we are not going to give information because he's not indicted like a normal person is not indicted because of lack of evidence is equivalent to a cover-up and subverts the only ability to hold the president accountable. And the president, more than anybody else, cannot be above the law. As to whether we will use subpoenas, we will if necessary. We, as you know, put out a lot of document requests to people. We are getting a good response on that. Not from the White House, but from a lot of other people. And we'll use subpoenas if and when we think we have to."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "You have made it clear that your committee is going to keep investigating the president regardless of what is in the Mueller report. You just recently sent out a document request 281 people and entities for information. But if the special counsel -- and I understand this is speculative. If the special counsel after two years basically does not find criminal activity - - obviously, you say they're not going to charge them with a crime. If they find no evidence of criminal activity by the president after this long investigation on collusion or obstruction of justice, how do you think the American people will react to House Democrats continuing to investigate the president for the rest of his time in office, the next two years? I understand why it might be good politically."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "NADLER",
      "utterance": "I don't know if it's good politically or not, and I don't know if it will take the next few years. But what I do know is that the job of Congress is much broader than the job of special counsel. The special counsel was looking and can only look for crimes. We have to protect the rule of law. We have to look for abuses of power. We have to look for obstructions of justice. We have to look for corruption in the exercise of power, which may not be crimes. They may be, but they may not be crimes. We have a much broader mandate and we have to exercise that mandate to protect the integrity of government and protect the integrity of liberty and the country."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "As you will know, there are some Republicans who believe the real scandal here is the bias, the misdeeds, overreach by the FBI, by the Justice Department, by the special counsel. Do you have any intention of investigating them, sir?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "NADLER",
      "utterance": "Well, when the Republicans controlled the Judiciary Committee and the Oversight Committee in the last two years, there was an extensive investigation of that. And nothing relevant was found. Yes, it turns out that some FBI agents have political opinions that they didn't like the president. Other FBI agents love the president. But the inspector general found that no actions were taken that were influenced by political opinions. You know, it's against the law for the FBI or any other government agency to inquire as to the political opinions of people you're going to hire, as a head check. So, no, I don't see the necessity for any further investigation. It is part of a sustained attack by the administration and its allies on the integrity of law enforcement agencies, the FBI, special prosecutor for the last two years to try to undermine the integrity and the credibility of our law enforcement institutions, and that's something that's very damaging to the country. And one of the things that we have to rectify. Let me add, again, regardless of whether the special prosecutor finds crimes, we know certain things. The public knows certain things. We know that the president asked the FBI director to go easy and to stop investigating some of his close associates like Michael Flynn. We know that the president fired the FBI director because he wouldn't give him the personal loyalty he demanded and because as he put it to NBC News, of the Russian thing. We know that a lot of the president's closest associates, his campaign manager, deputy campaign manager, national security advisor have been indicted and convicted of various crimes and we know the sustained attacks on our law enforcement institutions.

What we have so far and the indications out of the Department of Justice that there's no more indictments, I'm waiting to see the conclusion that Bill Barr is going to give us hopefully as early as today. As we see those, then we can actually show to the American people what the investigation meant and how far it went, and also the fact that now we can hopefully begin to move on in these to your cloud of an investigation in which a lot was gone into to prove the president. Now, we are saying that the collusion is not, and now, we can move forward."

They have an agenda to try to win 2020. And so, what we're seeing is, is they think that they can go into the Judiciary Committee or any other committee and have a limited budget, limited subpoena power, limited staff and go up against an investigation that lasted 22 months, had unlimited power, unlimited subpoena power, had plenty of investigators and they think they can find something more than what they did, then I think they are sadly mistaken, and I think the American people will see through that."

If Mr. Nadler is saying that our committee is supposed to be a paintbrush that just simply tries to taint the presidency and paint the presidency with doubt and innuendo, then I would disagree with that. That's an abuse of power. That's not something the committee ought to be doing and I think we also have to respect what the Department of Justice and Mr. Mueller has been doing. If we do that, then the American people can see we are respecting the will of law."

Would it include 6(e), which is grand jury information, things that are normally never released to the public outside -- really outside of a special order from the court? Would he want to do the things that, you know, would actually get into ongoing investigations? I think the problem is that the Democrats and my chairman have a problem. They thought that this report was going to show something they can impeach the president on. That is not seemingly going to happen. Now, they have to figure out some way around that and I think when you understand that for him to make a broad statement of what they want released, that's not fair to the American public and we believe they are trying to taint what is coming out by not saying what should not come out to the public, because of what I've just listed."
    },

They say on the one hand, that the Justice Department regulations they don't release information on people they're not going to charge, but also the department regulations say they can't charge the president. So, you know, there is, as I say, this kind of self-contradictory basis there. Isn't it legitimate to argue that even if there is damaging information to the president that does not rise to the level of an indictment, that it should be turned over to Congress to take a look at?"

Let's also understand, clearly, these were findings that have not been made yet. There was been no findings that that was the reason that you couldn't indict a sitting president, the reason why there's no more indictments coming forward. Let's be honest with the facts and say probably with the facts showed was that there was no collusion. Let's go to the logical choice that nothing happened. It was sort of amazing to hear the chairman say things that we do know. Again, basically, when you talk about collusion was happening, meetings were happening, that all of this was going on again to simply sully what they have been called the best investigation around and not to touch the Mueller investigation. When it comes back not what they want, now they've decided that they can just try to go around it and draw implications so that others can doubt it. That's just wrong."

But let's look at what the Mueller investigation has found. His team indicted, convicted or got guilty pleas from 34 people and three companies. His former national security advisor pleaded guilty. So did his former fixer. His former campaign chairman was convicted and a long-time advisor, Roger Stone, faces charges of lying to Congress. Congressman Collins, I agree that there has been no action and apparently will be no action taken against the president by the Justice Department, but would you agree that this was no hoax?"

What we see here, though, is an investigation which people who lied were held accountable, people who were investigated are now being held under the rule of law. At what point does that not make the investigation any less valid in the sense that they did what they saw on others, but also found that in their main core of the collusion or investigation or obstruction, they are seemingly coming to the point that the president and those around him had nothing to do with this? The other charges, except for those indicted with the Russians, which will probably never see in court in the United States, that is the core finding, at least if what we're seeing so far. Remember, that report and those findings are still coming out and we'll see. But at this point, the president has been proved right. I think he was obviously frustrated during this time and rightfully so, as this report seems to show."

When you have people lie to the investigators, when you have people lie to the FBI, Department of Justice, then there's going to be consequences to pay for that. To go into the reasons why they chose to lie is simply something that you'd need to ask all three of them. We still need the larger picture, which the Democrats want to just paint the president with, with these others, is the simple fact that at the end of the day, if this report comes back, as it seems to be coming back, that there was no collusion on the president or the part of the campaign, then that is the part that we need to take and move from here.

We're going to concentrate on the fact that deregulation works, and I think if they want to go down this path, we're going to meet them with strong resistance because there is a certain time that this is just a rabbit chase that they are wanting to go on a fishing expedition and we will be meeting that as it comes up.

I was thinking with three former members of Congress, we could form her own committee here and hold hearings. Congressman Chaffetz, from the information that you have -- and it's pretty sketchy, but what we've heard so far about the Mueller report as we await the summary and then whatever else more we're going to get over time, what do you think we can say about President Trump's actions, his -- and his jeopardy down the line to impeachment?"

And if the Democrats continue to overreach, if they continue with this power grab to try to delegitimize the president, I think America turns that out.

There may have been obstruction of justice on the part of the president. And, of course, Mueller wouldn't indict. What he would do is write a full report that the Congress needs to see, that the American people need to see, so that we can make a judgment for ourselves.

And -- and the people, frankly, that a lot of us were wondering about, like Jared Kushner, like Paul Manafort, like Don Junior, none of them were indicted, and they're not protected from being indicted.

I don't know, but we need to see the full report. The American people deserve it. The American people are asking for it.

So -- and again, obviously, we're -- we're talking before we get a lot of information. But the fact that there are have -- are no indictments on collusion, not only not of the president but any of the people around, how much does that put the president in the clear on that issue?

So what I feel like we need to now let this process go forward, let people actually read this. I know the polls indicate people are already going to have their opinions and it's not going to be changed, but I think it's important that we do read this and I think it's important that we really look at it with fresh eyes and not, you know, the inherent bias that everyone brings in from a partisan standpoint. And we are very fortunate, I think, with Bill Barr being there right now, he has a national security background, a White House staffer background. He worked at the White House also. And when he was attorney general, he appointed independent counsel's himself.

But I think you have to understand that the president was trying to shut down the Mueller investigation at times. I mean he was making the case it's a witch hunt, there's a deep state here, the FBI is corrupt, CIA, everybody. The -- you know, the Mueller team is filled with Democrats. they're not going to be fair. On Friday I think he said to our colleagues Maria Bartiromo, whose Rod Rosenstein? He didn't get any votes to ask somebody to investigate me. There shouldn't be a report. So that kind of undermining is going to go forward. But I think you have to understand, I think the American people will understand, Congress is an equal branch of government. They have a right to act as a check on the executive and to have these investigations. The question is whether or not you are doing so with a political motive, which is to prevent the president from functioning. If that's the case, there will be, I think, a legitimate backlash. But right now, if you look at the American people, they think Mueller was a legitimate investigation and Congress has a right to check this president."

And I think that that -- you know, it's rare that you see Democrats are acting in such a very sort of pragmatic way in terms of their -- their thinking, but that's what this year has brought. And also I think a lot of people don't even know these candidates. That's really what stands out for me in this poll. And that's why it's important to go through this primary process. And I'm looking forward to Joe Biden jumping in."

But certainly -- we haven't seen Biden in yet, but I think it comes down to it's all about Pennsylvania, I think, and people have realized that the guy, you know, who always likes to talk about Scranton has an edge in a very key state for the president. I think you're going to see any of these candidates are not going to do what Hillary Clinton did and not go to Michigan or Wisconsin. So I'm a little surprised by the practical approach, but I think that is -- I think it's likely they come through there. But these others have been very undivided. The fact that Joe Biden, who has been fairly vetted over the years from all his campaign, and the president, the way they stack up there, that has to be encouraging to the Democrats. But as these others come on, you know, people like Beto, who, you know, a lot of bizarre stories there. I think the -- the psycho shower scene is certainly going to -- we were talking about it before, that -- that -- that is -- kind of lost me how you can think that's a funny thing to play a joke on somebody with that and some of his other things. So I do think we're going to lean interestingly enough, two 70-year-old men, Biden or Bernie, and we're not going to --"

Juan, look, let's be honest, this is ridiculously early. We're a year and a half before.

You know, what you see there, by the way, I think, is evidence of name ideas you pointed out. But, keep in mind, there have only been five presidents I think in history who have not won a second term. Donald Trump not only has the bully pulpit, he has the bully Twitter. And so he's out there and he sets the media agenda. He's going to comment on every Democratic debate. He's going to be putting down, nicknaming candidates. But I would keep in mind that you also have it very clear here, 60 -- I think it's more than two-thirds of Democrats want Joe Biden in the race. They know who Joe Biden is because of name ID. He's going to have a tough race, by the way, on criminal -- police -- criminal -- crime reform in the '90s, Anita Hill testimony. All that is going to come up and going to challenge him with the left wing of the party. But when it comes to the policy issues that you highlighted, Chris, things like Medicare for all, it's overwhelming. The American people want these things. When it comes to things that are deemed socialist by President Trump, these are not winning issues. So there's lots there for the Democrats to have hope about, but it's not going to be an easy race."

So 2018 was not a good year for the Republicans. I understand Donald Trump wasn't on the ballot, but suburban women went against him. Minorities went against him. Young people went against him or went against the party. Independents. And he kept saying he was on the ballot. How concerned are you when you see -- I understand it's early -- Biden, seven points up, a number of these others neck and neck. I mean doesn't it indicate -- not that he's in trouble necessarily, but it's going to be a tough race?"

He can draw these crowds. He can talk directly from his heart. I don't see anybody on that list who has the authenticity and the dynamism that Donald Trump has in order to win an election. When 30 of the 50 states went with Donald Trump and you combine that with a thriving economy, world peace that I think is moving in the right direction, I think Donald Trump does have the upper hand, certainly is the incumbent."

It would be unconventional, but I think it would give him a lift that, you know, is needed in this kind of multicandidate field, even with Joe Biden. And I don't think it's a sign of weakness. In fact, I think it demonstrates his strength and his belief that he can carry a ticket that can win in states like Pennsylvania and Michigan and Wisconsin."
