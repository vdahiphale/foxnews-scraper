It's like it was last year that we started. We have an incredible show that you're not going to want to miss tonight hitting story from a lot of different angles. We have a stunning revelation out of Orlando today, the father of the terrorist that killed 49 people inside that Pulse Nightclub was known to the FBI, and so is his son. Unbelievable report ahead. And Kim Jong Un is meeting with foreign leaders today, but not anyone from President Trump's team. We are going to tell you where he is and why. Plus, the left is targeting masculinity. Of course, they are. We are going to debate what is really motivating them. And what key fact did those gun-control marches not understand? We'll have some video that will shock you. But first, when Trump wins on principle, that is the focus of tonight's \"Angle.\"  All right, given Friday's kick in the gut to the Trump base, you know, when the president decided to sign, not veto, that $1.3 trillion omnibus bill, well, the phrase 'Trump wins on principle' might seem a little odd to say the least, but bear with me. Amid the disappointment that a lot of you were rightly feeling, myself included, given the bait and switch on the border wall and the fact that Planned Parenthood gets full funding, I want to tell you tonight, there are victories on the horizon, especially involving one critical area that is woefully under covered by the American media in which the president, remember, relentlessly pressed on the campaign trail.",

Remember that one serious TV network like CNN and CBS, well, our trade policy for them doesn't merit as much airtime as porn stars, but our trade relationship with the rest of the world has a lasting impact on the lives of most Americans and their families. Trump has been pretty widely on trade overall, and he has made provocative and bold moves. He has talked to tough.

Trump's tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminum and last week's proposal to raise $60 billion worth of tariffs on other Chinese goods have brought Beijing to the negotiating table and are getting results. Today's Chinese economic minister announced that they are continuing talks with the Trump administration, but they have already committed to a lot, like this, easing U.S. access to the Chinese market, tweeting domestic and foreign firms equally, increasing U.S. semiconductor imports, that's big, and they will no longer require U.S. firms to hand over intellectual property to their Chinese partners in exchange for operating in the country.   The Financial Times is reporting that the Trump team is also making headway in lowering Chinese tariffs on American cars and that they are going to gain access to the Chinese financial sector. Well, folks, since we have a $375 billion trade deficit with China, this is all really good news. On trade, let's remember, the president has stood on principle. He stuck to his guns and he completely altered the dynamic for the better, and it is not only in China. The White House says that a new NASA deal is in the offing. We should note that Jared Kushner is working hard on this behind the scenes. Then today, we learned that Trump's tariff talk has brought back to Korea to the bargaining table as well. Think about this, less than three months after he was elected, President Trump made it crystal clear what he thought of that Korean-U.S. free trade deal.",

For months now, Trump's team has been plugging away, you haven't heard a lot about it, at a total renegotiation of that agreement. Now the deal was approved in 2012 and it used NAFTA as its framework, so it's not really all that shocking that it turned out to be a complete nightmare. In the first five years since it went into effect, our trade deficit with Korea increased for all but one month, 59 out of 60 months. Our auto sector was hardest hit, but others were as well. Last year, Korea shipped more than $16 billion worth of passenger cars here, but we sent only $1.5 billion worth of vehicles over there. Yet today, Korea announced it had made significant concessions to benefit U.S. automakers. While also they are capping the amount of Korean steel that can flood into our markets, for that, they are going to get a partial exemption from Trump's tariffs. This is terrific news for American industry. It is also great news for our national security as well because it's removing obstacles to cooperating and dealing with the North Korean threat. It also shows us how Trump uses leverage. You've got to use the leverage where you have it. Tariffs are not a four-letter word. Most presidents have used them. Selectively, but they've used them. But, of course, a fake news, they prefer to ignore the substantive issues, you know, the ones that really matter. And all the progress that Trump has made for millions of Americans on this issue. Citizens, by the way, who have seen the way of life, their standard of living, destroyed over the past two decades, during a period of what, unchecked trade abuses. You know, people who work for companies like Dusty Stevens.  DUSTY STEVENS, steel worker: My father worked as a smelter for 40 years. He retired early so another guy could keep his job. My brother, he was laid off and he didn't come back to work. So, this has directly affected our family, not only ours, but over 300 other families. The Trump administration has given it back to us.",

They need him to keep challenging the Washington 'corrupt-ocrats' and changing policies that just do not work. While the left-wing resistance is marinating on things like protests, propaganda, and porn stars, the Trump administration should stick to first principles. Now it's a shame they blew it on the omnibus, but they are killing it on trade. And so, we soldier on, and that's the \"Angle.\" All right. What I just laid out really does speak to the disconnect that I've talked about for, I don't know, 15 years in the media and books and so forth between the left and the rest of the country. While the media obsesses over Stormy Daniels and the March For Our Lives kids, tangible results are actually being achieved that directly benefit you and your family. After all of the talk about how motivated the Democrats are, I am telling you, this is true and key to the midterms. Trump and the GOP are about results. The left, today, at least, it is about demagoguery.  Most Americans aren't comfortable with what they saw over the weekend, the profanity, the crude posters, First Amendment out there, make your point, that's fine. But the profanity and the anger, the nastiness, I don't think so. But conservatives do need to counter this, and they have to counter it with substance, thought, and results. Joining me now to discuss all this in the studio, Dave Bossie, Fox News contributor, and a former deputy manager of the Trump campaign, and remotely, Austan Goolsbee, an economics professor at the University of Chicago and President Obama's former top economic advisor, and Kim Strassel, Wall Street Journal columnist and Fox News contributor. All right. Let's start with you, Austan, because I remember not so long ago, the Wall Street Journal wrote an editorial about you. It was called Austan Goolsbee's Revenge, because you successfully, according to The Journal convinced Barack Obama to abandon his campaign pledge to renegotiate to NAFTA. And they credited you with bringing this unbridled enthusiasm for free trade back to the mindset of Barack Obama. That is while considering where we are today, Austan.",

That is according to court documents and testimony in the trial of Noor Salman, Omar Mateen's widow. Authorities killed Mateen on the night of the attack, but his widow is facing federal charges for obstruction of justice and aiding and abetting her husband when she dropped him off that night. At the trial today, an FBI special agent testified that Omar's father, Saddique Mateen, was an FBI informant for more than a decade prior to the Pulse Nightclub attack, and according to reporters in the courtroom, the agent also revealed the FBI was considering making Omar himself and informant. Nice. This despite the fact that the agency knew Omar had previously spoken out to friends and associates about having ties to terrorist organizations. It was all a joke, I'm sure. For more on this incredible story, let's go to former LAPD Detective Mark Fuhrman, and Terry Turchee, who formerly worked in FBI counterterror. Describing both of you, Gentlemen, in those bland terms don't really capture it, but I've got to say, when I saw this cross, I thought of both of you, saying we got to get both on tonight. Terry, let's start with you, how is it that we are just learning now about Omar Mateen -- we have kind of not heard much about him in the aftermath of the attack, but now we learn his father was an informant, and then they thought about actually recruiting Omar himself, but then they also found out about his connection to the terrorist organizations.",

In this instance, they waited a long time. I can tell you this that literally within minutes after the shooting at the nightclub and after Omar Mateen's name was known, the FBI knew that Omar Mateen was connected to Saddique, they would have been an index check and they would have known immediately. The FBI had prior interest with these people. That is not at all unusual. What I am surprised about is that they would have decided during the lead up to this trial to not say anything about that until now because you could take big chances in waiting this long. As it turns out, it appears that the judge said, this is not relevant, and continues on. But there are a lot of questions here. One glaring thing that comes to mind, if Saddique was, in fact, in FBI informant during that time, I think the market was at various points between 2005 and 2016. It is very possible that he could be providing information on something else, and they decided they need to keep that part of this client for as long as we can. But ultimately, it was the prosecution team that had to make a decision, and the DOJ, of if and when they were going to reveal this.And today it was revealed. It really it makes you feel uneasy, and it is a little hard to explain it, the average person would say, that doesn't make any sense. It is going to feed a lot of conspiracy theories regardless of how it goes from here on out.",

They don't want to share information with Metropolitan Police Departments, no matter if it is a specialized unit or not. But I look at this situation, and the first question I have, he was an informant for what? And they are trying to recruit Omar for what reason? So, it is obvious that the FBI felt that Omar did have a connection to terrorism and that he could possibly, if they could flip them, give information that they could otherwise not obtain. So not revealing this would be obvious because they don't know if they made a mistake or not, but they would rather play it safe.",

We are going to wait and let the prosecutors figure it all out when we get close to trial. I fronted one of those possible reasons, maybe he was reporting on something else. To go back to something Mark said, and I do agree with him. In national security cases and especially since 9/11, but really this goes all the way back to the days after Watergate and the hearings, and then FISA, which, of course, we're talking about all the time now, the FBI changed.

It's like it was last year that we started. We have an incredible show that you're not going to want to miss tonight hitting story from a lot of different angles. We have a stunning revelation out of Orlando today, the father of the terrorist that killed 49 people inside that Pulse Nightclub was known to the FBI, and so is his son. Unbelievable report ahead. And Kim Jong Un is meeting with foreign leaders today, but not anyone from President Trump's team. We are going to tell you where he is and why. Plus, the left is targeting masculinity. Of course, they are. We are going to debate what is really motivating them. And what key fact did those gun-control marches not understand? We'll have some video that will shock you. But first, when Trump wins on principle, that is the focus of tonight's \"Angle.\" All right, given Friday's kick in the gut to the Trump base, you know, when the president decided to sign, not veto, that $1.3 trillion omnibus bill, well, the phrase 'Trump wins on principle' might seem a little odd to say the least, but bear with me. Amid the disappointment that a lot of you were rightly feeling, myself included, given the bait and switch on the border wall and the fact that Planned Parenthood gets full funding, I want to tell you tonight, there are victories on the horizon, especially involving one critical area that is woefully under covered by the American media in which the president, remember, relentlessly pressed on the campaign trail."

Remember that one serious TV network like CNN and CBS, well, our trade policy for them doesn't merit as much airtime as porn stars, but our trade relationship with the rest of the world has a lasting impact on the lives of most Americans and their families. Trump has been pretty widely on trade overall, and he has made provocative and bold moves. He has talked to tough.

Trump's tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminum and last week's proposal to raise $60 billion worth of tariffs on other Chinese goods have brought Beijing to the negotiating table and are getting results. Today's Chinese economic minister announced that they are continuing talks with the Trump administration, but they have already committed to a lot, like this, easing U.S. access to the Chinese market, tweeting domestic and foreign firms equally, increasing U.S. semiconductor imports, that's big, and they will no longer require U.S. firms to hand over intellectual property to their Chinese partners in exchange for operating in the country. The Financial Times is reporting that the Trump team is also making headway in lowering Chinese tariffs on American cars and that they are going to gain access to the Chinese financial sector. Well, folks, since we have a $375 billion trade deficit with China, this is all really good news. On trade, let's remember, the president has stood on principle. He stuck to his guns and he completely altered the dynamic for the better, and it is not only in China. The White House says that a new NASA deal is in the offing. We should note that Jared Kushner is working hard on this behind the scenes. Then today, we learned that Trump's tariff talk has brought back to Korea to the bargaining table as well. Think about this, less than three months after he was elected, President Trump made it crystal clear what he thought of that Korean-U.S. free trade deal."

For months now, Trump's team has been plugging away, you haven't heard a lot about it, at a total renegotiation of that agreement. Now the deal was approved in 2012 and it used NAFTA as its framework, so it's not really all that shocking that it turned out to be a complete nightmare. In the first five years since it went into effect, our trade deficit with Korea increased for all but one month, 59 out of 60 months. Our auto sector was hardest hit, but others were as well. Last year, Korea shipped more than $16 billion worth of passenger cars here, but we sent only $1.5 billion worth of vehicles over there. Yet today, Korea announced it had made significant concessions to benefit U.S. automakers. While also they are capping the amount of Korean steel that can flood into our markets, for that, they are going to get a partial exemption from Trump's tariffs. This is terrific news for American industry. It is also great news for our national security as well because it's removing obstacles to cooperating and dealing with the North Korean threat. It also shows us how Trump uses leverage. You've got to use the leverage where you have it. Tariffs are not a four-letter word. Most presidents have used them. Selectively, but they've used them. But, of course, a fake news, they prefer to ignore the substantive issues, you know, the ones that really matter. And all the progress that Trump has made for millions of Americans on this issue. Citizens, by the way, who have seen the way of life, their standard of living, destroyed over the past two decades, during a period of what, unchecked trade abuses.

They need him to keep challenging the Washington 'corrupt-ocrats' and changing policies that just do not work. While the left-wing resistance is marinating on things like protests, propaganda, and porn stars, the Trump administration should stick to first principles. Now it's a shame they blew it on the omnibus, but they are killing it on trade. And so, we soldier on, and that's the \"Angle.\" All right. What I just laid out really does speak to the disconnect that I've talked about for, I don't know, 15 years in the media and books and so forth between the left and the rest of the country. While the media obsesses over Stormy Daniels and the March For Our Lives kids, tangible results are actually being achieved that directly benefit you and your family. After all of the talk about how motivated the Democrats are, I am telling you, this is true and key to the midterms. Trump and the GOP are about results. The left, today, at least, it is about demagoguery. Most Americans aren't comfortable with what they saw over the weekend, the profanity, the crude posters, First Amendment out there, make your point, that's fine. But the profanity and the anger, the nastiness, I don't think so. But conservatives do need to counter this, and they have to counter it with substance, thought, and results. Joining me now to discuss all this in the studio, Dave Bossie, Fox News contributor, and a former deputy manager of the Trump campaign, and remotely, Austan Goolsbee, an economics professor at the University of Chicago and President Obama's former top economic advisor, and Kim Strassel, Wall Street Journal columnist and Fox News contributor. All right. Let's start with you, Austan, because I remember not so long ago, the Wall Street Journal wrote an editorial about you. It was called Austan Goolsbee's Revenge, because you successfully, according to The Journal convinced Barack Obama to abandon his campaign pledge to renegotiate to NAFTA. And they credited you with bringing this unbridled enthusiasm for free trade back to the mindset of Barack Obama. That is while considering where we are today, Austan."

I submit that the 'Journal' has been wrong on this issue for 25 years. These tariffs are what got Europe paying attention. They're working with Japan and us to put pressure on China, Korea was brought to the table, our manufacturers are going to benefit, and the world is taking notice, maybe we pulled him back.

They both benefit in the end. That's the idea. Now when you talk about some of these steel manufacturers going under, part of it was because we weren't doing as good a job, and partly because of liberal policies imposing vast amounts of regulation and taxes on our companies. So, one of the most important things that Donald Trump has done since he came into office was deal with our domestic agenda and begin to make it easier for manufacturers from an energy perspective, from a deregulatory perspective, from a tax perspective, to begin competing in the world. You also want the rest of the world to play by a fair set of rules."

The problem with, though, China, the market influence and market domination that they have been able to develop because of allowing permanent trade relations status.

The terrorist that gunned down 49 people in the Pulse Nightclub attack back in 2016. It was just revealed as an FBI informant. That is according to court documents and testimony in the trial of Noor Salman, Omar Mateen's widow. Authorities killed Mateen on the night of the attack, but his widow is facing federal charges for obstruction of justice and aiding and abetting her husband when she dropped him off that night. At the trial today, an FBI special agent testified that Omar's father, Saddique Mateen, was an FBI informant for more than a decade prior to the Pulse Nightclub attack, and according to reporters in the courtroom, the agent also revealed the FBI was considering making Omar himself and informant. Nice. This despite the fact that the agency knew Omar had previously spoken out to friends and associates about having ties to terrorist organizations. It was all a joke, I'm sure. For more on this incredible story, let's go to former LAPD Detective Mark Fuhrman, and Terry Turchee, who formerly worked in FBI counterterror. Describing both of you, Gentlemen, in those bland terms don't really capture it, but I've got to say, when I saw this cross, I thought of both of you, saying we got to get both on tonight. Terry, let's start with you, how is it that we are just learning now about Omar Mateen -- we have kind of not heard much about him in the aftermath of the attack, but now we learn his father was an informant, and then they thought about actually recruiting Omar himself, but then they also found out about his connection to the terrorist organizations."

What I am surprised about is that they would have decided during the lead up to this trial to not say anything about that until now because you could take big chances in waiting this long. As it turns out, it appears that the judge said, this is not relevant, and continues on. But there are a lot of questions here. One glaring thing that comes to mind, if Saddique was, in fact, in FBI informant during that time, I think the market was at various points between 2005 and 2016. It is very possible that he could be providing information on something else, and they decided they need to keep that part of this client for as long as we can. But ultimately, it was the prosecution team that had to make a decision, and the DOJ, of if and when they were going to reveal this.And today it was revealed. It really it makes you feel uneasy, and it is a little hard to explain it, the average person would say, that doesn't make any sense. It is going to feed a lot of conspiracy theories regardless of how it goes from here on out."

Information is power, and they prefer to keep all of it in-house. It is very difficult. Boston bombing was a perfect example of that. They don't want to share information with Metropolitan Police Departments, no matter if it is a specialized unit or not. But I look at this situation, and the first question I have, he was an informant for what? And they are trying to recruit Omar for what reason? So, it is obvious that the FBI felt that Omar did have a connection to terrorism and that he could possibly, if they could flip them, give information that they could otherwise not obtain. So not revealing this would be obvious because they don't know if they made a mistake or not, but they would rather play it safe."

It's hard to believe in this day and age, listening to Comey there -- he knew at that point in time when he gave that press conference, as did Sally Yates, who was standing next to him, that Saddique Mateen was a bureau informant or had been a puerile informant. I don't know why they chose not to say anything about it then. But I believe that they had already made a judgment that, for some reason, that we can't bring this up. We can't front this yet. We are going to wait and let the prosecutors figure it all out when we get close to trial. I fronted one of those possible reasons, maybe he was reporting on something else. To go back to something Mark said, and I do agree with him. In national security cases and especially since 9/11, but really this goes all the way back to the days after Watergate and the hearings, and then FISA, which, of course, we're talking about all the time now, the FBI changed. It changed dramatically in dealing with national security issues and domestic terrorism. And we are still now, I think, in my opinion, paying a price for guidelines that aren't keeping up keeping up with what we are now facing."

But the network lives inside the brains of these terrorists. And it has been 17 years since 9/11. I think they've figured out how to not get on the radar a very large percentage of the time to actually still have contacts and still be part of a terrorist network."

Earlier this month President Trump announced he would personally meet with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un to try to put an end to this standoff over the country's nuclear weapons. But according to reports, President Trump will not be the first foreign leader to take a meeting with Rocket Man. Bloomberg News is reporting that Kim is currently in China in his first foreign trip since taking power in 2011. Trying to make sense of all this. Is this really happening? Let's bring in Gordon Chang who is the author of Nuclear Showdown, North Korea Takes on the World, and with me here in Washington is Harry Kazianis, Director of Defense Studies at the Center for the National Interest, two experts in China, North Korea. Gordon, let's start with you. I read this today, and I almost fell out of my chair. An armored car procession going from North Korea to China. Are we all being punked here? What's going on?"

And what's going on is that Xi Jinping is trying to pull the string on the North Koreans. Kim Jong Un, the first foreign leader he wanted to meet was South Korea's Moon Jae-in. The second one was President Trump. Xi Jinping says, no, the optics look really bad. I'm going to force the North Koreans to come to Beijing because Kim Jong Un in Xi Jinping's mind is a vassal. And so this sort of shows that China does control North Korea. When China really wants something, they get it. And I think that really right now what we are seeing is the Chinese telling the North Koreans, you've got to do what we, the Chinese, say."

But we have to remember, what do the North Koreans actually get out of a negotiation with the United States? Nothing. Because now the Trump administration is demanding that they give up their nuclear weapons. We had John Bolton make a lot of statements who is going to be the national security adviser to say they only negotiation is how are we going to pack up your nuclear weapons and bring them back to the United States? So what do the North Koreans get here? I have a feeling the North Koreans could actually be in Beijing to figure out how to get out of this and hopefully the Chinese can help them do this."

This has been going on for decades and American administrations have not stopped it. I think Bolton as national security advisor is going to put an end to that. And I'm sure North Koreans are very concerned.

They have been trying to close off the global commons, trying to take territory from their neighbors, some of which are our treaty allies. And it's important for, I think, the world the world see Beijing and Moscow as it is, and Bolton does that. He understands it that that's the problems in the world today."

We are all against abuse, we are all against criminality, at least we should be. If you're not, you're weird. So for me, when you say someone is masculine, it doesn't -- I don't see that. I don't want that, no one I no wants that, but it's OK for a man too, as a friend of mine says, protect, provide, and defend. And I'm sorry, most women I happen to know like men who like to do that, that they carry themselves that way and that's what they think their role is. Today in schools and discussions like we saw on MSNBC, that is considered kind of icky, that whole construct is oppressive. Why is that?"

I think that what that specific NBC segment was talking about is the fact that rigid gender roles, specifically in boys, are tied to higher rates of suicide, substance abuse, violence.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "But Julie, how is that connected? We have had gender roles for, I don't know, millennia. So gender roles are causing boys to commit suicide. Maybe there are a lot of societal factors involved in drug abuse, in promiscuity, in shaming, in substance abuse of other types, addictions, violent video games, isolation because of social media, family dissolution. Men have been tending to be masculine for a long time, but they feminists are like, it's masculinity causing them to do all that."

      "speaker": "ALVIN",
      "utterance": "I think that in the feminist community, we talk a lot about how gender roles tend to hold women back, but there is also something that needs to be discussed about how gender roles tend to hold men back. So men are taught from a young age, from a very, very young age, preschool age, that they are supposed to be unemotional, that's they're supposed to be macho, that they're supposed to be aggressive. And because of that, they don't really have that healthy balance for an outlet of their anger, frustration, things they are feeling sensitive about, rage, things they are experiencing in schools. And because of that, it expresses itself often, and yes, there are certainly other factors at play here, but it often expresses itself through violence and through turning inward, through depression, through self-harm, through substance abuse. And I'm not saying it's the only cause, but --"

I know a lot of guys who work in a workplace, maybe it's lawyers or businessmen, and they feel like it is open season on them. I mean, these are good people. They feel like, we can't complement anyone, we have to be careful what we say. And they feel like, literally, if they are 25 and single, they can't ask out a gal down the hallway for a drink because if they do, that is going to be considered somehow overly aggressive or abusive. I'm telling you, it's not easy to be a man in the current work environment or in the current societal environment."

I think that's a welcome change after the way women have long been treated in the workplace. I wouldn't say that's one of the root causes of this increased self-harming behaviors in men. I think gender roles play a part in that and all the things that come with it. These gender roles create isolation, they create anger and a lot of pressure."
