We can also add an addition on, so we can start the printing now and maybe do an addendum after we get a positive decision. So we're working on a lot of things, including an executive order.",

Jeff, let's start with you. Do you get a sense from your sources the White House believes they can win this legal fight for the census question or is it something that they feel like they need to at least fight for?",

Asking a question about citizenship is something that a lot of people understand is being important. And if you look back at censuses, going back 190 years, they were - a question of this nature was asked in all but one of them, which was the immediate previous one. But it also speaks to the need to have people who are really capable in positions, in government to handle this. You know, the Supreme Court didn't say you couldn't ask this question. It had some issues with how it had been handled administratively, and what the justifications were for it.   This is not over and I think it's an important piece of information that a lot of people want to know and there are many ways that you can go about getting it.",

And it also didn't go over as well in the market because financial investors were hoping that maybe they would see a cut in those rates.

She goes after him on busing. She steals the show. Then it turns out her position is the same as Joe Biden's. I think this is a part of things she might want to avoid this pattern. She's known for grabbing the spotlight and then she kind of is out on a limb to mix metaphors that could be sawed off beneath her. She did it with the Kavanaugh confirmation hearings where she claimed she had the goods on him with perjury and then it turned out she had nothing at all. So she needs to make sure she backs up her bluster with actual substance.",

So I'm curious to see whether that will also play with voters if anyone believes or thinks that Senator Harris perhaps went too far.

We can also add an addition on, so we can start the printing now and maybe do an addendum after we get a positive decision. So we're working on a lot of things, including an executive order."

Jeff, let's start with you. Do you get a sense from your sources the White House believes they can win this legal fight for the census question or is it something that they feel like they need to at least fight for?"

But I think the most important thing to them right now is that they're showing that they are fighting on it. The President, of course, was upset when his administration earlier this week indicated that it would not continue to push for this after the Supreme Court decision. And now he and those around him are trying to say, \"Hey, look, we're still in on this. We're still working on it. Even if it does not end up going through or standing up to the legal scrutiny that it will no doubt face\"."

      "utterance": "I'm not sure how it plays exactly. I mean, obviously, this is an important issue that needs to be fought for, I think, on the merits of the situation. Asking a question about citizenship is something that a lot of people understand is being important. And if you look back at censuses, going back 190 years, they were - a question of this nature was asked in all but one of them, which was the immediate previous one. But it also speaks to the need to have people who are really capable in positions, in government to handle this. You know, the Supreme Court didn't say you couldn't ask this question. It had some issues with how it had been handled administratively, and what the justifications were for it. This is not over and I think it's an important piece of information that a lot of people want to know and there are many ways that you can go about getting it."

The U.S. economy added 224,000 jobs in June, a strong comeback for the labor market after a disappointing May, and higher than economists had predicted. Let's take a look at the Trump economy since he has taken office. Real GDP is up, unemployment rate is down, consumer confidence is up and the average hourly earnings up. Matthew, is at a winning formula heading into 2020?"

It had continued through his patriotic speech yesterday, with the July 4th salute to America and it culminates today with this really amazing jobs report, which beat expectations. It's very difficult to defeat an incumbent President presiding over a good economy. So President Trump wants this record to continue."

      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "Well, I think one thing about the previous month's jobs report which had really sluggish growth was that, a lot of people predicted that you'd have lower interest rates. You'd have a lowering of the interest rates coming up soon, that's maybe the less likely to happen with this really strong jobs report this month. And it's just one of these issues where - obviously, the economy is going really well. People keep waiting. They are wondering how long this can be sustained and whether it can be sustained through 2020."

      "speaker": "MASON",
      "utterance": "Well, the President - I mean, it's interesting what Mollie just said. It's true that - of course, this is - it's really good news that the economy is doing so well, but it does weaken the President's argument that the Fed should have been cutting interest or it should have - should be doing something different on interest rates. And it also didn't go over as well in the market because financial investors were hoping that maybe they would see a cut in those rates. The President has been upset with the Fed's policies for some time. I suspect he'll continue to voice that criticism regardless of how well the jobs numbers turn out."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "EMANUEL",
      "utterance": "All right, let's take a quick look at some of the trends with the 2020 Democrats. You've got Vice President Joe Biden who is down. Kamala Harris is up. Bernie Sanders down. Elizabeth Warren up. Pete Buttigieg, down. But when it comes to fundraising, Pete Buttigieg has been crushing it. Biden right behind him. Bernie Sanders behind Biden. And then Kamala Harris really needs to pick up some steam in terms of fundraising. Your thoughts Mollie?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "Well, you need to win both of these competitions, the fundraising and actually having the votes, and I think all of these are top-tier candidates. What was so interesting for me, Kamala Harris, obviously did a great job coming out of that debate, going after Joe Biden. But then it turned out she didn't have much to stand on. She goes after him on busing. She steals the show. Then it turns out her position is the same as Joe Biden's. I think this is a part of things she might want to avoid this pattern. She's known for grabbing the spotlight and then she kind of is out on a limb to mix metaphors that could be sawed off beneath her. She did it with the Kavanaugh confirmation hearings where she claimed she had the goods on him with perjury and then it turned out she had nothing at all. So she needs to make sure she backs up her bluster with actual substance."

      "utterance": "Harris made the most of her opportunity. She was the only candidate on that stage with Biden to really go after him and she scored some points. Her problem might be that she won't have another opportunity. There's still be going to 20 - even 21 candidates the next debate that will be split over two nights. What happens if Harris is not on that stage with Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren or Cory Booker decides to take on the front- runner for themselves."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "EMANUEL",
      "utterance": "Jeff, I know you've covered the Obama-Biden White House. It seemed that Vice President Biden was not comfortable with Harris's attack. Meanwhile, Harris seems to think attacking Joe Biden plays well for her."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MASON",
      "utterance": "Indeed. I mean, and then the Vice President said in an interview today that he wasn't prepared for the attack from Senator Harris. And he spoke sort of sympathetically or expected a little bit more sympathy for the fact that Senator Harris knew his son Beau who passed away, and should have in his view, known his record on civil rights. So I'm curious to see whether that will also play with voters if anyone believes or thinks that Senator Harris perhaps went too far. But, certainly, it was the move that she made to win herself a lot of plaudits after that debate. Although it does not look, at least at this point, like that translated to a major win on the fundraising side."

I don't think Iran is on really solid ground here to be provoking too much more. The whole world saw that the United States has chosen not to respond to some of those provocations. And with Europe weighing in, it is a very delicate situation and when everybody to be - remember to be very calm. But I'm not sure Iran is on as strong ground as they think there."

      "speaker": "CONTINETTI",
      "utterance": "I think we can hope so. The Iranian strategy has always been to split Europe from the United States, isolate us diplomatically and pressure us to continue some waivers that we have regarding their civilian nuclear program. That's why the seizure of the ship carrying oil to Syria by the British naval forces was so important, because it signifies that the Allies are continued to be on our side with regard to Iran's maligned behavior in the region."

At the same time, people need to also remember to be respectful of the work that our Customs and Border Patrol are doing. This is one of the few legitimate functions of government, and you're seeing a lot of lack of regard for the tough jobs that they're in. But all federal employees need to remember that they are in positions of trust and need to behave accordingly."
