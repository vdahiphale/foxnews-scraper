The vote is expected to be close, but that they will subpoena him and force the issue. It could mean jail time if he still refuses. And it could mean some hefty fines. We will keep a close eye on that vote. And keeping a close eye on what you see all the time at the store, inflation. It is running out of control, running at the latest wholesale price report -- those are the prices before what you and I pay at the retail level -- running at close to a 10 percent clip year over year.

      "sentences": "Yes, that's right, Neil, no relief in sight for consumers, with price pressures continuing to build in the U.S. supply chains. So we saw a record jump in producer prices in November. And that means suppliers are charging businesses at the highest level for their goods since data started being collected 11 years ago. Now, combine with the highest consumer price jump in 40 years last month, and that suggests that prices are going to stay elevated into next year. So businesses being businesses and meaning that they need to make money, they're going to try to pass on the bulk of any price increases onto consumers, with nearly 60 percent of small businesses raising their prices. And that is a highest number since the Carter administration in 1979, with a majority of wholesale suppliers, construction companies and manufacturing passing the buck onto consumers. And that's why Americans are paying a lot more these days, whether it's at the grocery stores or filling up their gas tanks, booking trips, or buying furniture. Now, geographically, consumers in the Midwest and the South of this country are more concerned of a negative inflation impact than, say, residents in the West or the Northeast, according to the New York Fed survey this week. And that's why Wall Street now predicts that the Federal Reserve will have to be more aggressive in its fight against inflation and skyrocketing prices. That means that they will start cutting back on their monthly bond purchases by twice the amount the Fed Chair Jay Powell had indicated just six weeks ago. And they will likely start raising interest rates in the early springtime, with Wall Street anticipating maybe two or three interest rate hikes next year, as the Fed, Neil, tries to battle and bring down the cost of goods.",

That could have an effect on interest rates moving up pretty much by themselves, even if the Fed doesn't formally raise interest rates to respond to this.

And there's a lot of uncertainty in the economy. So the more you tax the economy, the more you're going to hurt working families. All the things that are in this so-called Build Back Better tax-and-spend extravaganza hurt working families. So the real issue is spending. It's spending that has increased dramatically. And $1.9 trillion in March that was already spent is part of the problem. And now they want to make it even worse by once again overheating the economy with more stimulus spending that's going to result in higher inflation. The American people get that because they're going to the store, they're going to the gas pump, they're trying to buy clothes, and everything's going up.

It's a double whammy. The best thing to do right now, Neil, though, is on the fiscal side. Let's just take a pause. As Joe Manchin said wisely, let's take a strategic pause. We're in the middle of four things right now, incredibly high inflation, which will only be exacerbated by this, record levels of debt, both in nominal terms, but also as a percent of our economy, which is how you ought to look at it. And that's really scary to all of us, also a lot of uncertainty because of COVID. We have a situation now where, unfortunately, the COVID situation doesn't seem to be getting better, as we'd all hoped. And then I would just say we're in an uncertain time here, in terms of a lot of other expenditures.

Liz Cheney was up there before. We're hearing for representatives from both Democrats and Republicans to say that this action was necessary, they thought they had cooperation from the former congressman, the former chief of staff. Then he changed his mind, did a 180, said that he would not cooperate with them. They're forcing the issue by trying to force him with this resolution to hold him in contempt of Congress if he doesn't change his mind. We will continue monitoring this on Capitol Hill if and when they ever get to a vote. This was unanimously voted on within the committee looking into those January 6 events. It is expected to pass. That is this contempt of Congress resolution in the House, but it will be close as a tick. So we will follow that.

And they actually ended up punishing South Africa. But I think what we're learning is that, yes, this is more contagious, it may be less severe, but it's something we have to take seriously.

And that drives everything. That's more important than any other single issue. Then he's saying, those troops could be used. And he's saying that, because we can't guarantee and we certainly don't trust NATO, which they just said two days ago, then that we wouldn't put missiles there. So they're saying, if you come up to our border, then we will also bring missiles up closer too. And he's saying, hey, let's don't do either one of those. We will -- let's have some kind of agreement that NATO won't move up, we will move our troops back, we will take them -- we won't put missiles up there. So some of his positions have some merit that we should explore. But we should explore those, as opposed to pushing more, because all that's going to do is push Russia and China closer together.

And I know that people in Southern Illinois are dealing with this, people in Tennessee, people in Arkansas and everywhere. And so we work together and kind of figure out how we can make the biggest impact and use our resources and connect with other agencies as well. A disaster like this is so big, no single organization would be able to meet all the needs created. But we're going to do what we can do best. And that is provide comfort and bring hope for tomorrow. And we're going to make these people feel like they are not alone. I spoke to many local people today. And a man who said he was 59, who said he lived here his whole life, he had never seen anything like this. Another man I spoke to said he knew somebody who lost their brother in all of this. And I can just tell that people are going to need healing. And that's what we're here for. We have volunteers who are specializing in disaster mental health, in casework, in everything that might come from a disaster like this. So we're here to help.

Just want to update you on another development we're following out of Washington right now. And that is this contempt vote they plan to hold for Mark Meadows, the former chief of staff for President Trump, for refusing to come and testify before Congress to that January 6 Committee, of course, when rioters took over Capitol Hill. The vote is expected to be close, but that they will subpoena him and force the issue. It could mean jail time if he still refuses. And it could mean some hefty fines. We will keep a close eye on that vote. And keeping a close eye on what you see all the time at the store, inflation. It is running out of control, running at the latest wholesale price report -- those are the prices before what you and I pay at the retail level -- running at close to a 10 percent clip year over year. So here's the deal. You're seeing yourself making a little bit more money, about 4 to 5 percent more, but the cost of the things you want to buy are running double that. What do you do? After this."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "SUSAN LI, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Yes, that's right, Neil, no relief in sight for consumers, with price pressures continuing to build in the U.S. supply chains. So we saw a record jump in producer prices in November. And that means suppliers are charging businesses at the highest level for their goods since data started being collected 11 years ago. Now, combine with the highest consumer price jump in 40 years last month, and that suggests that prices are going to stay elevated into next year. So businesses being businesses and meaning that they need to make money, they're going to try to pass on the bulk of any price increases onto consumers, with nearly 60 percent of small businesses raising their prices. And that is a highest number since the Carter administration in 1979, with a majority of wholesale suppliers, construction companies and manufacturing passing the buck onto consumers. And that's why Americans are paying a lot more these days, whether it's at the grocery stores or filling up their gas tanks, booking trips, or buying furniture. Now, geographically, consumers in the Midwest and the South of this country are more concerned of a negative inflation impact than, say, residents in the West or the Northeast, according to the New York Fed survey this week. And that's why Wall Street now predicts that the Federal Reserve will have to be more aggressive in its fight against inflation and skyrocketing prices. That means that they will start cutting back on their monthly bond purchases by twice the amount the Fed Chair Jay Powell had indicated just six weeks ago. And they will likely start raising interest rates in the early springtime, with Wall Street anticipating maybe two or three interest rate hikes next year, as the Fed, Neil, tries to battle and bring down the cost of goods."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Susan Li, thank you very much for that. Just as a point of explanation here, what the Federal Reserve can do, it's been buying up a lot of Treasury notes, mortgage securities, and forcing to keep interest rates down, already indicating -- and we will get confirmation of that tomorrow -- that it's going to slow down on all that buying, and maybe, maybe stop it eventually, within just a couple of months. That could have an effect on interest rates moving up pretty much by themselves, even if the Fed doesn't formally raise interest rates to respond to this. And all of this with a backdrop of a lot more spending on Capitol Hill that some worry is going to make a bad thing get worse. Hillary Vaughn with the latest on that in Washington -- Hillary."

The Congressional Budget Office says, if that were to happen, the real cost of the Build Back Better bill is closer to $5 trillion. But the White House and Democrats on Capitol Hill say that's not fair because they cut programs short on purpose and will extend them on a case- by-case basis."

In other words, last quarter, it looks like our revenues may have been at a record level. So it's not that we're not taxing enough. We're taxing a lot. And there's a lot of uncertainty in the economy. So the more you tax the economy, the more you're going to hurt working families. All the things that are in this so-called Build Back Better tax-and-spend extravaganza hurt working families. So the real issue is spending. It's spending that has increased dramatically. And $1.9 trillion in March that was already spent is part of the problem. And now they want to make it even worse by once again overheating the economy with more stimulus spending that's going to result in higher inflation. The American people get that because they're going to the store, they're going to the gas pump, they're trying to buy clothes, and everything's going up. You just had a great report from Susan Ball saying -- or Susan Li saying that it's not only about the consumer prices going up, but now, as of the new numbers we just got last night, it was about the producer price index at historic levels since we started keeping track of it over 10 years ago.

It's a double whammy. The best thing to do right now, Neil, though, is on the fiscal side. Let's just take a pause. As Joe Manchin said wisely, let's take a strategic pause. We're in the middle of four things right now, incredibly high inflation, which will only be exacerbated by this, record levels of debt, both in nominal terms, but also as a percent of our economy, which is how you ought to look at it. And that's really scary to all of us, also a lot of uncertainty because of COVID. We have a situation now where, unfortunately, the COVID situation doesn't seem to be getting better, as we'd all hoped. And then I would just say we're in an uncertain time here, in terms of a lot of other expenditures. Look at the natural disaster that just happened in Kentucky and other states around the Midwest and the South. Look at all the other natural disasters.

But, by the way, on that issue, whoever is talking about $1.7 trillion, because these things are all temporary, these spending programs, doesn't realize that what Congress does when there's a program like the child tax credit is, we tend to extend it year after year after year.

The House has been on one-hour debate on a resolution that recommends the House find Mark Meadows, Donald Trump's former chief of staff, in contempt of Congress for defying a subpoena related to the January 6 Committee investigation, where the Capitol was stormed. Liz Cheney was up there before. We're hearing for representatives from both Democrats and Republicans to say that this action was necessary, they thought they had cooperation from the former congressman, the former chief of staff. Then he changed his mind, did a 180, said that he would not cooperate with them. They're forcing the issue by trying to force him with this resolution to hold him in contempt of Congress if he doesn't change his mind. We will continue monitoring this on Capitol Hill if and when they ever get to a vote. This was unanimously voted on within the committee looking into those January 6 events. It is expected to pass. That is this contempt of Congress resolution in the House, but it will be close as a tick. So we will follow that. Also waiting to hear anything from Mark Meadows or any of the key confidants around President Trump at the time of all of this. In the meantime, also following Omicron, spreading worldwide and fast, with cases now over 200,000 in the latest day in Britain alone. They're doubling right now. There's a death in Britain to talk about. But, overall, the impact of this has been surprisingly mild. It is a very contagious variant, but, right now, not all that dangerous a one. The read on all of this from Dr. Amesh Adalja, the infectious diseases specialist, Johns Hopkins senior scholar Doctor, I was thinking of just, once we got word of Omicron, the swift moves that were being taken and has since been taken all around the country, from an indoor mask mandate in New York, to the same in California, to companies also making much more sweeping requirements, restrictions as well Is all of this justified, in your eyes?"

I do think that there was a reflex jump as soon as people heard about it and its mutations to kind of go back to the early days of the pandemic, forgetting that we have vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, rapid tests, and lots of knowledge about how COVID-19 spreads. So I do think there was a panic reaction, especially, for example, in the travel bans that President Biden initiated that are still in place, even though there's no reason for them to be there. And they actually ended up punishing South Africa. But I think what we're learning is that, yes, this is more contagious, it may be less severe, but it's something we have to take seriously.

And it's likely that we would get variants like Omicron that are able to get around immunity and infect people. But we have got tools to be able to take care of this. And we don't have to go back to all of the -- those blunt measures. And what happens is, many of the places that put these things in place are areas where vaccination rates are very high. What we need is people where they're not vaccinated, where those vaccination rates are low to take this seriously. So what you kind of have is this two-track pandemic, where states like New York, cities like Philadelphia are aggressive. But then places, for example, in the South or the Midwest, they don't really double down on any anything. The stuff that they should be doing for Delta, they're not going to do for Omicron. And then we end up in this kind of limbo, where we still worry about hospital capacity. I mean, the solution to this is to get more people vaccinated, because we know, even if there's a breakthrough infection with Omicron, you're still protected against what matters, serious disease, hospitalization and death.

So it only makes sense that, on the two issues of the most critical importance to each of those two countries, Ukraine and Taiwan, to Russia and China, that they're going to compare notes.

And that drives everything. That's more important than any other single issue. Then he's saying, those troops could be used. And he's saying that, because we can't guarantee and we certainly don't trust NATO, which they just said two days ago, then that we wouldn't put missiles there. So they're saying, if you come up to our border, then we will also bring missiles up closer too. And he's saying, hey, let's don't do either one of those. We will -- let's have some kind of agreement that NATO won't move up, we will move our troops back, we will take them -- we won't put missiles up there.

They have the advantages, and it would be foolhardy for us to even attempt to do so.

Relevant Church Pastor Joel Cauley with us now to talk about all that stuff. Pastor, very good to have you. Man, you're a one-man band here. And you're taking care of a lot. Could you explain how it's going?"

There's hundreds and hundreds of volunteers, multiple organizations that are helping us on the front lines right there in ground zero in Mayfield, and not just in Mayfield, but we're sending relief efforts all throughout the state of Kentucky and just doing what we can to get people some relief after the devastation of these tornadoes on Friday night."

Man, Convoy of Hope and Master Chefs has come in and done an amazing job with getting us some supplies to give people some -- what little bit of comfort they can get right now. And then we're -- we're -- I think we're feeding probably close to 4,000 to 5,000 people a day all throughout the state. And then we're just trying to give people some relief, and so anything to keep people warm, keep people fed, and to give people a little bit of light before power comes back on. So we're just trying to keep up those efforts and do what we can and assist."

I love that verse in Psalm that says, God is close to the brokenhearted. So we know that he's here and near. And so it's our job just to try to lift their heads and hold their arms up in these times, and not just to be with them now, but, when this tornado is yesterday's news and this lifestyle now becomes their normal, to be with them there in the long haul, because it's going to take a long time for this to recover."

We also have the coroner that's on our site that is helping deliver some of the news. And, man, we're just trying to do what we can to just tell them that better days are ahead, that this just is a season, it won't last always, and that -- and just to be here and show them that we're the hands and feet of Jesus, to give them supplies that they need, and just to help parents that even lost -- today, today, we had to help a family assist to help bury their 4-year-old little boy."
