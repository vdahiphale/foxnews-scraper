      "sentences": "The worst jacket I've ever seen. What's your name again, Jimmy. I can't remember. Happy glorious Monday, everyone. You know ever since this show began in the early 70s, as a summer replacement for the Brady Bunch, we were on top of one trend, canceled culture. The idea being if your past isn't adaptable to current standards, you would lose your friends social status, Netflix password and career. You'd be shunned from polite society. It's kindred spirit was wokeism, political correctness on more steroids than Lance Armstrong, which allowed no forgiveness relating not just to your past actions, but to who you are. Generally, it's things that can't be changed, like your race, or Pete Davidson's bed sheets. In the world of the woke, you're either oppressed or the oppressor and the offenses only flow in one direction. Suddenly, we no longer measure anyone by achievement, but by victim status, which creates a new kind of segregation that's now spreading like Omicron in the Olympic Village. I call it idea segregation, and that we cannot share our knowledge, wisdom or ideas If we're not of the same tribe. Now we see this with crime. This show has been blaring about rising crime, like the alarm in a broken Nord Strom's window. But the people who need to hear it won't listen, because it's coming from us. It's the Fox crying wolf. They'd rather drown in raw sewage than grab a life preserver from us Metis. And I get it. It affects all issues from the border, to crime to COVID. It's a division of ideas, and none shall mix. Now imagine if this kind of thing existed before we had a chance to make things. Like did you ever wonder about how a pencil is made? Milton Friedman has. I certainly hope we have some grainy footage of him lying around. We can play right now.",

To make the saw, it took steel, to make the steel, it took iron ore. This black center, we call it lead but it's really graphite, compressed graphite. I'm not sure where it comes from, but I think it comes from some mines in South America. This red top up here, the eraser, that a rubber probably comes from Malaya where the rubber tree isn't even native. It was imported from South America by some businessmen with the help of the British government. This brass ferrule, I haven't the slightest idea where it came from, or the yellow paint, or the paint and made the black lines are the glue that holds it together. Literally , thousands of people cooperated to make this pencil.",

      "sentences": "Someone likes his weed. So the moral is obvious. It's not like one person sits in a room and makes a pencil. As the lady in the pantsuit once said, it takes a village. Now you can use that pencil to write whatever you want, or to gouge your eyes out if you're watching The View. But this is the case for everything we use today. It's the division of labor, which is not referring to twins being born more than 30 minutes apart, Kat. This clipboard right here, the chair I'm in, Kat's hair extensions, they all likely weren't made by a single entity but a cooperation of sources, workers, ideas, and of course labor from people who never even met each other. I wish that was how this show was produced. Imagine if wokeism existed before the pencil was made. Could the division of labor exist? Think of the micro and macro aggressions. Why does the pencil have to be yellow? Why isn't it black? Are you black? Do you have enough transgendered persons of color making the erasers? What's with the lead? Talk about a carbon footprint. And why number two? Why can't they all be equal? Fact is, nothing would happen because wokeism prevents cooperation needed for any shared labor. It wouldn't just be pencils, but everything you use. You have to work together whether you like it or not. And sometimes, you know, we have no choice. Take the Alec Baldwin tragedy. If there was an idea segregation that woman could be alive today because there would have been an NRA instructor on set and that's cooperation, idea sharing. Sure Baldwin, a Democrat might not like the instructor's politics but he's not there for that. He's there to share his safety expertise. And then an NRA dude would have kept a loaded gun out of Baldwin's hands. Idea segregation prevents that. Wokeism demands you can't benefit from a person's expertise if they're not like you. The political is now personal. Sure. You're having engine problems with your car and your brother in law is a great mechanic but he's got a Back the Blue sticker on his truck, screw it, you'll just walk home. So now to Joe Rogan. There's likely no person on earth who's doing more dismantle idea segregation than him. The roster of his guests are more diverse than the Olympic opening ceremonies. And they're allowed to speak endlessly about whatever, so the listener can decide. It's the antidote to cable T.V. where shows rely on the same people who say the same things over and over again. I mean, look at this show. You get 42 minutes of content divided by five segments, and five talking heads. No wonder I'm on drugs. And no wonder CNN hates Rogan. He's widening the universe as they shrink it. At first, the legacy media tried to take him down with his COVID content. He had doctors on who disagreed with Fauci, the left patron saint of masks mandates and mind control. But the takedown didn't take. So now some mysterious group released a supercut of Joe saying he N word over a decade or so. Probably matching what previous Democrat senators and presidents would say the one afternoon. The fact that the montage was released after Spotify stuck with Rogan tells you it's less about the word and more about canning Joe. He's apologized sincerely. But we all know, like me watching the first Magic Mike movie, that will never be enough. The N word is being used as a tool. They're getting desperate. They want Rogan destroyed. I wonder what the angry black male has to say.",

Yes, Joe Rogan said the N word. Hail he even said it was hard as are. A bunch of times on a podcast. And yes, it pissed me off when I first saw it. So, very clever woke. But you kind of left out a few things like it was 12 years ago. Nobody cares what he said 12 years ago. Hell, you didn't. Where were you then? I'll wait for response. But we know that will fall on deaf ears. Maybe it's time you stop using us African- Americans to do your dirty work and fight your battles. Now I get it. You use your favorite little words to get us fired up. Racist, systemic, critical. And your new favorite word, misinformation. And that'll get us fired up. And we won't even look at the facts of the whatnots. And we'll just jump in and cancel away with you. Your fight with Joe Rogan was about COVID. But you were losing that conversation. So you needed something else. And you went break to the good old book playbook. But you went one too many times. How about this. Fight Joe Rogan yourself? Leave us out of it? Look, the N word is bad. I learned as meaning at four years old. That was the first time I was called a (BLEEP) by a family member. And I've been called it enough times in my life to where I pretty much consider myself an expert on it. Now, I know there's going to be a news flash to you woke. But us blacks we understand the word context. Joe Rogan should keep that word out his mouth. Hell, everyone should. He said it then. But you're saying it now. For no other reason to cancel them and you can't compete with. And you know what? That sounds racist to me, because that's usually when I was called it. I was winning the argument. So you had to pull that out of your bag of tricks, because you couldn't compete. I think you just told on your woke cells. Now, I just may be in a (BLEEP) but that sounds a lot like and I'll use one of your words. Misinformation.",

And I think if people really want to talk about racial issues in America, the issue is not Joe Rogan. The issue is a mere lock in the Minneapolis Police Department, the killing of black men by police.

But she says it's not only classic flirting technique, it makes you more attractive. Yes, that works, especially to confused Golden Retrievers. So, also show off your thumb. The expert says keeping your thumbs in view is an attractive trait that models have used for years. Yes, that's what I call science -- we looked at models. It works especially well when you tuck your hands in your pockets and leave your thumbs hanging out. Jonas Salk has nothing on this lady. Also, do the backward glance. Look at that. A simple over the shoulder glance as you walk away makes you look sexier and cooler. Just like you read. I can't even read that joke now. I'm so pissed off at this segment. Keep going. Now, the don'ts. Don't cross your legs at the ankles because according to the body language expert, it lacks sex appeal. Also, it shows where you've been duct taped. Don't cross your arms. And whatever you do, don't go put your hands on your hips apparently that makes you look like you're up for a fight or your salsa dancing. Now, in my opinion this is all BS. If you're good looking, it doesn't matter what you do with your thumb. And if you're ugly uncrossing your arms won't help. So, what do I do? I just make a suit out of money. Look at that.

You know ever since this show began in the early 70s, as a summer replacement for the Brady Bunch, we were on top of one trend, canceled culture. The idea being if your past isn't adaptable to current standards, you would lose your friends social status, Netflix password and career. You'd be shunned from polite society. It's kindred spirit was wokeism, political correctness on more steroids than Lance Armstrong, which allowed no forgiveness relating not just to your past actions, but to who you are. Generally, it's things that can't be changed, like your race, or Pete Davidson's bed sheets. In the world of the woke, you're either oppressed or the oppressor and the offenses only flow in one direction. Suddenly, we no longer measure anyone by achievement, but by victim status, which creates a new kind of segregation that's now spreading like Omicron in the Olympic Village. I call it idea segregation, and that we cannot share our knowledge, wisdom or ideas If we're not of the same tribe. Now we see this with crime. This show has been blaring about rising crime, like the alarm in a broken Nord Strom's window. But the people who need to hear it won't listen, because it's coming from us. It's the Fox crying wolf. They'd rather drown in raw sewage than grab a life preserver from us Metis. And I get it. It affects all issues from the border, to crime to COVID. It's a division of ideas, and none shall mix. Now imagine if this kind of thing existed before we had a chance to make things. Like did you ever wonder about how a pencil is made? Milton Friedman has. I certainly hope we have some grainy footage of him lying around. We can play right now."

To make the saw, it took steel, to make the steel, it took iron ore. This black center, we call it lead but it's really graphite, compressed graphite. I'm not sure where it comes from, but I think it comes from some mines in South America. This red top up here, the eraser, that a rubber probably comes from Malaya where the rubber tree isn't even native. It was imported from South America by some businessmen with the help of the British government. This brass ferrule, I haven't the slightest idea where it came from, or the yellow paint, or the paint and made the black lines are the glue that holds it together. Literally , thousands of people cooperated to make this pencil."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "Someone likes his weed. So the moral is obvious. It's not like one person sits in a room and makes a pencil. As the lady in the pantsuit once said, it takes a village. Now you can use that pencil to write whatever you want, or to gouge your eyes out if you're watching The View. But this is the case for everything we use today. It's the division of labor, which is not referring to twins being born more than 30 minutes apart, Kat. This clipboard right here, the chair I'm in, Kat's hair extensions, they all likely weren't made by a single entity but a cooperation of sources, workers, ideas, and of course labor from people who never even met each other. I wish that was how this show was produced. Imagine if wokeism existed before the pencil was made. Could the division of labor exist? Think of the micro and macro aggressions. Why does the pencil have to be yellow? Why isn't it black? Are you black? Do you have enough transgendered persons of color making the erasers? What's with the lead? Talk about a carbon footprint. And why number two? Why can't they all be equal? Fact is, nothing would happen because wokeism prevents cooperation needed for any shared labor. It wouldn't just be pencils, but everything you use. You have to work together whether you like it or not. And sometimes, you know, we have no choice. Take the Alec Baldwin tragedy. If there was an idea segregation that woman could be alive today because there would have been an NRA instructor on set and that's cooperation, idea sharing. Sure Baldwin, a Democrat might not like the instructor's politics but he's not there for that. He's there to share his safety expertise. And then an NRA dude would have kept a loaded gun out of Baldwin's hands. Idea segregation prevents that. Wokeism demands you can't benefit from a person's expertise if they're not like you. The political is now personal. Sure. You're having engine problems with your car and your brother in law is a great mechanic but he's got a Back the Blue sticker on his truck, screw it, you'll just walk home. So now to Joe Rogan. There's likely no person on earth who's doing more dismantle idea segregation than him. The roster of his guests are more diverse than the Olympic opening ceremonies. And they're allowed to speak endlessly about whatever, so the listener can decide. It's the antidote to cable T.V. where shows rely on the same people who say the same things over and over again. I mean, look at this show. You get 42 minutes of content divided by five segments, and five talking heads. No wonder I'm on drugs. And no wonder CNN hates Rogan. He's widening the universe as they shrink it. At first, the legacy media tried to take him down with his COVID content. He had doctors on who disagreed with Fauci, the left patron saint of masks mandates and mind control. But the takedown didn't take. So now some mysterious group released a supercut of Joe saying he N word over a decade or so. Probably matching what previous Democrat senators and presidents would say the one afternoon. The fact that the montage was released after Spotify stuck with Rogan tells you it's less about the word and more about canning Joe. He's apologized sincerely. But we all know, like me watching the first Magic Mike movie, that will never be enough. The N word is being used as a tool. They're getting desperate. They want Rogan destroyed. I wonder what the angry black male has to say."

But you kind of left out a few things like it was 12 years ago. Nobody cares what he said 12 years ago. Hell, you didn't. Where were you then? I'll wait for response. But we know that will fall on deaf ears. Maybe it's time you stop using us African- Americans to do your dirty work and fight your battles. Now I get it. You use your favorite little words to get us fired up. Racist, systemic, critical. And your new favorite word, misinformation. And that'll get us fired up. And we won't even look at the facts of the whatnots. And we'll just jump in and cancel away with you. Your fight with Joe Rogan was about COVID. But you were losing that conversation. So you needed something else. And you went break to the good old book playbook. But you went one too many times. How about this. Fight Joe Rogan yourself? Leave us out of it? Look, the N word is bad. I learned as meaning at four years old. That was the first time I was called a (BLEEP) by a family member. And I've been called it enough times in my life to where I pretty much consider myself an expert on it. Now, I know there's going to be a news flash to you woke. But us blacks we understand the word context. Joe Rogan should keep that word out his mouth. Hell, everyone should. He said it then. But you're saying it now. For no other reason to cancel them and you can't compete with. And you know what? That sounds racist to me, because that's usually when I was called it. I was winning the argument. So you had to pull that out of your bag of tricks, because you couldn't compete. I think you just told on your woke cells.

But it says I'm triple vaxxed but unless they're standing for hate or calling for violence, banning someone's podcast is too much like burning a book to me.

And I think all of us are having to find that place where we want to passionately say what we believe, but also be somewhat careful. So I think Joe Rogan, I agree with what you said, I believe that he was honest and sincere and his apologies. I believe that the angry black man tape that we just heard, I think there's context. And I think if people really want to talk about racial issues in America, the issue is not Joe Rogan. The issue is a mere lock in the Minneapolis Police Department, the killing of black men by police. Americans needing to ask ourselves, if we're supporting the Saudi government in a genocidal war in Yemen, would we be willing to do that if those people in Yemen were white? There are serious issues of race to talk about right now. Joe Rogan is not one of them."

But the thing that drives me crazy really quick, is I'm so sick of this idea that comedians and even podcast hosts like Rogan who's also a comedian should be subjected to the same standards of languages like elected officials.

The reality here is that nobody can actually be pure enough to withstand the constantly shifting mechanism of who gets cancelled. And on the comedian front, by the way. I think a lot of people have gone super woke because they're afraid if they don't. They need to create a kind of insurance policy for themselves. Jimmy Kimmel as Karl Malone, Howard Stern as a whole bunch of things back in the day, different sketches and things that were done. When you look at the reason realities of who is getting canceled and who's not, all that matters right now is that the left-wing apparatus wanted to silence Joe Rogan and they found a reason.

Initially, the company froze the nearly 10 million bucks in donations saying law enforcement convinced them the convoy had become unlawful. Unlike the very peaceful Seattle writers that GoFundMe had no problem helping in 2020, where there were multiple cases of assault, homicide and severe body odor. But I guess after the public heard about GoFundMe's shady plan, they're now refunding all donations automatically. Even the ones in Canadian money, which I've learned is just colored Maple Leaves. That's true. So, not only is the protest continuing on Sunday, Big Rigs blocked streets as Ottawa declared a state of emergency. Spreading everywhere like brown makeup across Justin Trudeau's face. Truckers in the Netherlands they have them there, England, New Zealand, Australia all hitting the road with the same demand stop the mandates. Meanwhile, Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams is defending a photo of an -- of opposing unmasked, alongside masked schoolchildren. Now this is the same person who called Georgia Governor Brian Kemp incompetent for trying to block mask mandates last summer.

But she says it's not only classic flirting technique, it makes you more attractive. Yes, that works, especially to confused Golden Retrievers. So, also show off your thumb. The expert says keeping your thumbs in view is an attractive trait that models have used for years. Yes, that's what I call science -- we looked at models. It works especially well when you tuck your hands in your pockets and leave your thumbs hanging out. Jonas Salk has nothing on this lady. Also, do the backward glance. Look at that. A simple over the shoulder glance as you walk away makes you look sexier and cooler. Just like you read. I can't even read that joke now. I'm so pissed off at this segment. Keep going. Now, the don'ts. Don't cross your legs at the ankles because according to the body language expert, it lacks sex appeal. Also, it shows where you've been duct taped. Don't cross your arms. And whatever you do, don't go put your hands on your hips apparently that makes you look like you're up for a fight or your salsa dancing. Now, in my opinion this is all BS.
