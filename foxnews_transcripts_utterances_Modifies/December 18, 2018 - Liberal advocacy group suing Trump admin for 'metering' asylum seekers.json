      "sentences": "I'm Laura Ingraham. This is \"The Ingraham Angle\" from Washington tonight. I had the reporter who broke the news on that infamous Steele dossier used to surveil an ex-Trump aide. Carter Page calls its claims largely false. So, why the media is still hyping it. Plus, by spending their political capital, targeting the President, Could the incoming Democratic House leadership be helping a dangerous foreign power. Wow. Details in tonight's Angle, plus a special Christmas edition of seen and unseen later in the show. Raymond Arroyo is here to expose a city with no room for baby Jesus, as well as some of the most shocking toys flying off the shelves this season.  But we begin tonight with liberal activists, politicians and the media attacking American sovereignty. Now, it's important to know that the forces that oppose open debate on immigration. So, you've got to stay with me. Here first though, there are liberal advocacy groups siding with illegal immigrants over our own border agents. Overwhelmed by the crush of thousands of asylum seekers at the border, the Trump Administration has instituted a practice known as metering.  The procedure is meant to help alleviate the pressure on the border by limiting the number of asylum seekers allowed to enter the country each day, once they present themselves at a port of entry, seems kind of reasonable given the limited resources we have.  Well, not according to the advocacy group. Al Otro Lado, the activists legal aid group is slapping the Trump administration with a class action lawsuit over the practice. Melissa Crowe, an attorney with the Southern Poverty Law Center's Immigration Justice Project says, the goal is to get CBP to comply with a law, which requires them to process the asylum seekers at ports of entry. The law requires them to admit legitimate asylum seekers enter the country. Last fiscal year, immigration judges found that only about 9 percent of all those immigrants qualified as asylees. Despite that, the lies from the talking heads continue to pile up.",

Their goal to push for a greater number of asylum claims.   Well, imagine our surprise when we discovered that the group they partnered with is the same group suing the Trump Administration, Al Otro Lado. The third group guilty of manipulation though over the issue, the American media, using emotion over facts and honesty. Well, they purposely muddy all conversations related to immigration.

More on this, no wonder that in a new Gallup poll by the way, actual Americans point to immigration as the issue most important to them right behind our government. So, why are the activists, the politicians, the majority of the media listening to you. Here to debate Tom Homan, former Acting Director of ICE and a Fox News contributor and Lisa Johnson-Firth is a Principal of Immigration First and a professor of law at Georgetown University. It's good to have you both. Let's start with you, Professor. I understand that there is a great humanitarian story to be told here. There are thousands and thousands of people and indeed millions probably in Central America. I spent a lot of time in both Salvador and Guatemala and I know the people well. I know the place well. Beautiful countries, very corrupt.  But most of these aren't asylees. Most of these are economic migrants. And by - our own border patrol even during Obama, most of them are overwhelmingly rejected. So, why isn't the metering slowing this down, so we can process people in an orderly way. Why isn't that the right way to go?",

Trump's decision to have that. We're basically foreseeing a huge population to go through very small, entry points. And then the process of waiting, those people are subject to violence while they're waiting. I just interviewed a woman last week, who was raped while waiting at the border. She'd actually been gang-raped 60 times in her process of coming to the United States.   And so, I think we're increasing the danger. Obviously, some people will turn back.

I've been enforced immigration law about twice as long as you've been practicing. And I'm telling you most of these people are not legitimate asylum seekers. Violence is not a claim for asylum and 90 percent lose it.  What the politicians ought to be doing rather than pulling a political ploy that they're doing. They ought to be here in Washington DC fixing the loopholes in our immigration laws that causes these caravans even exist in the first place. I've been up on the Hill many times this past year with the secretary calls it - raise your asylum bar, address the foreign settlement agreement. Give ICE detention money, so it's not back to catch and release. If they close these loopholes, they will stop all this illegal immigration, but it isn't about protecting the border.

There were sources that were identified with enough specificity that they should have been able to figure out who they were.

      "utterance": "I'm Laura Ingraham. This is \"The Ingraham Angle\" from Washington tonight. I had the reporter who broke the news on that infamous Steele dossier used to surveil an ex-Trump aide. Carter Page calls its claims largely false. So, why the media is still hyping it. Plus, by spending their political capital, targeting the President, Could the incoming Democratic House leadership be helping a dangerous foreign power. Wow. Details in tonight's Angle, plus a special Christmas edition of seen and unseen later in the show. Raymond Arroyo is here to expose a city with no room for baby Jesus, as well as some of the most shocking toys flying off the shelves this season. But we begin tonight with liberal activists, politicians and the media attacking American sovereignty. Now, it's important to know that the forces that oppose open debate on immigration. So, you've got to stay with me. Here first though, there are liberal advocacy groups siding with illegal immigrants over our own border agents. Overwhelmed by the crush of thousands of asylum seekers at the border, the Trump Administration has instituted a practice known as metering. The procedure is meant to help alleviate the pressure on the border by limiting the number of asylum seekers allowed to enter the country each day, once they present themselves at a port of entry, seems kind of reasonable given the limited resources we have. Well, not according to the advocacy group. Al Otro Lado, the activists legal aid group is slapping the Trump administration with a class action lawsuit over the practice. Melissa Crowe, an attorney with the Southern Poverty Law Center's Immigration Justice Project says, the goal is to get CBP to comply with a law, which requires them to process the asylum seekers at ports of entry. The law requires them to admit legitimate asylum seekers enter the country. Last fiscal year, immigration judges found that only about 9 percent of all those immigrants qualified as asylees. Despite that, the lies from the talking heads continue to pile up."

Their goal to push for a greater number of asylum claims. Well, imagine our surprise when we discovered that the group they partnered with is the same group suing the Trump Administration, Al Otro Lado. The third group guilty of manipulation though over the issue, the American media, using emotion over facts and honesty. Well, they purposely muddy all conversations related to immigration.

I think the last surveys, 160 million people around the world had the hope or the dream to come to the country and most of those overwhelmingly want to follow the rule of law and they want to be part of the American experiment that includes law and order. More on this, no wonder that in a new Gallup poll by the way, actual Americans point to immigration as the issue most important to them right behind our government. So, why are the activists, the politicians, the majority of the media listening to you. Here to debate Tom Homan, former Acting Director of ICE and a Fox News contributor and Lisa Johnson-Firth is a Principal of Immigration First and a professor of law at Georgetown University. It's good to have you both. Let's start with you, Professor. I understand that there is a great humanitarian story to be told here. There are thousands and thousands of people and indeed millions probably in Central America. I spent a lot of time in both Salvador and Guatemala and I know the people well. I know the place well. Beautiful countries, very corrupt. But most of these aren't asylees. Most of these are economic migrants. And by - our own border patrol even during Obama, most of them are overwhelmingly rejected. So, why isn't the metering slowing this down, so we can process people in an orderly way. Why isn't that the right way to go?"

There are some of the most violent countries in the world. Gangs have as you noted taken over those countries are very corrupt and very dangerous. And so, I would say, I've been practicing immigration law for about 16 years, 10 years ago. Yes, I was seeing many more economic migrants. Now, I believe that I'm seeing in my caseload, true asylum seekers fleeing horrific gang violence."

But getting to the metering issue, when we are having people reports ports of entry rather than being able to cross the border wherever, which is obviously being challenged. Trump's decision to have that. We're basically foreseeing a huge population to go through very small, entry points. And then the process of waiting, those people are subject to violence while they're waiting. I just interviewed a woman last week, who was raped while waiting at the border. She'd actually been gang-raped 60 times in her process of coming to the United States. And so, I think we're increasing the danger. Obviously, some people will turn back. I think it is a way that the government is discouraging people from legitimately presenting asylum claims at the border that they're entitled to under U.S. law and under International law."

We know that that's already been proven. But politicians refuse to do what they need to do to make the system work. They refuse and then right now on capital, the light still on over there.

I've been enforced immigration law about twice as long as you've been practicing. And I'm telling you most of these people are not legitimate asylum seekers. Violence is not a claim for asylum and 90 percent lose it. What the politicians ought to be doing rather than pulling a political ploy that they're doing. They ought to be here in Washington DC fixing the loopholes in our immigration laws that causes these caravans even exist in the first place. I've been up on the Hill many times this past year with the secretary calls it - raise your asylum bar, address the foreign settlement agreement. Give ICE detention money, so it's not back to catch and release. If they close these loopholes, they will stop all this illegal immigration, but it isn't about protecting the border. It isn't about closing loopholes. It's about taking on the Trump Administration. It's about politics, head of public safety and national security."

I guess what is it $4.6 billion that came out today. I guess that's - and it looks like - they're not giving that money for nothing. That money is going.

These planes were for several planes we could on all three of those countries. Very few Mexicans claim asylum, so I don't agree with Mexico not being a safe place. Mexicans claim asylum for reasons. So again, we've got to get back to the basics of what's really going on here. These are people who want to come to this country for a better life. Can't blame for that now.

And now onto another story, you're not going to find covering on the other networks. Remember that infamous Steele dossier, that document that led to the surveillance of Trump campaign officials. Well, the reporter who actually broke the news of its existence revealed in a recent interview that it's probably all bunk. MICHAEL ISIKOFF, CHIEF INVESTIGATIVE CORRESPONDENT AT YAHOO!

Remember back, a month before the presidential election, Christopher Steele was desperate to stop Donald Trump and desperate to get the dossier into the press and he went to a bunch of reporters about a half a dozen. Michael Isikoff was one of those, but they didn't really bite on the whole thing. And it wasn't until the intelligence chiefs, remember that the Head of the FBI, the CIA, the NSA went up to Trump Tower on January 6th of 2017. Donald Trump is the President-elect. They go up there. They brief him on Russian efforts to interfere with the election and after that there is a one-on-one meeting with Comey and President-elect Trump and Comey tells him about that dossier story, about Trump being in a hotel room with prostitutes in Moscow. The dossier has played a key role. That was a key role in getting Trump and the FBI off to a very, very bad relationship. It's been a really important part of this Trump-Russia investigation."

Despite the fact that we know this dossier was phony from the beginning, Steele was the guy who brought it together with the help of Fusion GPS, Democrat firm, it wasn't - but he's like - well, the Republicans initially funded a long-debunked myth that was conveniently parroted for months and months and months. He is still parroting that."

      "speaker": "ANDY MCCARTHY, ASSISTANT U.S. ATTORNEY",
      "utterance": "Yes. Laura, a lot of the real anguish over this that people I think should feel is precisely that a lot of this stuff has been debunked. Byron has done reporting months ago that debunked you know this and that aspect of what we're talking about and what I would be - what I would be infuriated about if I were say, a FISA court judge or if I were the President for that matter, is that this material started to come into the FBI in July of 2016. They didn't go to the FISA court until October of 2016. And when I read the Steele dossier when it first became publicly available, what occurred to me is somebody who used to do this for a living, is there were a lot of details that should have been easy enough for the FBI to run down and corroborate. There were sources that were identified with enough specificity that they should have been able to figure out who they were. And in short order, understanding that this is - a lot of this is in Russia. But nevertheless, using Steele, who was working with the FBI, they should have been able to identify these people and figure out, yes, this happened or no, it didn't. And yet the incident that Byron just referred to where they go and brief Trump at Trump Towers. that's five months after this information started to come into the FBI and the thought that they hadn't corroborated it by then and yet they were using it as information that was worthy of briefing the President-elect is just astonishing to me."

For example, one of the big parts of the dossier has Michael Cohen, very close to President Trump or Donald - candidate Trump at the time going to Prague in Europe and meeting with Russians and agreeing on a payoff in which the Trump campaign would pay the Russians for all the hacking they were doing, helping the Trump campaign.

Thousands of U.S. companies moved overseas for cheaper production, all ushered in under the banner of globalization. Gone where most American made products from textiles to toys to televisions.

Movie posters redesigned. Previews edited. All to please their communist business partners. Now ironically, the Hollywood crowd claims to be vigilant guardians of artistic expression and they give tedious speeches at award shows about living your truth, all the while they avoid the inconvenient truth about how day in and day out China brutalizes dissidents both religious and political. The AP is reporting that a million Muslims are housed in internment camps in China. At one facility, they're forced to make clothing that despite being a violation of U.S. law has made its way to an American sportswear supplier. And this Christmas season, I ask you to remember what's happening to China's estimated 100 million Christians. House church pastors and underground bishops are arrested for being threats to the state. Churches are bulldozed, crosses ripped off steeples. Parishioners are forced to celebrate in secret. And there are reports that the regime is subjective Falun Gong members to forced organ harvesting. The Khashoggi murder murdered by the Saudis is still making news and Trump is faulted for his response. But there is no equivalent media coverage or condemnation of China for its widespread ongoing horrific human rights violations.

This from \"The Hill\" today. \"The tariffs have contributed to growth both directly and indirectly in the four main areas where tariffs were imposed -- steel, aluminum, solar panels, and washing machines. The U.S. has directly added more than 11,000 jobs as of August. Since then, more investments and jobs have been announced, including a massive $1.5 billion steel plant by Steel Dynamics that will employ some 600 workers. And in the solar arena, \"Solar Power World\" magazine lists more than a dozen U.S. companies where new facilities have been started and/or expanded.\" Good stuff. Only the United States, my friends, has the economic and moral might to keep China's global ambitions in check. And as Xi continues his ruthless consolidation of power along with aggressive global expansion, both parties need to consider this question -- will you support policies that strengthen the hand of a murderous communist regime in China, or the policies that ensure a prosperous, strong, independent America? It's a time for choosing. And that's the ANGLE. Joining me now is Michael Pillsbury, director of the Center for Chinese Strategy at the Hudson Institute, author of the phenomenal book \"The Hundred-Year Marathon.\" So Mike, how big a threat are the globalist who are clearly annoyed by the president's $200 billion tariffs, only 10, 15 percentage points on that, but they want those gone and they want to go back to regular order where China was continued to grow at the pace it was growing, eight, nine percent a year."

All right, court is in session. I love doing that. This is actually my gavel. The first case is a South Carolina inmate serving a life sentence for a 2013 murder, suing the prison system for violating his constitutional rights. Prisoner James Rose says they unlawfully required him to shave his dreadlocks and refused to let him smoke marijuana. He claims it should all be allowed as part of a Rastafarian religious practice. Those are the facts. Jamil, you have 30, 40 or seconds to lay out your case, followed by a rebuttal. Jamil."

The Constitution has protections for the free exercise of religion. We have a constitutional requirement against the establishment of religion. At the same time, Congress has gone even further and have written specific protections for prisoners in our prisons, whether state or federal prisons. At the same time, that doesn't give you the right to use in illegal drug and require the state to pay for it, which is what he's demanding. His dreadlocks, a debatable issue. The Supreme Court a few years back cited a case saying that a Muslim could keep his beard. That may be a protected religious right. The idea, though, the state has to pay for your marijuana and let you smoke it in prison, ridiculous."

      "utterance": "I agree that if you can't smoke marijuana outside of the prison, then you can't smoke marijuana in the prison. But where I probably disagree is on the cutting of the dreadlocks. If it's true, as he says in his complaint, that they held him down forcibly and cut his dreadlocks, then that is cruel and unusual punishment, punishment that is unnecessarily degrading, punishment that is in violation of your religion. It's something that should not happen in the prison system. What they are not supposed to do is you make a person who's mad already, like a security guard, make them mad by asking for marijuana, and then instead of them responding no, you can't have marijuana, they tie you down and cut your hair when they know that's part of your religious practice. I think that's unacceptable."

    {
      "speaker": "JAFFER",
      "utterance": "Right, although Congress did pass this law that gave additional rights to prisoners. And as a result the courts have now been implementing that law. And so Congress made the decision to give prisoners more rights.  Whether Congress should have made that law or should change it or not is a different question. I'd say we probably agree on the dreadlocks. The marijuana, we appear to agree, too, that which it's crazy to think that you're going to be allowed to use illegal drugs and have the state pay for it. It just makes no sense, and I think he's out."

      "utterance": "There's no argument. If you are, unfortunately, in an incarcerated situation, you don't have the same level of constitutional rights as you would if you were outside of the prison system. However, I still feel strongly that where the dreads are concerned, it's different even than the Shabazz case you mentioned in that this is a religious observation that you don't have to accommodate by making for a special service. You don't have to give a special time. It doesn't interrupt the normal flow in the prison. So there was no reason for them to violate him in that manner."

A group of Asian-American education advocates are suing him for making changes to an admission policy for specialized schools that they claim discriminates against Asian-American students. The mayor's plan would phase out testing and double the offers to black and Hispanic students at these schools. Monique, you've got 60 seconds here.

Instead this is antiracism. This is antiracism in that they are trying to level the playing field. These are the poorest schools in New York City who were getting opportunity to go to the best schools in New York City. And all New Yorkers should want that to happen. Now, what they don't mention, actually, in this op-ed is that Asian- Americans could also be included in the number from those particular schools who then get to attend the better schools."

This just demonstrates the problem with race-based policy. When we start thinking about race as a core factor in our consideration rather than merit-based issues. And look, the reality is we have a real problem this country. We do not give everybody an equal opportunity. It's largely an issue of economics.  Whether it's rural folks in America, white Americans in rural areas or people in the inner city, we do not give people an equal shot at education.  But the answer is not fix it in high school. The answer is go address the problem down at its root causes. Instead we try to make up for later and say we'll discriminate against the model minority, right, Asian in this case, right, in favor of other minorities. That is a crazy approach to this problem."
