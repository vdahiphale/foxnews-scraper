      "sentences": "Hi, I am Greg Gutfeld with Emily Compagno, Juan Williams, Jesse Watters, and in an oven mitt, it's her sleeping bag, Dana Perino, THE FIVE. Sorry, media. It looks like Iran hates its own government more than it hates us. Instead of burning U.S. flags, what did you see at Sunday's protests in Iran over its government shooting down that airliner? A bunch of Iranians refusing to act the way our media wished they would. Demonstrators refused to walk on American and Israeli flags while others attacked images of General Soleimani. Yes, as much as they were expected to despise those two countries, it seems they loathe the revolutionary guard much more.  Video also showed government forces firing live ammo at the protesters. Media outrage here seems at a low end, though. They're still too busy complaining about Trump tweeting mean things about them. Yet in Iran, people who speak out endure bullets. Yet in America, the outrage is over memes. But also the Oscars, why no best director for little women, poor Greta, I blame Trump.  Meanwhile, yet another media narrative implodes. We now learn that Trump authorized the killing of Soleimani seven months ago. Talk about impulsive, erratic, and unstable. Trump only waited seven months to take the guy out? Clearly, he is a maniac, crazy on blood lust. Where is the 25th Amendment when you need it?  So once again, the media lies to you about everything. They painted Soleimani as a folk hero, not true. And they repeat the lie that Trump was acting irrationally, part of the madmen persona they helped fabricate. It's not true either. Only in America can our media get everything so wrong and still see themselves as the good guys. I guess that's the only way they can look in the mirror without throwing up. Welcome back, Dana, from your, quote, \"tennis camp,\" unquote.",

I bet the people that came out to mourn Soleimani were people that were backed by the Iranian regime. And it is funny that the media has taken the same perspective as the Iranian regime. Think about it. They mourned Soleimani, both of us. And then they blamed Trump for shooting down the airline, both the American media and the Iranian regime.  And then they said that the street protests, oh no, those street protestors -- lots of reasons for people to be on the street, maybe somewhere shopping, maybe they were just out getting a breath of fresh air. But that fundamentally misunderstands the threat of protesting in Iran. You can get put to death if you chant death to ayatollah, which they were doing. It doesn't take any bravery to chant death to Trump, down with America. It's an evil empire. Everybody does that over there. And they're doing that because they get paid to do it. Now, when Trump goes in there and takes out a bad guy without having to pay a bribe, with no American casualties, 9 out of 10 Americans give the guy a round of applause.  Only the media creates a scandal over Trump killing a terrorist. How many terrorists did Barack Obama take out in the Taliban? How many generals in Libya across the Middle East? He didn't have his guys go on the Sunday shows the next weekend telling the media, oh, here is the documentary evidence that he had that he was planning an imminent attack.  He didn't have to do that because the media didn't demand he do that. Soleimani's in business to kill Americans. His job for the last three decades is to plot attacks against Americans and our allies. We don't need a specific piece of raw intelligence saying, oh, he is about to kill an American. It's what he does for a living. So we killed him first, and there is nothing scandalous about that at all.",

Because the protests became inconvenient for the left and inconvenient for our media, because up until then, the Iranians were used as a tool for both of those entities when it was an anti-Trump vehicle for them.   They were able to further that message. And these are people allegedly who cared deeply about democracy and freedom and those tenets. And yet all of a sudden, they are mute, when as you said not two months ago, up to 1500 citizens were murdered for protesting increase in gas prices. These protesters are out there literally risking their lives because they are saying death to the supreme leader. And they're saying specifically Trump is not the problem. Soleimani is. The Iranian government is. They are literally blowing open the sham and the bullying to let that light in. And there have been crickets from both the left and the mainstream media. Final point, this -- the foreign threat and the regime and the terror state that Iran is, that is a bipartisan threat. And the most dangerous thing we can all do to ourselves, because believe me, all bleed the same, is to politicize.

It looks like Iran hates its own government more than it hates us. Instead of burning U.S. flags, what did you see at Sunday's protests in Iran over its government shooting down that airliner? A bunch of Iranians refusing to act the way our media wished they would. Demonstrators refused to walk on American and Israeli flags while others attacked images of General Soleimani. Yes, as much as they were expected to despise those two countries, it seems they loathe the revolutionary guard much more. Video also showed government forces firing live ammo at the protesters. Media outrage here seems at a low end, though. They're still too busy complaining about Trump tweeting mean things about them. Yet in Iran, people who speak out endure bullets. Yet in America, the outrage is over memes. But also the Oscars, why no best director for little women, poor Greta, I blame Trump. Meanwhile, yet another media narrative implodes. We now learn that Trump authorized the killing of Soleimani seven months ago. Talk about impulsive, erratic, and unstable. Trump only waited seven months to take the guy out? Clearly, he is a maniac, crazy on blood lust. Where is the 25th Amendment when you need it? So once again, the media lies to you about everything. They painted Soleimani as a folk hero, not true. And they repeat the lie that Trump was acting irrationally, part of the madmen persona they helped fabricate. It's not true either. Only in America can our media get everything so wrong and still see themselves as the good guys. I guess that's the only way they can look in the mirror without throwing up. Welcome back, Dana, from your, quote, \"tennis camp,\" unquote."

They want their talents and they want their brains, but they don't respect their hearts. And so you see this in Hong Kong, Venezuela, Iraq, Lebanon, now Iran. We will get to that. And you think about the Arab Spring. There are these movements and then they get snuffed out. And then you think about Venezuela, for example, so we kind of help but then we can't do it all."

      "utterance": "Yes. Thank you for that. Jesse, I get the feeling that maybe Iran wasn't as overjoyed or in love with Soleimani as our media told us. JESSE WATTERS, CO-HOST Yeah. I bet the people that came out to mourn Soleimani were people that were backed by the Iranian regime. And it is funny that the media has taken the same perspective as the Iranian regime. Think about it. They mourned Soleimani, both of us. And then they blamed Trump for shooting down the airline, both the American media and the Iranian regime. And then they said that the street protests, oh no, those street protestors -- lots of reasons for people to be on the street, maybe somewhere shopping, maybe they were just out getting a breath of fresh air. But that fundamentally misunderstands the threat of protesting in Iran. You can get put to death if you chant death to ayatollah, which they were doing. It doesn't take any bravery to chant death to Trump, down with America. It's an evil empire. Everybody does that over there. And they're doing that because they get paid to do it. Now, when Trump goes in there and takes out a bad guy without having to pay a bribe, with no American casualties, 9 out of 10 Americans give the guy a round of applause. Only the media creates a scandal over Trump killing a terrorist. How many terrorists did Barack Obama take out in the Taliban? How many generals in Libya across the Middle East? He didn't have his guys go on the Sunday shows the next weekend telling the media, oh, here is the documentary evidence that he had that he was planning an imminent attack. He didn't have to do that because the media didn't demand he do that. Soleimani's in business to kill Americans. His job for the last three decades is to plot attacks against Americans and our allies. We don't need a specific piece of raw intelligence saying, oh, he is about to kill an American. It's what he does for a living. So we killed him first, and there is nothing scandalous about that at all."

The idea that somehow Democrats are to be, as Trump was today, putting Schumer and Pelosi in this picture with the Arab -- at the Iranian -- this is a vile thing that somehow Democrats don't go after terrorists or hate on people like Soleimani. Every Democrat has made a clear statement. Soleimani was a bad guy. And then finally, that NBC then says, oh, yeah, seven months ago, he gave the authorization that if you have a shot, OK. So then Trump comes out and says what difference does it make if I had information about an imminent attack. The defense secretary says I never saw any evidence of an imminent attack. Trump says that Laura Ingraham, oh, there were four embassies -- this guy is making stuff up. And you guys are just running around, like, anything he does is just fine."

And a door is opening for actually some new dialogue that had been blocked, obstructed by the guy who is now dead, Soleimani."

      "speaker": "EMILY COMPAGNO, GUEST CO-HOST",
      "utterance": "Yes, I agree. And I want to speak to just the perspective of the left and the mainstream media on these protests. Because the protests became inconvenient for the left and inconvenient for our media, because up until then, the Iranians were used as a tool for both of those entities when it was an anti-Trump vehicle for them. They were able to further that message. And these are people allegedly who cared deeply about democracy and freedom and those tenets. And yet all of a sudden, they are mute, when as you said not two months ago, up to 1500 citizens were murdered for protesting increase in gas prices. These protesters are out there literally risking their lives because they are saying death to the supreme leader. And they're saying specifically Trump is not the problem. Soleimani is. The Iranian government is. They are literally blowing open the sham and the bullying to let that light in. And there have been crickets from both the left and the mainstream media. Final point, this -- the foreign threat and the regime and the terror state that Iran is, that is a bipartisan threat. And the most dangerous thing we can all do to ourselves, because believe me, all bleed the same, is to politicize. So I really hope the left gets in gear and starts viewing this from an American perspective rather than an anti-Trump perspective."

So the second thing to say here is once that you get a sense of Donald Trump jumping in, he has been, just today, delighting in the idea that Sanders is taking on Warren. Warren is this and that, because he is the incumbent. The incumbent has an advantage. He can stay there and take these pot shots. But you know what? That dynamic changes once there is a Democratic nominee. Democrats, as much as they've been trailing in terms of fund-raising to President Trump's campaign, you know the overall fundraising to the Democrats is about on par, and it looks to me like Democrats are fired up to take out Trump."

And just because she's more liberal than Hillary doesn't make her free -- you know off the market for attacking. And I think he has that luxury of being the furthest left in the top tier. So he is going to use his ideology as a weapon on issues, substantively and then also of character, right, just like he did with Hillary. You have your Goldman Sachs speeches, and Elizabeth Warren, you've done your corporate work and whatnot.

And he is still there. But it never mattered if he was going to leave or go, because they wanted to punch daddy, because he is so mean to them. We have to ask ourselves, as Americans, are we OK with a government who use their office to exact an emotional tantrum. We paid for this tantrum. How much of that tantrum cost on lost work and wages, all the drama. The bright side, though is for America, Trump is still in power, kicking ass with one of the greatest economies in world history. And the media and the Democrats got what they wanted, which was an emotional payback, so it's kind of a win-win. On a separate note, I cannot get my shoes out of the Peloton Bike."

It's just so that we can have this label put on it. And I think the big issue facing Democrats and her now is the fact that this entire gambit has run out of steam. And we saw that even at the height of their impeachment growing, we saw that the polls reflected that the Americans were exhausted by it. They were uninterested in it. And now, even more so, we have the situation in Iran. We have the Iowa caucuses coming just right around the corner. People do not care about this. And for some reason, it's just like -- remember Spidey (ph) in L.A. who -- they would continue to insert themselves because they wanted to stay relevant.

He is nominating a hell of a lot of judges. And this has got a great economy, outflanked among trade and wages, that's why they are so mad. They're hysterical. This whole impeachment thing was just a backup plan because Mueller failed. And then this failed because they did it all in the dark. Once it saw the light of day, everyone said, OK, never mind, let's move on. If you think about what she says, it's so predictable. Give me everything I want. No, you're guilty of a cover-up. That's obstruction. But he released the transcripts, the most transparent thing you could do. And if you start asking questions to her, hey, what about the whistleblower or where's Hunter?

He's probably one of the greatest Conservative minds of the last 50, 60 years. In his final years, he was unfairly attacked by the New Statesman, which was a magazine. God, it has nearly ruined his career. And then Douglas Murray helped clear his name. He was just a tremendous person. I would urge you to check out maybe How to be a Conservative and the other book, The Meaning of Conservatism, or the Soul of the World is another book. But there's so many books and he's just an amazing person. He will be missed. Jesse."
