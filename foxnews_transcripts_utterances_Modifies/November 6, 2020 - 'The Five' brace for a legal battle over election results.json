      "sentences": "Hello, everyone. I'm Juan Williams along with Dagen McDowell, Jesse Watters, Dana Perino, and Greg Gutfeld. It's 5 o'clock in New York City. This is The Five. Former vice president Joe Biden and his running mate, Senator Kamala Harris expected to speak tonight as Biden's lead in Pennsylvania, Nevada, and Georgia inched him closer to the presidency, but many states remain still too close to call.  President Trump not going down without a fight, he's ramping up his legal battles in multiple states and his campaign says the election is not over.  So where do the races stand in key battleground state?  Let's go to Bill Hemmer for more. Bill, you are at the billboard.",

      "sentences": "Yes. Hey, Juan, I said the one board where you work on that one. Here's what will work west to east. OK? In Nevada, court case come and going to be heard here in a matter of minutes, actually 5 o'clock East Coast time.  This number has actually increased for Joe Biden throughout the day. When we look at this thing and I go through these races, keep an eye on this number here, as the roll vote difference between Joe Biden and Donald Trump in all these states, so again, that lead has increased for Biden. Just pop on down here to Arizona, woke up earlier today, the difference was larger than 39,000, so it's come down in Donald Trump's favor.  At the moment Arizona has been called by a network, at 11 electoral votes but that number continues to decrease. Whether or not it's a difference here, a difference-maker is something that our decision desk does not think will happen.   In Pennsylvania, meanwhile, this is the difference. We went to bed last night, Donald Trump had a lead and throughout the morning here and throughout the afternoon, it kept increasing toward Joe Biden's favor. Why is that? Philadelphia. Another reason? Pittsburgh. They keep on counting votes and they keep adding from the Democratic tally to Joe Biden. Pop on down here to Georgia, check this out, Juan. Are you ready for this? This is Georgia, this is 2.4 million votes and 2.4. Five million votes cast in the state of Georgia. You're at 49.4 to 49.4. A difference of 1,544 votes. There will be a recount in Georgia, there are also going to be two hotly contested Senate races in that state. In all likelihood if it remains the way it is now, the fifth of January, so watch that.   In North Carolina, this seems to be pretty much where it has been now for several days, which means North Carolina in all likelihood will stay red. Why is that important? It's important for the White House in the race to 270 and it's also important for Thom Tillis, the Republican senator who seems to have fought off a challenge by the Democratic challenger Cal Cunningham.  So, given that, the U.S. Senate will be a hot focus, regardless of whether it's President Trump's second year or president-elect Joe Biden in January of 2021. Juan, back to you.",

This takes a little bit longer and it's also taking longer because some states were used to mail-in ballots and they have to figure out a way to count those. One of the problems for Pennsylvania or not problems -- one of the issues with how long it has taken in Pennsylvania is that they were not allowed under the law to start counting those mail-in ballots until election day, so that has taken until now, here we are on Friday.  I do think that the numbers for Joe Biden when you woke up this morning like, he took over the lead in Georgia, but that number that 49.4 percent to 49.4, think about how -- that just absolute -- to me, that encapsulates the entire year of 2020, the last four years.

Well, I'm sorry, you don't really inspire confidence after everything you've told us I guess for the past four years with the Russian collusion hoax, and trying to get us to believe that some poorly produced memes created by Russian botch for a couple hundred grand managed to get Trump  307 votes -- or 306 electoral votes, I can't remember --",

But the fact is, the fact is people do not have long-term memories anymore and don't remember it. And to Dana's point, they think everything should happen now. Relax, it's like a turkey. Set it and forget it. Right? You voted, let the process go. The good news is, if it's legal, Juan, I mean if it's a recount, it's legal. You don't have to worry about it, what you see everything is great, so let it happen and don't complain, because that other side, man, they put us through hell for four years with the Russian crap, you can wait a month for an actual recount, especially with these razor-thin margins.",

If this had been a normal election and on election night, the votes are in and Joe Biden is declared the winner, I think a lot of people in the country, the president included, would say hey, that's it, that's the race.  But that's not what happened. It took three days, possibly four days, and they're counting ballots and ballots and ballots in these Democrat precincts and they have chewed away at the president's lead and now they flipped the president's lead in all these states, I'm sorry, but a lot of people just feel like this has left a bitter taste in their mouth. They have a right to be suspicious, that's a valid emotion but that emotion doesn't necessarily change anything. I do understand how Democrats felt after 2000 in Florida, but now we are looking at five Floridas. We're looking at five or six states with really thin margins and dicey outcomes and at this point the president needs to win at least three recounts to even get to 270 or maybe tie it at 269.  It's just -- it's a really tough, uphill battle. You know, when you think about everything that they have thrown at this guy. I mean, you've tried everything. He spied on that campaign, you investigate him, you impeach him, you blame him for 200,000 American deaths in the home stretch, big tech and big media and all this money poured in and they just emptied the clip into this guy and he is still right there.",

And that's where he said sometimes democracy is messy and requires patient, which he hopes to get from campaign staffers and supporters. The Biden campaign is paying very close attention to the things President Trump is saying. Telling me that his remarks last night were desperate, baseless, and a sure sign he is losing. And the campaign is interpreting reports that President Trump has no plan to concede as meaning that he may not leave the White House by the time that the lease is up at the end of January, telling Fox, the U.S. government has a lot of experience removing trespassers from the White House grounds. The campaign is confident enough that they are on a glide path to 270 electoral votes that officials did not host, and on the record update about the way they see the map shaking out like they did yesterday and the day before.  Kamala Harris is still in town, she is set to speak first if tonight's event moves forward and there has been a noticeable increase in security around here.

That's what they did in terms of their recruitment, and that's why they have a much more diverse class this time around.",

Former vice president Joe Biden and his running mate, Senator Kamala Harris expected to speak tonight as Biden's lead in Pennsylvania, Nevada, and Georgia inched him closer to the presidency, but many states remain still too close to call. President Trump not going down without a fight, he's ramping up his legal battles in multiple states and his campaign says the election is not over. So where do the races stand in key battleground state? Let's go to Bill Hemmer for more. Bill, you are at the billboard."

      "speaker": "BILL HEMMER, FOX NEWS HOST",
      "utterance": "Yes. Hey, Juan, I said the one board where you work on that one. Here's what will work west to east. OK? In Nevada, court case come and going to be heard here in a matter of minutes, actually 5 o'clock East Coast time. This number has actually increased for Joe Biden throughout the day. When we look at this thing and I go through these races, keep an eye on this number here, as the roll vote difference between Joe Biden and Donald Trump in all these states, so again, that lead has increased for Biden. Just pop on down here to Arizona, woke up earlier today, the difference was larger than 39,000, so it's come down in Donald Trump's favor. At the moment Arizona has been called by a network, at 11 electoral votes but that number continues to decrease. Whether or not it's a difference here, a difference-maker is something that our decision desk does not think will happen. In Pennsylvania, meanwhile, this is the difference. We went to bed last night, Donald Trump had a lead and throughout the morning here and throughout the afternoon, it kept increasing toward Joe Biden's favor. Why is that? Philadelphia. Another reason? Pittsburgh. They keep on counting votes and they keep adding from the Democratic tally to Joe Biden. Pop on down here to Georgia, check this out, Juan. Are you ready for this? This is Georgia, this is 2.4 million votes and 2.4. Five million votes cast in the state of Georgia. You're at 49.4 to 49.4. A difference of 1,544 votes. There will be a recount in Georgia, there are also going to be two hotly contested Senate races in that state. In all likelihood if it remains the way it is now, the fifth of January, so watch that. In North Carolina, this seems to be pretty much where it has been now for several days, which means North Carolina in all likelihood will stay red. Why is that important? It's important for the White House in the race to 270 and it's also important for Thom Tillis, the Republican senator who seems to have fought off a challenge by the Democratic challenger Cal Cunningham. So, given that, the U.S. Senate will be a hot focus, regardless of whether it's President Trump's second year or president-elect Joe Biden in January of 2021. Juan, back to you."

This takes a little bit longer and it's also taking longer because some states were used to mail-in ballots and they have to figure out a way to count those. One of the problems for Pennsylvania or not problems -- one of the issues with how long it has taken in Pennsylvania is that they were not allowed under the law to start counting those mail-in ballots until election day, so that has taken until now, here we are on Friday. I do think that the numbers for Joe Biden when you woke up this morning like, he took over the lead in Georgia, but that number that 49.4 percent to 49.4, think about how -- that just absolute -- to me, that encapsulates the entire year of 2020, the last four years.

That they're serving our country but we're not counting your votes because it's not going to matter anyway, so the same people that were telling us for so long that this was going to be a landslide are now telling us not to bother, he already got it, there is no fraud, there is no nothing, everything is great. Well, I'm sorry, you don't really inspire confidence after everything you've told us I guess for the past four years with the Russian collusion hoax, and trying to get us to believe that some poorly produced memes created by Russian botch for a couple hundred grand managed to get Trump 307 votes -- or 306 electoral votes, I can't remember --"

Because remember, it's hard to remember Gore, Bush, was 20 years ago and that was over one state. Twenty years ago, I was in diapers. I was -- I was 35, but it was a fetish. But the fact is, the fact is people do not have long-term memories anymore and don't remember it. And to Dana's point, they think everything should happen now. Relax, it's like a turkey. Set it and forget it. Right? You voted, let the process go. The good news is, if it's legal, Juan, I mean if it's a recount, it's legal. You don't have to worry about it, what you see everything is great, so let it happen and don't complain, because that other side, man, they put us through hell for four years with the Russian crap, you can wait a month for an actual recount, especially with these razor-thin margins."

It took three days, possibly four days, and they're counting ballots and ballots and ballots in these Democrat precincts and they have chewed away at the president's lead and now they flipped the president's lead in all these states, I'm sorry, but a lot of people just feel like this has left a bitter taste in their mouth. They have a right to be suspicious, that's a valid emotion but that emotion doesn't necessarily change anything. I do understand how Democrats felt after 2000 in Florida, but now we are looking at five Floridas. We're looking at five or six states with really thin margins and dicey outcomes and at this point the president needs to win at least three recounts to even get to 270 or maybe tie it at 269. It's just -- it's a really tough, uphill battle. You know, when you think about everything that they have thrown at this guy. I mean, you've tried everything. He spied on that campaign, you investigate him, you impeach him, you blame him for 200,000 American deaths in the home stretch, big tech and big media and all this money poured in and they just emptied the clip into this guy and he is still right there."

That margin has been steadily narrowing and the Trump campaign believes that there are still enough votes, given the percentage in the splits of the votes that are coming in to hands the Grand Canyon state to the president. It looks like they are becoming resigned to the idea that Georgia and Pennsylvania are gone, so now it's up to the recount, we expect that sometime in the next couple of days there is going to be a call, and then it's up to them to duke it out in court.

I think that's the appropriate recourse. But I also think that you've got to keep in mind a lot of this heated rhetoric, Dana, that's been coming out like the president's speech last night, I'm not sure that it's very helpful to the president's case because you've got to project some sense of confidence to the American people. And right now, I think it's just leading to the kind of harassment and name-calling towards state, local elected officials, people who are conducting the polling and the count of the vote and I just think again, it's just -- it's just not good.

We heard that, that he is going to take the reins from Steve Mnuchin because Nancy Pelosi has egg and something else all over her face and her fancy faith for dragging them and not pushing through stimulus that the American people need.

You don't need widespread fraud, right? You just need like isolated spots of incompetence, isolated spots of illegality. Tiny things where it matters, right? So why not look for it? Why not look for it? Check to see if it's there, and if it's not there, it's not there. Because we're going to have to deal this sooner or later in the next election with mail-in voting probably becoming more prevalent. We have to -- we have to -- we should actually investigate this stuff just so we are comfortable with the system if we are suspicious. And I go back to my initial point from yesterday. Everybody has the right to be suspicious. Right? When you brand somebody a Nazi, why wouldn't you cheat to beat the Nazi? If I believed Dagan was a Nazi, I would do everything in my power to get rid of her. So, you had an entire party that had labeled Trump supporters and Trump himself as a Nazi, of course they're going to cheat. Why wouldn't you? You have the moral imperative. So that's what I said yesterday. It's that's like, I -- I would do -- I would do -- I would pull out all the stuff and I have a feeling that's what they are doing. So, just logic."

Remember the last time they accused the president of engaging in a massive conspiracy to collude with Russia to interfere in that election. I'm thinking things are a little fishy too. It's just a feeling. The president's team has to go out and they have to present specific evidence, whether that's testimony, whether that's from a whistle-blower, video evidence to prove in court that enough votes were changed to affect the outcome of the race. But at this point, I can see the Democrats thinking they hit pay dirt with mail-ins. I feel like they're just going to try to expand the mail-in situation going forward in the next election. So, we have to get our hands around what the rules are for these things, the deadline, the timing, because you can't continue to find out who wins the White House four two days after the vote comes in.

Even though there's been no final call yet, Biden campaign staffers tell me that on a conference call this morning, hire ups were telling Biden staffers to enjoy this moment. And at this moment Joe Biden remains at home. That's where we have seen him all day, we haven't seen or heard from him since yesterday's a minute and 45-second long speech. And that's where he said sometimes democracy is messy and requires patient, which he hopes to get from campaign staffers and supporters. The Biden campaign is paying very close attention to the things President Trump is saying. Telling me that his remarks last night were desperate, baseless, and a sure sign he is losing. And the campaign is interpreting reports that President Trump has no plan to concede as meaning that he may not leave the White House by the time that the lease is up at the end of January, telling Fox, the U.S. government has a lot of experience removing trespassers from the White House grounds. The campaign is confident enough that they are on a glide path to 270 electoral votes that officials did not host, and on the record update about the way they see the map shaking out like they did yesterday and the day before. Kamala Harris is still in town, she is set to speak first if tonight's event moves forward and there has been a noticeable increase in security around here. There's also been a noticeable increase in the number of curious locals who are walking up to the Secret Service men, sticking their phone through, trying to get a look at the set where Biden may speak tonight."

Nothing has changed from yesterday to today except for we have -- you know, we don't have any additional race calls. Now, I imagine when they announced that there was going to be an evening speech, that they probably thought this thing was going to be projected as a win for them and that they would present themselves as president and vice president-elect.

The problem with the Dems is they're kind of -- they're being held hostage by a delusion. The delusion is that they think that this small cadre of woke social justice warriors actually matter because they're so loud on Twitter.

And they look at the results that defund the police didn't play, socialism didn't play, and they actually blame the voters. They say, you guys stick - - you guys all have that friend, right? You go to the bar with the guy, and he tries to hit on girls and gets rejected every time. And then he comes back to you, and he goes, man, she was so stuck up, what's wrong with her? And I'm like, man, you're spilling your drink all over, you know."

Just like stay the status quo. Like the Republicans, they went through it and they reckoned with it. They dealt with the fact that they needed to have more diverse candidates. That's what they did in terms of their recruitment, and that's why they have a much more diverse class this time around."

I'm paraphrasing something you talked about. I mean, they get up in the morning and they think about family and country and church and community and the rule of law and that's it.

But honestly, the man has exposed the media, he's exposed the polling industry, he's unmasked a lot of malfeasance in our law enforcement system. And, you know, he gave it a great run, if it ends up not in his favor, and he should be proud of himself. I'm proud of him. He fought for the people. The people love him. When you hear chants of \"We love you\" at a political rally, that is something special. The man has a fighting spirit. He never went down. I mean, the best jaw in the boxing I think goes to President Trump. And at the end of this thing, you know, it wasn't a knockdown. This was -- this went to the cards in a split decision, and we'll see what happens the next couple days."
