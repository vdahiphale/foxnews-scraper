They want to see him removed by any means necessary. And so there was initially collusion and we're moving to obstruction. Now we've got Democratic attorney generals of states suing on the emoluments clause. They're going to turn to his business dealings.

      "utterance": "Right, and that's exactly it. They want to put it out there, the Democrats do, that Trump would want to fire Mueller. And that's also talk that you've heard from several of these Trump allies, for example, I think it was Ruddy from Newsmax who came out and basically made some mention of it as well. So there's some of these individuals pushing this narrative about firing Mueller which is preposterous. That's not the case. And in fact actually Sessions today even mentioned the fact that he has full confidence in Mueller and this investigation. But there is talk out there in the conservative sphere in terms of Mueller being tight-knit with Comey. Does that impact the investigation? And those are the questions that arise."

      "utterance": "We talked about Newt Gingrich raised this very issue. Others have as well. Mueller was interviewed for FBI director, and then obviously you have the testimony from James Comey about leaking the contents of those memos in an effort to get a special counsel as the end result."

      "speaker": "HAYES",
      "utterance": "Yes. I guess I don't see the conspiracy there. I do think there are valid questions being raised about who Bob Mueller has hired. In this case he hired a number of prominent investigators and lawyers who have contributed overwhelmingly to Democrats. Those are fair questions. I would think that Bob Mueller might be concerned about the optics. But the story about Mueller potentially being fired has certainly been overhyped in the last 24 hours, but it didn't come out of nowhere. Christopher Ruddy was at the White House. He then went on television and said I think the president might fire Bob Mueller."

    {
      "speaker": "HAYES",
      "utterance": "But we only got that later. And the fact that Jay Sekulow wouldn't answer the question on Sunday I thought was -- it's not crazy notion. The White House has now walked it back considerably and it was overhyped, but it didn't come out of nowhere."

    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "I want to move on, but is there a chance Capitol Hill moves on? I mean, when does the onus shift? I have asked this a couple times to different panels and different people. When does it shift? Does it ever shift to produce a \"there\" there, otherwise we all need to move on?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BEVAN",
      "utterance": "I don't think so. Look, theoretically in a perfect world Bob Mueller comes out, absolves -- with a decision that either absolves the president or moves forward the investigation. And that is sort of the decisive moment. But I do think we've seen Democrats, and part of this is because of the base of their party. They do not believe Trump is the legitimate president. They want to see him removed by any means necessary. And so there was initially collusion and we're moving to obstruction. Now we've got Democratic attorney generals of states suing on the emoluments clause. They're going to turn to his business dealings. So I think despite even if Bob Mueller comes out with a decision opinion one way or the other this is going to carry on. Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC.
