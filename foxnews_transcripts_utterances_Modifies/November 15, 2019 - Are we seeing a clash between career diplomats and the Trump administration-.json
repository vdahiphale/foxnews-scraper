      "sentences": "Just one week and another big one is coming up. Have a good weekend. Thank you, Bret. Good evening, everybody. I'm Martha MacCallum, in New York. Tonight, on “The Story,” the battle between President Trump, and those who make their careers in the kind of work that we've watched over the past couple of days.  Governor Mike Huckabee is here along with David Tafuri, who worked in the Obama State Department. Also tonight, Senator Tim Scott on impeachment and the 2020 battle that unfolds in South Carolina, which also very interesting. Jim Gray is here on the NFL brawl that everyone is talking about.  And the ladies are here for Friday night. But first, Adam Schiff, thanked longtime ambassador Marie Yovanovitch for giving America a window into how career diplomats serve our country.  Didn't learn that much about specifically what she had accomplished while Kent and Taylor sang her praises and so did everyone else on the diets today. Some in the diplomatic community say that she has not been tough enough on Russia. Pointing to one example during her tenure, 24 Ukrainian sailors were taken hostage for 10 months and were not released until after she was gone. Then there's the Nord Stream 2 pipeline that will be completed in weeks providing Russian national -- natural gas to European allies. Potentially igniting a cold war-style collision over Europe's dependence on Russia.  Now, one person probably couldn't have stopped those things, but there has been some people who felt that she wasn't strong enough on this. So, given the president's approach to foreign policy, it's really no surprise that a lot of these government employees are not happy. The former ambassador complained that the ranks in her line of work have been thinned and the president was glad to weigh in on why that is today on Twitter. He said, \"We have vacancies in various departments because we do not want or need as many people as past administrations -- and save great cost. And also, the Democrats delay the approval process to levels unprecedented in the history of the country,\" he writes.  Since taking office, President Trump has increased defense spending and he's cut the State Department's budget. Those are the numbers right there. That's the fact. While at the same time, choosing to make more political appointments at the ambassador post rather than selecting the kind of people that we have seen this week who are more career diplomats under different presidents.   Listen to how Ambassador Yovanovitch push back on that today.",

And Martha, let me point out. He was elected. He wasn't just employed or appointed, he was elected. The people elected him and foreign policy is the domain of the elected official, not the unelected bureaucrats. I'm grateful for them, I'm grateful for this ambassador, and I think she's had a delightful career, I'm not in any way ever going to disparage her because I think she's a terrific professional.  But the president had every right to remove her from that post. And I would just remind people that Glenn Kessler in the Washington Post wrote back on December 3rd, 2008 an article in which he pointed out that president-elect Obama had told every single ambassador in every embassy, they needed to clear out by January the 20th of 2009 because every one of them was going to be a replace. I don't remember anybody getting upset about that. And you know what? Republicans didn't either, because of elections have consequences to quote President Obama.",

And we also have someone like Ambassador Taylor who was actually selected by the Secretary of State Pompeo for this purpose. So, he's really President Trump's choice to be serving in Ukraine. And you heard really stunning testimony from him about how President Trump corrupted the policy in Ukraine to serve his own personal purpose and put national security of the U.S. second.

You have a lot of hearsay.  But that's sort of -- you know, the nut of the debate over impeachment. But I'm getting at something a little bit bigger than that, and you have experience in the diplomatic circles. And my suggestion is that -- you know, what we've looked at this week is yes, people with integrity, people who are very sincere in their desire to serve, I believe, but it's -- that just isn't necessarily the way that it works under this president. And he has the right to put people in place and if he doesn't want someone there anymore, he's allowed -- he can send Rudy Giuliani if he wants to, to go talk to someone and be an envoy, he can send Rick Perry if he wants to, he can decide that Gordon Sondland is the person who's going to present his thinking when he -- when they go into Ukraine.

And what you saw this week was career diplomats, the best of the State Department who didn't engage in partisanship, they were reluctant to say anything critical about President Trump, but they reported what actually happened.

When officers arrived at Faith's home, she refused to cooperate and no children were located. But after the officers heard children's voices, they discovered a false wall leading to the home's basement where faith had been attempting to conceal the kids. Three adult workers were arrested for misdemeanor child abuse due to neglect, but those charges were canceled pending further investigation by DHS. The 58-year-old Faith, however, was not arrested. Police say they are working though to pursue the appropriate charges against her. And while the day care's license has been suspended, parent reaction to the news was mixed.",

      "utterance": "Just one week and another big one is coming up. Have a good weekend. Thank you, Bret. Good evening, everybody. I'm Martha MacCallum, in New York. Tonight, on “The Story,” the battle between President Trump, and those who make their careers in the kind of work that we've watched over the past couple of days. Governor Mike Huckabee is here along with David Tafuri, who worked in the Obama State Department. Also tonight, Senator Tim Scott on impeachment and the 2020 battle that unfolds in South Carolina, which also very interesting. Jim Gray is here on the NFL brawl that everyone is talking about. And the ladies are here for Friday night. But first, Adam Schiff, thanked longtime ambassador Marie Yovanovitch for giving America a window into how career diplomats serve our country. Didn't learn that much about specifically what she had accomplished while Kent and Taylor sang her praises and so did everyone else on the diets today. Some in the diplomatic community say that she has not been tough enough on Russia. Pointing to one example during her tenure, 24 Ukrainian sailors were taken hostage for 10 months and were not released until after she was gone. Then there's the Nord Stream 2 pipeline that will be completed in weeks providing Russian national -- natural gas to European allies. Potentially igniting a cold war-style collision over Europe's dependence on Russia. Now, one person probably couldn't have stopped those things, but there has been some people who felt that she wasn't strong enough on this. So, given the president's approach to foreign policy, it's really no surprise that a lot of these government employees are not happy. The former ambassador complained that the ranks in her line of work have been thinned and the president was glad to weigh in on why that is today on Twitter. He said, \"We have vacancies in various departments because we do not want or need as many people as past administrations -- and save great cost. And also, the Democrats delay the approval process to levels unprecedented in the history of the country,\" he writes. Since taking office, President Trump has increased defense spending and he's cut the State Department's budget. Those are the numbers right there. That's the fact. While at the same time, choosing to make more political appointments at the ambassador post rather than selecting the kind of people that we have seen this week who are more career diplomats under different presidents. Listen to how Ambassador Yovanovitch push back on that today."

But we are as they say the pointy end of the spear. If we lose our edge, the U.S. will inevitably have to use other tools even more than it does today. The State Department is being hollowed out, this is not a time to undercut our diplomats."

You know, I guess, Governor Huckabee, is it safe to say that what we have seen this week besides the -- you know, obvious discussion over impeachment is its sort of a clash between government, bureaucrats, or government longtime career diplomats, and the way things are done in the Trump administration?"

But that's what he said he was going to do and I think people ought to not be so shocked that he has disrupted the normal flow of the way policy has worked, but that's why he was elected. And Martha, let me point out. He was elected. He wasn't just employed or appointed, he was elected. The people elected him and foreign policy is the domain of the elected official, not the unelected bureaucrats. I'm grateful for them, I'm grateful for this ambassador, and I think she's had a delightful career, I'm not in any way ever going to disparage her because I think she's a terrific professional. But the president had every right to remove her from that post. And I would just remind people that Glenn Kessler in the Washington Post wrote back on December 3rd, 2008 an article in which he pointed out that president-elect Obama had told every single ambassador in every embassy, they needed to clear out by January the 20th of 2009 because every one of them was going to be a replace. I don't remember anybody getting upset about that. And you know what? Republicans didn't either, because of elections have consequences to quote President Obama."

But that's not really what this is about. What we saw was career diplomats testifying this week. And they didn't engage in any partisan -- partisanship at all. And we also have someone like Ambassador Taylor who was actually selected by the Secretary of State Pompeo for this purpose. So, he's really President Trump's choice to be serving in Ukraine. And you heard really stunning testimony from him about how President Trump corrupted the policy in Ukraine to serve his own personal purpose and put national security of the U.S. second. And that's what this is really about is President Trump turning the State Department into a quote of personality that just serve his own personality."

You know, I mean, I understand that that's the debate that's being had, but the motivation of the president is undetermined at this point because you don't have anybody who actually spoke to him. You have a lot of hearsay. But that's sort of -- you know, the nut of the debate over impeachment. But I'm getting at something a little bit bigger than that, and you have experience in the diplomatic circles. And my suggestion is that -- you know, what we've looked at this week is yes, people with integrity, people who are very sincere in their desire to serve, I believe, but it's -- that just isn't necessarily the way that it works under this president. And he has the right to put people in place and if he doesn't want someone there anymore, he's allowed -- he can send Rudy Giuliani if he wants to, to go talk to someone and be an envoy, he can send Rick Perry if he wants to, he can decide that Gordon Sondland is the person who's going to present his thinking when he -- when they go into Ukraine. I mean, can't he?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TAFURI",
      "utterance": "He can. But the American people have to evaluate whether those choices are actually serving them. Certainly, Rudy Giuliani who didn't have sufficient experience and who was engaging in diplomacy part-time at certain whims and in order to pursue an agenda that wasn't serving the American people. Well, we have a right to value whether that was a wise choice. And I think it's on display how that was not a wise choice. And what you saw this week was career diplomats, the best of the State Department who didn't engage in partisanship, they were reluctant to say anything critical about President Trump, but they reported what actually happened. And the American people have to judge based on their testimony."
    },

      "speaker": "HUCKABEE",
      "utterance": "Well, and let me point out, the ambassadors who testified earlier -- Bill Taylor, for example. He'd never met President Trump -- hadn't talked to him. He talked about what he thought, what he felt, what he believed. That is irrelevant. What he thinks, what he feels, and what he believes is not relative to the -- what the president has the right to do. And this idea that what the American people care about, that's why we have elections. And rather this -- than this impeachment hoax and sham that's going on. If the people of America don't like the policies of Donald Trump, about a year from now, they can change it. But that's ridiculous to say that let's impeach him because we don't like the fact that he is doing things that are different every president does."

Will we see Rudy Giuliani in front of this committee and what would that look like even the reports that Republicans some are saying that they might be ready to make him the fall guy in this situation. He was asked about it today. David Bossie was President Trump's 2016 deputy campaign manager. He was at the White House today and spoke with the president. David, good to have you here this evening."

      "utterance": "Well, I think Rudy Giuliani is beside the point. But the Democrats are in their witch-hunt, in their -- in their zeal to try to destroy this president, to try and meddle in the 2020 election. They can do anything they want, Rudy Giuliani can handle himself."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "But, you know, I mean a lot of this in terms of the way this policy was carried out was based on Mr. Giuliani's belief that there was deep corruption in Ukraine in 2016 that it went to digging up dirt on Paul Manafort and that there's a connection between Alexandra Chalupa and the DNC and all of this -- he's built this case. But what I'm trying to figure out is if that is -- if there's substance there and I know that he very firmly believes that there is, why didn't we hear any of the Republicans put those questions forth today?"

    {
      "speaker": "BOSSIE",
      "utterance": "Look, you know, I can't speak for the House Republicans, I don't know what they were thinking. But I can -- because -- look, the conversation today was with an ambassador who has never spoken to the president, never met the president and the third witness with no first-hand information. This is a witch-hunt that the Democrats are dedicated to. And they'll use whatever ploys they -- in the sham that they want to. Look, they attacked the president today for tweeting. This is ridiculous. There's no due process, Republicans get no witnesses, we don't get to ask questions. The chairman Schiff is shutting down questioning. This is a railroad and the American people see it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

Is there any daylight between them or does the president stand behind him 100 percent on this?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOSSIE",
      "utterance": "Well, all I know is that Rudy Giuliani is the president's attorney and has done in a magnificent job in destroying the last witch hunt, which was the fake Russia collusion story which some of these same players were involved in. And I think that Rudy Giuliani was doing his utmost to defend the president from the fake Russia collusion story, and knows what some of these players were doing. And none of this -- none of this reaches anywhere near an impeachable offense. This is a sham, and this is offensive to the American people. Which is why, I think, the Democrats are going to pay a price next year."

What do you think about that?"

I am not somebody who ever really knew Roger Stone and did not work with him at any time in my life. So, the last time I saw him was in a federal courtroom when I was a witness against him. So, this is -- this, this is not somebody that I have an affinity for, and I got to tell you, Roger Stone put himself into this jackpot. And I -- and I, I hate to see that the law enforcement went after him, they targeted him. The Mueller team targeted him and I think --"

He's going to connect all the dots here on what we learned today about John Brennan after this."

A number of people who have mentioned the new quarter having an opportunity right now to comment on how they're quoted in the report.

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

RealClearInvestigations is reporting this. \"It is clear that Brendan's role in propagating the collusion narrative went far beyond his work on the ICA. A close review of facts that have slowly come to light reveals that he was a central architect and promoter of the conspiracy theory from its inception.\" That is RealClearInvestigation's work. Here now Matt Whitaker, former Acting Attorney General under President Trump. Matt, always good to have you with us. Thank you very much for being here. So let's go to that first. With regard to John Brennan, what is -- explain to everybody the ICA report, and why they think that it proves that CIA Director got involved in FBI investigation and that it all started earlier than people think."

      "speaker": "MATT WHITAKER, FORMER ACTING U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "WHITAKER",
      "utterance": "Yes. And so -- and it appears that Mr. Brennan at the CIA was instrumental in drafting that. But we've seen FBI Director Wray testified that he agrees with that assessment. I haven't seen any daylight in the -- in the Intelligence Community. I think the interesting thing is that CIA, you know, they sort of do the foreign intelligence piece of the work and so they're interacting with a lot of their counterparts in other countries. And it appears that Mr. Brennan, but based on these -- some reports, took that information and sort of took it across the transom to the FBI. And that's how the original counterintelligence investigation was launched. And, you know, again, I think this Inspector General report is going to be probably one of the most consequential reports we've had in many years."

And I think we're going to learn a lot about not only the Carter Page FISA, but how they do business generally. And I think there's -- I think some Americans are going to be troubled by what the Inspector General's going to ultimately report."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Well, we all remember when Attorney General Barr said that he - - you know, that it could be that there was spying going on and that he was very concerned about that and wanted to dig into it. He says that he believes this report will be a credit to the department. But in terms of the difference between the Durham's report and the Horowitz's report, Horowitz's report is going to basically focus on those FISA requests. And I think as you say a lot will be revealed around those once that we have more clarity on those. But with regard to John Brennan, that would be part of the Durham investigation since he is no longer employed by the government, right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WHITAKER",
      "utterance": "That's true. They're actually kind of looking at two sides of the same coin while the Inspector General is looking at the Carter Page FISA specifically and then generally the FISA program. Durham's investigation is a lot broader. Now we understand it's even a criminal investigation. That's going to look at the actual origins and whether people not only did their jobs, but in doing their jobs, did they violate the law? And that's, you know, if it's a criminal investigation, there's some suggestion that there's at least some evidence that suggests that."

Well, those 26 children all under the age of three were discovered after the State Department of Health Services asks the Colorado Springs police department to assist them with a welfare check. The agency received a tip that Play Mountain Place daycare owner Carla Faith was caring for too many children than what her license would allow. When officers arrived at Faith's home, she refused to cooperate and no children were located. But after the officers heard children's voices, they discovered a false wall leading to the home's basement where faith had been attempting to conceal the kids. Three adult workers were arrested for misdemeanor child abuse due to neglect, but those charges were canceled pending further investigation by DHS. The 58-year-old Faith, however, was not arrested. Police say they are working though to pursue the appropriate charges against her. And while the day care's license has been suspended, parent reaction to the news was mixed."

Now in one incident after investigators visited one of her facilities, they found daycare employees hurting 31 children aged 18 months to four years, some of them without shoes through an alley in an attempt to hide them from officers.

And then I just want to remind everyone that just a few weeks ago, there is the other hit, a few weeks ago this is what happened. He was hit and went flat out cold.

The Cleveland authorities, the Ohio authorities as of now, Rudolph has not filed any charges. His lawyer has said they will consider it as well the team as they go down the road here. But that's a very difficult path. It really should be handled now with the players and the commissioner, and that should be the highest authority. The player is standing up. He said he's OK."

He said, it feels like this is more of an oversight or H.R. kind of issue because you're not relevant to the time period that we are talking about in terms of what happened here. That was his argument. I want to -- I do want to show you this Trump tweet --"

And he got a lot of heat for this today. He said \"Everywhere Marie Yovanovitch went turned bad. She started off in Somalia, how did that go? Then fast-forward to Ukraine where the new Ukrainian president spoke unfavorably about her in my second phone call with him. It's the U.S. President's absolute right to appoint ambassadors.\" And that got called, you know, basically intimidating the witness in real time."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCOTT",
      "utterance": "Yes. I don't think so. I mean, if she was watching her Twitter account while she was in the hearing, I would be shocked and amazed. There's no doubt that the left, the media, the left wants to find any scintilla of information and/or evidence to bring the president down on a couple of notches."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "SCOTT",
      "utterance": "Well, that reinforces. Martha, that reinforces what I'm suggesting however. Is that, the only way for any information to be in the hearing is for someone on the left to bring it up so that they could use it as a power or a tool of intimidation. The truth is she could not have known what he was tweeting because she was not able to get to any device that had the tweets on the devices. So, for that to happen, that only reinforces why the average person in this country sees the narrative of the left is based on emotions and a vitriol and animus towards the president and not a fact pattern that we should be focused on. We should be focused on the transcripts from July 25th, if we focus on that, we come to one simple conclusion, the president is innocent of an impeachable offense because there is no quid pro quo there, no quid pro quo there. There is nothing that is even out of line we can talk about whether or not he should be asking about the Bidens but he did so about 2016 and not 2020."

Some people see that in the tea leaves, the Washington Examiner wrote a piece about it today."

      "utterance": "Well, Martha, good question. There is no doubt that the number of African-Americans in South Carolina who are encouraged by the results of the economic policies of this administration is sky high. The truth is that we are making so much progress in so many indicators from a 73 percent cut in taxes for the average single mother to the opportunity zones that are bringing about $60 billion nationwide."

We're seeing such a huge surge in the economy that African-Americans are starting to ask the right question, who is responsible? This is the Trump economy and it's undeniable. And so, the Democrats continue to look for ways to give away something to entice and attract the African-American voters back to their side. That will not work this time. I expect the president's numbers to rise two to threefold in 2020, which scares the dickens out of the Democrats."

And they are seeking to embarrass her. I mean, that's the -- the entire premise of Wolf Blitzer's line of questioning was to embarrass her and to try to shame her essentially and I think that's wrong. And I also think, you know, looking at George Conway, he seems like such a jerk. I think to be out there constantly and try to embarrass your wife in that way and try to divide your family, it seems like a terrible human being, a terrible husband, and terrible father."

The media coverage of the story has also been quite something. Vanity Fair's headline, Kellyanne Conway really, really doesn't want to talk about her husband. The Daily Beast said, Kellyanne Conway blows up at CNN's Wolf Blitzer. So, they are basically portraying her as an emotional, hysterical woman."

With regards to her appearance, she wanted to do a montage of all of her music. You know, she's been battling with these former producers who own her music. Guys, it's been announced recently that the American Music Awards would be honoring me as artist of the decade. I've been planning to perform a medley of my hits, Scott Borchetta and Scooter Braun have said that I am not allowed to perform my old songs on television.\" Let's go to you first, Carley. What do you think?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHIMKUS",
      "utterance": "Well, this is a complicated situation but it all boils down to the fact that she does not own the rights to her music and the person who does, she can't stand. So, now, she's saying that they are denying her the rights to perform her songs in two really big upcoming projects. Scooter Braun Big Machine Records came back and said that's not true. And Taylor Swift's camp turned around and said yes, it is true and we have this statement to prove it. The crazy thing here is that young artists are forced to sign these contracts that basically say we are going to take a chance on you and we are going to pump a lot of money into your career."

      "speaker": "SHIMKUS",
      "utterance": "Well, that's the trade-off. The question is really should it be, and Taylor Swift is not trying to fight against that to give artists more rights. And she is, the way she is handling this now is she is going to re- record all her old music, but she can't until November of 2020."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TARLOV",
      "utterance": "But also, the point that she's emphasizing now moving forward and we do have these conflicting statements so I'm sure there will be more back and forth amongst lawyers. But the point that she's been making to her fans and to young artists out there is to say, consider this at this moment if you are 15 years old and you've got it, right, so a Hollywood producer is going to get you a coach, a stylist, and you know, make your first big pop hit, you're going to turn into Britney Spears. Think about that at this moment because at 29, look what's happening to me now."

She's made comments about saying controlling a woman, or basically be a good little girl and shut up is what they are trying to say to her. But as you mentioned these are deals that so many artists have signed, men or women. There's absolutely no evidence that there is anything sexism related to this, yet she's trying to play the victim which I think seems to be sort of a standard way that she operates in the public eye.
