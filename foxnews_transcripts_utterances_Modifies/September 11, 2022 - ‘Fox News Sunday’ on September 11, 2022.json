It has been 21 years, but it seems as if not one day has gone by, as again we gather here at the former Ground Zero, now the 9/11 Tribute Museum and Memorial to honor and remember. There is familiar sights and sounds that we have seen over the last decades, the government officials, the survivors, the first responders and family members of the victims honoring those who were killed here by radical Islamic terrorism. There will be as always, the four moments of silence when the two jetliners hit both towers and when those two gleaming towers crumbled to the ground. There will be reading of the names of the victims that is ongoing right now, 2,963 people killed by radical Islamic terrorism. Vice President Harris, Attorney General Merrick Garland are here to honor those who died and to remember. Vice President Harris has arrived, we understand, down in Washington. President Biden will be at the Pentagon, as you said. And First Lady Jill Biden will be marking the ceremonies in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, to mark where United Flight 93 crashed. The decades have not diminished our memories or for many, the pain. We're reminded that the Taliban has taken over the Afghanistan and also that the Biden administration killed al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri in July, that the threat remains, that the philosophy is still with us. Tonight, the tribute and light will soar into the sky, the two gleaning towers of light that evoke the vanished towers, remind us all, not just of what we lost, but the threat that still exists -- Shannon.",

Good to see you, Martha. MARTHA MACCALLUM, \"THE STORY\" ANCHOR: Good to see you, Shannon. Congratulations on your inaugural program. It's wonderful with you. I wish you a long and happy tenure in this spot. We are covering this story all throughout the days to come. The funeral is now scheduled. It will be a week from Monday and I'm reminded listening to Eric Shawn's report, of September 13th, 2001, when the Queen in a typically sort of wise and gracious move took that moment to allow the playing of the U.S. national anthem, \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" outside at Buckingham Palace for all those who are gathered. It was an extraordinarily moving moment. Brits had tears streaming down their faces, as did members of the U.S. who are expats here as well. And it was very typical of her grace and her understanding of the moment. And I think that's why people talk about her integrity, her dignity, it's actual examples like that, that built together that reputation. And today, we started the day with her coffin's exit from the gates of Balmoral, a favorite home of relaxation for her, in the highlands in Scotland, the place where she had gone since she was a little girl, with her sister Margaret and her parents, the queen mother and King George VI. She cherished her ability to be free there, to walk the highlands, to go hiking, and all of the activities -- the barbecues on the sides of the river that she loved to have with her family, that extended all the way through this summer. And she worked until the very end. We learned some new details this morning about her final days. She had dinner with family at Balmoral on Monday evening. Tuesday, we know she met with Liz Truss. On Wednesday, she was told that she could not -- her doctors did not want her to take part in a virtual meeting with the privy council. And we also know that in the past, she said that she wanted to work until the very end and she felt, she said, you know, when I stop, I drop. And she did work until that very last moment. We have that wonderful picture of her with Liz Truss, smiling with her kilt on at Balmoral. And right now beautiful aerial shots of her casket as it travels through the countryside, making its way toward Edinburgh where it should be a couple of hours from now, Shannon. One just last thing, Prince Charles at Buckingham Palace, those are the crowds that you see gathered on the right hand side of your screen. He is meeting with representatives of the commonwealth about the future of his leadership with that commonwealth and trying to cement those relationships, which have been under quite a bit of strain in recent years, Shannon.",

Her personal views on the important political questions of her reign, from Suez crisis to Brexit, remained unknown for many years after events and sometimes to this day.

I can tell you how not to approach the issue. It is by the banking hearing I had when Secretary Janet Yellen told me that Black women living in poverty could increase their labor force participation rate by having abortions.

I'm not sure that we got to the same side of the issue, but we did get to the same side of the solution, which was helping people who were hurting, helping people in marginalized communities. And today, I think we need to have hard conversations with the American voters about not red or blue solution, but about American solutions. Let's have hard conversations about the fact that in America, a good education is the closest thing to magic. And that's why 67 percent of Democrats, 68 percent of independents, 70 percent of Hispanics, 74 percent of African- Americans all agree that quality education is necessary for the furtherance of the American dream and the hardest hit communities. If we were to have the tough issues and tough conversations about the future of America and not the future of Republicans or Democrats, we would actually earn the respect of the American people and let the voters make their own decisions.",

All right, panel, great to have you with us on this busy Sunday morning. I want to start here with the midterm. \"The Nation's\" headline on Friday was, how the Democrats got their groove back, abortion, MAGA and healthy partisanship are changing the midterm dynamics. What are you watching for, Jonathan? JONATHAN SWAN, NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER \"AXIOS\": You've got this very unusual circumstance where you're sort of weighing history against this - well, unprecedented set of circumstances. You've got history which tells you that the party out of power, the opposite party of the president, is going to gain substantially. I think it's an average of 25 seats in the House going back to like, you know, the '50s or whenever they started looking at this. Oh, I think it even goes back in further than that. But you've also got Dobbs. You've got this huge Supreme Court decision. And one thing that I find really difficult with kind of trying to gauge the abortion issue is, it's not visible. You don't have a convening power. Like, it's very easy to see energy on the right because you've got Donald Trump - I was at his rally in Pennsylvania. Ten thousand people. Packed to the rafters. Fired up. There aren't stadiums full of suburban women, you know. So, it's actually - it's diffuse. It's out there. It's being picked up in polls and things. And we just don't know. We've got that. We've got inflation, which is still very high, and you've got a very unpopular president, but yet his party is doing quite well on the generic ballot. So, it's pretty weird, actually, and I -",

The economy is obviously bad. The border is bad. Foreign policy is not going well. So, they don't have anything else. But I do think it's important for Republicans to push back on some of this misinformation and disinformation that's getting spread in the media. The Dobbs decision does enable Americans to have a say in abortion in a way that they couldn't under Roe v. Wade. And it's actually a majority of Americans think that abortion should either be illegal or illegal in some circumstances. Three out of four Americans think there should be restrictions on abortion. Sixty-three percent believe abortion should be illegal after 15 weeks of pregnancy, which is around the time that an unborn child feels pain. So I think Republicans are shying away from the issues, when, in fact, they should be hitting hard and understanding that the moderate viewpoint is something enabled through this Dobbs decision.",

It has been 21 years, but it seems as if not one day has gone by, as again we gather here at the former Ground Zero, now the 9/11 Tribute Museum and Memorial to honor and remember. There is familiar sights and sounds that we have seen over the last decades, the government officials, the survivors, the first responders and family members of the victims honoring those who were killed here by radical Islamic terrorism. There will be as always, the four moments of silence when the two jetliners hit both towers and when those two gleaming towers crumbled to the ground. There will be reading of the names of the victims that is ongoing right now, 2,963 people killed by radical Islamic terrorism. Vice President Harris, Attorney General Merrick Garland are here to honor those who died and to remember. Vice President Harris has arrived, we understand, down in Washington. President Biden will be at the Pentagon, as you said. And First Lady Jill Biden will be marking the ceremonies in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, to mark where United Flight 93 crashed. The decades have not diminished our memories or for many, the pain. We're reminded that the Taliban has taken over the Afghanistan and also that the Biden administration killed al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri in July, that the threat remains, that the philosophy is still with us. Tonight, the tribute and light will soar into the sky, the two gleaning towers of light that evoke the vanished towers, remind us all, not just of what we lost, but the threat that still exists -- Shannon."

Good to see you, Martha. MARTHA MACCALLUM, \"THE STORY\" ANCHOR: Good to see you, Shannon. Congratulations on your inaugural program. It's wonderful with you. I wish you a long and happy tenure in this spot. We are covering this story all throughout the days to come. The funeral is now scheduled. It will be a week from Monday and I'm reminded listening to Eric Shawn's report, of September 13th, 2001, when the Queen in a typically sort of wise and gracious move took that moment to allow the playing of the U.S. national anthem, \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" outside at Buckingham Palace for all those who are gathered. It was an extraordinarily moving moment. Brits had tears streaming down their faces, as did members of the U.S. who are expats here as well. And it was very typical of her grace and her understanding of the moment. And I think that's why people talk about her integrity, her dignity, it's actual examples like that, that built together that reputation. And today, we started the day with her coffin's exit from the gates of Balmoral, a favorite home of relaxation for her, in the highlands in Scotland, the place where she had gone since she was a little girl, with her sister Margaret and her parents, the queen mother and King George VI. She cherished her ability to be free there, to walk the highlands, to go hiking, and all of the activities -- the barbecues on the sides of the river that she loved to have with her family, that extended all the way through this summer. And she worked until the very end. We learned some new details this morning about her final days. She had dinner with family at Balmoral on Monday evening. Tuesday, we know she met with Liz Truss. On Wednesday, she was told that she could not -- her doctors did not want her to take part in a virtual meeting with the privy council. And we also know that in the past, she said that she wanted to work until the very end and she felt, she said, you know, when I stop, I drop. And she did work until that very last moment. We have that wonderful picture of her with Liz Truss, smiling with her kilt on at Balmoral. And right now beautiful aerial shots of her casket as it travels through the countryside, making its way toward Edinburgh where it should be a couple of hours from now, Shannon. One just last thing, Prince Charles at Buckingham Palace, those are the crowds that you see gathered on the right hand side of your screen. He is meeting with representatives of the commonwealth about the future of his leadership with that commonwealth and trying to cement those relationships, which have been under quite a bit of strain in recent years, Shannon."

And I also want to give my condolences to the families of 9/11 today. But I do remember that moment. I was there. And I think it spoke a lot. It showed the Queen's kindness. And she was very kind, sensitive woman who I think loved America and I think America -- America loved her right back. And it's amazing being here during this. I got here a couple of months ago and she welcomed me to Buckingham Palace with a huge amount of kindness and cared deeply about the special relationship. And I have been an ambassador before, and I will tell you, this relationship is strong and really it is the number one relationship, quite different than we have with other countries."

And much have been recently said about her statements that were very personal about her faith. \"Christianity Today\" talking about that, put it this way, they say: Part princess and part pope, both guardian and great-grandmother, diplomat and disciple, her majesty the Queen was the calm that carried on, stabilizing her nation and Commonwealth during tumultuous periods of historic change and technological advancement. It's crazy to think over 70 years time how much the world changed, technology just being part of that, culture and so many other things. What kind of legacy do you think she leaves behind?"

Her last prime minister was Liz Truss, who was born in 1974. I mean, it is really quite incredible. And I am the second female ambassador in London, the first after 50 years.

We think back on the 2012 Olympics and the fact that she was part of the ceremonies, and that video that was so funny that portrayed her as if she were actually jumping out of a -- parachuting out of a helicopter with James Bond. It was kind of cheeky. It was a lot of fun. I know you probably had a chance to see that side of her as well."

It was the day -- it was hottest day in London history, so they couldn't send the horse and carriage as they normally do. In her kindness, she sent her own car. And then the audience was, you know, very policy-oriented, very, you know, substantive, because she cared a lot about the issues of the day and was very well-informed. But then she was very happy I had my dog with me, and we had a little chat about that. And she just -- she had a wonderful sense of humor. But the thing that you started this program and I commend you for doing it, her sense of duty, her sense of duty to a country and an institution for 70 years. We just don't see that much anymore. And I think -- even her last meeting, she met with Liz Truss to ask her to form a government three days before she died, you know, fulfilling her commitment to this country that as long as she lived, she would serve, I find that so admirable and I have -- I have just so much respect for her."

It's very inspiring, and one of the things that she did was thread this very careful needle to be apolitical as a monarch there in the U.K. \"Wall Street Journal\" editorial board put it this say. They say: She eschewed politics in a way her son and heir Charles has found difficult to do. Her personal views on the important political questions of her reign, from Suez crisis to Brexit, remained unknown for many years after events and sometimes to this day. Ambassador, we still don't know how she felt about some of the hot button issues. King Charles has now said that he will change the way he has openly supported progressive issues moving forward now as a monarch. How important was it to the Queen's legacy that she was able to be so atypical on tough things and what kind of challenge does that present now for the king?"

She was not one party or the other. She was not politics. But I do think listening to the king's remarks the other night, they were - - his mother would have been proud. They were filled with service and duty and dignity. You know, he will have to chart his own course.

And somehow there was this sense that everybody, even though you knew it was coming, somehow it still seemed too soon. So I think -- I think the country is heartbroken. She also, because 70 years, she's touched so many people and she was out in communities and she cared about people. So, everybody you meet has a story that -- you know, I was there when I was 12, I shook her hand. I saw her four months ago up in Scotland. So, you know, it's very personal.

I believe that we are the most exceptional people on Earth and we do unify after the crisis. The question is, can we have the type of leadership that unifies us without a crisis? And what we have not seen from the Biden administration is that type of unifying message that people rally around. Why in the world would we have a conversation about putting the burden of the most affluent people with student loan debt on to the back of the least fortunate, those who never went to college? Why would we have a conversation about zero percent inflation when in fact it's 8.5 percent? And why would we have the president of the United States deliver a soul-crushing speech that was unnecessary, polarizing and inflammatory? We have done better. We will do better.

Pew Research has out new polling that shows for registered voters, the things they care, about very important issues to them. The economy is at the top of the list, not surprising. But among a key constituency, \"Politico\" now has this headline: They're getting killed among women. Skeptical female voters stand in the way of GOP Senate. Republicans'' chances of retaking the Senate majority are diminishing thanks to abortion. You're unabashedly pro-life. You signed on to a brief to the Supreme Court in the Dobbs case which ended up overturning the Roe v. Wade. What do you think now about the possibility that that may cost you control of the Senate where if the GOP was control, you'd have much broader sweep over much broader issues including things like federal judges?

Herschel Walker has been gaining ground steadily for the last two or three weeks. J.D. Vance in Ohio is gaining ground. Dr. Oz in Pennsylvania is gaining ground and, frankly, in North Carolina, we are in a pretty solid position with Ted Budd. Here's the truth about issues that matter to the American people -- the economy, inflation and gas prices are the top three issues and without any question, the social issues certainly presents an opportunity for us to have a conversation with the American people about what matters to them and how we should approach that issue. I can tell you how not to approach the issue. It is by the banking hearing I had when Secretary Janet Yellen told me that Black women living in poverty could increase their labor force participation rate by having abortions. That lacks a moral clarity. It was absolutely a harsh comment that was unnecessary and we're sending wrong message that abortion should be the first option for those living in poverty. I was stunned.

I'm not sure that we got to the same side of the issue, but we did get to the same side of the solution, which was helping people who were hurting, helping people in marginalized communities. And today, I think we need to have hard conversations with the American voters about not red or blue solution, but about American solutions. Let's have hard conversations about the fact that in America, a good education is the closest thing to magic. And that's why 67 percent of Democrats, 68 percent of independents, 70 percent of Hispanics, 74 percent of African- Americans all agree that quality education is necessary for the furtherance of the American dream and the hardest hit communities. If we were to have the tough issues and tough conversations about the future of America and not the future of Republicans or Democrats, we would actually earn the respect of the American people and let the voters make their own decisions."

It's going to take some time to get it done. And, in the meantime, we need to start that transition because it makes sense. We're putting out hundreds of billions of dollars every year in disaster. Just had one of the driest years ever. Been on - this is my 45th harvest on the farm. One of the driest years ever. It's costing the taxpayer dollars. Does that mean we should just shut off carbon-based fuels? We can't. We can't afford to do it. So, we've got to figure out ways, like the Inflation Reduction Act did, to do both.

I haven't seen the language on the permitting stuff, so I can't tell you whether even I'm for it or not.

Hugh Hewitt wrote about this in \"The Washington Post,\" an opinion piece. He says, for Democrats the Respect for Marriage Act is about elections. He says, calculation is by Schumer that even if he can't find the 60 votes he needs, it's always better for his party's chances in November if it's caught trying to pass the measure. So, he says there are no state legislators even making a peep about this issue It is settled. Is this a cynical, political ploy?"

You know very well, business needs certainty. The policies coming out of government, if there's certainty involved, that's why we need, by the way, to get the appropriations done by the end of September, and not have a short term funding. It doesn't provide the kind of certainty we need in this country. So, what this does is provides certainly for folks who are married and protects religious liberties, which I think is really, really important. And so I don't really have a problem with it at all. And, by the way, and it's done in a bipartisan way."

All right, panel, great to have you with us on this busy Sunday morning. I want to start here with the midterm. \"The Nation's\" headline on Friday was, how the Democrats got their groove back, abortion, MAGA and healthy partisanship are changing the midterm dynamics. What are you watching for, Jonathan? JONATHAN SWAN, NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER \"AXIOS\": You've got this very unusual circumstance where you're sort of weighing history against this - well, unprecedented set of circumstances. You've got history which tells you that the party out of power, the opposite party of the president, is going to gain substantially. I think it's an average of 25 seats in the House going back to like, you know, the '50s or whenever they started looking at this. Oh, I think it even goes back in further than that. But you've also got Dobbs. You've got this huge Supreme Court decision. And one thing that I find really difficult with kind of trying to gauge the abortion issue is, it's not visible. You don't have a convening power. Like, it's very easy to see energy on the right because you've got Donald Trump - I was at his rally in Pennsylvania. Ten thousand people. Packed to the rafters. Fired up. There aren't stadiums full of suburban women, you know. So, it's actually - it's diffuse. It's out there. It's being picked up in polls and things. And we just don't know. We've got that. We've got inflation, which is still very high, and you've got a very unpopular president, but yet his party is doing quite well on the generic ballot. So, it's pretty weird, actually, and I -"

That's also going down at this moment. So, it's very troubling. And I think that's why Chief Justice Roberts felt the need to say, without the law and without the court upholding the law, where are we going as a country? But I think the vice president is on target, that if you take away rights, if you take away abortion rights, if you transfer abortion from a constitutional right to murder, well, then, you know, you have women who will be put in jail for committing murder."

      "utterance": "Well, the states are trying to figure that out now, Mollie. MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, \"THE FEDERALIST\": Yes, I think this is a very important issue. Obviously, Democrats are focusing on abortion because they don't have anything else to run on. The general mood of the country is that people are very frustrated with the direction of the country. The economy is obviously bad. The border is bad. Foreign policy is not going well. So, they don't have anything else. But I do think it's important for Republicans to push back on some of this misinformation and disinformation that's getting spread in the media. The Dobbs decision does enable Americans to have a say in abortion in a way that they couldn't under Roe v. Wade. And it's actually a majority of Americans think that abortion should either be illegal or illegal in some circumstances. Three out of four Americans think there should be restrictions on abortion. Sixty-three percent believe abortion should be illegal after 15 weeks of pregnancy, which is around the time that an unborn child feels pain. So I think Republicans are shying away from the issues, when, in fact, they should be hitting hard and understanding that the moderate viewpoint is something enabled through this Dobbs decision."

And in the sense of 9/11, just what an opportunity that was and that we saw, you know, as the players, the way that everyone rallied around us, you know, and rallied around as a team. And, you know, a friend of mine, you know, said it great, you know, growing up we all want to be part of a team. And then whether you were a part of the Yankees or the Mets at that time, or you were just a fan, what 9/11 really did was make you feel like you - we were all a part of the same team.
