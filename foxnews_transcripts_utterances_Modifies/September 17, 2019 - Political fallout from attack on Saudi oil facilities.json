The weapons were fired from inside Iran, the officials say. But not all the Iran weapons hit their target in Saudi Arabia. Some fell short. U.S. teams are on the ground in Saudi Arabia collecting the debris from the weapons used in the attack, which knocked out half the Kingdom's oil capacity. Some officials say Houthi rebels in Yemen could have also launched a small attack into southern Saudi Arabia, but the main attack came from inside Iran.\"  Let's bring in our panel, start there. Matthew Continetti, founding editor of the \"Washington Free Beacon,\" Mara Liasson, national political correspondent for National Public Radio, and Josh Holmes, former top adviser to Mitch McConnell, ow the president of the Cavalry Consultants.

I think the issue fundamentally is what Matthew was referring to earlier, that there is some Bibi fatigue. There has been an awful lot of drama surrounding the last three years, investigation after investigation. And I think even for his core supporters, at some point you kind of have to turn the page on some of that. I'm not saying that this is going to be a definitive election.

The weapons were fired from inside Iran, the officials say. But not all the Iran weapons hit their target in Saudi Arabia. Some fell short. U.S. teams are on the ground in Saudi Arabia collecting the debris from the weapons used in the attack, which knocked out half the Kingdom's oil capacity. Some officials say Houthi rebels in Yemen could have also launched a small attack into southern Saudi Arabia, but the main attack came from inside Iran.\" Let's bring in our panel, start there. Matthew Continetti, founding editor of the \"Washington Free Beacon,\" Mara Liasson, national political correspondent for National Public Radio, and Josh Holmes, former top adviser to Mitch McConnell, ow the president of the Cavalry Consultants.

Since may there have been 40 attacks that we know about, 40 attacks initiated by Iran on interests in the area, including three drones, American drones, that have been shot down. We know what they're trying to do. The question is whether or not we're going to acknowledge at some point that one country is at war. It's not us.

There's absolutely I don't think any question about what their intention is trying to do, is escalate this to the point where they get some kind of an interaction with the United States.

I think, Bret, when we look back on this election, we might see Bibi fatigue as a little bit of a factor. He is Israel's longest serving prime minister. That is no small feat. And in the run-up to this election in recent weeks, he has continued to make promise after promise that I think may have actually alienated some of his core supporters."

You've got the seven-foot tall posters of Trump and Netanyahu, and Trump has been an incredible friend to Netanyahu and has done almost everything he wanted. But he's been a little bit, it sounds like he's been hedging his bets a little bit recently because he's not so sure Bibi is going to pull it out. But if he loses, what happens to Trump's relationships with the Israeli government, that's going to be really interesting."

      "speaker": "HOLMES",
      "utterance": "Yes, and over there where it's been wrong, too. They've had exit polls that have been famously official. But I will say, I think it has less to do with Bibi Netanyahu's foreign policy, domestic policy, or even his embrace of President Trump. I think President Trump is still extremely popular in Israel. I think the issue fundamentally is what Matthew was referring to earlier, that there is some Bibi fatigue. There has been an awful lot of drama surrounding the last three years, investigation after investigation. And I think even for his core supporters, at some point you kind of have to turn the page on some of that. I'm not saying that this is going to be a definitive election. Clearly we're going down the wire. He may pull it out, may actually form a government. But I think that is some of the underlying angst there."

It's theater. It's not actual legal politics. We are not sure whether it's an impeachment investigation, or is it or is it not.
