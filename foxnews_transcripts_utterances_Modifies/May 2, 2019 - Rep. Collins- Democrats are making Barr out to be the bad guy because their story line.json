But tonight, the New York Times is starting to do some digging into a story that many have thought was worth pursuing for some time. We've reported on this angle quite a bit here on “The Story.”  Also, Representative Devin Nunes, just one example of somebody who was lambasted by the media for suggesting that perhaps, there might have been an effort by U.S. intelligence to bait members in the Trump campaign, and give reason to keep digging. Tonight, The Times writes of the meeting which we've talked about before at the London hotel between George Papadopoulos, a young newly affiliated member of the Trump policy team at the time, where he has long claimed, he felt like it was a setup like he was being framed.  So, this tonight is the reporting from the New York Times. \"The American governments affiliation with the woman there, who said her name with Azra Turk, is one previously reported -- unreported detail of an operation that has become a political flashpoint in the face of accusations by President Trump and his allies that American law enforcement and intelligence officials spied on his campaign to undermine his electoral chances. Last year, he called it Spygate,\" they write.   \"The decision to use Ms. Turk in the operation aimed at a presidential campaign official -- George Papadopoulos, shows the level of alarm inside the FBI,\" they write, \"during a frantic period when the bureau was trying to determine the scope of Russia's attempts to disrupt the 2016 election, but also gives ammunition to Mr. Trump and his allies for their spying claims.\" We will unravel this. Good evening, everybody. I'm Martha MacCallum, and this is “The Story.” Marc Thiessen, Dan Henninger, and Marie Harf are standing by for more on this new development tonight. But first, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, Congressman Doug Collins. Sir, good to see you tonight. Thank you very much for being here.",

Maybe those Republicans who we thought were crazy, and then, everybody else was saying, oh they're just chasing wild stories are now actually being seen is true. They're actually going back and actually doing real reporting and saying, what happened at a Department of Justice, it went from one investigation to another in the middle of a presidential campaign, and why did it start? I think Bill Barr is made reference to this, he's made reference to wanting to get to the beginning of it.

And so, if Mueller is still their gold standard they're holding on to, then someone has to be the bad guy, and Bill Barr, who has answered every one of their questions that they wanted, who has cooked for everything he's supposed to have done, they were making him out to be the bad guy.

But you wonder if they weren't actually more disappointed with Robert Mueller. Because Robert Mueller did not deliver on obstruction. And when they read the report, they clearly feel that he should have. So, the attorneys including Emmet Flood from the White House wrote a letter, sent it to Bill Barr on their analysis of the legal basis of the report -- the special counsel's report. And in it, they talked about the fact that there's -- there are lines in this report written by the folks who put it together, who, you know, the president has gone after a lot on Twitter as being unfair to him. And saying that they did not -- in the report, it says, \"We did not exonerate the president.\" Here is what Emmet Flood wrote, \"Prosecutors simply are not in the business of establishing innocence. In the American justice system, innocence is presumed. There is never a need for prosecutors to conclusively determine it.\" What do you say to that?",

For Democrats who want to say that Bill Barr tried to skew the report or do whatever and then, here there's this misunderstanding with claiming him and Robert Mueller through a letter or anything else.  He stated the facts correctly. He said that there was no collusion, he stated there is no charge to obstruction. And he even included the line that was actually in the Mueller report -- I thought was rather interesting for a career prosecutor to say, \"We don't exonerate.\" I'm not sure he's ever come out. I'd love to go back and look at a lot of his past writings or any prosecutors past writings to say, you know, at the end of this, we're not exonerating. We didn't charge, we're not exonerated. Emmet Flood is exactly right, prosecutors are not in the business of exonerating. They're either finding enough to charge or they're not finding enough to charge and they move on.   This is a concern and I think it's really interesting to me though for Democrats to play on this right now, they can't have everybody be the bad person here. They've got at least holdout hope that they can find something in this report or something going along that they can actually take and make political haze so they can tarnish the president.

At the end, I guess to catch the Attorney General may be in some discrepancy that they thought he said, and have it looked like an impeachment hearing. For over 200 years, there's never ever been a staff member asked questions in an oversight hearing in the House Judiciary Committee outside of impeachment. So, here is what they're going out and say, they say, well, it's an impeachment, we had staff here to make the assumption that this is a part of an impeachment investigation to smallify their base that dislikes the president, and members who dislike the president. So, they wanted it to appear like an impeachment hearing instead of just doing the oversight that our committee is supposed to be doing.

And now, 2-1/2 years, and $25 million later, we finally have the answer. No, they were not working with the Russians. So, now we need to get to the bottom of how did we spend 2-1/2 years and $25 million chasing a conspiracy theory down a rabbit hole? Because they weren't working with the Russians. That is a question that the American people deserve an answer to now, now that we have a definitive response to the -- I think from Mueller about the conspiracy.

I think, Martha, taking a step back to 2016, the U.S. intelligence community and the FBI were getting multiple pieces of information and concerning reports about Russians trying to infiltrate campaigns here, and about certain things that were taking place.

And let's be clear about this. I mean, yes, there was a -- we're looking into whether the Russians were meddling in the election. But the Russian collusion narrative was not about that. It was about whether the Trump campaign was actively involved with the Russians to essentially steal the 2016 election.

I think we should also be worried that he lays out in great detail that a campaign was at least willing to explore working with Russia, knew they would benefit from it. That's outlined in detail in the Mueller report. And then an administration tried at multiple points to shut down that investigation into what was going on.

But then the woman who petition for a special counsel, former appellate court judge Sheila O'Brien put the brakes on by asking the judge to recuse himself because his son works for the Cook County state's attorney Kim Foxx. Judge Martin was clearly unhappy called the request unusual but agreed to consider it, so for at least the next weeks, the legal jockeying goes on.  Former Judge O'Brien is fighting for a special prosecutor because she says there is a, quote, \"perception that justice was not served here, that Mr. Smollett received special treatment.\" States attorney Kim Foxx filed the motion arguing that a special prosecutor might duplicate or interfere with the investigation now underway by the Cook County inspector general. So, Foxx is now against the special prosecutor. But in late March she wrote an op-ed in the Chicago Tribune saying she was in favor of it, quoting, \"Let me state publicly and clearly that I welcome an outside nonpolitical review of how we handled this matter. I am not perfect, nor is any other prosecutor out there, but ensuring that I, and my office have our community's trust is paramount.\" Foxx has also filed a motion to prevent the release of original files and documents from her and her top deputy Joseph Magats, saying that former Judge O'Brien's request for information violates state law that prosecutors be allowed wide discretion in decisions about whether to charge or dismiss cases. Remember, Jussie Smollett was facing 16 felony counts for allegedly staging a hate crime, crime hoax. And days after the state's attorney's office laid out very compelling evidence against Jussie Smollett, the charges were suddenly dropped. Kim Foxx and her deputy Joseph Magats were not in court today, saying, they were not bound by subpoenas mandating their presence. Martha?",

We've reported on this angle quite a bit here on “The Story.” Also, Representative Devin Nunes, just one example of somebody who was lambasted by the media for suggesting that perhaps, there might have been an effort by U.S. intelligence to bait members in the Trump campaign, and give reason to keep digging. Tonight, The Times writes of the meeting which we've talked about before at the London hotel between George Papadopoulos, a young newly affiliated member of the Trump policy team at the time, where he has long claimed, he felt like it was a setup like he was being framed. So, this tonight is the reporting from the New York Times. \"The American governments affiliation with the woman there, who said her name with Azra Turk, is one previously reported -- unreported detail of an operation that has become a political flashpoint in the face of accusations by President Trump and his allies that American law enforcement and intelligence officials spied on his campaign to undermine his electoral chances. Last year, he called it Spygate,\" they write. \"The decision to use Ms. Turk in the operation aimed at a presidential campaign official -- George Papadopoulos, shows the level of alarm inside the FBI,\" they write, \"during a frantic period when the bureau was trying to determine the scope of Russia's attempts to disrupt the 2016 election, but also gives ammunition to Mr. Trump and his allies for their spying claims.\" We will unravel this. Good evening, everybody. I'm Martha MacCallum, and this is “The Story.” Marc Thiessen, Dan Henninger, and Marie Harf are standing by for more on this new development tonight.

And now, they're having to move on. And now, they're actually going back and saying, well that wasn't a story. Well, what is the story? Maybe those Republicans who we thought were crazy, and then, everybody else was saying, oh they're just chasing wild stories are now actually being seen is true. They're actually going back and actually doing real reporting and saying, what happened at a Department of Justice, it went from one investigation to another in the middle of a presidential campaign, and why did it start? I think Bill Barr is made reference to this, he's made reference to wanting to get to the beginning of it. And it's actually glad to -- and glad to see that some of the media who have in the past have been critical of the efforts are now actually saying, hey maybe something is up here."

Because I'll absolutely tell you, the chairman of our committee is doing nothing but a circus run of making Bill Barr be the -- now, the straw man, the boogeyman if you would. Because all of their dreams fell apart when Mueller came out. When there was no collusion by anyone, there was no charged obstruction, their dreams of impeachment died. And so now, they are in a panic mode to say, well, why could this be? We always thought Barr was going to be fine, we thought Mueller was the gold standard. Everything was fine. And so, if Mueller is still their gold standard they're holding on to, then someone has to be the bad guy, and Bill Barr, who has answered every one of their questions that they wanted, who has cooked for everything he's supposed to have done, they were making him out to be the bad guy. And really, it's a shame of the Democrats are now trying to make him out to be the bad guys simply because their storyline was wrong."

Because, you know, I wonder in this whole thing, I knew Democrats obviously were disappointed with the -- with the Attorney General. But you wonder if they weren't actually more disappointed with Robert Mueller. Because Robert Mueller did not deliver on obstruction. And when they read the report, they clearly feel that he should have. So, the attorneys including Emmet Flood from the White House wrote a letter, sent it to Bill Barr on their analysis of the legal basis of the report -- the special counsel's report. And in it, they talked about the fact that there's -- there are lines in this report written by the folks who put it together, who, you know, the president has gone after a lot on Twitter as being unfair to him. And saying that they did not -- in the report, it says, \"We did not exonerate the president.\" Here is what Emmet Flood wrote, \"Prosecutors simply are not in the business of establishing innocence. In the American justice system, innocence is presumed. There is never a need for prosecutors to conclusively determine it.\" What do you say to that?"

For Democrats who want to say that Bill Barr tried to skew the report or do whatever and then, here there's this misunderstanding with claiming him and Robert Mueller through a letter or anything else. He stated the facts correctly. He said that there was no collusion, he stated there is no charge to obstruction. And he even included the line that was actually in the Mueller report -- I thought was rather interesting for a career prosecutor to say, \"We don't exonerate.\" I'm not sure he's ever come out. I'd love to go back and look at a lot of his past writings or any prosecutors past writings to say, you know, at the end of this, we're not exonerating. We didn't charge, we're not exonerated. Emmet Flood is exactly right, prosecutors are not in the business of exonerating. They're either finding enough to charge or they're not finding enough to charge and they move on. This is a concern and I think it's really interesting to me though for Democrats to play on this right now, they can't have everybody be the bad person here. They've got at least holdout hope that they can find something in this report or something going along that they can actually take and make political haze so they can tarnish the president.

He took away the right of every member of that committee to question Bill Barr because he had this idea of having a circus stunt called putting a staff member to ask questions. At the end, I guess to catch the Attorney General may be in some discrepancy that they thought he said, and have it looked like an impeachment hearing. For over 200 years, there's never ever been a staff member asked questions in an oversight hearing in the House Judiciary Committee outside of impeachment. So, here is what they're going out and say, they say, well, it's an impeachment, we had staff here to make the assumption that this is a part of an impeachment investigation to smallify their base that dislikes the president, and members who dislike the president. So, they wanted it to appear like an impeachment hearing instead of just doing the oversight that our committee is supposed to be doing.

George Papadopoulos felt and he's written about it, and he talked about it here that there was a setup going on. That somebody was trying to dangle information in front of him in order to kind of ensnare him in and set him up to make it look like he was working with the Russians. Now, the FBI and the indications in this story are that the U.S. intelligence officers say, \"No, no, no, we were suspicious that there was something going on.

And the reality -- and what's fascinating about the New York Times story, if you read it, she asked him the question, was the Trump campaign working with the Russians? Pretty direct question. And now, 2-1/2 years, and $25 million later, we finally have the answer. No, they were not working with the Russians. So, now we need to get to the bottom of how did we spend 2-1/2 years and $25 million chasing a conspiracy theory down a rabbit hole? Because they weren't working with the Russians. That is a question that the American people deserve an answer to now, now that we have a definitive response to the -- I think from Mueller about the conspiracy.

But Barr was very clear that while we may have questions, we have no evidence of impropriety and I'm sure Barr knew about this New York Times thing that's being reported tonight. I think, Martha, taking a step back to 2016, the U.S. intelligence community and the FBI were getting multiple pieces of information and concerning reports about Russians trying to infiltrate campaigns here, and about certain things that were taking place. And it was their responsibility to make sure no Americans were working with them.

And let's be clear about this. I mean, yes, there was a -- we're looking into whether the Russians were meddling in the election. But the Russian collusion narrative was not about that. It was about whether the Trump campaign was actively involved with the Russians to essentially steal the 2016 election. And so now, you've got the New York Times admitting that back in September 2016, an FBI handler was sitting down with George Papadopoulos in a bar in London, directly asking him whether the Russians were involved with the Trump campaign."

The real story is, after all this -- Donald Trump just spent the last 2-1/2 years having members of Congress, former intelligence officials in the Obama administration, top officials from the previous administration calling him a traitor, calling him a Russian agent, saying that he -- that he conspired, betrayed our country, and was in, in a scandal worse than Watergate, and it was all untrue. It was all untrue. So, we need to find out what -- was there a corrupt motive for this investigation?

And if anyone reaches out to you from those countries, you should tell the FBI. They told the Trump campaign that. We know that. We also know the Trump campaign never told the FBI when in fact those entities reached out to them. And I also think just as Americans, we can look at the Mueller report and say yes, there was no conspiracy that he found. I think we should also be worried that he lays out in great detail that a campaign was at least willing to explore working with Russia, knew they would benefit from it. That's outlined in detail in the Mueller report. And then an administration tried at multiple points to shut down that investigation into what was going on.

Obviously, there was a lot of activity taking place connected to the Trump campaign, directed possibly by the Russians.

And when you just look at the IRS reports in the first a second week of reporting, over eight percent reduction, third week over 16 percent. That averages out, Martha, to about $539.00 per household. So did some Americans, a lot of Americans and maybe even you know many Americans, most Americans get a tax break that they didn't feel as Joe Biden said, did you feel it, yes.

But the deeper point is actually the ignorance that he showed and really applies to the corporate tax cut which was a big part of the package. Because the impact of that is actually to encourage companies to invest more in machinery and in expansion plans. That's what's happened. That leads to higher worker productivity and more jobs.

You can have record low unemployment, but if they don't feel financially more sound, that's not necessarily going to work going into 2020.

But then the woman who petition for a special counsel, former appellate court judge Sheila O'Brien put the brakes on by asking the judge to recuse himself because his son works for the Cook County state's attorney Kim Foxx. Judge Martin was clearly unhappy called the request unusual but agreed to consider it, so for at least the next weeks, the legal jockeying goes on. Former Judge O'Brien is fighting for a special prosecutor because she says there is a, quote, \"perception that justice was not served here, that Mr. Smollett received special treatment.\" States attorney Kim Foxx filed the motion arguing that a special prosecutor might duplicate or interfere with the investigation now underway by the Cook County inspector general. So, Foxx is now against the special prosecutor. But in late March she wrote an op-ed in the Chicago Tribune saying she was in favor of it, quoting, \"Let me state publicly and clearly that I welcome an outside nonpolitical review of how we handled this matter. I am not perfect, nor is any other prosecutor out there, but ensuring that I, and my office have our community's trust is paramount.\" Foxx has also filed a motion to prevent the release of original files and documents from her and her top deputy Joseph Magats, saying that former Judge O'Brien's request for information violates state law that prosecutors be allowed wide discretion in decisions about whether to charge or dismiss cases. Remember, Jussie Smollett was facing 16 felony counts for allegedly staging a hate crime, crime hoax. And days after the state's attorney's office laid out very compelling evidence against Jussie Smollett, the charges were suddenly dropped. Kim Foxx and her deputy Joseph Magats were not in court today, saying, they were not bound by subpoenas mandating their presence. Martha?"

You want an independent review, Ms. Knoxx? I'll give you one right now. I've been in the system for 26 years and yes, you have wide latitude but to plausibly analogize what Jussie Smollett to someone who nearly burns a draft card shows that either something nefarious was going on behind the scenes, or you have horrible judgment, in which case, you fail the people of Illinois."

But I think we have a culture within our leaders that is it's off-putting, it's saddening, it's very disheartening, and I think in particular, I think young people in our country look around and say, we are better than this.

They were fighting amongst themselves, let alone the rest of the country figuring out what to do with Civil Rights. Father Ted found an airplane, sent everyone up to Wisconsin and then went fishing for the weekend. And at the end of that fishing trip, they handed President Eisenhower their 12 recommendations. Those recommendations became the Civil Rights Act of 1964. So, it's that human, that kind touch that he had that was put to use for 50 years in American history. It's really an incredible --"

      "speaker": "KYLE",
      "utterance": "I think the biggest thing for me with grief is that it's such an individual process, such a personal experience because you may go through all stages at some point but at different levels. So, it's not predictable. And the biggest life lesson for me, I don't think that God created this mess, I think somebody chose evil, and he sees you through it. That's my faith and that's how that plays in. And I noticed that I'm a different person for having gone through it. It's the first time that I really couldn't plan it. Right? I couldn't even attempt to plan it because grief has a way of surprising you constantly. One day you wake up and you are just better, or one day you wake up and you are worse than you were six months ago in a certain way. Thinking that way taught me to let go and just accept that I am on a journey that I can't predict."

Little things don't bother me the way that they used to. I know what a big problem is and I know what's -- I know what a blessing it is to have strength. So \"American Spirit\" one of the reasons I was so driven to do this book is that when you look at obstacles and when you look at problems sometimes as it's the end of us or it's going to ruin us or our children or people we love, what I've learned is it's OK. It really is OK for people to be in a state of despair as long as somebody else shows up. Personal connection is what blesses everyone."

You know, it's a beautiful relationship, and I do feel him with me. I had a counselor one time asked me, because somebody was asking me why I can't even think about dating, and I had all the logical reasons and you know, I'm too busy, I can't this, I can't that, whatever. And I watched myself through it and I think I understand now, it's just that I wanted the dream. Right? And I had it. And so, it's the idea of somebody else taking that space is still really hard for me because it just, I think it makes me accept it on a different level. Right now, I can say, yes, he still with us, it's good, it's not the same, but we made this far, we're healthy, you know, I'm feeling like I like life again, and that's genuinely only been the truth for about six months. The place that Chris had I haven't quite figured out because I know it's not the place he was. And I still want that, but I know he's not there, and I think, it's just, you know, obviously, I have to -- I have to get to a place where it's just OK and I know logically, and I've counseled people through finding someone else. I've encouraged them to find someone else. I told Chris I would want him to find someone else if I died. I know that all logically, it's just emotionally I have to get to that place where I can admit that I don't have what I wanted, but it can look differently."

One was music and the other was starting a camp and that to me, the story behind this, Martha, is so cool because he went to camp as a kid and that summer camp changed his life. Now he has a camp, and he gets military kids there. Chris Kyle Foundation has supported the state-of-the art obstacle course that we can use with our, you know, couples and kids. He also helps kids with disabilities and everything he does a super cutting-edge, super high level. He raises tons of money to do things that are different.
