The president tweeting numerous times today about this, saying that \"We've lost $500 billion a year for many years on crazy trade with China. No more. Tariffs will bring in far more wealth into our country that even a phenomenal deal of the traditional kind, also much easier and quicker to do. Our farmers will do better, faster, and starving nations can now be helped. Waivers on some products will be granted or go to new source.\" He tweeted a few more times along those lines.  Let's bring in our panel and start there, Byron York, chief political correspondent for the \"Washington Examiner,\" Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at \"The Federalist,\" and at the White House on the North Lawn, Jeff Mason, White House correspondent for \"Reuters.\" Jeff, I'll start with you there. What is the sense at the White House about these talks?",

There were not too long ago the Secretary of the Treasury Steve Mnuchin, Larry Kudlow, and others were saying that a deal was close, that they were getting towards the final laps. And then there was a big setback a little over a week ago when China pulled back on some of its commitments within the draft agreement, nearly 150 page draft agreement that they've been working on.  And that, of course, was met with a lot of dissatisfaction by USTR, Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, and the rest of the team. And so that prompted the president on Sunday to increase tariffs, and now the talks ended today, as you said, without a deal, likely to continue on talks, but along at the same time, likely to have those tariffs continue, which means a longer trade war.",

The relationship between President Xi and myself remains a very strong one, and conversation into the future will continue. In the meantime, the United States has imposed tariffs on China which may or may not be removed depending on what happens with respect to future negotiations.\" So how does this play, and where does this come out? Obviously, farmers and a lot of people are feeling some pain already. Will they feel more, do you think? BRYON YORK, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, \"WASHINGTON EXAMINER\": They very well could. It seems to me that both sides have been feeling each other out and probably is calculating a little bit. And if there has been as much as we thought there was on issues like purchases from the United States, forced technology transfers, intellectual property theft, that kind of stuff, if there had been that much progress and the Chinese backed away from it, then they made a bad bet. They miscalculated. And now they've been hit with these tariffs, and they may have to retaliate. But it seems to me, how many years have we been hearing about these abuses from China? And Trump has finally taken a very strong position. As you saw Debbie Dingell, we've also heard Charles Schumer, he has some significant Democratic support on this. So it seems to me that he's going to stay where he is.",

MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR, \"THE FEDERALIST\": Senator Kennedy, earlier, you just had him saying that the only way to win a trade war is not to fight it. And that sort of assumes that you are totally fine with the trade situation as it is currently, that China can have high tariffs, that it can have these barriers to entry in their markets, that it can do intellectual property theft, and there's nothing we can do about it, or at least you can't do the stick approach, that you can only do the carrot approach. We have tried the carrot approach for decades. It has not resulted in a better situation in terms of American companies being able to enter the Chinese market, and so the question is, what are you going to do? Now we had been told a year ago when tariffs first started that we were going to see dramatic increases in consumer prices, that this was going to be just horrific for the economy. We are in a very good economy right now. A year later we can look and we can see that in fact consumer prices have not gone up that much. Inflation is holding, GDP is doing well, the job market is great, wages are great for the United States. China is hurting a little bit, so it will be curious, we'll have to see if they are feeling pressure to come back.",

      "utterance": "Those talks ended today without a deal, it seems. And so far, no definite time that they are going to continue with China. The president tweeting numerous times today about this, saying that \"We've lost $500 billion a year for many years on crazy trade with China. No more. Tariffs will bring in far more wealth into our country that even a phenomenal deal of the traditional kind, also much easier and quicker to do. Our farmers will do better, faster, and starving nations can now be helped. Waivers on some products will be granted or go to new source.\" He tweeted a few more times along those lines. Let's bring in our panel and start there, Byron York, chief political correspondent for the \"Washington Examiner,\" Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at \"The Federalist,\" and at the White House on the North Lawn, Jeff Mason, White House correspondent for \"Reuters.\" Jeff, I'll start with you there. What is the sense at the White House about these talks?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JEFF MASON, WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, REUTERS",
      "utterance": "That's a good question, Bret. I guess for starters the sense is that we didn't get where we thought we were going to get, at least over a week ago. There were not too long ago the Secretary of the Treasury Steve Mnuchin, Larry Kudlow, and others were saying that a deal was close, that they were getting towards the final laps. And then there was a big setback a little over a week ago when China pulled back on some of its commitments within the draft agreement, nearly 150 page draft agreement that they've been working on. And that, of course, was met with a lot of dissatisfaction by USTR, Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, and the rest of the team. And so that prompted the president on Sunday to increase tariffs, and now the talks ended today, as you said, without a deal, likely to continue on talks, but along at the same time, likely to have those tariffs continue, which means a longer trade war."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Byron, here's number four and number five tweets today. \"Over the course of the past few days, the United States and China have held candid and constructive conversations on the status of trade relationship between both countries. The relationship between President Xi and myself remains a very strong one, and conversation into the future will continue. In the meantime, the United States has imposed tariffs on China which may or may not be removed depending on what happens with respect to future negotiations.\" So how does this play, and where does this come out? Obviously, farmers and a lot of people are feeling some pain already. Will they feel more, do you think? BRYON YORK, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, \"WASHINGTON EXAMINER\": They very well could. It seems to me that both sides have been feeling each other out and probably is calculating a little bit. And if there has been as much as we thought there was on issues like purchases from the United States, forced technology transfers, intellectual property theft, that kind of stuff, if there had been that much progress and the Chinese backed away from it, then they made a bad bet. They miscalculated. And now they've been hit with these tariffs, and they may have to retaliate. But it seems to me, how many years have we been hearing about these abuses from China? And Trump has finally taken a very strong position. As you saw Debbie Dingell, we've also heard Charles Schumer, he has some significant Democratic support on this. So it seems to me that he's going to stay where he is."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "And Mollie, we should point out, it definitely hurts farmers here, but it hurts China. MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR, \"THE FEDERALIST\": Senator Kennedy, earlier, you just had him saying that the only way to win a trade war is not to fight it. And that sort of assumes that you are totally fine with the trade situation as it is currently, that China can have high tariffs, that it can have these barriers to entry in their markets, that it can do intellectual property theft, and there's nothing we can do about it, or at least you can't do the stick approach, that you can only do the carrot approach. We have tried the carrot approach for decades. It has not resulted in a better situation in terms of American companies being able to enter the Chinese market, and so the question is, what are you going to do? Now we had been told a year ago when tariffs first started that we were going to see dramatic increases in consumer prices, that this was going to be just horrific for the economy. We are in a very good economy right now. A year later we can look and we can see that in fact consumer prices have not gone up that much. Inflation is holding, GDP is doing well, the job market is great, wages are great for the United States. China is hurting a little bit, so it will be curious, we'll have to see if they are feeling pressure to come back."

I think it's also important that people be a little skeptical of what we are hearing right now. It doesn't seem to be in Iran's interest to launch an attack on the United States. We say that they are moving their missiles around, but it's important to remember that they've had missiles in their country for a long time. And so the provocative nature of some of what we are doing or how we are highlighting it is just kind of curious, particularly given that our sanctions against them are kind of going well. I think the United States needs to remember about being clear what it seeks from Iran and how what we are doing will accomplish that goal."

And then apparently there's this other issue of Joe Biden warning off a prosecutor who was looking into things. It was always kind of weird that the son of the vice president was given this plum position and the media didn't seem to be terribly interested in it at the time. Ukraine is becoming a much more interesting country to look too. They have already admitted to some light meddling against Donald Trump in the 2016 election.
