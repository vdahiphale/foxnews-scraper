      "sentences": "We are still waiting as well for that and we'll cover it as soon as it happens. Bret, good to see you tonight. Good evening, everybody. So, here is what we have got for you. The first 2020 Democrat Tom Steyer is the one to step up. He is siding with Republican calls now to end the secret impeachment hearings. He's calling on Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff and the others to let the American people see what is taking place behind those closed doors.  Ken Starr is here in a moment on that. Plus, Karl Rove joins me tonight. And Mike Huckabee all here on a very busy Friday night on “The Story.” But first, the runaway meltdown impeachment train.  What is it really? It's either a big nothing or an egregious abuse of power. The former is what the two-year Russian investigation turned out to be. The latter is what Democrats and some Republicans hope they will prove.  So, as Mitch McConnell interestingly is now telling his chamber to prepare for the possibility of a sixth day a week -- six to eight-week trial that could happen if the House impeaches the president. So, what did we get this week? We had a parade of aggrieved officials who say that they were shocked to have lost their portfolio of responsibilities to a trio who appears to have taken over U.S. policy with Ukraine. That is where this investigation is going at this point and that's the bigger part that Peggy Noonan wrote about this week that she says could begin to tip some of these scales perhaps.  Also, not a great day for the Biden side of this equation. They were not unscathed by the State Department testimonies. Career diplomat George Kent says that he worked in the Obama administration and he tried to raise some red flags about Hunter Biden's work in Ukraine. But he says nobody would listen. In fact, he says they blew him off. They didn't want to disturb the vice president was such a concern. He was grieving the loss of his son Beau.",

So, it's Independent Counsel Ken Starr found 11 possible grounds -- actual grounds for impeachment for President Bill Clinton.

The Speaker of the House of Representatives is third in the order of succession. So, she should follow the example of Newt Gingrich and Carl Albert during the Nixon years.

But in terms of the diplomats, the substance of their testimony, I can understand why they would be upset that there's this second track, but that has been done in American history. And what I think it boils down to is a policy and process dispute with the president of the United States as opposed to an impeachable offense of treason and bribery and other high crimes and misdemeanors.

New video does show black smoke billowing up from the ground as gunshots can be heard in the distance. At this hour, Kurdish-Syrian Democratic Forces are calling on international observers and the United Nations to step in and ensure the ceasefire is actually carried out. These are the same forces who earlier this month were allies of the United States. They are now operating under the direction of a Russian brigade linked to the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad. The President fired off a series of tweets this afternoon about the situation, at certain points echoing talking points of the Turkish government. In one tweet, Trump claims to have just been informed that some European countries will take back ISIS fighters who came to Syria to join the Islamic State. In another tweet, he writes, \"defeat terrorism,\" commenting on a similar tweet by Turkish President Erdogan, though everyone was not referencing the Kurds, he was actually referencing other enemies that he has. Now, as for Turkey and the Kurds, the President overnight did say at a rally in Dallas just last night, that he felt they needed to fight it out. Both sides needed to come and get it over with. He didn't commented on the geopolitical situation and the implications of the President's decision. And those implications are that Russia and Iran are both strengthened as a result of the American pullout from Syria. This is certainly a concern to us allies in the region, Martha.",

The FAA now says that Boeing withheld concerning messages between employees back in 2016 in which a senior pilot said, quote, \"basically lied to the regulators, unknowingly, and complained of egregious issues with the automated system.\" Chief breaking news correspondent Trace Gallagher here with that story for us tonight. Hi, Trace. TRACE GALLAGHER, ANCHOR & CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Martha. The key messages came from Mark Forkner who was not only Boeing's chief technical pilot but more importantly, he was in charge of the 737 MAX program when it was going through the FAA certification process. And his messages clearly show the company was aware of major problems with the MCAS system. That's the automated feature that's supposed to push the nose of the plane down so it doesn't stall. Instead the system repeatedly drove down the nose of two jets in Indonesia and Ethiopia causing them to crash, killing 346 people in both. In the 2016 messages, Forkner says, quote, \"it's running rampant in the sim.\" Meaning the flight simulator. Going on to say the feature was engaging itself like crazy and, quote, \"granted, I suck at flying but even this was egregious.\" And it's important to remember Boeing never added the new technology to the pilot manuals of the 737 MAX planes and pilots were never trained on it in simulators. Boeing has had these text messages for a while. But the FAA says the company just turned them over yesterday, calling it concerning. Quoting here. \"I understand that Boeing discovered the documents in its files months ago. I expect your explanation immediately.\" And late today Boeing released another statement in response to the FAA. Quoting again. \"Earlier this year, Boeing produced the same document to the appropriate investigating authority.\" Although the company didn't say exactly who that authority was. Boeing CEO is scheduled to be questioned by Congress at the end of this month. And you can bet the first question would be when did you know the MCAS system had a glitch? Martha?",

And maybe it's more important where the NBA ends up on this than where they started. Because, they were part, for the past 30 years, of an effort that I think both sides thought they were entering into in good faith to open up democracy, to shine sunlight as a disinfectant in China, to promote global relationships.

      "utterance": "We are still waiting as well for that and we'll cover it as soon as it happens. Bret, good to see you tonight. Good evening, everybody. So, here is what we have got for you. The first 2020 Democrat Tom Steyer is the one to step up. He is siding with Republican calls now to end the secret impeachment hearings. He's calling on Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff and the others to let the American people see what is taking place behind those closed doors. Ken Starr is here in a moment on that. Plus, Karl Rove joins me tonight. And Mike Huckabee all here on a very busy Friday night on “The Story.” But first, the runaway meltdown impeachment train. What is it really? It's either a big nothing or an egregious abuse of power. The former is what the two-year Russian investigation turned out to be. The latter is what Democrats and some Republicans hope they will prove. So, as Mitch McConnell interestingly is now telling his chamber to prepare for the possibility of a sixth day a week -- six to eight-week trial that could happen if the House impeaches the president. So, what did we get this week? We had a parade of aggrieved officials who say that they were shocked to have lost their portfolio of responsibilities to a trio who appears to have taken over U.S. policy with Ukraine. That is where this investigation is going at this point and that's the bigger part that Peggy Noonan wrote about this week that she says could begin to tip some of these scales perhaps. Also, not a great day for the Biden side of this equation. They were not unscathed by the State Department testimonies. Career diplomat George Kent says that he worked in the Obama administration and he tried to raise some red flags about Hunter Biden's work in Ukraine. But he says nobody would listen. In fact, he says they blew him off. They didn't want to disturb the vice president was such a concern. He was grieving the loss of his son Beau."

      "speaker": "DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT",
      "utterance": "He excoriated the Obama administration. And Joe Biden -- and Joe Biden's son saying that has tremendous problems -- tremendous problems with Joe Biden's son and the Ukraine. And I heard Schiff is going -- no, no, we don't want to talk about that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So, the Washington Post actually wrote about what George Kent said about raising those alarms about Hunter Biden's work. And then, Esquire scolded them for attempting to tell both sides of this story and especially for the fact that they used anonymous sources in doing so. The same folks who have purported -- who have supported countless stories about the president that were based on anonymous sources, but that never really seemed to bother them apparently. So, it's Independent Counsel Ken Starr found 11 possible grounds -- actual grounds for impeachment for President Bill Clinton. What does he make of where we are in all of this process as we get together to talk about it tonight? Ken, welcome. Good to have you here this evening."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So, I'm curious, you know, there's been a lot of discussion about the process here. The president obviously very unhappy that it happens behind closed doors, you get these drips and drabs that come out. And Peggy Noonan, saying that if Democrats want this process to be taken seriously, they really need to be a lot more serious about the way they approach it."
    },

      "speaker": "STARR",
      "utterance": "Peggy Noonan is exactly right. And I'm glad that some voices on the other side of the aisle are saying, let's be transparent and why are we doing all this behind closed doors? Frankly, that's not consistent with American tradition. It's not the way impeachments have been run in the past. So, why are we doing this? And let's also not forget one basic fact. The Speaker of the House of Representatives is third in the order of succession. So, she should follow the example of Newt Gingrich and Carl Albert during the Nixon years. And say, my hands are off this, I entrust this and she should have entrusted it to the House Judiciary Committee. Everything that has been done thus far is not consistent with our traditions and what's called in Washington regular order, and that's bad."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

      "utterance": "I think that's an insult to the witnesses who are being called. These are frequently career diplomats, some are political appointees, but they're people of integrity. Whatever their views may be about foreign policy. I think Adam Schiff needs to recognize with all due respect that he's not a prosecutor. He is representing now by virtue of being empowered by the Speaker, the people's House. This is the people's business. He is not engaged in a determination whether a crime should be permitted and therefore prosecuted through the grand jury process. So, he's conflating a grand jury process and it used to be a prosecutor. With now, the grand inquest of impeachment that the founding fathers never meant to be behind closed doors."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So, with regard to all of those who testified this week from the State Department, and the things that they said about having the Ukraine portfolio kind of taken away from them and adopted by Rudy Giuliani and others, how powerful did you think that their testimony was?

But in terms of the diplomats, the substance of their testimony, I can understand why they would be upset that there's this second track, but that has been done in American history. And what I think it boils down to is a policy and process dispute with the president of the United States as opposed to an impeachable offense of treason and bribery and other high crimes and misdemeanors. I do think that what we're doing is, we're elevating policy disputes and the process of foreign policy into an impeachment inquiry.

Fox News can confirm that a new round of fighting erupted today just two hours after the ceasefire took effect. There are also reports of multiple civilian casualties and deaths. New video does show black smoke billowing up from the ground as gunshots can be heard in the distance. At this hour, Kurdish-Syrian Democratic Forces are calling on international observers and the United Nations to step in and ensure the ceasefire is actually carried out. These are the same forces who earlier this month were allies of the United States. They are now operating under the direction of a Russian brigade linked to the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad. The President fired off a series of tweets this afternoon about the situation, at certain points echoing talking points of the Turkish government. In one tweet, Trump claims to have just been informed that some European countries will take back ISIS fighters who came to Syria to join the Islamic State. In another tweet, he writes, \"defeat terrorism,\" commenting on a similar tweet by Turkish President Erdogan, though everyone was not referencing the Kurds, he was actually referencing other enemies that he has. Now, as for Turkey and the Kurds, the President overnight did say at a rally in Dallas just last night, that he felt they needed to fight it out. Both sides needed to come and get it over with. He didn't commented on the geopolitical situation and the implications of the President's decision.

Ultimately, if the Soviet Union -- excuse me, Russia, meaning the future Soviet Union, wants to wants to handle the business of the Middle East and control it, then they can deal with that quagmire for the next 20 years. I mean, I'm a hawkish person who's believed in American strength, but at some point, you have to step back and reassess, because the Europeans can talk all they want. They're not doing anything about it. They won't even take back their citizens who went and fought for ISIS.

The FAA now says that Boeing withheld concerning messages between employees back in 2016 in which a senior pilot said, quote, \"basically lied to the regulators, unknowingly, and complained of egregious issues with the automated system.\" Chief breaking news correspondent Trace Gallagher here with that story for us tonight. Hi, Trace. TRACE GALLAGHER, ANCHOR & CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Martha. The key messages came from Mark Forkner who was not only Boeing's chief technical pilot but more importantly, he was in charge of the 737 MAX program when it was going through the FAA certification process. And his messages clearly show the company was aware of major problems with the MCAS system. That's the automated feature that's supposed to push the nose of the plane down so it doesn't stall. Instead the system repeatedly drove down the nose of two jets in Indonesia and Ethiopia causing them to crash, killing 346 people in both. In the 2016 messages, Forkner says, quote, \"it's running rampant in the sim.\" Meaning the flight simulator. Going on to say the feature was engaging itself like crazy and, quote, \"granted, I suck at flying but even this was egregious.\" And it's important to remember Boeing never added the new technology to the pilot manuals of the 737 MAX planes and pilots were never trained on it in simulators. Boeing has had these text messages for a while. But the FAA says the company just turned them over yesterday, calling it concerning. Quoting here. \"I understand that Boeing discovered the documents in its files months ago. I expect your explanation immediately.\" And late today Boeing released another statement in response to the FAA. Quoting again. \"Earlier this year, Boeing produced the same document to the appropriate investigating authority.\" Although the company didn't say exactly who that authority was. Boeing CEO is scheduled to be questioned by Congress at the end of this month. And you can bet the first question would be when did you know the MCAS system had a glitch? Martha?"

It is disgraceful. And quite frankly, Martha, when you sell yourself for money we know what that makes you. I won't say it on television but we know. And I think it is a disgrace to the NBA and to the sport. And it's really a reminder that the Chinese are not our real friends. They are in it for themselves."

But just to look at it from the NBA's perspective here for one moment. And it feels like Adam Silver is sort of strengthening his backbone on this issue as this moves forward. And maybe it's more important where the NBA ends up on this than where they started. Because, they were part, for the past 30 years, of an effort that I think both sides thought they were entering into in good faith to open up democracy, to shine sunlight as a disinfectant in China, to promote global relationships. Thinking that this was going to lead to a more open society in China. But what we are all learning now, through Hong Kong and through what's happening with the Muslims in the camps that are -- the Uighur camp that that just isn't happening. So, it looks like it's time for everybody to really reevaluate."

      "utterance": "So, yes. I mean, when you listen to a president saying that if you dissent, you're going to have your bones -- your body smashed and your bones ground to powder, I mean, that's a very clear message. That's coming from the president of the country, which is quite shocking. Now we also know these safe harbor laws are going into effect where China is plotting to block the U.S. military from ports. I also read that even with the situation going on in Syria and Turkey, they are looking to have greater influence in that part of the world as well. So, wherever we back away they are trying to move in. Correct?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HUCKABEE",

And a lot of it has to do with the president has pushed back very hard against China on the cheating, on the trade really scandal that they have been a part of. Stealing intellectual property rights. Pirating intellectual property. Over and over again. And because he has pushed back it's like they got their hands caught in the cookie jar and they are not happy about it. So, they're acting more like Mao Zedong than they are some modern reformist government that is really trying to be an international player. But what you just mentioned about the Chinese president, it is shocking. And let's hope the NBA is finding their spine, their guts and that they realize that some things aren't worth the money that they're being paid. It's just not. Freedom matters. And we are seeing it in the lives of those people out in Hong Kong waving our flag. I would love for the NBA players come back to America and wave our flag instead of taking a knee, take a stand."
