I was reading on Vox, something that you said, Harry, Trump language about Rocket Man and you weren't a big fan of the blunt talk. And I think that's what a lot of people thought. It was kind of funny, Rocket Man, but what was he getting at there. Harry now six months later, eight months later, nine months later, we're at this point were these two men are sitting down across the table. Now they have their closest advisors with them. And if it's true, again if, if, if, old practices and old prejudices, you saw with that script translated under Kim Jong Un, if that's really where we are, that could be the beginning of something really great, for not just the United States, the Korean Peninsula but for the world.",

Again, talking to White House officials ahead of this meeting, that one-on- one first kind of get to know you, let's shake hands and sit down and talk about where we are, where we've been and where we might be headed, is the most important aspect of today. The discussion is going on right now, the expanded bilateral meeting which include Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Chief of Staff John Kelly and John Bolton, who we know Kim Jong Un isn't particularly fond of. He's going to focus on issues of how they get moving with the process going forward. But there's still an open question here, Laura, about how sincere Kim Jong Un is about really giving his nuclear weapons. Don't forget the formula for North Korea has been, \"Well let's see if we can goad the United States into giving us some economic incentives. Let's see if we can goad them into giving us energy, let's see if we can goad them into giving other things\". Well does Kim Jong Un want to do that in exchange for completely denuclearizing or is he trying to get a deal where he gets something from the United States in exchange for a little piece of the nuclear program. But the President has said that he is not going to freeze in place a nuclear program and that's what's happened before negotiations between the United States and North Korea. The President says it's got to be rolled back and they have gone so far as to say, it has to be complete, it has to be irreversible and it has to be verifiable. Those are three really, really big challenges when it comes to North Korea. So I don't even know if the President will be able to get a full read today on exactly what Kim's intentions are. But at the very least, we've got this historic moment where an American President is sitting down with a North Korean leader for the very first time. They do seem to be on the same page with some issues and Mike Pompeo has said on a couple of occasions that on the two times that he's met with Kim Jong Un, Un has given him personal assurances that he wants to denuclearize. Why all of a sudden he wants to do that is anybody's guess but we'll see going forward Laura, whether or not the commitments to Mike Pompeo lasts with the President and whether it's a staunch enough and strong enough commitment that he will do the difficult work and, the amazingly difficult work, to roll back and eliminate North Korea's nuclear program. He has always seen this as the one way to keep his regime in place, the one way for his regime to survive. Now President Trump is offering him an alternative, we'll find out if he takes it, Laura.",

Chris I don't know if you could hear John Roberts there bit he's basically saying the idea that we're going to see Kim Jon Un come out and \"Okay we're going to denuclearize and oh it's all going to be great\". That's kind of pipe dream, however, he's never dealt with some like Trump before. This is a new ball game, a new President, with a different set of priorities and a different way forward which I think has rattled the old order. I think they're rattled by him and they don't know what is going to happen next but they're unsettled by it.",

      "sentences": "Listen I think both the optimism and the caution are both warranted in this case. Good evening to you, it's good morning here in Singapore, Laura. I mean on the one had its almost surreal to see these two men who just months ago were lobbying verbal ICBMs at each other. Little Rocket Man, the Dotard, standing together, shaking hands, meeting a certain level of courtesy, diplomatic approach to each other. It is stunning and you are quite right, it is a dramatic change of the order, the diplomatic order that we have seen over the last 50 years. And that is not to be minimized in any way, it a major accomplishment. On the other hand I think it is well to keep in mind that Kim Jong Un has given up nothing at this point. He has not given up a single nuclear bomb, he's not given up a single ICBM, he's not given up any of the nuclear infrastructure. Yes kind words, yes they're meeting, yes they're talking about process but he hasn't given up anything and we have to remember this is a country, North Korea, that's has made deals before, obviously with different Presidents and has backed off on all of them and reneged on all of them. So it's easy now looking back at the Regan Gorbachev Summit and say that was great and it changed the world and it ended the Soviet Union, and it brought down the Berlin wall. But that was not at all a player after the first summit and certainly after the second summit in Reykjavik which seemed to end in failure. So this is a very good an encouraging start and I agree, very positive in the sense that months ago we were talking about a hair trigger towards a nuclear confrontation, but at this point there have been no actions taken by North Korea in terms of denuclearizing and as they used to say during the Reagan years, the devil is in the details.",

And there does seem to be a look here for the dark cloud and the silver lining here, you know that's absurd and in addition, whatever happened in that 45 minutes, the fact is they're now having a meeting with their, not full national security teams, but a lot of their top advisors. Look, I think we should be hopeful, I mean remember where we were a few months ago when President Trump was threatening fire and fury and there was a sense as I say, we were on a hair trigger. And President Trump actually went to some of his top advisors and said maybe we should pull all the US dependence, thousands of them, out of South Korea because it's such a dangerous situation. We're a long way from there and that's all to the good. But again, you know we haven't really seen any firm commitment and we still don't know this question of denuclearization. Does that mean that Kim Jong Un is going to give up his entire nuclear arsenal, what is he going to demand in return in terms of the US holding back, taking down its nuclear umbrella, yes we don't have nukes on the South Korean mainland, but we do have nukes on the planes that fly over from Guam. We do have planes on ships and on submarines in the area, as part of our nuclear umbrella to protect South Korea and Japan and a lot of the people in the US don't want to see that given up. I will say one thing that concerns me a little bit in the opening meeting that was on camera when the President said, \"It's a tremendous honor to be here with you and I think we are going to have a terrific relationship\". I shouldn't be giving advice to the President but I don't think we should be giving away too much. Kim gets a lot by just having this meeting. It does boost his prestige, it does--",

I wonder, given the fact that Kim and President Moon of South Korea will have a relationship, we understand that the Chinese now are not as tough on the sanctions that they were forced to impose on North Korea. The President may say, \"I'm not giving you anything until you start to denuclearize\", but in fact has the maximum pressure regime, will it weaken, not because of the US but in a sense, Kim is on the world stage and things have been normalized.",

A lot of Chinese blood spilled in the Korean Peninsula, they have been thwarting sanctions, even those luxury gifts you pointed out the other day. They filmed the luxury gifts that Xi gave to Kim Jong Un and his family and you're not even supposed to do that.

And that is really the result of skillful diplomacy on the part of the President. You know President Trump started out by saying his number one foreign policy goal was disarming North Korea, and we hadn't heard a President say that before and because of that, we have seen over the course of is 500 and so days, essentially a focus of North Korea. That's why we're at Singapore right now and that's actually fantastic when you think about what we have done, not only the threats but also the maximum pressure of sanctions which have cut North Korea's international payments by half.

Ad one thing that's Trump officials say they find frankly amusing is that when a top Korean official was in the oval office about a week or so ago to hand deliver that letter from Kim Jong Un to President Trump.  There were stories in the Washington Post and elsewhere with former Clinton officials questioning why they had done such a photo op, that this was such a propaganda coup for Kim Jong Un and his regime. And top Trump officials will say in private, look they tried it that way, they said, \"Oh we can't do photo ops, we can't actually do direct meetings. We can't continue pressing sanctions at the same time and none of their previous ways actually worked\". And what's fascinating is they are now at the negotiating table, at least, a long way to go has been noted by your panel but beyond that I can tell you something new that secretary of State Mike Pompeo told us a short time ago before these talks commenced, which is that they are not, inside the Trump administration, going to pull back on the crippling sanctions that have put Kim Jong Un in a corner, pushed him to the point of potentially going broke. They're not pulling back on those sanctions until they have a path to denuclearization from Kim Jong Un in these negotiations. Now, he may never offer that, we'll have to see where it goes, but they're insisting they're going to take a tough line there and in fact I can tell you that Mike Pompeo added that if Kim Jong Un does not take this opportunity, they may increase US sanctions against North Korea which have already been crippling. And so the bottom line is you put facts together with what President Trump was saying before the summit that this is a once in a lifetime opportunity for North Korea and if they don't take it, that opportunity will never be there again. That raises the stakes big time, Laura.",

So why could it be different this time? Let's go back to our panel here in Washington to discuss that.

Let's ask experts how China and Russia may react to any deal and its impact.

Gentlemen, there is so much I want to unpack with you. Michael, I want to start with you, because much has been made of Kim Jong Un's historical affection for his grandfather and where his grandfather was in conversations with I think it was Jimmy Carter back in '93, end of 93, and he died three weeks later. He even looks kind of heavy. He looks a lot like his grandfather in many ways. How does that play into this, and then your reaction on the Russia-China issue?",

When Kim Jong Il took over in 94 that's when the famine started getting worse. He even launched a campaign called let's eat two meals a day instead of three so say that having less food is a good thing. So even his clothing is a throwback. I have the same suit Kim Jong Un is wearing. I got it in North Korea. I think it looks better on me. But the point is very much optics are a function there of the regime. And anything he can do to channel his grandfather's energy, and in fact by law, only a descendant of the great leader Kim Il-sung can be the North Korean leader which is one of the reasons why he had his elder brother assassinated because if there is no Kim Jong-nam to take over, it's not like there's a Mike Pence.

And in addition, this is a two-prong win for us Laura. So we win thousands of voters who see Trump as a reasonable alternative, and secondly they lose thousands of customers for their crap movies like \"Dirty Grandpa\" and \"Meet the Fockers 6\" or whatever De Niro was in.

One quick update, Larry Kudlow, chief economic advisor, the White House put out a statement he suffered a mild heart attack earlier today. He is in good condition and according to his doctors and will make a full and speedy recovery. The most important thing on the table right now, and this is the big unknown for the U.S. delegation and the one that they are most concerned about, and that is, is Kim Jong Un sincere about wanting to give up his nuclear weapons program? Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was twice told in person by Kim that he is sincere about it. I asked the president about it on the south lawn of the White House and again in a press conference in the rose garden, do you think Kim is sincere? The president said he believes he is.  But giving up the nuclear weapons would really go against everything North Korea has been doing for the last few decades. But the president believes, at least on the surface, that Kim Jong un is willing to do that. But just in case the president has reminded all the way along that there are sanctions are going to remain in place for North Korea, and there is another package of sanctions that's ready to go if North Korea decides to bail out of these talks. And we heard the president talk about it when he was in Quebec, saying that this is the one shot that Kim Jong Un has got to do this. This is an opportunity that's not going to come around again. And then the unspoken part of that is, it's not going to work well for Kim if he doesn't come to the table here and deal with the United States and continues to pursue his nuclear program because this president has made it very clear, Laura, that he is not going to tolerate a North Korea that has a nuclear weapon that can be mounted on an intercontinental ballistic missile and fired at virtually any city in the United States. We will hear a lot more about this when the president has a press conference this afternoon at 4:00. That is going to be one of the more fastening press conferences that I have ever been to.

Harry Kazianis is a North Korea expert and the Director of Defense Studies at the Center for National Interest, and Dr. Walid Phares is a Fox News National Security and foreign affairs analyst. All right gentlemen we have a lot to get through. I had to stop myself tonight and had to pinch myself, is this actually happening? We don't know what will ultimately transpire here but go back six months ago to last fall. I was reading on Vox, something that you said, Harry, Trump language about Rocket Man and you weren't a big fan of the blunt talk. And I think that's what a lot of people thought. It was kind of funny, Rocket Man, but what was he getting at there. Harry now six months later, eight months later, nine months later, we're at this point were these two men are sitting down across the table. Now they have their closest advisors with them.

The mainstream media networks you were referred to, are trying to imply this is some kind of silly mistake, or how did this all happen? And what we are actually seeing in these pictures is somebody coerced with military threats, exercises massive sanctions to come into Singapore. It's our idea to come to Singapore, not his idea.

Now what they are trying to do in the 49 point epsilon is basically how to engage the world about it and what would be the plan. I am very confident that what they have agreed on is going to be announced. Now of course you were mentioning the criticism. The criticism is because mainstream media, which I call now opposition media didn't understand, that's what they called them basically, they didn't understand what was happening inside North Korea and how our administration understood and seized the moment.

      "utterance": "We've been watching this unfold not just today Laura, but over the last few weeks as well and things seem to be going well. The body language is good, off the top of this. Again, talking to White House officials ahead of this meeting, that one-on- one first kind of get to know you, let's shake hands and sit down and talk about where we are, where we've been and where we might be headed, is the most important aspect of today. The discussion is going on right now, the expanded bilateral meeting which include Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Chief of Staff John Kelly and John Bolton, who we know Kim Jong Un isn't particularly fond of. He's going to focus on issues of how they get moving with the process going forward. But there's still an open question here, Laura, about how sincere Kim Jong Un is about really giving his nuclear weapons. Don't forget the formula for North Korea has been, \"Well let's see if we can goad the United States into giving us some economic incentives. Let's see if we can goad them into giving us energy, let's see if we can goad them into giving other things\". Well does Kim Jong Un want to do that in exchange for completely denuclearizing or is he trying to get a deal where he gets something from the United States in exchange for a little piece of the nuclear program. But the President has said that he is not going to freeze in place a nuclear program and that's what's happened before negotiations between the United States and North Korea. The President says it's got to be rolled back and they have gone so far as to say, it has to be complete, it has to be irreversible and it has to be verifiable. Those are three really, really big challenges when it comes to North Korea. So I don't even know if the President will be able to get a full read today on exactly what Kim's intentions are. But at the very least, we've got this historic moment where an American President is sitting down with a North Korean leader for the very first time. They do seem to be on the same page with some issues and Mike Pompeo has said on a couple of occasions that on the two times that he's met with Kim Jong Un, Un has given him personal assurances that he wants to denuclearize. Why all of a sudden he wants to do that is anybody's guess but we'll see going forward Laura, whether or not the commitments to Mike Pompeo lasts with the President and whether it's a staunch enough and strong enough commitment that he will do the difficult work and, the amazingly difficult work, to roll back and eliminate North Korea's nuclear program. He has always seen this as the one way to keep his regime in place, the one way for his regime to survive. Now President Trump is offering him an alternative, we'll find out if he takes it, Laura."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",

So let's get some context on all of tonight's developments from someone who has covered summits like these before. Fox News Sunday Anchor, Chris Wallace, who is also in Singapore. Chris I don't know if you could hear John Roberts there bit he's basically saying the idea that we're going to see Kim Jon Un come out and \"Okay we're going to denuclearize and oh it's all going to be great\". That's kind of pipe dream, however, he's never dealt with some like Trump before. This is a new ball game, a new President, with a different set of priorities and a different way forward which I think has rattled the old order. I think they're rattled by him and they don't know what is going to happen next but they're unsettled by it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS ANCHOR",
      "utterance": "Listen I think both the optimism and the caution are both warranted in this case. Good evening to you, it's good morning here in Singapore, Laura. I mean on the one had its almost surreal to see these two men who just months ago were lobbying verbal ICBMs at each other. Little Rocket Man, the Dotard, standing together, shaking hands, meeting a certain level of courtesy, diplomatic approach to each other. It is stunning and you are quite right, it is a dramatic change of the order, the diplomatic order that we have seen over the last 50 years. And that is not to be minimized in any way, it a major accomplishment. On the other hand I think it is well to keep in mind that Kim Jong Un has given up nothing at this point. He has not given up a single nuclear bomb, he's not given up a single ICBM, he's not given up any of the nuclear infrastructure. Yes kind words, yes they're meeting, yes they're talking about process but he hasn't given up anything and we have to remember this is a country, North Korea, that's has made deals before, obviously with different Presidents and has backed off on all of them and reneged on all of them. So it's easy now looking back at the Regan Gorbachev Summit and say that was great and it changed the world and it ended the Soviet Union, and it brought down the Berlin wall. But that was not at all a player after the first summit and certainly after the second summit in Reykjavik which seemed to end in failure. So this is a very good an encouraging start and I agree, very positive in the sense that months ago we were talking about a hair trigger towards a nuclear confrontation, but at this point there have been no actions taken by North Korea in terms of denuclearizing and as they used to say during the Reagan years, the devil is in the details."

And there does seem to be a look here for the dark cloud and the silver lining here, you know that's absurd and in addition, whatever happened in that 45 minutes, the fact is they're now having a meeting with their, not full national security teams, but a lot of their top advisors. Look, I think we should be hopeful, I mean remember where we were a few months ago when President Trump was threatening fire and fury and there was a sense as I say, we were on a hair trigger. And President Trump actually went to some of his top advisors and said maybe we should pull all the US dependence, thousands of them, out of South Korea because it's such a dangerous situation. We're a long way from there and that's all to the good. But again, you know we haven't really seen any firm commitment and we still don't know this question of denuclearization. Does that mean that Kim Jong Un is going to give up his entire nuclear arsenal, what is he going to demand in return in terms of the US holding back, taking down its nuclear umbrella, yes we don't have nukes on the South Korean mainland, but we do have nukes on the planes that fly over from Guam. We do have planes on ships and on submarines in the area, as part of our nuclear umbrella to protect South Korea and Japan and a lot of the people in the US don't want to see that given up. I will say one thing that concerns me a little bit in the opening meeting that was on camera when the President said, \"It's a tremendous honor to be here with you and I think we are going to have a terrific relationship\". I shouldn't be giving advice to the President but I don't think we should be giving away too much. Kim gets a lot by just having this meeting. It does boost his prestige, it does--"

I mean whatever, that's just the way Trump is , he's not like Madeline Albright back in 2000 when she met Kim Jong Il, she said, \"It's a great pleasure to meet you\". Nobody was freaking out when she said it was a great pleasure to meet Kim Jong Il but she did that and you know, it didn't work."

The main reason, even for all the rhetoric, the main reason that Kim is here, he didn't suddenly decide he wants to be in Jeffersonian Democrat is because of the maximum pressure which goes far beyond anything that any previous President has done in terms of really tightening the economic screws and getting China to go along. I wonder, given the fact that Kim and President Moon of South Korea will have a relationship, we understand that the Chinese now are not as tough on the sanctions that they were forced to impose on North Korea. The President may say, \"I'm not giving you anything until you start to denuclearize\", but in fact has the maximum pressure regime, will it weaken, not because of the US but in a sense, Kim is on the world stage and things have been normalized."

So I think he's hard to predict there but I think it's cautionary note. Chris Wallace, thank you so much from Singapore, great reporting and let's get back to the panel still with me in New York is Gordon Chang. With me in Washington of course, Mike Pillsbury, Harry Kazionis and Dr. Walid Phares. All right Gordon we have to get to you, we just brought up the issue of China of course and I think back to the Korean War by some estimates China lost, I think it was 900,000 casualties, in the Korean War. A lot of Chinese blood spilled in the Korean Peninsula, they have been thwarting sanctions, even those luxury gifts you pointed out the other day. They filmed the luxury gifts that Xi gave to Kim Jong Un and his family and you're not even supposed to do that. All the banks that trade and use the banking system in China, they help North Korea out. But they haven't been unhelpful, correct?"

The problem is you back two or three months, maybe four months, China's sanctions enforcement has deteriorated. You know, the important thing here, Laura is that President Trump has created a momentum. This momentum I think, is pushing Kim in a direction he may not want to go, but nonetheless he's being there. And that is really the result of skillful diplomacy on the part of the President. You know President Trump started out by saying his number one foreign policy goal was disarming North Korea, and we hadn't heard a President say that before and because of that, we have seen over the course of is 500 and so days, essentially a focus of North Korea. That's why we're at Singapore right now and that's actually fantastic when you think about what we have done, not only the threats but also the maximum pressure of sanctions which have cut North Korea's international payments by half. That's a significant advance."

In fact China got stronger and stronger and stronger. Mike's written an entire book about this, and now we're at a point where again, cautiously optimistic. He's at the table, Kim's at the table because he's out of money. He has some money but his people are starving and he wants legitimacy, he wants legitimacy on the world stage. Who knows if he's going to be able to denuclearize or even has the appetite for it, but if he's going to do something, there's going to be a gradual denuclearization, for gradual lifting of sanctions, don't you think?

History in the making. President Trump and the North Korean Leader, Kim Jong Un just wrapped up their historic summit at the top of the hour and Trump is trying to exceed, let's face it, where so many presidents have failed, and put an end to the Hermit King's nuclear program. Let's get the very latest in Singapore from Chief National Correspondent Ed Henry, Ed."

      "speaker": "ED HENRY, FOX CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Laura good to see you. You're right, here on the ground in Singapore, one thing that top Trump officials have been talking about is the fact that previous administrations, Democrat and Republican have tried the same thing over, over and over again and left us in this position where when Donald Trump took office, North Korea was closing in on the ability to miniaturize nuclear warheads. That they could then attach two missiles and potentially reach the continent of the US. That is why these talks are so urgent. Ad one thing that's Trump officials say they find frankly amusing is that when a top Korean official was in the oval office about a week or so ago to hand deliver that letter from Kim Jong Un to President Trump. There were stories in the Washington Post and elsewhere with former Clinton officials questioning why they had done such a photo op, that this was such a propaganda coup for Kim Jong Un and his regime. And top Trump officials will say in private, look they tried it that way, they said, \"Oh we can't do photo ops, we can't actually do direct meetings. We can't continue pressing sanctions at the same time and none of their previous ways actually worked\". And what's fascinating is they are now at the negotiating table, at least, a long way to go has been noted by your panel but beyond that I can tell you something new that secretary of State Mike Pompeo told us a short time ago before these talks commenced, which is that they are not, inside the Trump administration, going to pull back on the crippling sanctions that have put Kim Jong Un in a corner, pushed him to the point of potentially going broke. They're not pulling back on those sanctions until they have a path to denuclearization from Kim Jong Un in these negotiations. Now, he may never offer that, we'll have to see where it goes, but they're insisting they're going to take a tough line there and in fact I can tell you that Mike Pompeo added that if Kim Jong Un does not take this opportunity, they may increase US sanctions against North Korea which have already been crippling. And so the bottom line is you put facts together with what President Trump was saying before the summit that this is a once in a lifetime opportunity for North Korea and if they don't take it, that opportunity will never be there again. That raises the stakes big time, Laura."

So why could it be different this time? Let's go back to our panel here in Washington to discuss that. Mike Pillsbury, Harry Kazianis, Dr. Walid Phares, Mike, you want to address a point as a former government official, how things really go behind closed doors and how we talk about them as members of the media, we want to be very careful.

And the other thing is to put pressure on them when we start our aid and the nukes are not around. So it's a question of strategy, at this point in time I think what is happening right now is the first stage. And the first stage is to get a commitment as it happened with Yeltsin. Remember, at the end of the Soviet Union he said our missiles are not directed at you. That was chapter one. That's what we need. That's what our citizens want.

China will want a say in any nuke deal because North Korea has been dependent on Beijing for food, energy, and trade. And Russia fears the summit could impact its reputation as a major dealmaker in east Asia. According to an online piece by former Russian diplomat Vladimir Frolov. Let's ask experts how China and Russia may react to any deal and its impact. We welcome historian Victor Davis Hanson of Stanford's Hoover Institution, Michael Malice, biographer and author of the book \"Dear Reader, The Unauthorized Biography of Kim Jong Il,\" and rejoining us, Gordon Chang. Gentlemen, there is so much I want to unpack with you. Michael, I want to start with you, because much has been made of Kim Jong Un's historical affection for his grandfather and where his grandfather was in conversations with I think it was Jimmy Carter back in '93, end of 93, and he died three weeks later. He even looks kind of heavy. He looks a lot like his grandfather in many ways. How does that play into this, and then your reaction on the Russia-China issue?"

He is doing a throwback to his grandfather, the great leader Kim Il-sung, who was the founder of North Korea, who is very much revered to this day even by refugees as one of the greatest people who's ever lived. When Kim Jong Il took over in 94 that's when the famine started getting worse. He even launched a campaign called let's eat two meals a day instead of three so say that having less food is a good thing. So even his clothing is a throwback. I have the same suit Kim Jong Un is wearing. I got it in North Korea. I think it looks better on me. But the point is very much optics are a function there of the regime. And anything he can do to channel his grandfather's energy, and in fact by law, only a descendant of the great leader Kim Il-sung can be the North Korean leader which is one of the reasons why he had his elder brother assassinated because if there is no Kim Jong-nam to take over, it's not like there's a Mike Pence. You have to stick with what you have."

Otherwise it had been out of the Middle East for almost 40 hours. So it's going to try to repeat that, punch above its weight and wiggle in. It has a border with North Korea, and offer some type of triangulation, maybe help with Iran or something. China, North Korea wouldn't be nuclear if it wasn't for China. It wants a nuclear North Korea but it doesn't want a nuclear war. It wants a sort of pit bull on a Chinese leash it occasionally lets go and consumes American attention and resources and it feigns ignorance of what's happened. So it is perplexed right now. It's even scared maybe. It seems impossible to imagine that maybe North Korea might gravitate away toward China. And that's something. As far as the Iranians, that's really interesting because this is their pipeline for nuclear technology, North Korea and China. And all the conventional wisdom said if you walk away from the Iran deal you can't cut a deal with North Korea. In fact the opposite is true."

Once they made that decision to point a missile at Portland, Trump is basically saying you not only lost the missiles, you lost your entire nuclear program, and that's where we want to be. And I think he can do it. And the other thing is, we are going to get medieval pretty soon because these sanctions are really biting. In the past under the agreed framework and the six party talks, strategic patience, we always let up. I don't think Trump will, and Kim knows it."

If we have to have our flag next to theirs as we talk to them, so be it. The important point here right now is that President Trump is talking about a relationship with the North Koreans. That is going to scare the Chinese and the Russians as well because it means that we can then have one more friend in Asia, and China will have one less friend. And by the way, Laura, that one less friend, North Korea, is China's only formal ally. And so this undercuts the narrative of China being the global hegemon, the U.S. in terminal decline, that the Chinese will rule east Asia, all of that goes out the window in one summit.

But when Mao Zedong was looking at how North Korea and the North Koreans were developing and Kim Il-sung and they were going to the old Stalinist ways. They were abandoning Marxism-Leninism. But it was the cult of personality. I know Victor has written about this extensively as has Gordon, as has you. The cult of personality with Mao in China, the Great Leap Forward, and also with Kim Il Sung, and to some extent with this young man who is his grandson. We can't look away from that dynamic either."

And when they put it up originally it was plated in gold. And the Chinese government in the 70s said we are communist regimes. We shouldn't be plating giant idols of our leaders in gold, so they changed it to bronze. But very North Korea is the function of this personality cult. In their literature they attack the idea that a personality cult is a bad idea because from their perspective it is only the leader who bestows political life onto the population. So you can't really separate the two. However, that does give Kim Jong Un some leeway in the fact that since the leaders will and ideas are law, he's free to do whatever he wants, including contradict himself, and everyone will stand and applaud him. And Laura, I'm going to make one more point. When you played that clip earlier of Ben Rhodes, if you can't pronounce Kim Jong Un's name correctly, maybe you shouldn't be flapping your gums on this issue and stay in your lane."

Chris, have at it. This dynastic situation, the 34-year-old has more experience with these matters than Donald Trump. Kim Jong Un is wearing a pair of depends at this bilateral meeting, OK. That's my view. He's holding it in. This guy is willing to go to the mat militarily to denuclearize the peninsula and stop my missile tests. Rocket man, and he called him an old man six months ago. And now he's sitting there across the table with Trump with John Bolton present who he said he would not meet with, by the way, before. Your reaction to this?"

Sometimes you've just got to talk, and I guess that's where she was going with the comment, trying to make something happen on TV. Look, I think that most people hope that this summit goes well, that the United States comes to an agreement where North Korea denuclearizes, and of course we welcome them back into the family of nations, plus we secure the borders for our allies in South Korea and in Japan, and we see some action on human rights in North Korea. That's what I'm hoping for. If that comes out of that, I will say yay, Mr. President."

We heard from Bill Maher over the weekend that he hopes the economic collapse which would devastate American families coast to coast, he wants an economic collapse to get rid of Trump. So in the Hollywood elite, when they were flipping off the president last night at the Tony awards, I guess it was in New York, flipping off the president. They are all giving him a standing ovation, Robert De Niro, oh, you're so brave, Robert, \"Meet the Fockers.\" And this is where they are. The elites on the left want this president to fail. To hell with nuclear war. You have to have nuclear war to get Trump then I think half of them are OK with that. I'm not exaggerating."

I mean this when I say this, I know this may sound bizarre, but we should really be thanking De Niro and Bill Maher and Nancy Pelosi for her whoop-de-do and crumbs comments about the economy. I mean it. I know it's painful to hear, it is. You hear it, and you're like they can't be this dumb, but they are, because each time they say this, you can chalk up thousands of more people who are realizing what the Democrats really are and what they have been. And in addition, this is a two-prong win for us Laura. So we win thousands of voters who see Trump as a reasonable alternative, and secondly they lose thousands of customers for their crap movies like \"Dirty Grandpa\" and \"Meet the Fockers 6\" or whatever De Niro was in. So this is a double win for us. Chris, you know I'm right, too."

Let's go back to chief White House White House correspondent John Roberts in Singapore for the very latest on what he's hearing about the upcoming working lunch between Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un. I want to know what's on the menu. I'm getting hungry. We were talking about appetizers earlier here John and foodstuffs and In and Out Burgers. Come on, give us some flavor here."

      "speaker": "JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "One thing I can tell you, I don't know what's on the menu but there is very good food here in Singapore. One quick update, Larry Kudlow, chief economic advisor, the White House put out a statement he suffered a mild heart attack earlier today. He is in good condition and according to his doctors and will make a full and speedy recovery. The most important thing on the table right now, and this is the big unknown for the U.S. delegation and the one that they are most concerned about, and that is, is Kim Jong Un sincere about wanting to give up his nuclear weapons program? Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was twice told in person by Kim that he is sincere about it. I asked the president about it on the south lawn of the White House and again in a press conference in the rose garden, do you think Kim is sincere? The president said he believes he is. But giving up the nuclear weapons would really go against everything North Korea has been doing for the last few decades. But the president believes, at least on the surface, that Kim Jong un is willing to do that. But just in case the president has reminded all the way along that there are sanctions are going to remain in place for North Korea, and there is another package of sanctions that's ready to go if North Korea decides to bail out of these talks. And we heard the president talk about it when he was in Quebec, saying that this is the one shot that Kim Jong Un has got to do this. This is an opportunity that's not going to come around again. And then the unspoken part of that is, it's not going to work well for Kim if he doesn't come to the table here and deal with the United States and continues to pursue his nuclear program because this president has made it very clear, Laura, that he is not going to tolerate a North Korea that has a nuclear weapon that can be mounted on an intercontinental ballistic missile and fired at virtually any city in the United States. We will hear a lot more about this when the president has a press conference this afternoon at 4:00. That is going to be one of the more fastening press conferences that I have ever been to. We'll bring it to you."

It's going to be incredible, historic. You've got to wake up for this kind of stuff. So the two of them will stand side-by- side. The question is whether they will leave representatives behind even when the president is wheels up coming back to the United States. No one else could have pulled this off. So far, cautiously so good. We pass the baton now to Shannon Bream and the fantastic \"Fox News @ Night\" team for continuing coverage of the Singapore summit. Shannon?
