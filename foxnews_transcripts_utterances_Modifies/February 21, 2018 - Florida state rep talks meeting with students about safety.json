I can't tell you how brave these kids are. To have seen and gone through what they just did, and then within days making a trip up here to speak with legislators, it's remarkable. And I had probably one of the best discussions that I have had yet on this topic with these kids.",

It's about building that puzzle work together to make sure that our schools are safe, that mental health issues are in place, that someone like this, this monster, Nikolas Cruz, can never get his hands on a weapon whatsoever ever again. And then if someone like this does want to cause harm, that they're not able to get into a school and cause this kind of mass tragedy on our children.",

And we talked about, if we ban it, does this even solve the problem? If we ban assault rifles today -- and mind you, what is the definition of assault rifle? It might be something different to you, to me.  A bill that was discussed or was proposed to be brought up through tactics yesterday was an outright ban on all guns together. We have a Second Amendment in this country. We have a constitutional right to protect ourselves.   And we can look at that and have discussions to make sure that people that are mentally ill are not getting their hands on weapons. But we cannot do an outright strip of guns altogether. So, let's look at that and have that discussion. We will do so. But even if we were ever to even discuss an outright ban, we will still have mass killings in this country. So, we need to look at ways to make sure that those mental health checks are in place, that people like this, this monster, are not getting their hands on weapons, and beyond that, make sure that our schools are secure and safe, because even if they can't get their hands on a gun, they can get their hands on a knife or a vehicle, whatever it is they want to do to inflict the most harm possible.",
