And it feels kind of like it was -- the strike was a gesture. Because it was -- we're done here, like after that happened, we were done. And there was a lot of -- there was a lot of rumor and a lot of pretty substantiated rumor that this was a bad thing. But, you know, they wouldn't -- they wouldn't admit it. Now they are. And I really do think he was under pressure to act. And that's why they acted and they did -- and they did a horrible, horrible thing. You know, it's been eight or nine months in this administration and their mantra should be a lot went wrong because, I mean, this White House right now is a mess. The situation is terrible in Afghanistan right now. There are still people trapped there. I hope that the people are happy we got rid of a president because of his mean tweets, and in exchange what you got is a president who's just mucking it all up. But there were people that voted a guy out because emotionally it was damaging. It was causing the sleepless nights.  But he happened also to be a peacemaker, right? He didn't drone anybody, right? He didn't -- he didn't make the worst foreign policy decision and -- or implementation of a decision in the last five decades. That's -- I'm the nice guy. The nice guy who lets you sleep at night but then he does absolutely horrible things.   So, I'm always like -- I'm always going to vote for the jerk. Because you know what? You're harder on the jerk.

And the fact that General Milley hasn't resigned over those 12 marines and navy medic who were killed, who were bombed to death. And then who did they get the intel from? That's what I want to know. Where did they get the intel? Because I think you're right. It was absolutely rushed. It was totally political. Was it from the Taliban?

There were drone strikes in Syria, there were drone strikes in Iraq, there were drones strike in Somalia, that happened outside of the spotlight, out of the headlines, no journalist covered it. Those families are still suffering today. And they're not going to get any money. They're not going to get journalist coverage. They won't get interviews. They won't be talked about on this show or any other show. And they're suffering in silence because of bad drone policy that honestly should get bipartisan rebuke, the idea that people are being struck in the middle of night -- in the middle of the night with no -- just like as Kennedy said poignantly, shoot and then aim later. And in this case, it's very clear. And I watched the entire press conference earlier today, if they had just waited a second, or two seconds, or a minute later on this drone, they could say, this is actually water and it's not an explosive.

Heads would only roll if we collectively come together in 2022 and 2024 to vote this administration out and everyone that's perpetuating it. There will only be accountability and heads rolling if the mainstream media gets its act together and presses back on this. Now to you point earlier, you know, the action that Americans were calling for, it was to extract Americans, it was to protect allies. It was to process Afghans in an efficient, legitimate way, not acting with, quote, \"reasonable certainty\" as General McKenzie said earlier which was the aiming certainty that they had before this drone, the I.D. certainty that they had before this drone.   It's like that commercial, that insurance one, where that family is paying for the house. And they're like, we think we can pay. And then the comedian comes in and he's like, you think you can? Would you say that, you know, about bees? Like, I think I can outrun this Doberman, I think I can outrun this bee sting. There are certain things where reasonable certainty is unacceptable. And that drone strike was one of them. General McKenzie said today that moving forward he would have to use a heightened standard absolutely.  But to your point, that's the argument against this over the horizon capability that under this administration has been furthered, which is that without U.S. intel and troops on the ground, we are relying on the Taliban. We're relying on intercepted communications, video feed to get this intel at what cost? The cost of life. And American lives at that. This administration continues to fumble everything.

They didn't walk on foot from Brazil to America's southern border, a journey that takes almost 15 months, right? And they're on the southern border. They are waiting to qualify for asylum. Many of them can't qualify for asylum because of title 52 which is a program that says because of health restrictions, you cannot cross that border. Because of America's clogged immigration courts, they are not seeing an immigration judge. So this is a story about delays in the immigration courts and an un- modernized immigration court system has caused many of these folks that would qualify for temporary protective status to be -- as you just said, Emily, to be in a situation where there's a humanitarian crisis on the southern border by the people that will qualify for humanitarian asylum in the United States. We are a giving country, right? That's why we have Lady Liberty a couple of miles from here. These individuals who -- is who we should be giving to.",

Was it based on limited info just to help the administration politically, right? Because, you know, he came out and he was very, we're going to do something, we're going to do something. And it feels kind of like it was -- the strike was a gesture. Because it was -- we're done here, like after that happened, we were done. And there was a lot of -- there was a lot of rumor and a lot of pretty substantiated rumor that this was a bad thing. But, you know, they wouldn't -- they wouldn't admit it. Now they are. And I really do think he was under pressure to act. And that's why they acted and they did -- and they did a horrible, horrible thing. You know, it's been eight or nine months in this administration and their mantra should be a lot went wrong because, I mean, this White House right now is a mess. The situation is terrible in Afghanistan right now. There are still people trapped there. I hope that the people are happy we got rid of a president because of his mean tweets, and in exchange what you got is a president who's just mucking it all up. But there were people that voted a guy out because emotionally it was damaging. It was causing the sleepless nights. But he happened also to be a peacemaker, right? He didn't drone anybody, right? He didn't -- he didn't make the worst foreign policy decision and -- or implementation of a decision in the last five decades. That's -- I'm the nice guy. The nice guy who lets you sleep at night but then he does absolutely horrible things. So, I'm always like -- I'm always going to vote for the jerk. Because you know what? You're harder on the jerk.

They are doing so much harm to this country by trying to make this OK. They have lied to us on Afghanistan for 20 years. They thought they would continue to do so. And the fact that General Milley hasn't resigned over those 12 marines and navy medic who were killed, who were bombed to death. And then who did they get the intel from? That's what I want to know. Where did they get the intel? Because I think you're right. It was absolutely rushed. It was totally political. Was it from the Taliban?

There were drone strikes in Syria, there were drone strikes in Iraq, there were drones strike in Somalia, that happened outside of the spotlight, out of the headlines, no journalist covered it. Those families are still suffering today. And they're not going to get any money. They're not going to get journalist coverage. They won't get interviews. They won't be talked about on this show or any other show. And they're suffering in silence because of bad drone policy that honestly should get bipartisan rebuke, the idea that people are being struck in the middle of night -- in the middle of the night with no -- just like as Kennedy said poignantly, shoot and then aim later. And in this case, it's very clear. And I watched the entire press conference earlier today, if they had just waited a second, or two seconds, or a minute later on this drone, they could say, this is actually water and it's not an explosive. This is actually not going to the airport. They're going to drop water off to people. This could have been better handled."

Heads would only roll if we collectively come together in 2022 and 2024 to vote this administration out and everyone that's perpetuating it. There will only be accountability and heads rolling if the mainstream media gets its act together and presses back on this. Now to you point earlier, you know, the action that Americans were calling for, it was to extract Americans, it was to protect allies. It was to process Afghans in an efficient, legitimate way, not acting with, quote, \"reasonable certainty\" as General McKenzie said earlier which was the aiming certainty that they had before this drone, the I.D. certainty that they had before this drone. It's like that commercial, that insurance one, where that family is paying for the house. And they're like, we think we can pay. And then the comedian comes in and he's like, you think you can? Would you say that, you know, about bees? Like, I think I can outrun this Doberman, I think I can outrun this bee sting. There are certain things where reasonable certainty is unacceptable. And that drone strike was one of them. General McKenzie said today that moving forward he would have to use a heightened standard absolutely. But to your point, that's the argument against this over the horizon capability that under this administration has been furthered, which is that without U.S. intel and troops on the ground, we are relying on the Taliban. We're relying on intercepted communications, video feed to get this intel at what cost? The cost of life. And American lives at that. This administration continues to fumble everything.

However, remember, New York City public schools shut down at 3 percent. So, which is it? What is the priority of this administration?

Many of those people have been through two earthquakes, two hurricanes. Many of them left the country of Haiti. They got on ships and went to Brazil. They didn't walk on foot from Brazil to America's southern border, a journey that takes almost 15 months, right? And they're on the southern border. They are waiting to qualify for asylum. Many of them can't qualify for asylum because of title 52 which is a program that says because of health restrictions, you cannot cross that border. Because of America's clogged immigration courts, they are not seeing an immigration judge. So this is a story about delays in the immigration courts and an un- modernized immigration court system has caused many of these folks that would qualify for temporary protective status to be -- as you just said, Emily, to be in a situation where there's a humanitarian crisis on the southern border by the people that will qualify for humanitarian asylum in the United States.

It also seems that to some extent some of these governors are playing politics as well. Because you, a couple of days ago, Governor DeSantis had anti-vaxxers at his rally and he's like, I'm not sure what they said. I don't know if they were really there. And there's video tape of the anti-vaxxers being there.

When he was the one that was touting the booster, it's so political. And then the own FDA comes out with a vote of 16-2 that says, no, thank you. And then only when it comes to 65 and older -- when the wording, by the way, the first question posed to them was literally like, should we give the booster six months later? And most of them said absolutely no way. That second question updated 90 minutes later had the qualifications of a legal brief. Is it more likely than not? If you more than not? I mean, it was -- I literally had to sit there for five minutes to understand the questions. And that only then did it pass unanimously. So, I think the ripple effect of confusion, my point is, is completely under his watch. And it will go not only forward but also it goes back. This is a president that, to your point too, stokes division. He sows hatred among Americans. He tells the vaccinated they should be angry at the unvaxxed. He says they should be condemned. If you're a celebrity, however, he'll answer your legitimate questions about the vaccine by inviting you to the White House and talking about it. But he answers the rest of our questions, our fellow American's questions with the mandates, anger, and condemnation. I want my fellow Americans to be supported and their questions to be answered. But under this President's watch, all they will get is his anger that should be reserved for the Taliban and for the virus itself."

If you have more people in certain states who are going to require treatment, send the treatment there. You know, this idea of equity that is really taken hold this socialistic idea that is ill-defined, it's not appropriate in a medical setting. And when you politicize a medical setting and sacrifice people's lives, you're really dumb, like you're a bad politician. And also, at same point for Texas applies to Florida.

So, while he was so focused on mandates and masks, people are dying and he needs to get these people help. Donald Trump was giving people ships masks, PPE, ventilators.

That moment gave rise to an idea, fused together two American passions into one, sharing the love of the game and the grill. The company has been engraving baseball bat grilling tools. They partnered with pitching for baseball, worked for the Negro League Hall of Fame, and more charities. Charlie made these two amazing grilling tools for myself, which is incredible, you guys. And this one features the best baseball team of all time, which is the El Cerrito High School Gauchos."

That's Bernardo, and there he is at Disney tipping his hat to all the princesses like a chivalrous young man. Snow White, Merida, every time one of the gals walked by, tip of the hat."
