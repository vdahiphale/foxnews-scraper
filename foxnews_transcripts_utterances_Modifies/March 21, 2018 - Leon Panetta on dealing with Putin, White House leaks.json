The fake news media is crazed because they wanted me to excoriate him. They're wrong. Getting along with Russia and others is a good thing, not a bad thing. They can help solve problems with North Korea, Syria, Ukraine, ISIS, Iran, and even the coming arms race.'  'Bush tried to get along, but didn't have the smarts. Obama and Clinton tried, but didn't have the energy or chemistry. Remember reset. Peace through strength.'  Reaction right now from Leon Panetta, of course, our former defense secretary, CIA director, former top official for a number of presidents.  Very good to have you, sir. Thank you for joining us.",
