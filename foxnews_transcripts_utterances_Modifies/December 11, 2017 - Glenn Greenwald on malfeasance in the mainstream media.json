      "sentences": "Good evening from Washington. This is \"The Ingraham Angle.\" It's been a big news day here in the nation's capital and in New York City where an ISIS follower botched a terror attack, a pipe bomb strapped to his chest malfunctioned after detonation at the Port Authority subway station, one of the city's main transportation.  Surprise, surprise, he got into America via -- wait for it -- chain migration. So, isn't it time to ditch this dangerous policy finally? I'm going to ask Univision anchor, Jorge Ramos, what he thinks of the chain migration debate in light of today's event.  And with accusations of partisanship surrounding the Mueller investigation, former federal prosecutor, Andy McCarthy, will be here to explain how the Mueller probe may be missing the most important Russia story of all.  But first, the media's desperate attempt to divert attention from their repeated screw-ups. That is the subject of tonight's Angle. It wasn't just another fake news story attempting to tie President Trump to Russia. CNN's disgraceful reporting of last week seems like a watershed moment. A blatant example of the establishment media's reckless coverage of the so- called Russia collusion story. On Friday, you'll recall CNN reported that Wikileaks tried to share hack documents with the Trump campaign and Don Trump Jr. back in September of 2016.  That report was quickly picked up by other news organizations. But it turned out, those documents had already been made public and the dates of the Don Jr. e-mails by CNN were false. The bombshell quickly blew up in CNN's face. CNN never retracted the story, but took five hours to post a correction after it was debunked. On Sunday, the host of CNN's \"Reliable Sources,\" Brian a.k.a. \"Shulet\" (ph) Stelter refused to explain how the network got the story so wrong.  Instead, he trotted out that old Watergate dinosaur, Carl Bernstein, and the perpetual Trump critic, David Fromm, who both ignored the question of how CNN botched the story. Though, they did revert to the CNN party line and they attacked the president.   BRIAN STELTER, CNN HOST, \"RELIABLE SOURCES\": The sources weren't trying to trick the reporter. The sources were just mistaken, but that mistake obviously caused a black eye for CNN.",

      "sentences": "Wait a second. Now CNN concocts a damaging story about the president and they only did so because they're trying to be utterly fair to him? I'm not following any of this. I need to buy a major vowel or two.  The media are destroying their credibility by allowing politics to dominate editorial decisions and color their reporting. This is no way to build public confidence. By the way, it's not just CNN.   ABC's Brian Ross reported that Candidate Trump instructed Michael Flynn to reach out to the Russians when it was actually President-elect Trump. Oops! \"The Washington Post\" reporter, Dave Wiegle, let's not forget him. He tweeted a photo from the Trump rally in Florida on Friday showing lots of empty seats. Didn't look good. It turns out, he took the picture before the audience had actually entered the arena. Cute. He did apologize later. Not surprisingly, polls show the American public is losing faith in how the media are covering Trump.  A Quinnipiac poll last month found 58 percent of American voters disapprove of the way the media covers the president while only 38 percent approve. Fifty three percent of voters said the media focuses too much on negative stories about Trump. So, the media's answer today? More negative stories about Trump. In an attempt to revive some slagging ratings and distract from their own journalistic and sex abuse scandals, the network dragged out Trump accusers again.  The president, of course, has denied these accusations, but that didn't stop Megyn Kelly from showcasing them on her struggling morning show. So much for staying out of politics. Didn't she say she was going to do that?  Well, they then held a press conference sponsored by a Soros-backed group called \"Brave New Films.\" Peel back the curtain a little bit, Brave New Films describes itself as a quick strike media company that has produced a string of liberal documentaries. Establishment media tripped over themselves to take the bait and turned today's White House press briefing into a total circus.",

      "sentences": "North Korea. But this is a huge issue. It's a huge issue for a media obsessed with driving Trump from office at all costs. Well, now, on the day before the Alabama Senate election, as we predicted last week when Democrats ran Al Franken out of the Senate, without so much as a scheduled hearing, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand is calling for President Trump to resign from office.  This is a craven attempt to weaken the president with these choreographed allegation parades, but my friends, they won't work. But at least now it's easier to see with whom certain media organizations are colluding and to what end? That's \"The Angle.\" One Pulitzer Prize winning journalist is sounding the alarm. He's painting a dangerous scenario of what happens without a free and honest media. Glenn Greenwald wrote an article in \"The Intercept\" titled, \"The U.S. media suffered its most humiliating debacle in ages and now refuses all transparency over what happened.\"  With us to give us more insight is Greenwald himself joining us now from Rio de Janeiro in Brazil. Glenn, it's great to see you. Recap for my audience what you wrote about over the weekend about why particularly this CNN issue is so disturbing given the enormity of the story regarding President Trump and the Russians  GLENN GREENWALD, JOURNALIST AND CO-FOUNDER, \"THE INTERCEPT\": Right. So, you described exactly how the story fell apart. It is certainly the case that anyone in journalism, whether people at Fox or anywhere else will get stories wrong sometimes. This is not just a blockbuster story that fell apart, but what is most disturbing is two things. One, it's a long line now of stories about Trump and Russia that major media outlets have trumpeted in a very flamboyant way only for those stories to completely fall apart upon minimal scrutiny always going in the same direction of trying to prove that Trump really did collude with the Russian in a criminal way and that Russia is essentially taking over the United States.  So, it's not one mistakes it's a huge series of them always toward the same outcome and same agenda. The second and more disturbing thing for me, Laura, is the question of how it is that not just CNN but ultimately CBS and MSNBC that said they confirmed the story got it wrong. They all claimed that multiple sources told them that this e-mail sent to Don Jr. was dated before the Wikileaks Publications became public. How did multiple sources all get the same date wrong when talking to multiple media organizations? It's impossible to think about how that can be.",

If multiple sources -- I think the date was the -- missing one digit. The 4th or the 14th, something like that. So, given that case, how could multiple people read a number wrong or transmit it incorrectly? To me, that on its face seems very far-fetched.",

I mean, it seems like it's was a deliberate attempt to mislead, in which case they have the obligation to say which members of Congress, probably Democrats on the Intelligence Committee were the ones that gave them that false information. But if it wasn't deliberate, they have the obligation to say how it happened. Instead, they brought a CNN employees, Carl Bernstein and David Fromm, who spent two days defending CNN, on to pretend that they were willing to talk about it.   They didn't bring me on when I talk about Fox News and all of its many flaws and may mistakes and humiliations, which have taken place this year, CNN immediately invites me on and Fox doesn't. That's the reverse that happens when I write about CNN. Fox loves to have me on and CNN won't. I think that really is the issue. I don't want it implied that this is a problem unique to CNN and MSNBC. Fox has had its share of incredibly embarrassing mistakes also in the direction of its own political agenda. The problem is that media outlets are vulcanized. They talk only to their audiences and they don't have any transparency or accountability duties, and that I think is what is ruining journalism.",

We have \"The New York Times\" coming out with stories that they have to correct. Obviously, CBS, Washington Post sometimes repeats the false stories that other networks are printing.

What you're seeing in this story is the exact opposite. Virtually, 100 percent of the mistakes that outlets like CNN and \"The Washington Post\" and MSNBC make are designed to undermine and subvert Donald Trump and bolster the Russia Trump story like all of Fox's mistakes are in the opposite direction.  I don't mean your show, which is only a couple of months old. I mean, the two that Donald Trump loves to watch most, which is the morning show full of disinformation and the evening show that precedes yours.  That's the problem in journalism.

In fact their report even says the fact that we render a judgment doesn't mean that we can prove it as a matter of fact. And the problem that we have with Mueller's investigation is it's a prosecutorial exercise, which means you have to prove every essential element of the scheme, of the crime, beyond a reasonable doubt to the satisfaction unanimously of 12 jurors. So even if it's OK for the intelligence community for the sake of protecting the country to assume that Russia has these operations against our country doesn't relieve Mueller of the need to prove it beyond a reasonable doubt. I don't think he can. The intelligence report says it would compromise methods and sources of intelligence, so they don't want to make those available.

So the fact that Flynn ended up pleading guilty to lying in that interview was not Strzok's idea. Evidently Strzok wasn't pushing that. That was the very aggressive Mueller investigators toward the end. So I just want to see all the facts on him come in, Laura. But I think your general point about Mueller's poor judgment in larding this ridiculously inflated 17-lawyer team with Democratic donors and activists is not only a big problem for the integrity of the investigation. I think we're ultimately going to find that the real collusion story of the 2016 election was the way that the Obama administration put the law enforcement and intelligence arms of the administration in the service of the Clinton campaign. And a lot of these Mueller lawyers come from the top levels of the Obama Justice Department.",

      "utterance": "Good evening from Washington. This is \"The Ingraham Angle.\" It's been a big news day here in the nation's capital and in New York City where an ISIS follower botched a terror attack, a pipe bomb strapped to his chest malfunctioned after detonation at the Port Authority subway station, one of the city's main transportation. Surprise, surprise, he got into America via -- wait for it -- chain migration. So, isn't it time to ditch this dangerous policy finally? I'm going to ask Univision anchor, Jorge Ramos, what he thinks of the chain migration debate in light of today's event. And with accusations of partisanship surrounding the Mueller investigation, former federal prosecutor, Andy McCarthy, will be here to explain how the Mueller probe may be missing the most important Russia story of all. But first, the media's desperate attempt to divert attention from their repeated screw-ups. That is the subject of tonight's Angle. It wasn't just another fake news story attempting to tie President Trump to Russia. CNN's disgraceful reporting of last week seems like a watershed moment. A blatant example of the establishment media's reckless coverage of the so- called Russia collusion story. On Friday, you'll recall CNN reported that Wikileaks tried to share hack documents with the Trump campaign and Don Trump Jr. back in September of 2016. That report was quickly picked up by other news organizations. But it turned out, those documents had already been made public and the dates of the Don Jr. e-mails by CNN were false. The bombshell quickly blew up in CNN's face. CNN never retracted the story, but took five hours to post a correction after it was debunked. On Sunday, the host of CNN's \"Reliable Sources,\" Brian a.k.a. \"Shulet\" (ph) Stelter refused to explain how the network got the story so wrong. Instead, he trotted out that old Watergate dinosaur, Carl Bernstein, and the perpetual Trump critic, David Fromm, who both ignored the question of how CNN botched the story. Though, they did revert to the CNN party line and they attacked the president. BRIAN STELTER, CNN HOST, \"RELIABLE SOURCES\": The sources weren't trying to trick the reporter. The sources were just mistaken, but that mistake obviously caused a black eye for CNN."

      "utterance": "Wait a second. Now CNN concocts a damaging story about the president and they only did so because they're trying to be utterly fair to him? I'm not following any of this. I need to buy a major vowel or two. The media are destroying their credibility by allowing politics to dominate editorial decisions and color their reporting. This is no way to build public confidence. By the way, it's not just CNN. ABC's Brian Ross reported that Candidate Trump instructed Michael Flynn to reach out to the Russians when it was actually President-elect Trump. Oops! \"The Washington Post\" reporter, Dave Wiegle, let's not forget him. He tweeted a photo from the Trump rally in Florida on Friday showing lots of empty seats. Didn't look good. It turns out, he took the picture before the audience had actually entered the arena. Cute. He did apologize later. Not surprisingly, polls show the American public is losing faith in how the media are covering Trump. A Quinnipiac poll last month found 58 percent of American voters disapprove of the way the media covers the president while only 38 percent approve. Fifty three percent of voters said the media focuses too much on negative stories about Trump. So, the media's answer today? More negative stories about Trump. In an attempt to revive some slagging ratings and distract from their own journalistic and sex abuse scandals, the network dragged out Trump accusers again. The president, of course, has denied these accusations, but that didn't stop Megyn Kelly from showcasing them on her struggling morning show. So much for staying out of politics. Didn't she say she was going to do that? Well, they then held a press conference sponsored by a Soros-backed group called \"Brave New Films.\" Peel back the curtain a little bit, Brave New Films describes itself as a quick strike media company that has produced a string of liberal documentaries. Establishment media tripped over themselves to take the bait and turned today's White House press briefing into a total circus."

      "utterance": "North Korea. But this is a huge issue. It's a huge issue for a media obsessed with driving Trump from office at all costs. Well, now, on the day before the Alabama Senate election, as we predicted last week when Democrats ran Al Franken out of the Senate, without so much as a scheduled hearing, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand is calling for President Trump to resign from office. This is a craven attempt to weaken the president with these choreographed allegation parades, but my friends, they won't work. But at least now it's easier to see with whom certain media organizations are colluding and to what end? That's \"The Angle.\" One Pulitzer Prize winning journalist is sounding the alarm. He's painting a dangerous scenario of what happens without a free and honest media. Glenn Greenwald wrote an article in \"The Intercept\" titled, \"The U.S. media suffered its most humiliating debacle in ages and now refuses all transparency over what happened.\" With us to give us more insight is Greenwald himself joining us now from Rio de Janeiro in Brazil. Glenn, it's great to see you. Recap for my audience what you wrote about over the weekend about why particularly this CNN issue is so disturbing given the enormity of the story regarding President Trump and the Russians GLENN GREENWALD, JOURNALIST AND CO-FOUNDER, \"THE INTERCEPT\": Right. So, you described exactly how the story fell apart. It is certainly the case that anyone in journalism, whether people at Fox or anywhere else will get stories wrong sometimes. This is not just a blockbuster story that fell apart, but what is most disturbing is two things. One, it's a long line now of stories about Trump and Russia that major media outlets have trumpeted in a very flamboyant way only for those stories to completely fall apart upon minimal scrutiny always going in the same direction of trying to prove that Trump really did collude with the Russian in a criminal way and that Russia is essentially taking over the United States. So, it's not one mistakes it's a huge series of them always toward the same outcome and same agenda. The second and more disturbing thing for me, Laura, is the question of how it is that not just CNN but ultimately CBS and MSNBC that said they confirmed the story got it wrong. They all claimed that multiple sources told them that this e-mail sent to Don Jr. was dated before the Wikileaks Publications became public. How did multiple sources all get the same date wrong when talking to multiple media organizations? It's impossible to think about how that can be."

      "utterance": "Glenn, they refused to say over the weekend when they trotted out David Fromm and Carl Bernstein, who has been dining out on Watergate for 40 plus years, they won't even entertain questions about that or go into that at all. If multiple sources -- I think the date was the -- missing one digit. The 4th or the 14th, something like that. So, given that case, how could multiple people read a number wrong or transmit it incorrectly? To me, that on its face seems very far-fetched."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GREENWALD",
      "utterance": "Right, exactly. I mean, it seems like it's was a deliberate attempt to mislead, in which case they have the obligation to say which members of Congress, probably Democrats on the Intelligence Committee were the ones that gave them that false information. But if it wasn't deliberate, they have the obligation to say how it happened. Instead, they brought a CNN employees, Carl Bernstein and David Fromm, who spent two days defending CNN, on to pretend that they were willing to talk about it. They didn't bring me on when I talk about Fox News and all of its many flaws and may mistakes and humiliations, which have taken place this year, CNN immediately invites me on and Fox doesn't. That's the reverse that happens when I write about CNN. Fox loves to have me on and CNN won't. I think that really is the issue. I don't want it implied that this is a problem unique to CNN and MSNBC. Fox has had its share of incredibly embarrassing mistakes also in the direction of its own political agenda. The problem is that media outlets are vulcanized. They talk only to their audiences and they don't have any transparency or accountability duties, and that I think is what is ruining journalism."

    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "First of all, if I get something wrong, Glenn, you have an open invitation to correct me. I'm not a perfect person, believe me. If I get something wrong, I'm happy to have you on and have a conversation with it. I'm not sure what you're talking about there. I want more people on my show. Sometimes we have trouble getting people that are Democrats on the show or liberals. I'm always welcoming more voices. I'm happy to have you on for that. It's not just CNN. We have \"The New York Times\" coming out with stories that they have to correct. Obviously, CBS, Washington Post sometimes repeats the false stories that other networks are printing. Sometimes what they say is there's a rush to get news out. It's just because of the speed of the internet. Is that a plausible explanation here?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GREENWALD",
      "utterance": "No, I don't think so. What I said in my article, if people were making mistakes journalistically because they were rushing or because human beings are fallible as we all are, you would expect roughly 50 percent of the mistakes to go in one direction and 50 percent to go in the other direction. What you're seeing in this story is the exact opposite. Virtually, 100 percent of the mistakes that outlets like CNN and \"The Washington Post\" and MSNBC make are designed to undermine and subvert Donald Trump and bolster the Russia Trump story like all of Fox's mistakes are in the opposite direction. I don't mean your show, which is only a couple of months old. I mean, the two that Donald Trump loves to watch most, which is the morning show full of disinformation and the evening show that precedes yours. That's the problem in journalism. These mistakes stop looking like mistakes when they always go in the same direction and are always bolstering the same political agenda. You're seeing that around most media outlets and not just the ones that we are discussing."

There was in fact just a couple months ago, a document that was circulating around the internet that purported to identify men in the media who had misbehaved with sexual misconduct and it was entirely anonymous. Everyone in the media read it. People talked about it. It's so offensive as a lawyer, if you care about due process, a human being that cares about ethics and basic fairness to allow people who are accused the opportunity to defense themselves, which they can't do, if they're being smeared with anonymous attacks."

It's very difficult for men or women and I understand there's a lot of people hurt out there. At some point, we have to have some due process before we destroy people's careers. Glenn, I really appreciated your piece and thank you very much for joining. Now with reaction from New York. We're joined by Ari Fleischer, former White House press secretary under George W.

Gallup asked a question, do you have faith in the media to tell the news fully, fairly, and accurately. It hit an all-time low 32 percent in September '16. Think about what that means. The core mission of journalism is to tell the facts is being doubted by the American people astonishingly large numbers. In the past week made it even worse, yes, mistakes happen, but in the case of the Wikileaks what Donald Trump Jr. said, it's not credible what CNN is saying. It's just not. It's hard to understand two completely independent sources could both make the same mistake to CNN and MSNBC and CBS. It doesn't add up. So, what CNN really does need to do for the sake of credibility is just explain it. Walk people through the reporting, how did you get the information, how did it come to be so wrong, what did your sources said when you confronted them and said how come you got it wrong? We should learn those answers."

But chain migration is really family reunification. It's been in the law since 1965. For me when President Trump says that he wants to end chain migration, those are code words.

They'll still be allowed to come in and parents will be allowed to come in. Adult children -- stay with me -- adult children of green card holders or legal immigrants and extended relatives, which has ballooned the number of immigrants in the United States.

Macron devised a grant competition after President Trump announced in June that he would withdraw the U.S. from the 2015 Paris climate accord.

    {
      "speaker": "MCCARTHY",
      "utterance": "Laura, I want to be clear. I'm not questioning the finding of the intelligence community. I would stipulate that Russia had a cyber- espionage operation against the 2016 election. But what we all need to focus on is the fact that that is an intelligence judgment. It's a probability. In fact their report even says the fact that we render a judgment doesn't mean that we can prove it as a matter of fact. And the problem that we have with Mueller's investigation is it's a prosecutorial exercise, which means you have to prove every essential element of the scheme, of the crime, beyond a reasonable doubt to the satisfaction unanimously of 12 jurors. So even if it's OK for the intelligence community for the sake of protecting the country to assume that Russia has these operations against our country doesn't relieve Mueller of the need to prove it beyond a reasonable doubt. I don't think he can. The intelligence report says it would compromise methods and sources of intelligence, so they don't want to make those available. And we know that the FBI never even physically took custody of and did an examination, its own examination of the Democratic National Committee servers which are the key evidence in the case."

    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "And you also point out in your piece that they based, they real jump on their investigation -- when Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, he basically panicked and called for a special counsel. That's my view. He was freaking out that the Democrats on Capitol Hill were asking questions. Instead of answering them, he panics and appoints Mueller. But Mueller is facing, his investigation with Rosenstein on the contacts with Russia, which during a campaign, as you point out, that's not a big deal. Most campaigns have some contacts with Russia. It's the second question which is the operative one."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCCARTHY",
      "utterance": "Yes, the Clinton campaign and people in it had plenty of contacts with Russia, right? The thing that would make contacts problematic or incriminating is if they indicated complicity in an actual espionage scheme. But you never even get there until you can prove the espionage in the first place. And I just don't think he can."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Andy, let's go to Peter Strzok, Jeannie Rhee, Andrew Weissman, questions raised about other people in the FBI lately about their ability to be truly objective in looking at this investigation. To my eye we have a lot of individuals who are not just -- they're not just Democrats. They are Trump adversaries in their previous associations and in their texts or tweets or commentary during debates and so forth. You sort of have -- the jury is out for you on Peter Strzok. Why?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCCARTHY",
      "utterance": "Because as I understand it and as Comey testified to a closed session, according to the Wall Street Journal, as then FBI director Comey testified to a closed session of the House Intelligence Committee in March, the reason they hadn't brought any case against Flynn at that point is because the agents who interviewed him believed him, and that was Strzok. So the fact that Flynn ended up pleading guilty to lying in that interview was not Strzok's idea. Evidently Strzok wasn't pushing that. That was the very aggressive Mueller investigators toward the end. So I just want to see all the facts on him come in, Laura. But I think your general point about Mueller's poor judgment in larding this ridiculously inflated 17-lawyer team with Democratic donors and activists is not only a big problem for the integrity of the investigation. I think we're ultimately going to find that the real collusion story of the 2016 election was the way that the Obama administration put the law enforcement and intelligence arms of the administration in the service of the Clinton campaign. And a lot of these Mueller lawyers come from the top levels of the Obama Justice Department."

How did he get here? The answer is chain migration. Let's dive deeper into this with Monica Crowley who is with the London Center for Policy Research, and she's all over this story. Monica, once again we are struck by chain migrants who come to the country as part of an extended family or the adult children of an illegal immigrant, and they don't assimilate and they go on in this case almost to wreak real havoc on the subway system.

Donald Trump, one of the most powerful reasons he was elected president is because he ran on the platform of reforming our immigration system, which has failed us miserably. Case in point, once again today here in New York City. Ending chain migration, stopping the diversity lottery visa program, building the wall, enforcing our borders, ending sanctuary cities, and you have the Supreme Court just the other week back him up on the extreme vetting policy, all of these things will be put in place under Donald Trump so that these kinds of things, while they may not ever be eliminated because you can't control everybody, will certainly be mitigated.

Donald Trump ran on this platform of moving us away from that kind of approach on illegal immigration toward an approach where it should be based on national interests, serving the U.S. economy and serving our national security.

      "utterance": "Should a faithful Christian vote for a flawed candidate? Many had no problem voting for Donald Trump despite his admitting to a less than perfect past. But Roy Moore's candidacy in Alabama has sparked a big evangelical debate. Can the devout support his Senate run given the accusations against him? Just as confusing, we now have completely opposite results from two reputable polls on the eve of the special election in Alabama. Check it out. An Emerson College poll shows Roy Moore has jumped out to a nine- point lead over Democrat Doug Jones. But a Fox News poll shows Jones with a whopping 10-point advantage. The divided poll results are part of a larger national debate about evangelical support for Roy Moore. Pete Wehner, an old friend of mine from the Reagan administration days, he served in three previous Republican administrations, wrote an op-ed for \"The New York Times\" titled, quote, \"Why I can no longer call myself an evangelical Republican.\" He wrote the following, \"Assume you're a person of the left and an atheist and you decided to create a couple people in the laboratory to discredit the Republican Party and white evangelical Christianity. Well, you can hardly choose two more perfect men than Donald Trump and Roy Moore.\" On the other hand, there's Ralph Reed. He's the founder of the Faith and Freedom Coalition and he appeared on my radio show this morning, and he explained why he felt supporting Moore should be an easy choice and a consistent choice for evangelicals."

      "utterance": "He favors taxpayer funding of abortion. He favors taxpayer funding of Planned Parenthood. He opposes securing the border. He opposes the Trump tax cut. I think for a lot of voters of faith in Alabama, that's a grave moral evil."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "That's how Reed describes Doug Jones. Whatever the result, we'll be covering it tomorrow night live as the results come in. So keep the faith. We'll be right back."

So check it out. And you can always reach me @IngrahamAngle on Twitter and of course hit me up on Facebook. Let me know what you thought about tonight's show. And that is all we have this evening.
