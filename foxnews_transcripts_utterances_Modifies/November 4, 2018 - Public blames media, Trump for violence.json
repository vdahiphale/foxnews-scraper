That's a problem. The media does need to take a closer look at its own fairness, at its own bias. And that hasn't happened at all with President Trump and it didn't happen with President Obama.

    {
      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "-- but for people who are in the country illegally. The idea that that's a settled constitutional question is highly debatable. There are good arguments for first looking at various court opinions that say that that is settled. There are a ton of arguments that say that that is not settled. It really hasn't been taken up by the court very much. So to treat this as if he's saying I'm going to overturn the constitution, we haven't seen an executive order. It depends on what the executive orders says."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Right. Now, a few Republicans, Susan, including Paul Ryan who is leaving anyway said, no, Trump can't do that, it's unconstitutional.

I agree there are all kinds of issues that we can go around as far as the intent of the 14th Amendment and all the rest of this. I think that there are two sort of parallel things happening here. One is the media coverage which I think has been focused on the issue of whether or not the president can do this with an executive order with the subtext of President Trump doesn't understand how government works."

      "speaker": "FERRECHIO",
      "utterance": "What's missing too is if you really look at what's happening in this country with birth tourism, there are whole aspects of this that the media could really get into and educate the public about. What is behind the president's motivation here? This very little understanding and very little reporting about that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",

And instead, the media treated anyone who cared about those things as illegitimate and racist. It is a really good way to decline your credibility among people when you keep calling people that when they have completely legitimate reasons to be concerned about border security enforcement and national sovereignty."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "My judgement is the press took the bait on this. It is a trap sort of laid by the president. Now on the caravan, Washington Post headline, \"For Trump and GOP, subtle racial rhetoric is out, over rallying of white support is in.\" So, look, the president has clearly driven daily coverage of caravan. He sent 5,000 troops to the border. He then says there will be 10,000-15,000. Given the title wave of media criticism over the president's handling of this issue, are journalists again helping the president to highlight what is his closing argument in this election?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "They do. I actually think that's one of the big lessons, that the media and the president are in a codependent relationship and they both get out of this. What they want -- the media gets clicks and President Trump gets to highlight an issue that was very key to him winning in 2016 and that is key again to remind people why it might be important to vote for Republicans."

I think one of the things that is really interesting about how this issue has been covered by the press is not necessarily what's been said but what hasn't been said. Images speak louder than words. You have a lot of media outlets from PBS, you know, all the way to, you know, some of the more mainstream outlets like NBC and ABC showing these images and highlighting the humanitarian crisis of children and hunger and heat and, you know, the problems that these folks are having between here and there, why they're fleeing supposedly. So, I think that the fact that those issues are being highlighted trying to create humanity around this issue, again, is creating a silent and juxtaposition of President Trump being mean about this issue."

We talk about the humanitarian issue which is very important. When they get here, really what happens and what's the impact on communities? And then there's little local coverage about the impact on school systems, on neighborhoods, on how they have to absorb the cost and the difficulty of new immigration that's not regulated."

Sanctions are coming, it says, November 5th, like it's a coming attraction of a television show. November 5th, I guess that would be the day before the election. All right. When we come back, the war between the president the press is really getting uglier in the run-up to Tuesday's election. And later, Frank Luntz.

That interviewed you just played was really interesting where he said, look, I wouldn't be here if I didn't do this. I have to say I agree with him on that.

Gary Schreier, senior vice president at FBN, said in a statement, \"we condemn the rhetoric by the guest on Lou Dobbs Tonight. This episode was a repeat which has now been pulled from all future airings.\" And he said the guest will not be invited back. Judicial Watch has since put out a release a Soros group helping to fund a State Department open government partnership in Romania. This is really ticking me off. There's a video out there that is generating a lot of buzz online. Donald Trump Jr. is one of those who has re-tweeted it, showing a bunch of big male pundits just flatly writing off his father's presidency. And the underlying theme is true.

      "speaker": "UNIDENTIFIED MALE",
      "utterance": "Shouldn't you reserve the term enemy for people who are actually the enemy of the United States rather than journalists?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SARAH HUCKABEE-SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY",
      "utterance": "The president is not referencing all media. He's talking about the growing amount of fake news that exists in the country."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Jim Acosta pressed Sarah Sanders about CNN, which the serial pipe bomber targeted last week. But she wouldn't brand the entire network an enemy. And David Bossie, White House reporters and others are now revolting against the president bringing back discharge, fake news, enemy of the American people. I always thought that goes too far rhetorically. And then, as you saw, she wouldn't name -- Sarah Sanders wouldn't name outlets. Your take on this sort of rhetorical escalation?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOSSIE",
      "utterance": "The frustration on the right, on the conservative side, is that CNN acts like a Democrat Super PAC all day, every day. That is all they do is act like they are trying to elect Democrats, all they ever do. And they are trying to attack this president all day, every day. So this president says, the fake news is the enemy of the people. He's not saying the media. He's saying the fake news."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "He said fake news is ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, New York Times, Washington Post, so that's a lot of media."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOSSIE",
      "utterance": "He's saying the fake news because they all have made mistakes. You look -- just look at yesterday, CNN puts a woman on during a rally. We found this woman in the audience and the interviewer, and it's Andrew Gillum's mother."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "It was disclosed."

      "utterance": "Of course, it is not disclosed until they are caught at it though."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "I think it was disclosed at the time. All right. Philippe, we played earlier President Trump told Axios this is my only way to fight back, by attacking the press and using that language. And that's how he uses it, counterpunching against the foe that's constantly pummeling them."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REINES",
      "utterance": "But these are codes. Counterpunching is lying. You know..."
    },

      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "With what?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REINES",
      "utterance": "Well, these things he does, basically, let's narrow it down, including Sarah Sanders. It's lying. So when he says enemy of the people, the media is not the enemy, this is the one person's enemy list that he keeps reciting. It's as simple as that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "How was it lying if that's his opinion? It's not an opinion I happen to agree with, but he's certainly..."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REINES",
      "utterance": "I just think, in general, the lying is off the chart. I mean, now, you're seeing he's lied more than 5000 times. He has lied at the rate of 80 a day."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOSSIE",
      "utterance": "This president is demonized by the mainstream media, by the left- wing mainstream media on a daily basis, since he won the election in November of 2016. Not for one minute have they allowed him the breathing room like they have other presidents, to have that honeymoon period."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REINES",
      "utterance": "That's 93 of the coverage is negative is negative, 93 percent of what he does is negative."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOSSIE",
      "utterance": "No. Hey, how about we look at the economy, how about we look at our national security. The facts are -- the facts are that the economy is better off, the American people are better off, we are more secure at home and abroad since this president has come into office. And those are the facts. It's the media that doesn't want the American people to hear how good things are going, because they're afraid of having Republicans in control on Tuesday."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REINES",
      "utterance": "The good thing about this talking about Tuesday is we will go from fake news and fake polls and fake everything to real voting. And I think we're going to see after the blue tornado, I don't think it's a wave, because I think it's going to hit here, in this district..."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Fascinating to me that you would say the 93 percent negative coverage is just fine, if that's the figure. But let me get you both."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REINES",
      "utterance": "Well, it's also the economy, even among Republicans..."
    },

      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "All right. Let me go to Jon Stewart, no fan of President Trump, here's what he had to say about the relation. Play it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JON STEWART, TELEVISION HOST",
      "utterance": "I think the journalists have taken it personally. They are personally wounded and offended by this man. He baits them and they dive in. And what he's done well I thought is appeal to their own narcissism, to their own ego. Because what he says is these are -- and the journalists say we are noble, we are honorable, how dare you Sir. And they take it personally."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOSSIE",
      "utterance": "Of course, he is right about that. And it's amazing he would make that point. Jon Stewart, Bill Maher, you name the so-called comedian, they are 100 percent, whether it's in the entertainment industry or the media, these folks are all leftists. And they are opposed to everything this president has done."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "That may be true, but here is Jon Stewart saying the president is beating the press at their own game. Is he right?"

      "speaker": "KURTZ",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "REINES",
      "utterance": "I don't think so. First of all, it's hard to sit here after 15 years. And I think both you and David know that I've had my own problems with the press. But there's a constructive way to do it and there's a non- constructive way. No, it is not fair to say that he's playing them. And by the way, he has made any press is good press, Maxim, wrong. I mean, most of his press is bad."
    },

      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "I think it helps him."
    },

    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "I have like 20 seconds. When you push back against the press as a campaign person, how is that different except perhaps in tone than the president doing it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REINES",
      "utterance": "Because we're all not the equal. He's not just some guy sitting next to me like David. He has a high responsibility to not do this. And it's crazy. It's like the Republican Party didn't get the memo."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOSSIE",
      "utterance": "The media is offended because this president doesn't bow to them. He does it his way every single day. And they are offended by it. And they lash out -- they lash out at him."

      "speaker": "UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE",

      "utterance": "The problem he's attacked nonstop by the media every single day."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "And Frank Luntz, a longtime Republican pollster joins us now. And, Frank, I sometimes wonder whether the whole angry America theory is overplayed within the media echo chamber. Are you finding something different?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LUNTZ",
      "utterance": "I find it very different. I mean, that was done by HBO and Vice News. And these two guys came together to give the American people a chance to put a mirror up so they could see exactly what they're saying and doing. And we did half a dozen of these. The last one airs Monday night on HBO. I have never done a session without people yelling at each other. I've never done a session this year without it degenerating into this abusiveness that your own children, I say this to the - they think they have the right to yell and scream if there are offended with. If your own children behave that way, you send them to their rooms. And yet, this is how adults behave when they talk about politics in every state in the country."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "In terms of the battle for the House since we all believe that anger is a motivating factor for people turning out to vote, does this mean whether Democrats or Republicans are angrier could affect the outcome of the election?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LUNTZ",
      "utterance": "It absolutely could, but there's always been anger with some sort of control. I can't say a four letter word on this show or I'll never be on Fox News again. You have to carry yourself with certain decorum. There is no decorum anymore. There are no limits anymore. So we feel like we have the right and even the responsibility to shout. And I wonder what that means the day after the election. We're spending more money in this election than any other off-year in the history of American politics. And it's almost all the negative ads and abusiveness and these debates have degenerated. I'm afraid."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "I bet that many in the audience are saying, well -- half the audience will say well, it's Trump's fault. And half of the audience will say it's the media's fault. And so my question to you..."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LUNTZ",

    },

      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LUNTZ",
      "utterance": "And so are you, and so are the 320 million Americans. But they want to ignore that responsibility and they want to blame someone else. We are now in a blame-game society and it's wrong. It's wrong if we do it on the right, it's wrong if we do it on the left."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "OK. But President Trump has the biggest megaphone and some people blame him. We who sit in front of television cameras have a big megaphone. Is that -- how much is divisive media coverage contributing to this climate of anger that you're seeing in your focus groups?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LUNTZ",
      "utterance": "I still read the New York Times and the Washington Post. I know a lot of people have stopped doing it. But I would say to them, if every editorial, 100 percent of editorials are hostile to the president, why should anyone read it? They know exactly what you're going to say. If I turn on a cable news program and I only get one side, I'm only half- informed. And that's the not the way we should be. The fact is today, we're getting our information to affirm us and not inform us. And that is the core problem that's contributing. And the other part is there is no civics. Our kids are not being taught about history, about politics, about elections."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Is this -- is this a climate that's created in part by President Trump and his approach to the office, and then, exacerbated or amplified by media?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LUNTZ",
      "utterance": "Every interview tries to get me to blame either Trump or Democrats and Congress. I always say the same thing. It's both of them. They both should not be doing this. They both should be held to a higher standard. And the public is responsible for playing along and actually agitating it. They want to hear the lines. They want to hear the slogans that give them the right to yell and scream. And we've got to stop."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "So you're pointing the finger at most Americans, how does this affect your polling this year, all this emotion and this anger and the divisive issues?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LUNTZ",
      "utterance": "I have less confidence in polling numbers today than I ever had. Because I'm looking at turnouts in places like Texas, it's a presidential level turnout. And then, I see some states that are turning out in a typical off year. I would not use polling to predict or project. I would simply use it to explain what is happening and why."
