So you had to know the storyline -- never mentioned the word \"Israel.\"  I have heard it's one of the toughest deals of all, but I have a feeling that we're going to get there eventually, I hope.  Innocent people living and enjoying their lives murdered by evil losers in life. Thank you very much. Thank you. I won't forget what you said.  And we will work together on various problems. Number one right now is terrorism. And 23 of the 28 member nations are still not paying what they should be paying.  I have seen you today, and I'll be seeing you I'm sure many times over the years to come.",

You had him first start off in the Middle East, show a clear difference between Barack Obama whose first trip involved him going to Egypt and kind of apologizing for American history. Instead this was a president who went, showed strength, recognized that Iran and its hegemonic ambitions for the region was a threat for America, has gone to Europe. And look, it's no secret that a lot of the president's supporters have differences of opinions with the kind of G-7 cosmopolitan worldview, and some of those things came up with regards to trade, the Paris climate protocols. And so I think this was a successful trip of Trump being Trump and really laying out a strong path forward for America.",

The climate change accord is extremely weak. It doesn't have any enforcement. We are in it or out of it. I think it's a marginal difference. Everybody knows that we are not where the Europeans are.  I thought overall the trip was very strong at the beginning because it sent a message to Iran that eight years of appeasement are over, and not only is it America that has now a new policy but it looks as if Trump has rallied the Sunni Arabs with Saudi Arabia on that policy, and that is an extremely important message to the Middle East. I thought the European part was a disaster, his speech in NATO, and not because of the scolding and the paying the dues. That's OK. The Europeans deserve a scolding. This has been a 50-year complaint. But because the world was waiting for Trump to say I support Article 5. That was the purpose of the visit, and he wouldn't say it. And that omission, I think, is going to have a lot of repercussions weakening NATO unity over time. And it's really hard to understand why he didn't say it.",

That was the point of the ceremony. So it is exactly the kind of place and time and occasion for a president who has been skeptical of NATO, called it obsolete, called into question our coming to the aid of the others, to have simply said we support Article 5 as we have ever since the late 1940s.

There will be news stories around the Russia probe, around where former Director Mueller's investigation will lead. Jared Kushner said he is happy to testify before the Senate. He said he is happy to participate in this investigation. So I'm not sure that there is much of a story here other than it's a distraction from everything else that is going on.  Charles mentioned earlier kind of the nonbinding nature of the Paris climate protocols, which is important because this is a decision that apparently the president will make when he comes back. I think really it is the only the nonbinding nature of this that has made a difficult decision. It will have very little impact on global temperatures. It will have a big impact on jobs and people's electrical costs.  The reason that I think that the president is still going to pull out of the Paris protocols is twofold. One, he was absolutely clear on the campaign trail this is a promise he has made and he was elected to do. And second, when the United States speaks, the United States should hold its promises. And if we stay in the Paris protocols, we shouldn't rely on the fact that they're nonbinding. We should pull out. And I think that because the president knows from a policy standpoint pulling out is the right decision, I think he will follow through in the spirit of keeping that campaign promise and keeping America's promises to the world.",
