The debate's not going to shift anything, but it does have potential to shift some, which is why I was just amazed. As you were saying in the open, Jesse, why is the president of the United States spending time talking about drug tests and transmitters in JoeBiden's head? I think he just wants to avoid having to talk about not paying taxes or paying less taxes than the average working American. You know, I mean, he wants to do everything toavoid that topic. And to me, it looks desperate. Theother part of it, I guess, he wants to avoid talking about Coronavirus, which is that whole thing about, you know, what Chris Wallace is allowed to ask. And, you know, I mean, today, we have increases in Coronavirus infection rates in 21 states, New York City seeing -- New York State I should say seeing the rate now above 1,000. I mean, this is like a crisis. And of course, our economy continues to suffer. So the president is going to have to address serious issues, not transmitters in Joe Biden's head.",

You're not seeing it everywhere, but you're starting to see claiming that he got his education started at Delaware State, a historically black college.

That basically, they think that the justices will probably tank it. So I wouldn't -- I just wouldn't put all my eggs in that basket, although I know that theywill try to do that.

I would say you can sort of feel theenergy, right? There is a palpable excitement. I do think it will be the most-watched presidential debate in American history, especially as the candidateswere flying in today. You could just feel it stepped up. So now, we are less than four hours away now. So everything is locked in. Like, the debate about a debate, you know, eargate or whatever you want to call this idea that Chris Wallace wouldn't bring up the Coronavirus deaths. Like, I think all of that immediately goes away. It melts on contact right as the two start at 9:00 p.m. And I think that President Trump and Biden, like, they know this is for all the marbles, so get ready, Jesse."

You know, the first debate -- what do they say, Jesse? The first 30 minutes of thefirst debate really forms a lot of opinions out in thecountry. I know a lot of people say, you know, I think it's the Wall Street Journal, I think mentioned this yesterday, 70 percent of Americans say they've already made up their minds. The debate's not going to shift anything, but it does have potential to shift some, which is why I was just amazed. As you were saying in the open, Jesse, why is the president of the United States spending time talking about drug tests and transmitters in JoeBiden's head? I think he just wants to avoid having to talk about not paying taxes or paying less taxes than the average working American. You know, I mean, he wants to do everything toavoid that topic. And to me, it looks desperate. Theother part of it, I guess, he wants to avoid talking about Coronavirus, which is that whole thing about, you know, what Chris Wallace is allowed to ask. And, you know, I mean, today, we have increases in Coronavirus infection rates in 21 states, New York City seeing -- New York State I should say seeing the rate now above 1,000. I mean, this is like a crisis. And of course, our economy continues to suffer. So the president is going to have to address serious issues, not transmitters in Joe Biden's head."

That is good for Joe because, you know, he needs them. He lost a lot of them. As for the whole idea of the earpiece controversy, Bret is right. It isn't new. Gore was accused. Hillary was accused. And Bill Clinton was accused of having a piece. But she was in the hotel room waiting for him to finish up. There's been a lot of criticism now about Joe for a huge, huge lie. You're not seeing it everywhere, but you're starting to see claiming that he got his education started at Delaware State, a historically black college. And Delaware State denies that he has ever been a student there. Joe's response was, as a black man, I find this attack incredibly racist. So I'm going towatch this. I'm not going to use a sports analogy. I'm going to use it as a -- let's call it a furniture-moving analogy. When I'm watching the debate, it's like watching two movers in your house moving your stuff out.

And that according to handwritten notes, Brennan, former CIA Director, actually briefed President Obama about this, late July 2016, and again briefed Jim Comey in September.

I don't know if he's going to get this specific from this letter. But expect the first 30 minutes, Jesse, I think to be full of fireworks.

I think the president anticipated that this nomination might help him in the presidential race. But so far, the polls don't show that. They showed two to one.

Harvard University did a poll and said that 53 percent of Americans says thepresident should nominate a Justice quickly and theSenate should take that person up quickly. And that includes 51 percent of independents. Also would like to push back on some more Democrat misinformation about Amy Coney Barrett. This is from Betsy McCaughey from The New York Post, theonly newspaper that I read every single morning. McCoy (ph), I'm sorry, Betsy. That is the correct pronunciation of her name. So this is what they're saying about this, that she's going to undo Obamacare, false. They said that she's going to join the other justices in the conservative majority. And she's just going totake a scalpel to the mandate. She is not going totake a bulldozer to the entire Obamacare legislation. Secondly, there is not going to be 12 million people that are going to get thrown off the healthcare roles. That 12 million refers to Medicaid, and the court has already ruled that states can opt out whether or not they want to expand Medicaid. Thirdly, and final point, because I know you guys love my wonky healthcare data, is that the allegation from Nancy Pelosi that 138 million people with pre- existing conditions are going to lose access to healthcare, also not true. Only six percent of Americans were affected by Obamacare. And the president just signed an executive order covering pre-existing conditions. Thank you."

As Jesse just mentioned, in what the Senate calls a filibuster, by the way, that is what Jesse just did. And the -- and expect Trump to tout how many judges and justices he's actually gotten through, living up to his promise in 2016 and what he was elected to do. So I think it's a dangerous prospect for Democrats to not meet with Judge Amy Coney Barrett. I think in some Senate races it's going tomake a difference, in Georgia, Montana, Iowa, North Carolina.

When she starts to speak on her own behalf, I think all the not- meeting with her goes away. I don't think anyone really remembers that. She is her own best advocate. And those hearings aren't that far away. So I think this is just a thing for a couple of days. The other thing I point out as that there are many conservative legal scholars who believe that this lawsuit, the ACA Obamacare lawsuit that is going to be heard in theSupreme Court the week after the election, is not a very good one for the Republican position. That basically, they think that the justices will probably tank it. So I wouldn't -- I just wouldn't put all my eggs in that basket, although I know that theywill try to do that. Joe Biden definitely wants this discussion tonight and going forward to be about healthcare and the Coronavirus. President Trump's strong point will be talking about the economy and his record and judges. So all of those things will come up tonight, but let me just go back to this. As soon as she starts speaking for herself, I think a lot of this just goes away and you get right into the hearings and thesubstance of the issues, not the process."

The other side is going to say that. It's entertaining, that's for sure. But you are not going to learn anything other than the politicians are blowhards. The one thing that you learn about this when they're talking about Obamacare is that once you introduce a giant program, no matter how awful it is, the Democrats in time will pretend like it's been there forever. And that it's amazing, when in fact, it was -- I don't know how many years ago, 10 years, 11 years, I can't remember. I was very young back then, foolish too. It is a massive disaster. It was terrible for everybody. People forget about the website. You lost your doctor. And yet, here we are. We're going oh my, god, even the media. The objective media is buying into this. Oh, are they going to get rid of Obamacare, as if they actually believe it's worth saving. No, it's time to actually look at healthcare at a different way. We have a lot of new, great stuff coming up. Telemedicine is a huge thing. And it's going to make medicine and health a lot cheaper.

It's Trump voters. So who is stirring up the anxiety and fear? Prominent Democrats are the ones that have been doing that. And they know and they do this little extortion trick. It's going to get worse under Trump. So who is stoking fear? This is a big problem because there are two -- OK. There are two parties right now. There's a Republican and a Democratic Party. One is saying you cannot cooperate with the other. It's not the Republican Party. Trump will talk toanybody. We know that. It's the Democratic Party that is saying we cannot cooperate with them because it's a moral decision. Biden says that Trump is evil. They say that Trumpvoters are deplorable. What does this do for America? The only thing holding that holds people together from killing each other is something called cooperation. If you decide that you are no longer going to cooperate with people and you tell that. No wonder the streets are in chaos. And there's riots and there's looting. And come November, it's going to get worse. You have a leadership telling people that that's the way forward.

Well, these Democrats there say theybelieve it because they have Democrats who will not say that they support Trump, even though they do.

I think President Trump has had some problems in thesuburbs. You saw it in the 2018 midterms. You've seen it in some of these polls here. Greg could beright. I mean, maybe there's plenty that are just saying I'm just not going to say it. In fact, Bret Stephens of the New York Times wrote a column today that said meet a secret and a shy Trump voters, a lesbian women who said that coming out as a Trump voter is even harder than coming out as a lesbian, OK? That is how hard it is for some people to admit that they are going tovote for Trump. So that is there in the New York Times for everybody to see. And I feel like some Democrats are trying to, you know, broadcast that message loud and clear. But one thing -- you know, there's all this talk about thesuburban vote. And I know there are a lot more suburban voters than rural voters. But Joe Biden's problems with rural voters is probably even stronger than that of President Trump's problem with suburban voters. That is a lock. And I think this is all part of a political realignment that we are living through. And it's one of the reasons I also believe President Trump will try to constantly turn back to the economy so he can talk about what he accomplished, and also try todraw the contrast to say if Joe Biden becomes your president. This recovery that we are currently in, coming out of the Coronavirus recession will stop. And you will bein the back where you were during the Obama years with everything stagnant and nothing moving forward."

In thecase of President Trump, what's his agenda for a second term, or in the case of Joe Biden, is he a man that has a vision of something more than just being not Donald Trump? Now, I will say that in terms of this law and order message that President Trump has been pushing, it doesn't seem to move the numbers. I mean, so it seems like it's been a waste of time on the campaigntrail and a waste of ad money. And especially when you're talking about suburban women, and just to be direct, we're talking about white suburban women. So he has tried this, not only in terms of law and order, but also in saying -- trying to push the fear button, oh, you're -- thesuburbs will be taken apart, you know that we're going to have more middle-income housing, minorities will come in to the people he calls housewives. Well, you know what, it just hasn't worked? It's no, there's no evidence anywhere, Pennsylvania or anywhere else, that suburban white women have said, oh, gee, I'm thinking differently now."

Republicans vote Republican, Democrats vote Democrat, and independents are up for grabs. It's really more about the education gap. The more advanced degrees you have in the suburbs, themore likely you are to vote for Joe Biden. Trump's competitive with college-educated and does very well with high school diplomas. He does very well in the excerpts. You know, the place is kind of in between the suburbs and the rural areas, and those areas are really undercounted by pollsters. But Trump is getting traction in the suburbs on twomajor issues. People living in the suburbs are more economically minded. They're definitely afraid of taxation. One of the reasons they're in the suburbs, they're not living in the city. And I totally disagree with Juan. They are very upset with this zoning regulation where you can force densely populated low- income housing into your community and local municipalities don't have a say about that. This no cash bail situation that Biden has signed on to with Bernie Sanders in the manifesto, they're very against that and they don't want the drugs, thecrime, and the gangs coming into their communities."

But it's Trump's third and it's for something new yet again. Australian law professors, they have them there, nominated him for the Trump doctrine a mix of common sense and national interests, keeping us from \"endless wars\" and therefore killing thousands of young Americans. It is funny to be nominated three times not formaking liberals feel good but for real stuff. Middle East peace reducing our military footprint while expanding our capabilities, beating ISIS, confusing pacifists and generals alike. It reveals that contrastbetween most leaders and Trump. It's the eloquent statesman who sends kids to die versus theobnoxious ruffian who keeps your kids at home. No one denies Trump's personality. He'll never win a prize for his mostly peaceful press conferences. But that argument is four years old, which is why thepeople still crying about it. It seems like they're four years old. Still, we no joke and handle a room, he could shake hands, smile those bright white teeth, his hair plugs blowing in the breeze. He can talk wistfully about those who sacrifice their lives and give you the bad news from his basement bedroom, then go back into hiding. We won't lose sleep over Biden's tweets. But some of us might lose sleep over worse things if you know he'd sent it the army again and again. It's worth asking the candidates tonight, what's a bigger worry, mean tweets or a wasteful never-ending war. Trumpproduced the tweets, Biden supported the war. We know the media's answer to that, but what's yours? All right, Dana, he's got -- he got three nominations for three separate reasons, two peace deals, theTrump doctrine. Could he be the greatest president in the history of the universe?"

But I bet Joe Bidenmaybe will try to possibly bring up climate change and try to make that one. But one of these debates will focus on foreign policy. And remember what Secretary Gates said, he believed that Joe Biden had been wrong on every single foreign policy issue for the last 30 years. You know, he wrote in his book. Like, that -- it is there. And I do think that the contrast is quite stark.

But if you're an intellectually honest liberal, I know that's a little bit of an oxymoron, but if you are, you have to admit that Trump's foreign policy has been successful. You know, the North Koreans have not tested a nuclear device or an ICBM in three years. We have Space Force; we have peace deals. ISIS annihilated, the two top terrorists taken out, China's been ostracized, the Iranians are isolated. I mean, this is really good stuff. Susan Rice is out there complaining about our allies, our allies. Who, who she talking about, the Brits, theIndians, the South Koreans, the Japanese, theIsraelis? It seems like we have a very nice alliance system. And President Trump, despite being called this big renegade that's going to create a nuclear holocaust, has done the exact opposite."

So, of the millions and millions of people who follow him on social media, 77 percent of them approve of his performance, andthose are about half Democrats and independents. And that's why when he does these State of theUnion Addresses or these Coronavirus briefings, people pay attention and his numbers go up. Andit's also the reason why CNN and a lot of the other networks, they've censored him. they don't air therallies, they cut away from the briefings, and theycensor him on social media. So, this is an opportunity tonight, for the president for 90 minutes to be unfiltered by the mainstream media. You'll see him in a contrast with Joe Biden. He'll be speaking directly to the American people. And I think the American people will listen and will like what they hear."

I think that -- in fact, I think the reason he's doing so well right now is that his strategy through social media, the Convention and the like have paid off for him. But I think tonight, the people -- the people are going to bepaying attention with a new focus because we haven't seen Biden and Trump on the same stage. This is new, this is different, so it's going to get more attention. I think the President's strategy is always to create the kind of circus Jesse was talking about. So, I guess he will make all kinds of allegations andcharges. We'll see how Biden reacts. If Biden is to besuccessful, he can't take the bait. He has to come across a steady, a strong alternative to the way theTrump plays ball."

But Greg, there's fewer people in the hall tonight around I think 100 people and the audience, so it might -- I don't know. I don't know how it will land if he is able to make one of those jokes. We might laugh at home, but I don't know how well the reaction will be there in thehall."

      "speaker": "GUTFELD",

You're actually impugning them. You're putting -- those are what you call fighting words. And if I were in a debate where somebody had called me a racist or had said I had blood on my hands, I would fight them. So, I think there's going to be -- I think that's -- that would have --"

He'll treat it like Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, you know. And when he gets tohalf a million, or he's going to go like, well, I really don't need to go to the million."
