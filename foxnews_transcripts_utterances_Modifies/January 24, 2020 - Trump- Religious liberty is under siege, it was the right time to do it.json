Our own Raymond Arroyo spoke with President Trump today about Lev Parnas impeachment and his historic address to the March for Life. It was a tour de force. The two-part exclusive is straight ahead. And we unpack all the impeachment madness. It was Groundhog Day today. We need Bill Murray to show up in the House. Democrat, House managers just wrapped up their case and Trump impeachment lawyer, Robert Ray, Congressman Mark Meadows, Senator David Perdue are all here to break it all down. Plus 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard is here. She's going to talk about her party's Russia obsession and her present impeachment vote.  And we have part three of our investigation into a 2016 White House meeting that involves Obama officials and Ukrainian prosecutors. We've spoken to one of the Ukrainians now who was in that meeting. What he told us will be later on in the show.  But first, despite what many in the public might think, Democrats keep telling us that their case against President Trump isn't complicated at all. It's simple like basic math.",

And for the record, Trump ran on a platform committed to reforming the distribution of foreign aid much to the chagrin of the establishment GOP, I might add and one of the reasons so many of us supported him. And he's also held up taxpayer funds to several countries to get them to change their policies. The truth is that Trump's anti foreign aid agenda has ruffled feathers of all these career globalists embedded in the State Department, who sometimes have more of a focus on their countries of focus and their own little sections where they work than they do what's good for the United States.  And by the way even if what Congressman Crow here said is true, it's just a ludicrous legal standard. Law professor Josh Blackman explains it best. He writes in The New York Times otherwise legal conduct even when plainly politically motivated does not amount to an impeachable abuse of power. The House's short-sighted standard will fail to knock out Mr. Trump, but if taken seriously threatens to put virtually every elected official in peril.  Third, and this is a favorite of Adam Schiff that Trump is basically just a Manchurian candidate.",

Adam Schiff is supposed to be so smart, is he just forget all this and sublimate it all. And let's not forget that under Trump, we are now the world's largest oil producer. Thanks in part to the President's energy dominance agenda. That fact alone gives the Russians nightmares. This impeachment trial will eventually come to an end.   Trump is going to be acquitted and Democrats will still have to face voters in November. We think with an agenda at some point. Now, when that happens, Trump will have a massive list of accomplishments. The USMCA, the China deal deregulation 100 - what 60 judges now. A booming economy and so on and so on. So, what will the Democrats have?  Joining me now is Congressman Mark Meadows, Trump impeachment defense team member.

We discovered the existence of this meeting in an email chain between State Department staffers in \"The New York Times\" reporter Ken Vogel. We obtained those emails exclusively. In examining archive White House visitor logs, we came across two names that piqued our interest. The first, the person who checked the Ukrainians into the White House the day of the meeting. That person has been identified by some as the impeachment whistleblower. The second point, another person at the 2016 meeting, Andriy Telizhenko, he worked at the Ukrainian embassy at the time, and as we reported last night, was quoted in a 2017 political article, also by Ken Vogel, explaining how he was forced to work with a DNC operative to hurt Trump. Telizhenko saw part two of our investigation last night, and tonight he has decided to speak out. \"I'm being pressured to hobble Trump's 2016 campaign,\" he told THE INGRAHAM ANGLE. \"I was told to work and cooperate with Mrs. Chalupa, a DNC operative, by Ambassador Chaliy. Chalupa asked me to help her get dirt on presidential candidate Donald Trump. I never coordinated any work with her or the DNC because I did not support the unethical orders to work and assist one party.\" He also provided these documents, a White House invite and a schedule of the meeting, listing two names, one associated with the whistleblower, whose name we blacked out, and Elizabeth Zentos, both from Obama's NSC. Telizhenko also told us that while the meeting was touted as a, quote, prosecutors training program, much of the conversation revolved around the Bidens and Burisma. And it wasn't the Ukrainians who brought up Bidens and Burisma. Telizhenko said \"The representatives of the DOJ, U.S. embassy in Kiev, and NSC staff raised the question of the Burisma investigation. Most of the NSC staff were people from Bidens team.\" Wow. You getting this focus now? Joining me now, Byron York, chief political correspondent for the \"Examiner,\" and Sara Carter, host of \"The Sara Carter Podcast,\" both Fox News Contributors, and Lee Smith, investigative journalist, author of \"The Plot Against The President.\" All right, Sara, how can Democrats continue to claim the Bidens and Burisma have no relevance to this?",

And by the way, it's not only Ukraine, you hear this coming from other countries with the Obama administration, officials in other countries. I'll give you an example. In Guatemala, the same thing, pressure from the State Department to do things their way or they'll withhold aid. So this is nothing new. I think right now we're at the cusp of something really big.

Our own Raymond Arroyo spoke with President Trump today about Lev Parnas impeachment and his historic address to the March for Life. It was a tour de force. The two-part exclusive is straight ahead. And we unpack all the impeachment madness. It was Groundhog Day today. We need Bill Murray to show up in the House. Democrat, House managers just wrapped up their case and Trump impeachment lawyer, Robert Ray, Congressman Mark Meadows, Senator David Perdue are all here to break it all down. Plus 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard is here. She's going to talk about her party's Russia obsession and her present impeachment vote. And we have part three of our investigation into a 2016 White House meeting that involves Obama officials and Ukrainian prosecutors. We've spoken to one of the Ukrainians now who was in that meeting. What he told us will be later on in the show. But first, despite what many in the public might think, Democrats keep telling us that their case against President Trump isn't complicated at all. It's simple like basic math."

And for the record, Trump ran on a platform committed to reforming the distribution of foreign aid much to the chagrin of the establishment GOP, I might add and one of the reasons so many of us supported him. And he's also held up taxpayer funds to several countries to get them to change their policies. The truth is that Trump's anti foreign aid agenda has ruffled feathers of all these career globalists embedded in the State Department, who sometimes have more of a focus on their countries of focus and their own little sections where they work than they do what's good for the United States. And by the way even if what Congressman Crow here said is true, it's just a ludicrous legal standard. Law professor Josh Blackman explains it best. He writes in The New York Times otherwise legal conduct even when plainly politically motivated does not amount to an impeachable abuse of power. The House's short-sighted standard will fail to knock out Mr. Trump, but if taken seriously threatens to put virtually every elected official in peril. Third, and this is a favorite of Adam Schiff that Trump is basically just a Manchurian candidate."

Adam Schiff is supposed to be so smart, is he just forget all this and sublimate it all. And let's not forget that under Trump, we are now the world's largest oil producer. Thanks in part to the President's energy dominance agenda. That fact alone gives the Russians nightmares. This impeachment trial will eventually come to an end. Trump is going to be acquitted and Democrats will still have to face voters in November. We think with an agenda at some point. Now, when that happens, Trump will have a massive list of accomplishments. The USMCA, the China deal deregulation 100 - what 60 judges now. A booming economy and so on and so on. So, what will the Democrats have? Joining me now is Congressman Mark Meadows, Trump impeachment defense team member. Congressman, over the last week it's apparent that the Democrats case is just a smear job. It's intended to cast Trump's every move as somehow just orchestrated by Russia. He's just a marionette and Putin is upstairs pulling the strings."

The Democrat House managers want so much to make an impact that they're out there exaggerating, mischaracterizing, lying and instead of it being the end of a President Trump's presidency, this is going to be the end of a Joe Biden nomination. I can tell you; senators are upset by what they believe has been a false narrative that has been tried to be perpetrated on the American people. Hunter Biden, Joe Biden, we haven't seen the end of it, you're going to hear from Senator David Perdue, a real serious and thorough senator. He was there today I was behind him on the Senate floor.

So, can you imagine, I wouldn't do it anyway. But can you imagine with all of these people, Mike Pompeo, Secretary of State was on with all of these people on the call, I'm going to say something that's inappropriate. That call was perfect.

But even if you look at the conversation I had with the President, he her, like it because in there he didn't like her. So, I don't know, I didn't hear this.

I watched him say that there were eight quid pro quos. There were none. I watched him - this is why I had releases. I mean we got approval from Ukraine and I released it. I don't want to do it. Many people heard the conversation that were on the line, but I don't want to do this. But we've got approval from Ukraine. I watched him say, the end - like a mob kind of. Don't call me, I'll call you. That's like a mob. That's from The Godfather or someplace. So, I watched all of this, Raymond and I said, this is terrible. We have to release it. It was a total lie. It was a fabrication. It was a made-up statement. What my people have to do is just be honest, just tell the truth. They've been testifying. The Democrats, they've been telling so many lies, so many fabrications, so much exaggeration and this is not impeachable. In fact, I don't even know how to determine this, but they say it's not a crime. Everybody says that the other side says it, it's not a crime. They say, but it doesn't have to be a crime. Well, maybe it doesn't have to be a crime, but can you imagine being impeach and you didn't commit a crime. So, there's no crime. This is a political horrible witch hunt.

Look, I mean - look, they can make that argument all they want. You heard from the President. The President released the full transcript of the call that led to his own impeachment.

But I will say this, one of the problems of having a standard less impeachment is really two things. One is that you can pour pretty much anything that you want into vague articles of impeachment. And the second is just that you wander all over the place on factual issues that really don't go to the question about whether or not the articles as charged warrant the President's removal from office. This is not an oversight hearing.

I mean this is incredible what they're talking about and they're going at something about - this whole thing article one around motive. The principle is if a President does something, what they want you to believe is he does something lawful, but they can convince you that it's for political gain. That's impeachable. Well, they have not proved that this was done for his political advantage.

I think a lot of people maybe not remembering that we have a lot of missiles still pointed at each other's countries on hair trigger alert, within minutes those missiles could be launched, and so there are serious consequences to this new cold war that pose an existential threat to our country.

I just don't think that is what the American people are, yet anytime someone raises the issue of maybe a reset with Russia, you are called a Russian asset. You've been called a Russian asset.

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Over the past few nights we've laid out details of a 2016 White House meeting between Obama officials and Ukrainian prosecutors. The Bidens and Burisma were the main topic. We discovered the existence of this meeting in an email chain between State Department staffers in \"The New York Times\" reporter Ken Vogel. We obtained those emails exclusively. In examining archive White House visitor logs, we came across two names that piqued our interest. The first, the person who checked the Ukrainians into the White House the day of the meeting. That person has been identified by some as the impeachment whistleblower. The second point, another person at the 2016 meeting, Andriy Telizhenko, he worked at the Ukrainian embassy at the time, and as we reported last night, was quoted in a 2017 political article, also by Ken Vogel, explaining how he was forced to work with a DNC operative to hurt Trump. Telizhenko saw part two of our investigation last night, and tonight he has decided to speak out. \"I'm being pressured to hobble Trump's 2016 campaign,\" he told THE INGRAHAM ANGLE. \"I was told to work and cooperate with Mrs. Chalupa, a DNC operative, by Ambassador Chaliy. Chalupa asked me to help her get dirt on presidential candidate Donald Trump. I never coordinated any work with her or the DNC because I did not support the unethical orders to work and assist one party.\" He also provided these documents, a White House invite and a schedule of the meeting, listing two names, one associated with the whistleblower, whose name we blacked out, and Elizabeth Zentos, both from Obama's NSC. Telizhenko also told us that while the meeting was touted as a, quote, prosecutors training program, much of the conversation revolved around the Bidens and Burisma. And it wasn't the Ukrainians who brought up Bidens and Burisma. Telizhenko said \"The representatives of the DOJ, U.S. embassy in Kiev, and NSC staff raised the question of the Burisma investigation. Most of the NSC staff were people from Bidens team.\" Wow. You getting this focus now? Joining me now, Byron York, chief political correspondent for the \"Examiner,\" and Sara Carter, host of \"The Sara Carter Podcast,\" both Fox News Contributors, and Lee Smith, investigative journalist, author of \"The Plot Against The President.\" All right, Sara, how can Democrats continue to claim the Bidens and Burisma have no relevance to this?"

      "speaker": "SARA CARTER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "They can't, this is the point. And this is the reason why Adam Schiff doesn't want to call the whistleblower. This is the reason why he doesn't want any more information coming out, because what we know now is those connections were so deep inside the State Department. And by the way, it's not only Ukraine, you hear this coming from other countries with the Obama administration, officials in other countries. I'll give you an example. In Guatemala, the same thing, pressure from the State Department to do things their way or they'll withhold aid. So this is nothing new. I think right now we're at the cusp of something really big. This is an explosive report, Laura. This is huge and it absolutely has to be investigated. But who is going to investigate it, the DOJ? The Senate Judiciary?"

    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",

BRYON YORK, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, \"WASHINGTON EXAMINER\": This could be the nexus between the whistleblower and the Biden-Burisma story, where you have concerns in the Obama White House about Hunter Biden's connections in Ukraine. His father is obviously the vice president. And now we have, we know, that the person alleged to be the whistleblower was involved with that. And so it makes it very hard -- senators do not want -- Republicans do not want to call witnesses. They don't want any witnesses. But if they had to have a witness, it seems that whistleblower is the one. I do not believe it is possible to call for the removal of the president of the United States and say, some of the evidence has to stay secret. It's just got to be a secret."

Because now this is where we are going to go, and we are going to expose this corruption. And even more importantly, all of these documents, Laura, that you have been able to show here on this show, that you've been able to expose, actually show that Joe Biden obviously knew everything that was going on before he made those demands."

      "speaker": "YORK",

I think that once they opened the door, just as you showed with Adam Schiff, just as we've been hearing over and over ad nauseam for the last three days about Biden and about Burisma, we have seen now may be a little bit of a shift, saying, OK, if you are going in this direction, if you really want to push for witnesses, maybe we should just do it."

So to think that this is somehow a bunch of men, or this is handmaid's tale, that's not what is at play here. And Donald Trump, I have to tell you, years ago he told me the full story.

He ended up knowing and understanding the child that came from that decision. The child was born. And he said that turned my thinking entirely."
