Tonight, Dr. Sebastian Gorka, Darryl Parks have a very powerful debate and you don't want to miss it. Also tonight, we made a promise to you. We'll going to hold Washington accountable. That is why we're here. Our exclusive sit-down interview with the Speaker of the House Paul Ryan. We will ask him about the Republican's new tax plan, President Trump's agenda and so much more.  But first, we're following two major breaking news stories tonight. The President did unveil the GOP tax plan that calls for massive cuts, sweeping reform. Is it enough? Will it help you? We'll explain what it means for you and your family. Also, the President, he is not backing down in the NFL anthem controversy and we have brand-new comments from the President. We'll play that and he spoke exclusively with \"FOX & FRIENDS WEEKEND\" co- host Pete Hegseth. We will play all of that for you.  Also tonight, a HANNITY history lesson on how the left, the mainstream media, how they have been disrespecting the flag, the National Anthem and our military for years. I promise, you will not get this anywhere else on your television dial. We have all of that in tonight's very important breaking news opening monologue from D.C.   All right. So, President Trump is hitting the road today to outline details of his tax plan and how it is going to impact you and your families. Let's take a look.",

We're going to cut taxes for the middle class, make the tax code simpler and more fair for everyday Americans, and we are going to bring back the jobs and wealth that have left our country and most people thought left our country for good.

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "sentences": "Now, basically, the president, he is following through on what he promised you on the campaign trail. Now, here is what the president outlined today. He is going to consolidate the seven current brackets to just three brackets with new rates. Twelve, 25 and 35 percent. He is going to double the standard deduction, and if you are single, well, you are not going to pay taxes on the first $12,000 you make. If you're married, that increases to $24,000.  The child tax credit will also be expanded and he will repeal the alternative minimum tax and he will end the death tax, double taxation. Now the corporate rate will be lowered to 20 percent and he wants to create a 25 percent pass through tax rate which is going to help small business owners. And he is also calling for a very low repatriation tax, and that is a tax rate for multi-national corporations that targets money directly that's parked overseas because of the high taxation and regulation here, and that allows these multi-nationals to bring trillions back to the American economy.   So, let me explain. The corporate side of tax reform is so very important and here is why. When businesses pay higher taxes, it gets passed on to you, the customers. Corporations don't pay taxes. Now, if President Trump's plan is approved, all these companies will have billions of dollars, if not more, of extra money. They're not going to put it in their bank account. Guess what they're going to do? They'll going to invest, capital and manufacturing centers and factories, which will create jobs for the millions of forgotten men and women in this country. That's what we need, that's what we want, that's what many of you voted for. And to add to that, the House Freedom Caucus, they are now supporting the president's plan. So basically everything that the President is proposing is designed to help grow the economy.  And the only thing I would add to the plan personally? Give a tax cut across the board and let everybody have it. And in many ways, it's a lot like what President Reagan did in the 1980s. Now, President Reagan, he created the blueprint for economic success, and it all adds up. Here are the facts. Reagan, he slashed over the course of his presidency the top marginal rate from 70 to 28 percent. As a result, economic growth exploded. For example, 1984 GDP growth -- get this - hit 7.3 percent. Well, Barack Obama didn't reach three percent in a single year of his presidency, the only president in history not to do that. Twenty million jobs were created under Reagan after the recession. Revenues to the government doubled by cutting taxes. And America, it saw the longest period of peacetime economic growth in history to that point.  And if Americans, if you want more proof that works, well, just take a look at what happened when John F. Kennedy, a Democrat believe it or not, he cut the top marginal rate from 91 percent to 77 percent. Same thing, millions of jobs created, GDP growth soared.  But today, the left predictably, all they want to do despite all the tax cuts that the president is proposing for the middle class and corporations and small businesses, they do what they always do, right to the playbook. Let's play class warfare. Take a look.",

      "sentences": "They are just wrong, they don't know what they're talking about.  Now, the Trump hating Washington Post, a perfect example. They attacked the president's tax plan. Look at the headline what it says. \"GOP proposes deep tax cuts but provides few details on how to pay for them.\"  Now, this is what the liberal press and people on the left will never, ever understand in spite of Reagan and Kennedy's success: The idea. It is not a zero sum game, you want to grow the economy. And if you do that, well, those people out of work and in poverty and on food stamps, they will have jobs and stop taking hand-outs and they'll start paying taxes. In other words, you incentivize people to work and pay taxes, you create an environment that is growth oriented for everybody. Democrats, the media, they just play class warfare. They have been doing it for decades. Now, you have to remember this: Democrats and the mainstream left establishment media, they are not telling you that under President Obama -- they will never tell you this -- 13 million more Americans were on food stamps. Eight million more Americans were put in poverty. Ninety five million Americans were out of the labor force. Lowest labor participation rate since the 70s and the worst economic recovery since the 40s. Lowest homeownership rate in 51 years. And by the way, President Obama accumulated more debt than every other president before him combined. Great job, President Obama.  Now, they also don't want you to know that here is the facts, the rich that they hate so much, the top one percent of wage earners in America according to IRS, they pay 39.5 percent of all federal income taxes. Top 10 percent wage earners, they pay 70.9 percent of personal income taxes. So, it sounds like the rich are paying their fair share to me. Now, the bottom 50 percent of wage earners, they pay 2.8 percent combined. And we can't forget, 35 percent of tax filers pay nothing, zero federal income tax. And under President Trump's plan, they will even pay less.   So, my advice to the GOP is very simple. Stay the course, follow the Reagan, the Kennedy models and stick to the plan that the President is proposing.  Now also tonight, President Trump, he is not backing down in his fight to defend the flag, the National Anthem and stand up for our military. Now, the President called out the NFL National Anthem protesters once again. Good for him, take a look.",

      "sentences": "Now, as the President keep saying, this issue is very simple, it's about respect. He never once mentioned race, not one time despite what the liberal media is saying to you when they lie to you. Now the military fights, you know what? They fight, bleed and die, why? So football players and others will have the opportunity. And in the case of football players, to make millions of dollars for playing a sport on Sundays. Now members of the military that puts everything on the line every single day for all of our freedoms. They don't do it for the money, they don't get paid a lot on average. Privates make $40,000 a year. Football players on average makes over 2.4 million a year. And by the way, the guys in the military, they don't do it for recognition, they do it because they love the country and they are willing to fight and die defending the country and they fight under that flag.   You know what at a bare minimum, every single American should stand with their hand over their hearts during the National Anthem and honor them. The veterans, active duty military members, do they not deserve that honor? Is showing respect to the military, is that really too much to ask? And as I've been saying, until the NFL fixes this, addresses this issue right now Saturday is my football day. I'll watch college football and I think millions of Americans will be doing the same.  And as you can see, they'll going to stop watching. According to a new poll, 64 percent of you the American people agree with the President's position that this is completely out of line. Ratings for the NFL already down 11 percent just compared to last year which was a low year for them. We're also seeing more fallout from the NFL controversy. The National Anthem singer for the Baltimore Ravens, veterans, Joey Odoms, he has now resigned and now a CEO that provides the wardrobe for NBC's on-air talent said, he is no longer do that and he is also pulling his ads from stations that broadcast NFL games. Taya Kyle, remember the widow of American hero, Navy SEAL Chris Kyle. She is now speaking out with a very powerful open letter to the NFL. Let me read part of it to you. It says, \"Your desire to focus on division and anger has shattered what many people loved the most about the sport. Football was really a metaphor for an ideal world. Different backgrounds, talents, political beliefs and histories as one big team with one big goal, to do well, to win together.\"  I'll sum it up perfectly. Sports are supposed to be the one thing that can unite us. An escape from politics. Americans don't want to see players disrespecting the flag, not standing for the anthem and making cheap political points. By the way, what is their big political point? Is it one universal point? And the NFL, they also continue to be exposed as total hypocrites. Take a look at this quote, from an article written by Mark Thiessen, \"The NFL gave operations manual,\" get this because they're all rules, it says, quote, \"all players must be on the sideline for the National Anthem. They must stand at attention. They must face the flag, hold helmets in their left hand and refrain from talking or face discipline such as fines, suspensions, and/or the forfeiture of draft choices.\"  And by the way, that's first offense. And there is the mainstream media, they are just pathetic. And despite the President clearly stating again and again and again and again that his criticism of the NFL has nothing to do with race, the media, they are engaging in identity politics. So predictable, so pathetic and they lie almost on an hourly basis. It is so bad the information crisis in this country. Take a look.   UNIDENTIFIED MALE, \"NIGHTLINE\"/ABC: This current NFL kneeler movement may have kicked off with Collin Kaepernick but when it comes to athletes using their platform, he did not start the fire. UNIDENTIFIED MALE, \"NIGHTLINE\"/ABC: Seventy years ago, this was a face of change and of social activism in sports when Jackie Robinson broke baseball's color line in 1947.  CHARLIE ROSE, \"THIS MORNING\"/CBS: Where is Collin Kaepernick at year later? JAMES BROWN, HOST, \"NFL TODAY\"/CBS : A year later, still from a visible standpoint, unemployed as far as the NFL is concerned. The fact of the matter is, he has put his money where his mouth is, nearly $1 million through community efforts to be a bridge builder.",

The tax reform bill we'll do it in such a way they can't filibuster that and we can limit the debate on it to get it done. We're working with the world we have in front of us, to get around this crazy filibuster rule and get these things done and that is the plan we have. I believe if Americans see their congress giving them a postcard tax form, giving a middle class tax break, getting rid of the special interest loopholes to make it more fair and lowering taxes on businesses to bring jobs back from overseas and make it easier for businesses to create more jobs here, that is going to be something that is going to be good for all Americans.

He is going to consolidate the seven current brackets to just three brackets with new rates. Twelve, 25 and 35 percent. He is going to double the standard deduction, and if you are single, well, you are not going to pay taxes on the first $12,000 you make. If you're married, that increases to $24,000. The child tax credit will also be expanded and he will repeal the alternative minimum tax and he will end the death tax, double taxation. Now the corporate rate will be lowered to 20 percent and he wants to create a 25 percent pass through tax rate which is going to help small business owners. And he is also calling for a very low repatriation tax, and that is a tax rate for multi-national corporations that targets money directly that's parked overseas because of the high taxation and regulation here, and that allows these multi-nationals to bring trillions back to the American economy. So, let me explain. The corporate side of tax reform is so very important and here is why. When businesses pay higher taxes, it gets passed on to you, the customers. Corporations don't pay taxes. Now, if President Trump's plan is approved, all these companies will have billions of dollars, if not more, of extra money. They're not going to put it in their bank account. Guess what they're going to do? They'll going to invest, capital and manufacturing centers and factories, which will create jobs for the millions of forgotten men and women in this country. That's what we need, that's what we want, that's what many of you voted for. And to add to that, the House Freedom Caucus, they are now supporting the president's plan. So basically everything that the President is proposing is designed to help grow the economy. And the only thing I would add to the plan personally? Give a tax cut across the board and let everybody have it. And in many ways, it's a lot like what President Reagan did in the 1980s. Now, President Reagan, he created the blueprint for economic success, and it all adds up. Here are the facts. Reagan, he slashed over the course of his presidency the top marginal rate from 70 to 28 percent. As a result, economic growth exploded. For example, 1984 GDP growth -- get this - hit 7.3 percent. Well, Barack Obama didn't reach three percent in a single year of his presidency, the only president in history not to do that. Twenty million jobs were created under Reagan after the recession. Revenues to the government doubled by cutting taxes. And America, it saw the longest period of peacetime economic growth in history to that point. And if Americans, if you want more proof that works, well, just take a look at what happened when John F. Kennedy, a Democrat believe it or not, he cut the top marginal rate from 91 percent to 77 percent. Same thing, millions of jobs created, GDP growth soared. But today, the left predictably, all they want to do despite all the tax cuts that the president is proposing for the middle class and corporations and small businesses, they do what they always do, right to the playbook. Let's play class warfare. Take a look."

In other words, you incentivize people to work and pay taxes, you create an environment that is growth oriented for everybody. Democrats, the media, they just play class warfare. They have been doing it for decades."

      "speaker": "Now, you have to remember this",
      "utterance": "Democrats and the mainstream left establishment media, they are not telling you that under President Obama -- they will never tell you this -- 13 million more Americans were on food stamps. Eight million more Americans were put in poverty. Ninety five million Americans were out of the labor force. Lowest labor participation rate since the 70s and the worst economic recovery since the 40s. Lowest homeownership rate in 51 years. And by the way, President Obama accumulated more debt than every other president before him combined. Great job, President Obama. Now, they also don't want you to know that here is the facts, the rich that they hate so much, the top one percent of wage earners in America according to IRS, they pay 39.5 percent of all federal income taxes. Top 10 percent wage earners, they pay 70.9 percent of personal income taxes. So, it sounds like the rich are paying their fair share to me. Now, the bottom 50 percent of wage earners, they pay 2.8 percent combined. And we can't forget, 35 percent of tax filers pay nothing, zero federal income tax. And under President Trump's plan, they will even pay less. So, my advice to the GOP is very simple. Stay the course, follow the Reagan, the Kennedy models and stick to the plan that the President is proposing. Now also tonight, President Trump, he is not backing down in his fight to defend the flag, the National Anthem and stand up for our military. Now, the President called out the NFL National Anthem protesters once again. Good for him, take a look."

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Now, as the President keep saying, this issue is very simple, it's about respect. He never once mentioned race, not one time despite what the liberal media is saying to you when they lie to you. Now the military fights, you know what? They fight, bleed and die, why? So football players and others will have the opportunity. And in the case of football players, to make millions of dollars for playing a sport on Sundays. Now members of the military that puts everything on the line every single day for all of our freedoms. They don't do it for the money, they don't get paid a lot on average. Privates make $40,000 a year. Football players on average makes over 2.4 million a year. And by the way, the guys in the military, they don't do it for recognition, they do it because they love the country and they are willing to fight and die defending the country and they fight under that flag. You know what at a bare minimum, every single American should stand with their hand over their hearts during the National Anthem and honor them. The veterans, active duty military members, do they not deserve that honor? Is showing respect to the military, is that really too much to ask? And as I've been saying, until the NFL fixes this, addresses this issue right now Saturday is my football day. I'll watch college football and I think millions of Americans will be doing the same. And as you can see, they'll going to stop watching. According to a new poll, 64 percent of you the American people agree with the President's position that this is completely out of line. Ratings for the NFL already down 11 percent just compared to last year which was a low year for them. We're also seeing more fallout from the NFL controversy. The National Anthem singer for the Baltimore Ravens, veterans, Joey Odoms, he has now resigned and now a CEO that provides the wardrobe for NBC's on-air talent said, he is no longer do that and he is also pulling his ads from stations that broadcast NFL games. Taya Kyle, remember the widow of American hero, Navy SEAL Chris Kyle. She is now speaking out with a very powerful open letter to the NFL. Let me read part of it to you. It says, \"Your desire to focus on division and anger has shattered what many people loved the most about the sport. Football was really a metaphor for an ideal world. Different backgrounds, talents, political beliefs and histories as one big team with one big goal, to do well, to win together.\" I'll sum it up perfectly. Sports are supposed to be the one thing that can unite us. An escape from politics. Americans don't want to see players disrespecting the flag, not standing for the anthem and making cheap political points. By the way, what is their big political point? Is it one universal point? And the NFL, they also continue to be exposed as total hypocrites. Take a look at this quote, from an article written by Mark Thiessen, \"The NFL gave operations manual,\" get this because they're all rules, it says, quote, \"all players must be on the sideline for the National Anthem. They must stand at attention. They must face the flag, hold helmets in their left hand and refrain from talking or face discipline such as fines, suspensions, and/or the forfeiture of draft choices.\" And by the way, that's first offense. And there is the mainstream media, they are just pathetic. And despite the President clearly stating again and again and again and again that his criticism of the NFL has nothing to do with race, the media, they are engaging in identity politics. So predictable, so pathetic and they lie almost on an hourly basis. It is so bad the information crisis in this country. Take a look. UNIDENTIFIED MALE, \"NIGHTLINE\"/ABC: This current NFL kneeler movement may have kicked off with Collin Kaepernick but when it comes to athletes using their platform, he did not start the fire. UNIDENTIFIED MALE, \"NIGHTLINE\"/ABC: Seventy years ago, this was a face of change and of social activism in sports when Jackie Robinson broke baseball's color line in 1947. CHARLIE ROSE, \"THIS MORNING\"/CBS: Where is Collin Kaepernick at year later? JAMES BROWN, HOST, \"NFL TODAY\"/CBS : A year later, still from a visible standpoint, unemployed as far as the NFL is concerned. The fact of the matter is, he has put his money where his mouth is, nearly $1 million through community efforts to be a bridge builder."

Cleaning it up and simplifying it. And by the way, by getting rid of loopholes, you are making the system more fair. So, people who make the same kind of money pay the same taxes. It's fairness, it's unrigging the economy, it's getting all the connected crap out of the tax code, excuse me for saying that, but this tax code is --"

I live in New York, I pay 10 percent federal tax. California 13.5 percent. No longer deductible. So while their rate may be lower they'll end up paying more."

Everybody in the middle class, even in Blue State are going to see a big break. The other question is should we be having some states subsidize other states who have big government and high taxes? We want to get rid of that so that it's just fair across the board for everybody."

Why should we incentivize big government? That is point one and point two, by getting rid of loopholes and deductions, we can give everybody in the middle class a tax break. We want to do is reduce these deductions and get rid of the loopholes so that everybody can keep more of their own money in the first place and you decide what to do with your money. If you have kids we'll help you with that. Expanded child tax credit and raising the standard deduction it just simplifies things so much so that people just don't pay taxes on the first $24,000 of money they earn."

On income tax rates for people's personal taxes what the President feels very strongly about and congress agrees is that the middle class are the people who need the tax break? People who are low and middle income are living paycheck to paycheck worried about losing their jobs or having gotten a raise in years.

You know what the congressional review act is in you can rescind Obama regulations. We've done 14-in-law this year alone, because they can't filibuster that. The tax reform bill we'll do it in such a way they can't filibuster that and we can limit the debate on it to get it done. We're working with the world we have in front of us, to get around this crazy filibuster rule and get these things done and that is the plan we have. I believe if Americans see their congress giving them a postcard tax form, giving a middle class tax break, getting rid of the special interest loopholes to make it more fair and lowering taxes on businesses to bring jobs back from overseas and make it easier for businesses to create more jobs here, that is going to be something that is going to be good for all Americans. Bigger paychecks, more jobs, faster growth. We get that done I think people will be happy with congress and with the President. We will have kept our word."

Then it builds up a little bit and more and more and you see what's been happening and you see more and more and more and I came out and made a statement in Alabama the other day and I think it's very disrespectful to our country and the world picked it up.

I don't want to tune on my TV and see protests of a flag that I'm wearing on my shoulder while carrying a rifle to fight for my freedom.

They want to be liked amongst people so they choose not to enforce this and allow the protests, against their own rules, while enforcing all the minuscule rules that fans are sick and tired of and why President Trump has made this as example. It is not going anywhere, Sean. A lot of Americans, vast majority of Americans side with him. It will hurt the NFL. They have a big choice to make."
