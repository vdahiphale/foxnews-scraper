      "sentences": "All right, Shepard, thank you very much. These sheriffs have been meeting with the president of the United States.  He's going to have some comments before heading out to El Paso, Texas, later tonight.  Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto. And you're watching \"Your World.\"  And in the middle of this fight over what to do about the wall, we have a sudden impasse over not the funding for the wall itself, but the facilities meant to detain illegals who are here in this country.  These sheriffs have been by and large supporting the president on the wall effort. He could run into some resistance when he gets to El Paso, the way he has described El Paso, as a city that was riddled with crime before a wall was built, and a lot of that crime just disappeared. But ahead of that, what we have learned as well is that the president does want to sell his case that he has made concessions to Democrats in order to get a shutdown off the table.  But we're hearing right now that, because of other Democratic demands that have nothing to do with the wall, per se, he's kind of run into a buzz saw on that. We're going to get the read from Steny Hoyer, the majority leader in the House of Representatives, very, very shortly.  But for the president of the United States, this is his first opening campaign salvo, if you will, some say of the 2020 political season. The president and the vice president now meeting some of these sheriffs, big proponents of tougher protection at the border, including El Paso, where the president will be leaving right after he finishes with these guys.   Let's listen in to this.",

      "speaker": "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP",
      "sentences": "So, thank you very much. I'm heading out to El Paso, Texas, right now. And we are going to do a job. We're going to continue to do what we're doing. I think we've made a lot of progress.   We've actually started a big, big portion of wall today in a very important location. And it's going to go up pretty quickly over the next nine months. That whole area will be finished. It's fully funded. Construction, which I know a lot about, has begun. And it's a much better wall, much stronger wall, and a much less expensive wall than we've been building. And we're going to have a lot of wall being built in the last -- in the next period of time. I'm with some of the great law enforcement people. A lot of them are friends of mine. I've known them for a long time, and they've been fantastic people. Fantastic men and women. And they know what we're up against. We're up against people who want to allow criminals into our society. Can you explain that one? You know, most things you understand, but they want to allow criminals into our society. Convicted felons -- people of tremendous -- like, big problems.  I just got this from Homeland Security. And you look at this -- thousands of people. Dangerous drugs: 76,000 people. Then you have traffic offenses. That's not so good, but that's -- every crime. Assault: 63,000 people. Larceny: 20,000 people. Fraudulent activities, 12,000 people, burglaries, 12,000 people.   These, again, are just a different crime, robberies. These are the people coming into our country that we are holding and we don't want in our country. And the Democrats want them to go into our country, that's why they don't want to give us what we call the beds. It's much more complicated than beds. But we call them the beds.  Robberies, 5,991. Sexual assaults, 6,350. Forgeries, 5,158. Stolen property, 4,462. These are people we're talking about. Kidnapping -- these are people that kidnap people. The Democrats want them to come into our society. I don't think so. Anybody here who would like to have a lot of kidnappers left in our society? I don't think -- I won't bother waiting for you to raise your hand, right? Kidnappings, 2,085. Homicides -- that means murder -- murderers, 2,028.  I mean, it's incredible. Sexual offenses, 1,739. Just came out two minutes ago. Homeland Security. The Department of Homeland Security. I don't know, maybe we're in a different country than I know of.  And we're going to El Paso. We have a line that is very long already. I mean, you see what's going on. And I understand our competitor has got a line too, but it's a tiny, little line. Of course, they'll make it sound like they had more people than we do. That's not going to happen. But we're going there for a reason. We're going there to keep our country safe. And we don't want murderers and drug dealers and gang members, MS- 13, and some of the worst people in the world coming into our country.  Now, Mexico has had the worst year they've ever had. Almost 40,000 killings in Mexico this year. One of the most unsafe places, unfortunately. We need a wall. And all of the other things are nice to have. But without a wall, it's not going to work. We can have technology, we can have beautiful drones flying all over the place, but it doesn't work without the wall.   Now, we need a wall. We can call it anything. We'll call it barriers. We'll call it whatever they want. But now, it turns out not only don't they want to give us money for the wall, they don't want to give us the space to detain murderers, criminals, drug dealers, human smugglers. How bad is that? Human smuggling. People think of that as an ancient art. There are more human smugglers right now -- traffickers, they call them -- than at any time in the history of our world, because of the Internet, unfortunately. So, I'm heading out and we have a tremendous crowd. Like, tremendous. They have 75,000 people signed up. I think the arena holds like 8,000 people, unfortunately. I like the old days when I was allowed to make outdoors speeches. It was a lot easier because you could have very big crowds, John.  But we have a tremendous crowd. We have screens on the outside of the arena, so we'll have a lot of people coming. And again, if you look at your own newscasts, you'll see people lined up for a long way. A lot of people.  Sheriff, would you like to say something?",

It was a lot less than the president wanted, a little less than $2 billion. He wanted close to something like $5.7 billion. But they were there. And, then all of a sudden, the dust-up over detention beds at ICE centers that has now threatened to sort of unhinge this.  Let's get to read from the House majority leader, Steny Hoyer.

Shutting down the government ought not to be an option. But we want to see an agreement reached. Ms. Roybal-Allard put out a statement just the -- just a few hours ago as to why we were trying to restrict the numbers of beds.  Now, let me say, the president's statement that he just made is absolutely incorrect. In Ms. Roybal-Allard's statement -- she's the chair of the Homeland Security Subcommittee on the Appropriations Committee. She said, clearly, they wanted to have sufficient beds to house -- to keep whatever criminals are elected -- or arrested.  And we think that that is the proper thing for ICE to do. Clearly, if we have people who are committing crimes, putting in danger either people or property, they ought to be taken off the streets and, frankly, incarcerated are held. But we're talking about beds sufficient not to deal with criminals, which is what the case is now, but dealing with people who are working, paying taxes in our community, and our subject obviously to civil action, but should not be held.",

Now, critics of the United States says we're late to this A.I. party, that the Chinese are way ahead of us, because they have been committing billions of dollars to this, and we're sort of late to this. So, this is more coordination of those efforts. But we will keep a close eye on it here. And whether this comes up in the trade talks that are continuing this week is anyone's guess. But it's China and the United States trying to dominate an area that is bigger than the space program was back in the '60s. We will keep an eye out on it for you.

These sheriffs have been meeting with the president of the United States.  He's going to have some comments before heading out to El Paso, Texas, later tonight. Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto. And you're watching \"Your World.\" And in the middle of this fight over what to do about the wall, we have a sudden impasse over not the funding for the wall itself, but the facilities meant to detain illegals who are here in this country. These sheriffs have been by and large supporting the president on the wall effort. He could run into some resistance when he gets to El Paso, the way he has described El Paso, as a city that was riddled with crime before a wall was built, and a lot of that crime just disappeared. But ahead of that, what we have learned as well is that the president does want to sell his case that he has made concessions to Democrats in order to get a shutdown off the table. But we're hearing right now that, because of other Democratic demands that have nothing to do with the wall, per se, he's kind of run into a buzz saw on that. We're going to get the read from Steny Hoyer, the majority leader in the House of Representatives, very, very shortly. But for the president of the United States, this is his first opening campaign salvo, if you will, some say of the 2020 political season. The president and the vice president now meeting some of these sheriffs, big proponents of tougher protection at the border, including El Paso, where the president will be leaving right after he finishes with these guys. Let's listen in to this."

I think we've made a lot of progress. We've actually started a big, big portion of wall today in a very important location. And it's going to go up pretty quickly over the next nine months. That whole area will be finished. It's fully funded. Construction, which I know a lot about, has begun. And it's a much better wall, much stronger wall, and a much less expensive wall than we've been building. And we're going to have a lot of wall being built in the last -- in the next period of time. I'm with some of the great law enforcement people. A lot of them are friends of mine. I've known them for a long time, and they've been fantastic people. Fantastic men and women. And they know what we're up against. We're up against people who want to allow criminals into our society. Can you explain that one? You know, most things you understand, but they want to allow criminals into our society. Convicted felons -- people of tremendous -- like, big problems."

Fraudulent activities, 12,000 people, burglaries, 12,000 people. These, again, are just a different crime, robberies. These are the people coming into our country that we are holding and we don't want in our country. And the Democrats want them to go into our country, that's why they don't want to give us what we call the beds. It's much more complicated than beds. But we call them the beds. Robberies, 5,991. Sexual assaults, 6,350. Forgeries, 5,158. Stolen property, 4,462. These are people we're talking about. Kidnapping -- these are people that kidnap people. The Democrats want them to come into our society. I don't think so. Anybody here who would like to have a lot of kidnappers left in our society? I don't think -- I won't bother waiting for you to raise your hand, right? Kidnappings, 2,085. Homicides -- that means murder -- murderers, 2,028. I mean, it's incredible. Sexual offenses, 1,739. Just came out two minutes ago. Homeland Security. The Department of Homeland Security. I don't know, maybe we're in a different country than I know of. And we're going to El Paso. We have a line that is very long already. I mean, you see what's going on. And I understand our competitor has got a line too, but it's a tiny, little line. Of course, they'll make it sound like they had more people than we do. That's not going to happen. But we're going there for a reason. We're going there to keep our country safe. And we don't want murderers and drug dealers and gang members, MS- 13, and some of the worst people in the world coming into our country. Now, Mexico has had the worst year they've ever had. Almost 40,000 killings in Mexico this year. One of the most unsafe places, unfortunately. We need a wall. And all of the other things are nice to have. But without a wall, it's not going to work. We can have technology, we can have beautiful drones flying all over the place, but it doesn't work without the wall. Now, we need a wall. We can call it anything. We'll call it barriers. We'll call it whatever they want. But now, it turns out not only don't they want to give us money for the wall, they don't want to give us the space to detain murderers, criminals, drug dealers, human smugglers. How bad is that? Human smuggling. People think of that as an ancient art. There are more human smugglers right now -- traffickers, they call them -- than at any time in the history of our world, because of the Internet, unfortunately. So, I'm heading out and we have a tremendous crowd. Like, tremendous. They have 75,000 people signed up. I think the arena holds like 8,000 people, unfortunately. I like the old days when I was allowed to make outdoors speeches. It was a lot easier because you could have very big crowds, John. But we have a tremendous crowd. We have screens on the outside of the arena, so we'll have a lot of people coming. And again, if you look at your own newscasts, you'll see people lined up for a long way. A lot of people.

It was a lot less than the president wanted, a little less than $2 billion. He wanted close to something like $5.7 billion. But they were there.

Shutting down the government ought not to be an option. But we want to see an agreement reached. Ms. Roybal-Allard put out a statement just the -- just a few hours ago as to why we were trying to restrict the numbers of beds. Now, let me say, the president's statement that he just made is absolutely incorrect. In Ms. Roybal-Allard's statement -- she's the chair of the Homeland Security Subcommittee on the Appropriations Committee. She said, clearly, they wanted to have sufficient beds to house -- to keep whatever criminals are elected -- or arrested. And we think that that is the proper thing for ICE to do. Clearly, if we have people who are committing crimes, putting in danger either people or property, they ought to be taken off the streets and, frankly, incarcerated are held. But we're talking about beds sufficient not to deal with criminals, which is what the case is now, but dealing with people who are working, paying taxes in our community, and our subject obviously to civil action, but should not be held."

Now, if you're scratching and saying, well, this is a big issue we have with the Chinese and our ongoing talks with them, remember, we have been saying that the Chinese disproportionately pour a great deal of money into that. And this is our response there. If they're going to continue doing so -- and right now, there's no indication they're going to lighten up in that regard -- we're going to do so. Now, critics of the United States says we're late to this A.I. party, that the Chinese are way ahead of us, because they have been committing billions of dollars to this, and we're sort of late to this. So, this is more coordination of those efforts. But we will keep a close eye on it here. And whether this comes up in the trade talks that are continuing this week is anyone's guess. But it's China and the United States trying to dominate an area that is bigger than the space program was back in the '60s. We will keep an eye out on it for you.

And when Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer say this is a manufactured crisis, they're absolutely wrong. The American people want us to secure our nation, secure our border. They also want to have us keep the government open. Now, the president has been very patient in trying to negotiate with the Democrats. And they just will not come to the negotiating table. And when they do, they move the goalposts. So I hope that they can get things done. I have heard that there's a meeting going on right now. So let's hope it gets done, so we can keep the government open, but also secure our borders. This is important. This is the number one mission of Congress, is to secure our nation and protect our people. Let's get this done. And let's have the Democrats stop this nonsense. Come to the negotiating table. Get it done."

But I have to tell you, when one side, the Democrats, won't even come to the negotiating table, and when they do, they change the goalposts, it's very disappointing, very discouraging. I'm glad that we have the president that we have, because, quite frankly, if we had a Democrat president, this -- you know, our nation would be totally insecure."

We will see. The president, to the congresswoman's point, is headed to El Paso, Texas. He ran into some criticism when he said the city was an example of a place that benefited from barriers, that they reduced crime. The mayor of El Paso was furious over that. He's Republican. And he's next."

Of course, the end of his comments about us being one of the safest cities in the nation, it's correct. We are, according to the uniform crime statistics reported to the FBI, the lowest -- we have the lowest crime rate of any city greater -- with a population greater than 500,000.

Homeland Security will talk about that. But it stopped a number of automobile thefts and crimes of that nature from occurring. People were coming over, and then they would steal their vehicles and drive them across the bridge into Juarez, Mexico. So that went way down. So -- and some of the -- and then neighbors in the Chihuahuita neighborhood have anecdotally told me they feel pretty safe with that fence there. So, you know, it has some benefits. But the primary reason we had such a low crime rate were due to our police department and the neighborhood policing we were doing, so community policing. So, it was a combination of, I guess, all of the above."

I mean, it was -- we were significantly low on crime to begin with and always have been. We have been tainted somewhat by the perception of Juarez, Mexico, when they were going their -- in the early part of the 2000s and '6 and '7 and '8 maybe when they were having their drug wars and the cartels were fighting it out.

We caught all of these announcements, including Elizabeth Warren's. And then yesterday, of course, you saw Amy Klobuchar in the snow and all. But it's an expanding field. And they're not done yet. The read on what they're saying and the boxes they're checking off I was discussing during the break with Robert Wolf. Let's get into that with him. We also have GOP strategist Justin Sayfie and The Washington Examiner's Tiana Lowe. To a man or woman at this stage, Robert, they're all in agreement on the big stuff, right, the big stuff being? ROBERT WOLF, 32 ADVISORS: Health care is right, climate change, pro- immigration, and gun reform. And all of them, from populist to moderate, have to check those four boxes. Then I believe it's who can best beat Trump. And I think you have to be a pro-growth Democrat to be able to beat Trump. You have to be strong in the economy"

If they -- if it's true that the Democrats need to have a pro-growth Democrat, they're going to have a hard time, because the progressives in the Democratic Party are going to pull them all the way to the left, more social programs, higher tax rates, Green New Deal. Everyone -- payment for everyone who doesn't want to work, unwilling to work, as we saw in AOC's original statement on that.

However, I think that we will see that change if Democrats decide that they want to run on these multitrillion-dollar spending packages, wealth taxes and estate taxes. And if you're just going to run against..."

Is it your sense that some have a better network of support, donors? I mean, Kamala Harris' name comes up a lot for that, Beto O'Rourke, who hasn't announced, but might, as a sensation who can raise money, of course Joe Biden.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right. Well, Justin, the president obviously didn't accidentally, in his State of the Union address, refer to the socialist way of these, he called in and described it. And so he could be teeing up his approach to any of these guys, right?"

    {
      "speaker": "SAYFIE",
      "utterance": "He absolutely is. He's the master of defining the opposition. We saw that in the 2016 campaign. And you saw that when he mentioned socialism in the State of the Union address. And if the Democrats are going to nominate someone who's for the far left of their party, they can expect to have some of those socialist policies tagged on them and hung around their neck by the president with his Twitter feed with 58 million followers on Twitter."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, but he could be polling better, Tiana. So he is ripe to be taken down. Is it your sense that he's got to sharpen his focus, avoid the tweeting, stick to the big issues? He's been fairly big picture since the State of the Union. What do you think?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LOWE",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. You see -- whenever Trump takes a step back and doesn't let the news cycle revolve solely around him, his numbers always go up. People like a good economy. They like the sense that we're achieving some victories in the Middle East. The general sense is that the country itself is moving somewhat in the right direction, at least in an improved way. But then, when he makes himself the story, it does him no favors. We already saw after the shutdown his numbers have been slowly -- there have been mild increases in his approval rating. But he has to just avoid making himself the center of the story."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "And it is still early, I think, as all of you would remind me. We have a lot more coming up on this, including some surprises on the tax refund issue, not because of the IRS potentially shutting down again, but the refund checks themselves that are going out -- after this."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, the media's really been fixated on this IRS 2019 tax refund show thus far that shows refunds on average are down 8.4 percent from a year ago. But Kelsey Sheehy of NerdWallet.com, personal finance writer, isn't that a good thing, Kelsey?"
    },

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "So when I'm looking at lower refunds, it means that the government didn't hold as much of your money during the year as you would have feared, and maybe the lower taxes did that. But are now people coming to find out that, all right, I might be getting less back, that they're somehow getting gouged?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHEEHY",
      "utterance": "Well, I think a lot of people are surprised if they are getting a little bit of a lower tax refund this year. And one of the reasons that could be that a NerdWallet study found that 16 percent, only 16 percent of people went in and changed their withholdings after the new tax law last year. And whenever there's a big change, whether it's a family change or a change with the tax laws, it's good to go ahead and take a look at your withholdings to make sure you're having the right amount taken out. Ideally, you don't want to have a huge tax refund at the end of the year."
