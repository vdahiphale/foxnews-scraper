      "sentences": "Good evening and welcome to “Tucker Carlson Tonight.” It is all but official, Elizabeth Warren is now the Democratic frontrunner. In a survey released today by Quinnipiac University in Connecticut, Warren maintains a seven-point lead over Joe Biden -- that's the candidate all the people on television assures us will be the Democratic nominee.  Warren is a full 13 points ahead of Bernie Sanders. Now keep in mind that both Warren and Sanders are Northeastern socialists. They're polling from essentially the same strain of Democratic primary voters. Splitting that vote should dramatically weaken Warren's position in the field, but she is leading any way. That's how dominant she is.  So unless something unforeseen and dramatic happens between now and next spring -- and it could -- but if it doesn't, Elizabeth Warren will be the Democratic nominee. And that, as they say, has implications for all of us. Her many terrible policy ideas, obviously we'll get to those in just a minute, but more immediately, there is Warren herself.  You're going to be seeing a lot of Elizabeth Warren over the next year. She'll be on your television screen nonstop. You will hear her voice rising from your car radio at red lights. If you live in Iowa, New Hampshire, or South Carolina, you may find her in the flesh loitering outside your Starbucks or waiting on your doorstep.  Prepare yourself because wherever there is Elizabeth Warren, there is falseness. Fake is who Warren is. She is authentically ersatz. It turns out that pretending to be an Indian is not the least real thing Warren has ever done. She is always that synthetic, even when she is sitting around the kitchen.",

They'd have to be reading off cue cards, complete with intentionally bad grammar for that patina of middle class authenticity.  I'm going to get me a beer says the Harvard professor. Fetch me my Winston's. I'm hankering for a smoke. You have got to be kidding. Except Elizabeth Warren isn't kidding. She expects you to believe every word of what she says. Which means you're watching someone who will say literally anything, whatever it takes. In the primaries on the Democratic side, what it takes is maximum leftward pander. So that's what Warren has delivered this season. There's no issue in which he doesn't have the most radical possible position. And for now, it's working. Quinnipiac confirms that.  But how will Warren's positions on the issues play with the rest of the country in next fall's general election? Let's see. On immigration, Warren wants to decriminalize all border crossings into this country. If that sounds crazy to you, you are hardly alone. Two thirds of the country opposes that idea, too.   Warren also says she wants to abolish I.C.E., that's our Federal Immigration Enforcement Agency. How many Americans agree with her on that? Fewer than 25 percent agree with Elizabeth Warren on that. Under her plan, we'd likely see a huge increase in illegal immigration, of course, and she has told us that every one of those foreign nationals is entitled to completely free healthcare courtesy of you. How many Americans approve of that idea? Well, not that many, not surprisingly. Though more than say they favor say race based reparations. And that's something else that Warren has called for. Sending people tax dollars based on their skin color is a genuinely unpopular idea in this country. But Warren doesn't seem to care.  As she has pointed out before, America is so racist, we deserve it.",

You've got to wonder which bored teaching assistant in what mediocre State University thought up that phrase -- healthcare racism -- and what it might mean. Warren didn't bother to define it, of course. In her world, it is self-explanatory.  You just add the word racism after any category of public policy and all the woke kids nod in unison. Oh, healthcare racism. Yes, man. It's systemic. This country was built on healthcare racism. Of course, it was.  And that, ladies and gentlemen, is why we need Medicare-for-All. It's a costly plan to be sure. But it's a plan that Elizabeth Warren, because she is magic, being infused with the power of her ancestral Cherokee spirit animals can pay for without raising taxes on you, or anyone you know, or anyone you will ever meet. She can do that. She swears she can. MARC LACEY, NATIONAL EDITOR, \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\": Will you raise taxes on the middle class for pay to pay for it? Yes or no?",

And she -- you know, she's running around in these debates, Tucker and she is saying, well, you know, I know how to do this. I set up the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

So she's going to continue to pander because Elizabeth Warren's policy prescriptions don't resonate in the black community or in any community, frankly, because as you've indicated, they are a little bit -- they're insane. Look at some of the immigration proposals that harm black folks, and she is favor of abolishing private healthcare. That's crazy.

      "utterance": "Good evening and welcome to “Tucker Carlson Tonight.” It is all but official, Elizabeth Warren is now the Democratic frontrunner. In a survey released today by Quinnipiac University in Connecticut, Warren maintains a seven-point lead over Joe Biden -- that's the candidate all the people on television assures us will be the Democratic nominee. Warren is a full 13 points ahead of Bernie Sanders. Now keep in mind that both Warren and Sanders are Northeastern socialists. They're polling from essentially the same strain of Democratic primary voters. Splitting that vote should dramatically weaken Warren's position in the field, but she is leading any way. That's how dominant she is. So unless something unforeseen and dramatic happens between now and next spring -- and it could -- but if it doesn't, Elizabeth Warren will be the Democratic nominee. And that, as they say, has implications for all of us. Her many terrible policy ideas, obviously we'll get to those in just a minute, but more immediately, there is Warren herself. You're going to be seeing a lot of Elizabeth Warren over the next year. She'll be on your television screen nonstop. You will hear her voice rising from your car radio at red lights. If you live in Iowa, New Hampshire, or South Carolina, you may find her in the flesh loitering outside your Starbucks or waiting on your doorstep. Prepare yourself because wherever there is Elizabeth Warren, there is falseness. Fake is who Warren is. She is authentically ersatz. It turns out that pretending to be an Indian is not the least real thing Warren has ever done. She is always that synthetic, even when she is sitting around the kitchen."

They'd have to be reading off cue cards, complete with intentionally bad grammar for that patina of middle class authenticity. I'm going to get me a beer says the Harvard professor. Fetch me my Winston's. I'm hankering for a smoke. You have got to be kidding. Except Elizabeth Warren isn't kidding. She expects you to believe every word of what she says. Which means you're watching someone who will say literally anything, whatever it takes. In the primaries on the Democratic side, what it takes is maximum leftward pander. So that's what Warren has delivered this season. There's no issue in which he doesn't have the most radical possible position. And for now, it's working. Quinnipiac confirms that. But how will Warren's positions on the issues play with the rest of the country in next fall's general election? Let's see. On immigration, Warren wants to decriminalize all border crossings into this country. If that sounds crazy to you, you are hardly alone. Two thirds of the country opposes that idea, too. Warren also says she wants to abolish I.C.E., that's our Federal Immigration Enforcement Agency. How many Americans agree with her on that? Fewer than 25 percent agree with Elizabeth Warren on that. Under her plan, we'd likely see a huge increase in illegal immigration, of course, and she has told us that every one of those foreign nationals is entitled to completely free healthcare courtesy of you. How many Americans approve of that idea? Well, not that many, not surprisingly. Though more than say they favor say race based reparations. And that's something else that Warren has called for. Sending people tax dollars based on their skin color is a genuinely unpopular idea in this country. But Warren doesn't seem to care. As she has pointed out before, America is so racist, we deserve it."

Oh, healthcare racism. Yes, man. It's systemic. This country was built on healthcare racism. Of course, it was. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is why we need Medicare-for-All. It's a costly plan to be sure. But it's a plan that Elizabeth Warren, because she is magic, being infused with the power of her ancestral Cherokee spirit animals can pay for without raising taxes on you, or anyone you know, or anyone you will ever meet.

And, you know, even people like Larry Summers, who was the Treasury Secretary under Clinton, the President of Harvard University for a while, he is saying this is ridiculous. Larry Summers is saying this. He is the quintessential pointy headed intellectual who can't park a bicycle straight as George Wallace used to say. He is saying it is BS. I'll give you another example. You know who else says it's ridiculous? Jonathan Gruber. You remember that name? That's the original flim-flam man of Obamacare. He is saying this is ridiculous. And she -- you know, she's running around in these debates, Tucker and she is saying, well, you know, I know how to do this. I set up the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Has she seen the docket for the Supreme Court? They're going to decide whether that's unconstitutional. You know, it probably is, just like this wealth tax is unconstitutional. And she wants everybody to pay higher taxes. We have something in Massachusetts, Tucker, you could -- you have an option to pay at the old Dukakis era tax rate 5.85 percent as opposed to 5 percent. Guess what? You know she wants to raise everybody's taxes to 70 to 90 percent, the top marginal rate for Federal income tax.

And the question goes, how is she going to pay for this? Well, you know, if you messed up and you have $200,000.00 in loans, and for a worthless degree in non-binary archery, well, she's got a solution for that.

She's at four percent in South Carolina, where you know, 60 percent of black voters, 60 percent of the primary voters are black. She is doing extremely poorly there. Nationwide, she is only at 19 percent. And it's imperative for a Democratic candidate to get anywhere from 85 and closer to 95 percent of the black vote and a robust turnout because Hillary Clinton got 89 percent of the black vote, but only -- well, four million fewer blacks came out to vote for her and you know, she lost the election. So she's going to continue to pander because Elizabeth Warren's policy prescriptions don't resonate in the black community or in any community, frankly, because as you've indicated, they are a little bit -- they're insane. Look at some of the immigration proposals that harm black folks, and she is favor of abolishing private healthcare. That's crazy. So she's continuing to pander by using -- trying to use the language that she thinks will sell herself to black voters, and it makes her look more phony.

In addition to those, his name was used as a selling point in a fraudulent bond scheme that one of his business partners was allegedly involved in. A South Dakota American Indian tribe, as well as several pension funds were conned in a bogus business deal and according to court documents, Hunter Biden's name was used to give that deal the veneer of legitimacy. Now, it's not news to viewers of this program. We reported on Biden's connection to that fraudulent scheme weeks ago. We were way ahead in the story, and we plan to keep it that way. Congressman Matt Gaetz took a strong stand against impeachment yesterday, and instead of arguing with him, the left decided to attack him based on his skin color. That actually happened live on television. Some of the most famous people in America did that out loud. He responded to that. There is a fascinating exchange that tells you a lot about the modern left. He will join us after the break."

So yesterday, Congressman Matt Gaetz of Florida and several other Republican Members of Congress occupied a closed or impeachment hearing and insisted that these proceedings ought to be public, at least to other Members of the House of Representatives. But instead of debating that question, though, the press and the Democratic Party had another angle. Gaetz and his allies were wrong because of how they were born, because of their skin color.

I guess, Tucker, I'm a little old fashioned. I identify as a white male because I am a white male, and to use language the left is familiar with, I guess it's because I was born this way. But you know what? I predicted this last night sitting next to you on your show. I said that Democrats in the House were trying to impeach President Trump because they did not want to substantively engage him on the issues and that this was part of a broader strategy to deplatform, de-legitimize and destroy anyone who champions the America First agenda. We saw that in play before your show even came back on because instead of discussing the serious issues, they just talk about my race."

So is the standard that we're allowed to dismiss people because of their skin color? I mean, I don't want to live in a country where people do that. I think it's awful. But that's commonplace now. Why would -- why would NBC allow that and what did they say when you called them on it?"

I said it was offensive and it's not reflective of a substantive interview and I tried to then get to, I think what is the important substance because the risk, Tucker is that if we take the bait, to always be discussing identity rather than the work the President is doing, or frankly, the work we're doing to try to have more openness in this impeachment process, then the left wins. But we see this as a new strategy, whether it's Ayanna Pressley saying we don't need any more black faces, there are black voices, or any more queer faces, there are queer voices. I don't know what that means. But it is part of the new game plan for them to try to avoid substantive discussions on the issues by making everything about identity. We should stand against that."

There are academic departments and they have mechanisms in place in the institution to prevent people from pursuing truth on their own, from hearing different voices. And if you just think about it in terms of free speech, I think it misses the larger issue that what these folks are really after, and what I mean by these folks, many in the academic left who is really there -- there's no polite way to say it -- they have been pressed to ties by an invasive ideology. These people are really after your cognitive liberties."

      "utterance": "Well, the 2017 piece there is a piece in \"The Wall Street Journal\" in 2018 says that bias response teams, for example, as one mechanism of enforcement are at 232 universities. And if you look at the Portland State University webpage, it says bias is a state of mind. So, I mean, really, you need to let that idea percolate. It is a state of mind."

      "utterance": "And people can file responses with the bias response team complaints without putting their name on it, they can do it anonymously, and anybody can be accused of anything. I think a key thing that's really important to understand here is terms people use. Have you heard of the idea of inclusive speech or an inclusive space?"

And if it didn't restrict speech, then by definition, it wouldn't be welcoming. So there are mechanisms within the university to restrict speech, to prevent freedom of expression, to prevent freedom of assembly, to shout people down, for example, if they don't agree with you. But again, I think the real emphasis here is they are after cognitive liberty. They are absolutely convinced that they have the right answers to questions."

What Iger was talking about, you know, we've now seen this with ESPN, which is a Disney unit, which is now showing maps -- Communist Party maps -- instead of maps which are more coincident with reality. So what we're seeing is China trying to use its power to intimidate companies, to do its bidding, and this oftentimes goes against our free marketplace of ideas."

But unfortunately, we can't have both and we're going to have to make a choice, Tucker.

Do I have to do a -- she is thinking, have I done a photo op at the content farm? Have I been to the Iowa content farms? The dark web is in -- the dark web is in northern New Hampshire. I think that's where they have the first pancake flip. It's on the shortest day of the year in December. And we all get up in the morning and you get a dark web of pancake dough in the New Hampshire primary. She has no idea. These are phrases, but the fact -- the fact is, there's seven billion people on the planet. And basically about six and a half billion people were on the dark web conspiring to actually steal the presidency from her. You know, there are headhunters in Papua New Guinea that are leading blameless lives in the middle of the jungle, who suddenly switch on TV in the middle of the night and discover that Hillary is blaming them for her defeat.
