Yes, it's worse than the worst thing ever. And, of course, you know, they're the heroes. So, why commemorate it if it's so bad? Well, first, it's easy. It's just one day, right? I mean, try commemorating the riots after George Floyd or Jacob Blake or the burning down of various cities, and don't forget the violent melees after Trump won in 2016. You'd have to hold a commemoration every single day. It be like combining Groundhog Day with Rodney King. But don't hold your breath. Well, unless you're in an elevator with Eric Swalwell.",

So, instead of acknowledging the many of the dead caused by those relentless media-approved riots of 2019 and onward, the press chooses to amp up one day of rioting. When they falsely call an insurrection since no one's been charged with insurrecting anything. Hell more people died at that Travis Scott show. And worse, they salute online narcs who helped get people arrested for wandering around that day, even after some Capitol Police held the doors open for them. Yes, our government deputize a nation of Staci Karens (PH), under the line guys of sedition to ruin people's lives. And if you don't play the media's game, they will say you're playing the event down. Screw them. They're lying. It's the only thing they're good at. As we've said before, about January 6th, it's a riot, and riots are bad. That's what makes us good people here at Fox. We view all violence as unseemly. Well, unless it involves a safe word. That reminds me, Bill Hemmer, I need my leather mask back. But the legacy media is just faking outrage to hide their own pro-violence stance, which is like Stelter trying to hide behind a flagpole. See to them, crime and death are just political weapons, the kind that can be hidden when necessary to win an election, and then one to play up in order to not lose an election. Let's not forget how the media manipulated the riots and the crime wave for political favor.",

They only cared about January 6th to falsely smear millions of people who didn't vote for Joe while helping their own dying networks. That is they need Trump-like our president needs Metamucil. And more Trump content helps boost ratings that are limper than Kevin Spacey thumbing through a Victoria's Secret catalogue. CNN is going all in, and you can't blame them. Consider the mess they're in. A network that spent more time last year covering their ass than the news, and zero time covering up Jeffrey Toobin's Weiner. You got multiple anchors accused of sexual harassment. Their only star anchor fired in disgrace. Producers either arrested or implicated in deviant sex crimes that would make Jeffrey Epstein want to fly commercial. Yes, no wonder they couldn't cover that story either. It hit too close to home I guess. So, gasbags like Stelter gorge on January 6th, like it was an eclair founded a trashcan rather than the perversion exploding around him, anything to distract. And they've been wrong so many times on so many things that they need January 6th, more than Alec Baldwin needs an NRA instructor. It's really about shelf space. The libs got nothing to sell. Biden's horrendous performance is creating a kink in the supply chain for other news stories. All they have left is doom and gloom, inflation, crime, COVID, the border. That's all they have to filled their shelves. Is it any wonder that all of this is every bit as coordinated as their efforts to beat Trump which Time Magazine boasted about or openly punishing anyone who dare bring up Hunter Biden's laptop? And what coordination it is? You got the New Republic, USA Today, the A.P., The Daily Beast, The L.A. Times, a Hollywood reporter. And what do they have in common? Other than being covered in (INAUDIBLE) by the end of the day. Their media interviewing other media, forming a media human centipede. Feeding on its own waist, high on its own fumes. What's that tell you? That nothing ever happens in life until it happens to the media. Crime didn't exist, you see? Until one day in January put the media and their idols on center stage. What's next is the cast of Hamilton going to pop by to commemorate the day?",

Yet, they finally found a dead, unarmed female protester, they didn't give (INAUDIBLE) about. Meanwhile, their lives weren't as bad as much danger as the day when Brian Williams who was in his third tour on Vietnam. But before that, when neighborhoods were destroyed, businesses plundered, innocent people terrorized. To the media, that was as alien as an episode of Star Trek, because they, the media wasn't the center of that universe. January 6th, though, was their story, as opposed to the riots, crime waves, you're suffering. So, for nearly two years, they pretended everything was great. But then January 6th happens, and suddenly, there's a threat to our fragile democracy. Yes, suddenly, they're pro-cop after a decade of painting targets on their backs. So, they use this day now to deflect from the devastation they wrought upon this country. It's the one product they can fill their shelves with, and they hope you care, but you see through it like a $3 shower curtain. You know, your pain was never the media's concern. Your pain didn't validate their core beliefs. In fact, your pain exposed how their own leftism led to our civil decline. To them, authentic violence had to be buried, unless they could use it against you. You'd be a sucker to fall for this. And it's on every Republican who does. You hear that, Liz?",

We understood that concern as uncivil as it may be and not characteristic of our community, It is not a crime.\" Now, of course, Florida has seen a population boom a lot coming from New York. One former New Yorker who now lives in Palm Beach said the letters were another sign that our democracy is in peril. There it is again.

And worse, they salute online narcs who helped get people arrested for wandering around that day, even after some Capitol Police held the doors open for them. Yes, our government deputize a nation of Staci Karens (PH), under the line guys of sedition to ruin people's lives. And if you don't play the media's game, they will say you're playing the event down. Screw them. They're lying. It's the only thing they're good at. As we've said before, about January 6th, it's a riot, and riots are bad. That's what makes us good people here at Fox. We view all violence as unseemly. Well, unless it involves a safe word. That reminds me, Bill Hemmer, I need my leather mask back. But the legacy media is just faking outrage to hide their own pro-violence stance, which is like Stelter trying to hide behind a flagpole. See to them, crime and death are just political weapons, the kind that can be hidden when necessary to win an election, and then one to play up in order to not lose an election.

They only cared about January 6th to falsely smear millions of people who didn't vote for Joe while helping their own dying networks. That is they need Trump-like our president needs Metamucil. And more Trump content helps boost ratings that are limper than Kevin Spacey thumbing through a Victoria's Secret catalogue. CNN is going all in, and you can't blame them. Consider the mess they're in. A network that spent more time last year covering their ass than the news, and zero time covering up Jeffrey Toobin's Weiner. You got multiple anchors accused of sexual harassment. Their only star anchor fired in disgrace. Producers either arrested or implicated in deviant sex crimes that would make Jeffrey Epstein want to fly commercial. Yes, no wonder they couldn't cover that story either. It hit too close to home I guess. So, gasbags like Stelter gorge on January 6th, like it was an eclair founded a trashcan rather than the perversion exploding around him, anything to distract. And they've been wrong so many times on so many things that they need January 6th, more than Alec Baldwin needs an NRA instructor. It's really about shelf space. The libs got nothing to sell. Biden's horrendous performance is creating a kink in the supply chain for other news stories. All they have left is doom and gloom, inflation, crime, COVID, the border. That's all they have to filled their shelves. Is it any wonder that all of this is every bit as coordinated as their efforts to beat Trump which Time Magazine boasted about or openly punishing anyone who dare bring up Hunter Biden's laptop? And what coordination it is? You got the New Republic, USA Today, the A.P., The Daily Beast, The L.A. Times, a Hollywood reporter. And what do they have in common? Other than being covered in (INAUDIBLE) by the end of the day. Their media interviewing other media, forming a media human centipede. Feeding on its own waist, high on its own fumes. What's that tell you? That nothing ever happens in life until it happens to the media. Crime didn't exist, you see? Until one day in January put the media and their idols on center stage. What's next is the cast of Hamilton going to pop by to commemorate the day?"

So, suddenly, according to the media, the world's in danger because they were in danger, when in fact, the only person who was murdered was an unarmed woman who are brave media dare not mention ever. Yet, they finally found a dead, unarmed female protester, they didn't give (INAUDIBLE) about. Meanwhile, their lives weren't as bad as much danger as the day when Brian Williams who was in his third tour on Vietnam. But before that, when neighborhoods were destroyed, businesses plundered, innocent people terrorized. To the media, that was as alien as an episode of Star Trek, because they, the media wasn't the center of that universe. January 6th, though, was their story, as opposed to the riots, crime waves, you're suffering. So, for nearly two years, they pretended everything was great. But then January 6th happens, and suddenly, there's a threat to our fragile democracy. Yes, suddenly, they're pro-cop after a decade of painting targets on their backs. So, they use this day now to deflect from the devastation they wrought upon this country. It's the one product they can fill their shelves with, and they hope you care, but you see through it like a $3 shower curtain. You know, your pain was never the media's concern. Your pain didn't validate their core beliefs. In fact, your pain exposed how their own leftism led to our civil decline. To them, authentic violence had to be buried, unless they could use it against you. You'd be a sucker to fall for this. And it's on every Republican who does. You hear that, Liz?"

Which is still friendlier than the messages on cars in San Francisco, which is eat me written with a pile of human poop. Thanks for well to do that. Several people reported the letters to Palm Beach Police. Did I say people? I'm sorry, I meant -- But after an investigation, it was determined a crime hadn't been committed, said a spokesman \"Residents were concerned about the lack of civility and respect for personal property. We understood that concern as uncivil as it may be and not characteristic of our community, It is not a crime.\" Now, of course, Florida has seen a population boom a lot coming from New York. One former New Yorker who now lives in Palm Beach said the letters were another sign that our democracy is in peril. There it is again. Well, that seems like an overreaction or exactly what you'd expect from a big crybaby was from the city. If there was ever a sign our democracy is in peril, I put my money on the new pro-criminal directives coming from New York City's woke D.A.

      "utterance": "Women have started an internet squabble. Is it better or worse to look like a model? TikTok content creators, which is as I understand awful people, have been sharing videos on the platform about their pretty privilege. In the videos, the women claim that they get certain perks that others don't get simply because they're attractive. Tell me about it. The last time I went to Costco, they gave me free samples."

So, for example, I'm not being charged for that extra drink or dessert at a restaurant. I'm having someone offered to put the air in your tires rather than see you struggle doing it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",

      "speaker": "UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE",
      "utterance": "Everybody on this app wants to talk about how people are consistently benefiting from pretty privileged, but nobody wants to talk about how pretty privilege can actually affect your life in a negative way. Another thing is girls seeing you as competition. Sometimes a girl will front as your friend but literally she has the worst intentions for you and she secretly won't see you fail. And I talked about this before but feeling lonely and just being excluded from things."

      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "Maybe you should settle it with a pillow fight, a sexist might say. But yes, it has to be the reason women don't want to be friends with you because you are hot. And definitely not because you sit around filming yourself talking about how you are so hot that it's hard for you sometimes. Who do they think they are, AOC? All right, Dagen, you're a woman. I believe that women deserve this privilege because life is hard for women because they pay a heavy price on the commodity of youth. So, they got to use it while they got it. Is that a fair summation?"

And honestly, I think it's pretty much the same. I'm glad that like if -- I think there's nothing worse honestly than being like a super-hot 22-year- old because then you just are stressed out constantly about losing it. Like, what if I'm not going to be hot anymore? Like, I was an ugly 22-year- old, so it's not so bad for me. I just have to focus on, as you mentioned, dying younger before as a woman society casts me away due to my age."
