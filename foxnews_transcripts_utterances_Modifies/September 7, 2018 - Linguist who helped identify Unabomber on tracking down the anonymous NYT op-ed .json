So we were anticipating a letter from the state department official to be handed from Kim Jong-un in North Korea to our President. It has now just happened. Our own Rich Edson of Fox News is reporting that he can confirm that part of what President Trump talked about aboard Air Force One today has happened. The Secretary of State Pompeo has received a letter from Kim Jong-un to give to President Trump. Remember, the course is still going forward after their meeting, that summit, denuclearization is the goal. And now a letter to the president from their Chairman. We'll cover the news as this happens as more details pop on this. Also, breaking right now.",

There's generally a picture of the victim holding up a newspaper or something that can be dated.

We've been talking about it for a few days and not knowing if it's going to get to the U.S. or not but it's looking a little bit more likely. Take a look at some of the weather map. I'll show you a couple of things. First of all, we are climatologically right -- that's a big word climatologically right at the peak of hurricane season. September is a peak, September 10th and so we're right in that mode right now. And long with that, look at all these storms in the Pacific and the Atlantic, we have six storms we're watching out there. The three in the Atlantic are the ones now that potentially have some sort of impact for us, certainly Florence and also we are talking about that tropical depression number nine we are going to watch. This is a look at the path. Harris, it's really interesting, no storm that's ever been where this storm is now has ever hit anywhere around the U.S. And this one models are coming into better and better agreement that we are going to have some sort of impact from this. We have been seeing our models all show this moving up towards the north, maybe around Bermuda. Take a look at the latest track, it has moved much more to the south and heading straight towards the U.S. Will it curve out? It's possible that it will make a little curve before it hits here. We don't know. But these models that look we call them the spaghetti models they look really messy. They look much more in agreement than they did before.",

Our own Rich Edson of Fox News is reporting that he can confirm that part of what President Trump talked about aboard Air Force One today has happened. The Secretary of State Pompeo has received a letter from Kim Jong-un to give to President Trump. Remember, the course is still going forward after their meeting, that summit, denuclearization is the goal. And now a letter to the president from their Chairman.

Great to see you both. You both are so shy. Let's jump right in. (INAUDIBLE) let's see if you're listening. All right, so actually Antoine, I want to start with you. Barack Obama today former President had a whole lot to say reaching across, I guess, the aisle. He called evangelicals out by name.

And to the Republicans, I think today's speech means game on. It was refreshing to hear the leader like Barack Obama talk about what we're experiencing in this day. He talked about issues, he talked about the rhetoric, but most important he talked about how do we chart a path forward. And regardless if you're Democrat or Republican, I think most people agree that our democracy is on fire and we need political firefighters."

You look at the failed Iran deal, you look -- yes, let me finish, please. The fail Iran deal, look at how he had taxes -- high taxes and regulations that harmed hardworking Americans. There is a long list of things that former President Obama did that did not help Americans, hardworking Americans.

And he addressed it and if truth be told, if we look at pure numbers, take the emotional arguments out of it, compared to what he inherited from the Republican president before him to what he had to do to get our economy back on track, I think the proof is in the pudding. But larger than that, I think this says a lot -- his speech today spoke to the hearts and the minds of independent thinkers in this country because whether you're Democrat or Republican, black or white, California or South Carolina, most people will agree that we are starting to unravel at our core and in this country and it's a scary place as we move forward."

That division has been around for a while. Let's talk about the politics of it though. We're about to see these two men go. Remember when President Trump said a couple of weeks ago, six-seven days on the campaign trail. I can't even imagine what the Secret Service was thinking in that moment. But now you've got former President Barack Obama saying that he's going to insert himself. Deneen, how does that work out for a former President who lost more than a thousand national and state House seats?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BORELLI",
      "utterance": "Yes, that is a good question because first of all, the Democrat Party I think has a number of problems. There are big divisions because you have the activists, the liberals who want to bring in socialism. They are further to the left. And then you have the establishment Democrats who don't want to go that far to the left. So their message is split. And not only that, you have people like Maxine Waters for example who was calling for folks to get in the faces of Trump Administration personnel to go after them at the restaurants and gas stations. There are a number of issues that the Democrat Party is facing. They're not talking about policies that will help hardworking Americans."

We're seeing the benefits of the tax cuts and rollback in regulations, wages are going up, people are getting bonuses, more jobs in manufacturing, there are over 400,000 jobs since President Trump became president. So we're looking at a good economy that is clipping along and that is something that Americans are concerned about."

      "speaker": "FAULKNER",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "SEAWRIGHT",
      "utterance": "Well, let me say a few things. One, Barack Obama and his wife Michelle are the great unifiers and the great equalizer for the Democratic Party. In order for Democrats to be successful in November, it's going to take a united front of the Democratic Party. I believe those two are the two people that can bring the many facets of our party together. And number two, your guests failed to mention the policy prescriptions that Democrats are putting forth up and down the ballot in elections all across this country and that's why we've won over 40 somewhat legislature seats where President Trump won and 2016. That's why the Connor Lamb is the of Congressman from Pennsylvania, a district that Trump won by 20 points. That's why Doug Jones is the U.S. Senator from Alabama. Because when you talk about health care, when you talk about the economy, when you talk about the environment, when you talk about simple things that make sense to the heartbeats of the American soul, Democrats are campaigning on those things."

But questions still abound, Harris, about the now-infamous New York Times op-ed. You know, the one allegedly pinned by an anonymous administration official who claims to be working to subvert the President's policy goals. The larger argument percolating now, Harris, is this, whether or not that administration official who has admitted attempting to impede the function of government and its policy aims is, in fact, a national security threat. It is clear the president thinks so and today aboard Air Force One he said he wants that person found."

Let me share part of a statement from Eileen Murphy of The Times, it reads thusly, \"We're confident that the Department of Justice understands that the First Amendment protects all American citizens and that it would not participate in such a blatant abuse of government power.\" Now it is also important to point out that there is no criminal behavior necessarily and having penned that op-ed even for The Times anonymously thus making it unlikely the DOJ would pursue that person Harris criminally. However, the feds also might have a vested interest in locating that person if she or he is in the military or has any part of a national security portfolio. This story continues to unfold but for now back to you."

Kevin Corke, thank you very much. Great to see you. Let's bring in my next guest now and go a little bit deeper on this, an expert he is when it comes to deciphering writing. James Fitzgerald is a former FBI linguist who poured through Ted Kaczynski's manifestos -- boy we haven't said that name in a while -- and he was able to actually help eventually identify him as the Unabomber. He is the author of the memoir series a journey to the center of the mind. Great to see you tonight. Thank you for being with us, James Fitzgerald. Let's start with what you say should be a commonality in something and identifying someone and that is that they use the lingo that only people in the room or the circle would know about. Did you find that in this op-ed?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JAMES FITZGERALD, FORMER FBI AGENT",
      "utterance": "Well, I certainly did, Harris. And there's no question this person has an advanced level of writing skills and he or she -- not sure exactly gender at this point -- but they know how to write very succinctly, very cogently recode gently and get their points across. There's 27 paragraphs here, 14 of them are only one sentence which is kind of unusual for people's writing style. Paragraphs are generally supposed to be more than one sentence. However, some journalists do tend to write in only one sentence. So there are some and I'm certainly aware that this may have been -- there's been a copy editor involved in this to some degree at the New York Times maybe even several levels of that. So there may have been some editing here but there's definitely some language familiar to this person and certainly from someone who may be involved in the White House staff."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FAULKNER",
      "utterance": "So I made a similar observation although it's different experience that's driving it. You're looking at it forensically and I'm looking at it from the eyes of a journalist. Almost everything has some copy editing unless it's breaking news just to make sure that it -- the verbs are succinct and those sentences are easy to digest and remember which is why they tend to be very short. Let's talk about the perspective that you found from this writing. You say that there's no singular point that says, oh it's got to be this person because that's their expertise. You say you could almost get what's in this op-ed from reading about other stuff."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FITZGERALD",
      "utterance": "Sure. And what I -- I've handled dozens of these cases even in retirement in the last ten years from the FBI as a forensic linguist and there's a Web site called glassdoor.com. A lot of people go in that and complain about their jobs, their companies, their CEOs and I've been hired by some CEOs to try to find out who may have written these things. I don't judge whether it's right or wrong, whatever they asked me to try to find authorship and determine it, I do. And this letter, these 27 paragraphs could almost be sort of an elongated version of a Glassdoor posting complaining about a boss, about a company who does things wrong, so that's not all that unusual in terms of my experience. But what I've noticed most importantly in those other types of communications, they're what I call is a linguistic proof of life. You know, anybody familiar with you know, kidnapping cases. There's generally a picture of the victim holding up a newspaper or something that can be dated. And as you said earlier, Harris, there's really -- and that would be something that would prove the kidnap victim is still alive so of course pay the ransom etcetera. But here in this -- in this document, in all 27 paragraphs, there's not one thing that's singular as far as I know that hasn't been already mentioned in the media, in someone's book or various pundits commenting on. So to me, that ownership takes away from that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FAULKNER",
      "utterance": "Yes, it's what you're saying. It's like a calling card we all watched enough of those CSI types shows where they're leaving their calling card is what you're saying. I want to turn to a couple of things that you pointed out to my team. You said that -- you looked at some things. Let's put these words up on the -- on the screen if we can. That is why many Trump appointees have vowed to do what we can. You say that that's an important point to look at. Why is that, James?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FITZGERALD",
      "utterance": "Well, first of all, anonymous authors have two goals in mind. One, to get their point across and two, to remain anonymous. And it's about a 50/50 percentage roughly of how important they take each issue. So here in a letter that supposed to be anonymous, we have here an interesting autobiographical clue and that is -- that is why many Trump appointees have vowed to do what we can. So this person is including himself or herself in this group of Trump appointees. I would consider that and this is a linguistic term that I coined, a contra-indicator. That means it's against indications. It's against what's truthful. So it's very possible that this person is lumping -- they're lumping themselves in with a Trump appointee group but in reality, they may be not, that they may not be that. They may be a lower-level someone who just took a regular job and somehow now they're involved in the White House staff and some decision-making and all of a sudden they're trying to lump themselves in with this to try to make themselves appear more important but also not identified."

Booker is was coming into the Senate and saying, look, we need to understand where Kavanaugh stands, where he comes from. This is a lifetime appointment. This is not about this political moment.

A lot of talk, no real delivery being misrepresented being lied to in some instances and so this effort I think appeal to the far left part of the base was actually more of what all of us do not like and this, I think is, a lesson for all of us.

We've been talking about it for a few days and not knowing if it's going to get to the U.S. or not but it's looking a little bit more likely. Take a look at some of the weather map. I'll show you a couple of things. First of all, we are climatologically right -- that's a big word climatologically right at the peak of hurricane season. September is a peak, September 10th and so we're right in that mode right now. And long with that, look at all these storms in the Pacific and the Atlantic, we have six storms we're watching out there. The three in the Atlantic are the ones now that potentially have some sort of impact for us, certainly Florence and also we are talking about that tropical depression number nine we are going to watch. This is a look at the path. Harris, it's really interesting, no storm that's ever been where this storm is now has ever hit anywhere around the U.S. And this one models are coming into better and better agreement that we are going to have some sort of impact from this. We have been seeing our models all show this moving up towards the north, maybe around Bermuda. Take a look at the latest track, it has moved much more to the south and heading straight towards the U.S. Will it curve out? It's possible that it will make a little curve before it hits here. We don't know. But these models that look we call them the spaghetti models they look really messy. They look much more in agreement than they did before."
