      "speaker": "SEAN HANNITY, HOST",
      "sentences": "All right. Tucker, thank you. And welcome to \"Hannity.\" Tonight, breaking new information and more smoking gun evidence about Special Counsel Robert Mueller's corrupt and extremely biased team of liberal political crusaders that have one singular admission and that is to destroy your elected President Donald Trump and unseat the commander-in-chief.  Now, they are trying to create a constitutional crisis that will threaten the rule of law in this country. So, tonight right here we have new and more smoking gun evidence that Mueller's handpicked minions or bunch of Trump hating Hillary loving partisan hacks that are carrying out what I described as a witch-hunt. In an email released by Judicial Watch, Mueller's top attack dog told Andrew Weismann told former acting Attorney General Sally Yates, he was so proud of her, this after Yates defied a direct order from the President of the United States Donald Trump and refused to defend his travel ban back in January.  Now this comes as we alerting more information about Peter Strzok, he is the former FBI counterintelligence official we were telling you about last night that was fired from the Russia investigation for sending those anti- Trump, pro-Clinton text messages.  Tonight, Fox News has learned that the Department of Justice is in the process of now turning over Strzok's text messages to the House Intelligence Committee. Now, it is expected to happen in coming days. Now Strzok is a key player and he is tied to several of the high profile cases we have been covering including the Russian probe. That means Clinton's e mails, the anti-Trump dossier. The FISA surveillance of a Trump campaign associate. Now tonight what we're going to do, we will peel back the layers of this very complex onion, we will expose, it will be easy to see just how crooked and corrupt Mueller and his appointed team really are. Their conduct is something you'd respect in a banana republic not the United States of America.  There is so much fake news and misinformation in the news outlets today. We'll do what we always do. We're going to set the record straight. We'll get to the truth and tonight we'll explain and we will diagram all of these controversies and the corruption surrounding Mueller's team. Something you'll only see right here on \"Hannity.\" And also tonight, the liberal media is spreading even more fake news about President Trump reporting that Special Council issued a subpoena to Deutsche Bank for information about bank accounts owned by the President and his family. Well, tonight, the president's lawyer is pushing back and saying, those reports are flat out false. And Robert Mueller's witch-hunt comes at a significant cost to all of us and you the American people. The tab right now is nearing $7 million in counting. We will cover all of that and much more in tonight's breaking news opening monologue.  All right. Tonight, just like we did with Hillary Clinton's giant web of corruption, we are going to actually show you with charts just how corrupt, abusively biased and political Special Counsel Robert Mueller and his team of so-called investigators really are. This is on the surface complicated. Stay with us tonight. We're going to set the stage. We will explain and breakdown everything for you.   Let's start with the head of the snake. That would be the Special Counsel Robert Mueller. Mueller's credibility is in the gutter tonight with these new discoveries. His conflicts of interest, his clear bias, the corruption are on full display. Mueller is frankly a disgrace to the American justice system and has put the country now on the brink of the coming banana republic. Here is why. Robert Mueller, former FBI director under Bush and Obama, was first appointed as a Special Counsel to the Russia probe by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. Rosenstein, longtime federal attorney, was only able to appoint Mueller because the Attorney General Jeff Sessions, you remember, recused himself from the Russia investigation. That was a huge mistake. By the way, he may want to un-recused himself. Now you might remember, this came after Sessions and Rosenstein encouraged President Trump to fire then-FBI Director James Comey over his inappropriate actions in the 2016 Clinton email investigation. Well, as it turns out, James Comey, guess what, he is very good friends with Robert Mueller after years of working in similar roles, while some have even described the duo as, quote, \"brothers in arms.\" Isn't that so cute?   Now Comey also tweeting tonight he is meeting with his book publisher. I can't wait for that to come out. When's he going to start working for fake news CNN or conspiracy theory TV MSNBC? We'll have more on that later. But back to Mueller his conflicts of interest do not end here. While serving as the FBI director in the Obama administration, Mueller stood by and did nothing while the controversial sale of uranium was approved by Hillary Clinton and others in 2010 to that state owned Russian energy company. Now, keep in mind, a year and a half before the FBI had serious evidence of Russian bribery linked to the Uranium One sale. And a confidential informant was providing them further proof for six years of a potentially illicit deal. Twenty percent of America's Uranium was at stake. We don't have enough uranium.  Another important Mueller conflict. It stemmed from President Trump. Remember, he reportedly interviewed Mueller to be Comey's replacement as the head of FBI and ultimately President Trump, he went in another direction. He gave the job to Christopher Wray.   And finally, one of the biggest examples of Mueller's faulty, clouded, biased, abusively biased judgment is who he chose to staff the Russian probe. Now get this. At least, eight of the 16 lawyers that Mueller appointed to his team donated to Democrats like Obama and Clinton, including thousands of dollars to these campaigns. Not a single attorney Mueller appointed or hired donated to the Trump or other any Republican presidential campaign. Which brings us to our next chart where we exposed members of Mueller's team from their clear political bias. One of Mueller's top lieutenants who some have called the legal pit bull is none other than Andrew Weissmann. We'll have more on him later on his monologue and show. But first, it is important to point out Weissmann gave $4,300 in political donations to Democrats including Obama. And as you can see, we filled out the chart. All told, Mueller's corrupt band of Clinton lovers, they have been responsible for over $50,000 in donations to Democrats. Are we really supposed to believe that they are fair and they are unbiased in this investigation?  Next up, former FBI counterintelligence official Peter Strzok, as we are about to show you, as we told you about last night. His tentacles just touched about everything. Now there is more stunning, new information about Strzok tonight. We will get to that in a second. But first, let's lay the foundation. According to a report, this was yesterday, Strzok is a member of Mueller's Special Council team that signed the document that officially started the entire Russian investigation witch hunt. We learned yesterday this Trump hating Clinton loving agent oversaw FBI interviews of our former National Security adviser Lieutenant General Michael Flynn where he supposedly lied. Sara Carter -- will join us in a little bit -- is reporting that Strzok personally interrogated Flynn himself. And Fox News also learned that it was Strzok that was fired by Mueller over this summer presenting the anti-Trump pro-Clinton texts messages to his FBI lawyer girlfriend. Well, we just discovered tonight that Strzok's girlfriend Lisa Page also was on Mueller's team before leaving. We didn't know that yesterday.  And from there, it gets even more shocking as our own Catherine Herridge is reporting. Strzok played a very key role in the Clinton email server investigation. Now this politicized FBI official even participated in the July 2, 2016 interview of then-former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton where conveniently she was not put under oath.  Now this part is brand new tonight. Strzok was also present at FBI interviews of Clinton's top aids Huma Abedin, Cheryl Mills where they claimed they only knew about the server after Clinton left the State Department and it became public. He loves the Clintons and everybody around them. And it turns out emails from 2010 and '11 show that both Abedin and Mills did in fact know about the server. So, either they mislead the FBI or flat out lied. Where are the charges against them? And why were they spared and Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, why was he charged with lying to the FBI? A massive double standard. And it gets worse from there. Fox News has confirmed that Strzok changed the language -- he was the guy -- in James Comey's draft memo exonerating Hillary Clinton from grossly negligent behavior favor to extreme carelessness. That is letting Hillary Clinton off the hook. Remember, they wrote the exoneration before the investigation. That means the fix was in. Gross negligence is part of the legal standard that would mean Clinton broke the law.  They stood up for her. They defended her. They protected her. This is shocking and this is why the office of Inspector General is now reviewing Peter Strzok's role in the Clinton email server investigation.   Now, Strzok's involvement extends to other key areas of this Russian probe -- keep up with me here, there is a lot of information -- like the anti-Trump fake news Russian propaganda dossier that used current and former Russian government sources to try and smear then-candidate Trump with salacious lies and influence the election and misled you the American people. And the sources now revealing to Fox News that FBI Director Andrew McCabe, he is the key witness that Congress wants to talk to about the anti-Trump dossier. McCabe was scheduled to appear before Congress Thursday but now he is saying he is not going to show up. Now, McCabe is also thought to have been the key point of contract to the former British spy Christopher Steele. He is the guy that created the fake news, anti-Trump dossier that was bought and paid for by Hillary Clinton and the DNC that Donna Brazile says she was running.  And we can't forget according to multiple reports, a political action committee with ties to key Clinton ally, Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe, they are like best friends. Well, they gave $500,000 to Andrew McCabe's wife Jill. She was running for the Virginia State Senate race. Now, Virginia's Democratic Party also contributed over 200 grand to Jill McCabe. Wow! The connections are stunning.  And finally, House investigators, they believe that Strzok is the key figure in the FISA surveillance of a Trump associate on the campaign. Now that makes a lot of sense given the ICE agents background in counterintelligence. And also tonight and finally tonight, does Robert Mueller's top deputy, pay close attention. This particular minion is known as Mueller's legal pit bull. We are talking about the hard charging prosecutor Andrew Weismann. He has a long history of using highly questionable, unethical tactics to get convictions. There is new information tonight and it highlights Weissmann's rampant anti-Trump bias. We'll get to that in a second.   Before we do, you've got to understand who was Andrew Weissmann. Now, Fox News legal analyst Greg Jarrett has dug deep into Weismann's background. Here is what he has found. Back in 2000 during the massive Enron scandal, Weissmann was one of the prosecutors on the task force that brought a very controversial obstruction of justice against case against the giant accounting firm, Arthur Anderson. This is important. Weissman's actions put that company out of business. Tens of thousands of people lost their jobs. In 2005, the United States Supreme Court overturned Weissman's obstruction of justice conviction in a unanimous nine-zero nearly unprecedented ruling. But it was too late, he had already inflicted maximum damage to so many people. Arthur Anderson was not the only victim of Weismann's aggressive tactics. The conviction of a business transaction between Enron and the financial firm Merrill Lynch, well, that sent people to jail. But guess what, they were innocent. That decision was reversed by the Fifth Circuit US Circuit Court of Appeals.  Weissmann is also been accused of intimidating witnesses, making up crimes that don't exist and in one case, withholding evidence that was exculpatory, that helped the defendant. And Weissmann is also tied to that corrupt Uranium One deal and the Obama administration cover up. Why did Mueller ever appoint this guy? He knew his track record.  And back then Weismann was in charge of the DOJ's fraud section during the Russian's bribery scheme, and as Gregg Jarrett's points out, Weissmann actually signed the bottom of the plea agreement from the Russian businessman involved in that case. Now, here is the new explosive information we have tonight. In an email released after a FOIA request by Judicial Watch, Weismann -- the guy I'm telling you about -- he told the former acting Attorney General Sally Yates, an Obama appointee, he was proud of her. What was he so proud of? Yates denied a direct order from the president, her boss, refused to defend the legal constitutional travel ban back in January. Weissman's email, reads, quote, \"I am so proud. I am in awe. Thank you so much. All my deepest respects.\" Pretty unbelievable. Shows where his political bias is. Also tonight, your mainstream media, they are corrupt, they continued to spread fake news all in an attempt to destroy and damage this president day in, day out, hour after hour, minute after minute. The latest example involves reports that a Special Counsel has issued a subpoena to Deutsche Bank for information about bank accounts that were held by President Trump and his family. Well tonight, we learned it is fake news. President Trump's lawyer Jay Sekulow, he shot down this erroneous reporting with a statement that read, quote, \"We have confirm that the news reports the Special Counsel had subpoenaed financial records relating to the president are false. No subpoena has been issued or received. We have confirmed this with the bank and other sources.\"   This is just another reason you the American people should never trust this destroy Trump corrupt media.  And finally tonight, Robert Mueller's political witch hunt comes at a massive cost to all of us, the American taxpayers. Now for May to the end of September alone, Mueller has spent nearly 7 million of your dollars on a corrupt, his crooked investigation that is now turned into this political fishing expedition. Remember this also started as a probe in the possible Trump-Russia collusion. There is been zero evidence so far -- none, zero, it's been almost a year -- that this ever happened. And the media, Russia, Russia, Russia. So now Mueller and his political lackeys, they are trying to dig up any kind of potential wrongdoing that justified their existence. This is a massive waste of money and you, the American people are paying for all of this which is an attempted political takedown of you duly elected president. It is a direct threat tonight to the rule of law, to our constitution. And tonight, this all now begins to end. Joining us now with reaction, Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton. He filed the FOIA investigation request. Also investigative reporter Sara Carter. FOX News legal analyst we count on him obviously a lot, Greg Jarrett is with us.  Tom, let us start with you. And it wasn't only Weissmann who is praising a woman, an Obama holdover that would not -- that disobeyed a direct order of her boss, the President of the United States Donald Trump.",

This upends decades of foreign policy by American presidents in both parties that these issues would be settled by peace talks. It is wildly popular as you noted with our key ally in the region is real. And its Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who today praised it. But in a phone call, the Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas expressed his displeasure saying this will hurt the peace process and possibly injure the prospects for the internationally endorsed two state solutions. Well, Jordanian and Saudi officials warned this may provoke the global Muslim community which some experts see as a veiled warning that another Intifada could erupt.

      "utterance": "All right. Tucker, thank you. And welcome to \"Hannity.\" Tonight, breaking new information and more smoking gun evidence about Special Counsel Robert Mueller's corrupt and extremely biased team of liberal political crusaders that have one singular admission and that is to destroy your elected President Donald Trump and unseat the commander-in-chief. Now, they are trying to create a constitutional crisis that will threaten the rule of law in this country. So, tonight right here we have new and more smoking gun evidence that Mueller's handpicked minions or bunch of Trump hating Hillary loving partisan hacks that are carrying out what I described as a witch-hunt. In an email released by Judicial Watch, Mueller's top attack dog told Andrew Weismann told former acting Attorney General Sally Yates, he was so proud of her, this after Yates defied a direct order from the President of the United States Donald Trump and refused to defend his travel ban back in January. Now this comes as we alerting more information about Peter Strzok, he is the former FBI counterintelligence official we were telling you about last night that was fired from the Russia investigation for sending those anti- Trump, pro-Clinton text messages. Tonight, Fox News has learned that the Department of Justice is in the process of now turning over Strzok's text messages to the House Intelligence Committee. Now, it is expected to happen in coming days. Now Strzok is a key player and he is tied to several of the high profile cases we have been covering including the Russian probe. That means Clinton's e mails, the anti-Trump dossier. The FISA surveillance of a Trump campaign associate. Now tonight what we're going to do, we will peel back the layers of this very complex onion, we will expose, it will be easy to see just how crooked and corrupt Mueller and his appointed team really are. Their conduct is something you'd respect in a banana republic not the United States of America. There is so much fake news and misinformation in the news outlets today. We'll do what we always do. We're going to set the record straight. We'll get to the truth and tonight we'll explain and we will diagram all of these controversies and the corruption surrounding Mueller's team. Something you'll only see right here on \"Hannity.\" And also tonight, the liberal media is spreading even more fake news about President Trump reporting that Special Council issued a subpoena to Deutsche Bank for information about bank accounts owned by the President and his family. Well, tonight, the president's lawyer is pushing back and saying, those reports are flat out false. And Robert Mueller's witch-hunt comes at a significant cost to all of us and you the American people. The tab right now is nearing $7 million in counting. We will cover all of that and much more in tonight's breaking news opening monologue. All right. Tonight, just like we did with Hillary Clinton's giant web of corruption, we are going to actually show you with charts just how corrupt, abusively biased and political Special Counsel Robert Mueller and his team of so-called investigators really are. This is on the surface complicated. Stay with us tonight. We're going to set the stage. We will explain and breakdown everything for you. Let's start with the head of the snake. That would be the Special Counsel Robert Mueller. Mueller's credibility is in the gutter tonight with these new discoveries. His conflicts of interest, his clear bias, the corruption are on full display. Mueller is frankly a disgrace to the American justice system and has put the country now on the brink of the coming banana republic. Here is why. Robert Mueller, former FBI director under Bush and Obama, was first appointed as a Special Counsel to the Russia probe by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. Rosenstein, longtime federal attorney, was only able to appoint Mueller because the Attorney General Jeff Sessions, you remember, recused himself from the Russia investigation. That was a huge mistake. By the way, he may want to un-recused himself. Now you might remember, this came after Sessions and Rosenstein encouraged President Trump to fire then-FBI Director James Comey over his inappropriate actions in the 2016 Clinton email investigation. Well, as it turns out, James Comey, guess what, he is very good friends with Robert Mueller after years of working in similar roles, while some have even described the duo as, quote, \"brothers in arms.\" Isn't that so cute? Now Comey also tweeting tonight he is meeting with his book publisher. I can't wait for that to come out. When's he going to start working for fake news CNN or conspiracy theory TV MSNBC? We'll have more on that later. But back to Mueller his conflicts of interest do not end here. While serving as the FBI director in the Obama administration, Mueller stood by and did nothing while the controversial sale of uranium was approved by Hillary Clinton and others in 2010 to that state owned Russian energy company. Now, keep in mind, a year and a half before the FBI had serious evidence of Russian bribery linked to the Uranium One sale. And a confidential informant was providing them further proof for six years of a potentially illicit deal. Twenty percent of America's Uranium was at stake. We don't have enough uranium. Another important Mueller conflict. It stemmed from President Trump. Remember, he reportedly interviewed Mueller to be Comey's replacement as the head of FBI and ultimately President Trump, he went in another direction. He gave the job to Christopher Wray. And finally, one of the biggest examples of Mueller's faulty, clouded, biased, abusively biased judgment is who he chose to staff the Russian probe. Now get this. At least, eight of the 16 lawyers that Mueller appointed to his team donated to Democrats like Obama and Clinton, including thousands of dollars to these campaigns. Not a single attorney Mueller appointed or hired donated to the Trump or other any Republican presidential campaign. Which brings us to our next chart where we exposed members of Mueller's team from their clear political bias. One of Mueller's top lieutenants who some have called the legal pit bull is none other than Andrew Weissmann. We'll have more on him later on his monologue and show. But first, it is important to point out Weissmann gave $4,300 in political donations to Democrats including Obama. And as you can see, we filled out the chart. All told, Mueller's corrupt band of Clinton lovers, they have been responsible for over $50,000 in donations to Democrats. Are we really supposed to believe that they are fair and they are unbiased in this investigation? Next up, former FBI counterintelligence official Peter Strzok, as we are about to show you, as we told you about last night. His tentacles just touched about everything. Now there is more stunning, new information about Strzok tonight. We will get to that in a second. But first, let's lay the foundation. According to a report, this was yesterday, Strzok is a member of Mueller's Special Council team that signed the document that officially started the entire Russian investigation witch hunt. We learned yesterday this Trump hating Clinton loving agent oversaw FBI interviews of our former National Security adviser Lieutenant General Michael Flynn where he supposedly lied. Sara Carter -- will join us in a little bit -- is reporting that Strzok personally interrogated Flynn himself. And Fox News also learned that it was Strzok that was fired by Mueller over this summer presenting the anti-Trump pro-Clinton texts messages to his FBI lawyer girlfriend. Well, we just discovered tonight that Strzok's girlfriend Lisa Page also was on Mueller's team before leaving. We didn't know that yesterday. And from there, it gets even more shocking as our own Catherine Herridge is reporting. Strzok played a very key role in the Clinton email server investigation. Now this politicized FBI official even participated in the July 2, 2016 interview of then-former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton where conveniently she was not put under oath. Now this part is brand new tonight. Strzok was also present at FBI interviews of Clinton's top aids Huma Abedin, Cheryl Mills where they claimed they only knew about the server after Clinton left the State Department and it became public. He loves the Clintons and everybody around them. And it turns out emails from 2010 and '11 show that both Abedin and Mills did in fact know about the server. So, either they mislead the FBI or flat out lied. Where are the charges against them? And why were they spared and Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, why was he charged with lying to the FBI? A massive double standard. And it gets worse from there. Fox News has confirmed that Strzok changed the language -- he was the guy -- in James Comey's draft memo exonerating Hillary Clinton from grossly negligent behavior favor to extreme carelessness. That is letting Hillary Clinton off the hook. Remember, they wrote the exoneration before the investigation. That means the fix was in. Gross negligence is part of the legal standard that would mean Clinton broke the law. They stood up for her. They defended her. They protected her. This is shocking and this is why the office of Inspector General is now reviewing Peter Strzok's role in the Clinton email server investigation. Now, Strzok's involvement extends to other key areas of this Russian probe -- keep up with me here, there is a lot of information -- like the anti-Trump fake news Russian propaganda dossier that used current and former Russian government sources to try and smear then-candidate Trump with salacious lies and influence the election and misled you the American people. And the sources now revealing to Fox News that FBI Director Andrew McCabe, he is the key witness that Congress wants to talk to about the anti-Trump dossier. McCabe was scheduled to appear before Congress Thursday but now he is saying he is not going to show up. Now, McCabe is also thought to have been the key point of contract to the former British spy Christopher Steele. He is the guy that created the fake news, anti-Trump dossier that was bought and paid for by Hillary Clinton and the DNC that Donna Brazile says she was running. And we can't forget according to multiple reports, a political action committee with ties to key Clinton ally, Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe, they are like best friends. Well, they gave $500,000 to Andrew McCabe's wife Jill. She was running for the Virginia State Senate race. Now, Virginia's Democratic Party also contributed over 200 grand to Jill McCabe. Wow! The connections are stunning. And finally, House investigators, they believe that Strzok is the key figure in the FISA surveillance of a Trump associate on the campaign. Now that makes a lot of sense given the ICE agents background in counterintelligence. And also tonight and finally tonight, does Robert Mueller's top deputy, pay close attention. This particular minion is known as Mueller's legal pit bull. We are talking about the hard charging prosecutor Andrew Weismann. He has a long history of using highly questionable, unethical tactics to get convictions. There is new information tonight and it highlights Weissmann's rampant anti-Trump bias. We'll get to that in a second. Before we do, you've got to understand who was Andrew Weissmann. Now, Fox News legal analyst Greg Jarrett has dug deep into Weismann's background. Here is what he has found. Back in 2000 during the massive Enron scandal, Weissmann was one of the prosecutors on the task force that brought a very controversial obstruction of justice against case against the giant accounting firm, Arthur Anderson. This is important. Weissman's actions put that company out of business. Tens of thousands of people lost their jobs. In 2005, the United States Supreme Court overturned Weissman's obstruction of justice conviction in a unanimous nine-zero nearly unprecedented ruling. But it was too late, he had already inflicted maximum damage to so many people. Arthur Anderson was not the only victim of Weismann's aggressive tactics. The conviction of a business transaction between Enron and the financial firm Merrill Lynch, well, that sent people to jail. But guess what, they were innocent. That decision was reversed by the Fifth Circuit US Circuit Court of Appeals. Weissmann is also been accused of intimidating witnesses, making up crimes that don't exist and in one case, withholding evidence that was exculpatory, that helped the defendant. And Weissmann is also tied to that corrupt Uranium One deal and the Obama administration cover up. Why did Mueller ever appoint this guy? He knew his track record. And back then Weismann was in charge of the DOJ's fraud section during the Russian's bribery scheme, and as Gregg Jarrett's points out, Weissmann actually signed the bottom of the plea agreement from the Russian businessman involved in that case. Now, here is the new explosive information we have tonight. In an email released after a FOIA request by Judicial Watch, Weismann -- the guy I'm telling you about -- he told the former acting Attorney General Sally Yates, an Obama appointee, he was proud of her. What was he so proud of? Yates denied a direct order from the president, her boss, refused to defend the legal constitutional travel ban back in January. Weissman's email, reads, quote, \"I am so proud. I am in awe. Thank you so much. All my deepest respects.\" Pretty unbelievable. Shows where his political bias is. Also tonight, your mainstream media, they are corrupt, they continued to spread fake news all in an attempt to destroy and damage this president day in, day out, hour after hour, minute after minute. The latest example involves reports that a Special Counsel has issued a subpoena to Deutsche Bank for information about bank accounts that were held by President Trump and his family. Well tonight, we learned it is fake news. President Trump's lawyer Jay Sekulow, he shot down this erroneous reporting with a statement that read, quote, \"We have confirm that the news reports the Special Counsel had subpoenaed financial records relating to the president are false. No subpoena has been issued or received. We have confirmed this with the bank and other sources.\" This is just another reason you the American people should never trust this destroy Trump corrupt media. And finally tonight, Robert Mueller's political witch hunt comes at a massive cost to all of us, the American taxpayers. Now for May to the end of September alone, Mueller has spent nearly 7 million of your dollars on a corrupt, his crooked investigation that is now turned into this political fishing expedition. Remember this also started as a probe in the possible Trump-Russia collusion. There is been zero evidence so far -- none, zero, it's been almost a year -- that this ever happened. And the media, Russia, Russia, Russia. So now Mueller and his political lackeys, they are trying to dig up any kind of potential wrongdoing that justified their existence. This is a massive waste of money and you, the American people are paying for all of this which is an attempted political takedown of you duly elected president. It is a direct threat tonight to the rule of law, to our constitution. And tonight, this all now begins to end. Joining us now with reaction, Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton. He filed the FOIA investigation request. Also investigative reporter Sara Carter. FOX News legal analyst we count on him obviously a lot, Greg Jarrett is with us. Tom, let us start with you. And it wasn't only Weissmann who is praising a woman, an Obama holdover that would not -- that disobeyed a direct order of her boss, the President of the United States Donald Trump."

    {
      "speaker": "TOM FITTON, PRESIDENT, JUDICIAL WATCH",
      "utterance": "Yes. There were other lawyers in the Justice Department senior officials. One in a financial fraud section. Former US attorneys who ended up getting fired in retrospect rightly by President Trump. But Weissmann is very serious. Because he is the number two under Mueller and he was praising misconduct by the former acting Attorney General Sally Yates. She was fired quite rightly by President Trump for refusing to follow his direction to defend a lawful regulation. This -- temporary band on immigrants from several countries. So, this is a real concern for anyone who wants fair administration of justice out of the Mueller investigation."

      "speaker": "FITTON",
      "utterance": "Listen, if you praise lawlessness against President Trump, I think it's fair to say, you don't like President Trump. And he shouldn't be anywhere near this investigation and strike two in the least for a Mueller investigation, we've got Peter Strzok. Now we have Weissmann and if I were General Flynn's lawyers, if I were Manafort's lawyers, I would be screaming to the courts right now what is going on here? Why hasn't this been disclosed? Strzok by the way, he was fired back in July, Sean."
    },

    },
    {
      "speaker": "FITTON",
      "utterance": "And the Justice Department, his nominal supervisors to the Justice Department withheld this information from the American people in Congress. And I'll tell you, it is at the point where we may need a special counsel for the special counsel. That is how out of control things are."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Sara Carter, you began this all last night with this guy Strzok and literally, you know, him being removed, now he found out tonight that the girlfriend is remove and we found out that the number one hit man with the most atrocious unethical background and record and failure Andrew Weismann. Why was he ever appointed by Robert Mueller with that background? A 9-0 decision. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SARA CARTER, INVESTIGATIVE REPORTER",
      "utterance": "Well, I think what is most stunning here is his relationship with Sally Yates and the relationship among the people inside the Department of Justice that they felt so comfortable sharing these emails with one another on their office email accounts. And not only that, think about the relationship he had with Sally Yates. I think there is a series conflict of interest here according to a number of sources that I've spoken with. In law enforcement and the intelligence community, they have said, look, she was after Flynn from the beginning. And if he is this close to her and he has this much respect for her based on a decision where she basically went against the President of the United States, this should be called into question. And you know, Tom, isn't the only one that kept saying, there needs to be a special council for a special counsel. I am hearing that a lot right now."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "I am, too. Greg Jarrett, you are saying tonight in a column that Andrew Weissmann must resign or be fired immediately. I don't even -- why was this man either hired with that atrocious -- he wrecked tens of thousands of people's lives. Innocent people went to jail because of Andrew Weissmann. Robert Mueller had to know this."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GREG JARRETT, FOX NEWS LEGAL ANALYST",
      "utterance": "Of course. Because Weismann worked for Mueller not ones but twice as special counsel for the FBI. Their long time colleagues and friends, which is why Mueller hired him and may be hired him because Mueller knew of the hidden political agenda that Weissmann harbored. Look, not only should Weissmann be fired immediately. But the entire staff of Mueller of Robert Mueller is right with corrupt motives and political prejudiced. It was entirely stacked against Donald Trump. And so, what happened now, Mueller should be dismissed. The entire remember staff should be fired. And a new special counsel should be appointed."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Who can do it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JARRETT",
      "utterance": "Well, Rod Rosenstein could do it but he won't do it because he is conflicted as well, he is both prosecutor and witness in this case."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JARRETT",
      "utterance": "Well, I'll tell you what should happen. The Attorney General Jeff Sessions who recused himself from the case should un-recused himself for the soul purpose of firing Mueller and the staff and appointing a new special counsel. And then disassociate himself from any of the oversight."
    },

    {
      "speaker": "FITTON",
      "utterance": "Yes. I agree. You know, Mr. Mueller is being treated as king of the Justice Department, he has got his enormous budget. I guarantee you. There is no other investigation that this Justice Department is conducting. It has the resources allocated to it that Mueller has. And it is being used for what? To investigate mortgages fraud? To investigate a penny anti-perjury charge that was the result of an ambush interview by an enemy of the President and the supporter of Hillary Clinton. President Trump should order the Justice Department to file Mueller. The Justice Department has had their chance to reigns this guy in. They haven't taken it. And the President needs to exercise the constitutional law that he has to protect the American justice system."

      "utterance": "Between the role of Strzok, Sara, and the role of Comey and the role of everybody else here, Comey writing the letter and Strzok, you know, editing the letter. They would exonerate Hilary before they did the investigation. That renders that investigation meaningless to me. Where is the Attorney General? Where is the Special Counsel to do a real investigation? Because we know crimes were committed in this particular case."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARTER",

Before December, we're going to see other parts of his report coming out after January. And they are looking at Peter Strzok, they are looking at Comey. They are looking at 27 leakers. It would not surprise me if there is a shake-up at the FBI and house cleaning."

At 1:00 p.m. tomorrow, the President will announce at the White House that the U.S. government is officially recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and he will direct the State Department to begin the process of moving U.S. Embassy there from Tel Aviv. This upends decades of foreign policy by American presidents in both parties that these issues would be settled by peace talks. It is wildly popular as you noted with our key ally in the region is real. And its Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who today praised it. But in a phone call, the Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas expressed his displeasure saying this will hurt the peace process and possibly injure the prospects for the internationally endorsed two state solutions. Well, Jordanian and Saudi officials warned this may provoke the global Muslim community which some experts see as a veiled warning that another Intifada could erupt. Though all of this talk of grave consequences was rejected by the President's National Security advisor who says, this move can actually help the peace process. Watch."

      "speaker": "DERSHOWITZ",
      "utterance": "It is worse than it (inaudible) murders. I think that President Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel is the perfect response to President Obama's outrageous orchestration of the security council resolution which he pushed through as a lame duck that declared the western wall to be illegally occupied territory. The Hebrew University, the hospital, the Jewish quarter, according to this resolution that was basically pushed through by Obama, these are outrageously flagrant violations of the international law. The best response to that horrible resolution is for the President to say, we don't accept the U.N. resolution and the best proof is we will recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. You say it is occupied we say it the capital. Perfect response."

Let us go Democratic Senate and ranking member of the senate judiciary Dianne Feinstein claiming obstruction of justice case against the President you had very strong reaction to that. Is it possible people sight that Nixon and they sight the Clinton affair? Is there obstruction of justice and can you sight that against a sitting President?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DERSHOWITZ",
      "utterance": "Well those cases both support my position that you cannot charge a sitting President with obstruction of justice if he simply implements his own constitutional obligations under article two. What happened in the Nixon case they charged him with obstruction of justice for telling his subordinates to lie and for destroying evidence of a paying hatch money in Clinton case, they set up for telling witnesses to lie. Here what they are saying the President commit an obstruction of justice by firing Comey. Which he had a perfect right to do. Comey said that himself. If he were pardon somebody like Flynn. But you cannot hold the president criminally responsible for exercising constitutional authority. Remember it is not only the President who has this kind of immunity. Senators have immunity in prosecution. Judges have immunity from prosecution if they perform their constitutionally appropriate actions that is when our system of checks and balance system is all about."

In the case of James Comey and this guy, Strzok, how can you possibly be drafting an exoneration of Hillary Clinton before the investigation was ever -- not only ever completed but the key people in the investigation including Hillary were not interviewed up to that point. How is that possible? Does that mean that needs to be relitigate or reinvestigated?"
    },

      "speaker": "DERSHOWITZ",
      "utterance": "First, Strzok should have recused himself even if other people did not know, he knew about them, he knew he had a biased against Trump and in favor of Clinton. He should have recused himself. I'm against using the criminal justice system to target political enemies whether it is Hillary Clinton or whether it is Donald Trump, I want to see a cease-fire and not use the criminal justice system as a weapon against our political enemies. I don't think Hillary Clinton should not have been investigates and prosecuted. I don't think Donald Trump should be investigated and prosecuted. If you don't like what a candidate did you vote against them, but you don't try to create criminal actions whether be espionage against Hillary Clinton of obstruction of justice against Donald Trump."

      "speaker": "DERSHOWITZ",

What often happens is that companies routinely destroy a document you have to show a very high level of specific intent. I don't think it was there and another innocent case, I don't think it was there and the Hillary Clinton case. I want to make sure we don't politicize."

I just think in general we should not be looking to make criminal cases against our political opponents. We should lead that to the electoral process. If there are clear cases like the Nixon case, then I think prosecution is appropriate, but in general we should error on the side of leaving it to the political process rather than the criminal justice system."

Gross negligence is a legal standard under the federal statute 18USC-793F and is it is widely reported that agent Strzok over saw the review of Clinton aide Huma Abedin e-mail that were found under her strange husband Anthony Wiener's computer that discovered that the FBI to reopen and close the criminal e-mail probe just days before the election."

One of the little known fact there is that the Department of Justice via the FBI was handing out immunity like candy and in those immunity agreement they were not required to cooperate with government officials. You can track out General Flynn has to plead guilty and has to cooperate. Here you are giving out immunity, this witnesses had no obligation to -- work with government officials and investigators. And there are still Sean, to this day, 10 of thousands of documents, Hillary Clinton e-mails that had not been shared with congress. They are still sitting at the Department of State."
