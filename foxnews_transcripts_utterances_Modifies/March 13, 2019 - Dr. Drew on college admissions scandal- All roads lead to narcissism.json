      "sentences": "Hannity, great show tonight and we are jam packed. I'm Laura Ingraham and this is “The Ingraham Angle” from New York City tonight. Now he says Americans will never have faith in the United States government until the FBI's handling of the Hillary Clinton email probe is actually investigated. I mean, really investigated for obstruction of justice. Former NYPD Commissioner Bernie Kerik is here to explain plus Jay Leno, I don't know if you saw this, he just believes comedy is officially dead in the age of Trump and Dolly Parton taking on Elizabeth Warren, that's choice.  That and more on seen and unseen with Raymond Arroyo and just moments away, counsel to the President, Kellyanne Conway has a message for you Republicans not backing the President on the border issues. Stay tuned for that plus a brand new feature in the show where you the viewer actually get involved.  God help us out. Now, we begin tonight with two stories that demonstrate why we need repercussions for egregious unlawful conduct. First up, lawbreaking by the privileged and under privileged, that is the focus of tonight's “Angle.”  Now right off the bat, I need to tell you that we did not actually intend to lead our show tonight with the college admissions scandal that was the subject of last night's “Angle” but late in the day we decided that we had to. Your response to last night's show was one of overwhelming disgust and outrage. And now there are growing demands for a re-evaluation of the college admissions process as a whole and severe repercussions for wrongdoers.  Now of course, if it's a scandal involving mostly Hollywood celebs and rich liberal elites though, it has to be linked to Donald Trump, right? Well, this is one of the more pathetic attempts to couple the President with this nation-wide admission scam.",

      "sentences": "They never stop. I saw them, I said, of course they did. Well, the truth is, it was the Trump DOJ that busted this racket. The FBI paid actress Lori Loughlin, an early morning visit today, a taking her into custody for her role in the fraud. She and her fashion designer husband Mossimo Giannulli allegedly shelled out half a million dollars in bribes to get their two daughters accepted at USC as recruits for the rowing team.   Even though neither rowed crew. Both are out on bond. Now actress, Felicity Huffman and 32 other high profile, well connected parents from the legal world, from private equity were also charged for participating in the scheme. But one aspect of the story was overlooked, I think, when this news first broke, part of the reason, we wanted to do this again tonight. And it's an aspect that speaks to just how low they can go. According to The New York Times, \"the conspiracy relied on the parents getting medical documentation that would entitle their children to extra time on the test, an accommodation normally made for students with disabilities. Students who need extra time generally take the test alone supervised only by a proctor providing the opportunity for the bribed proctor to rig the outcome. Now Mr. Singer advised parents on how to get the medical documentation needed to qualify.\"  Remember Rick singer is the man at the center of this whole admissions ring and he was recorded by the FBI telling parent Gordan Caplan, \"for $4000 or $5000, a psychologist he worked with would write a report saying Mr. Caplan's daughter had disabilities and required special accommodations.   He assured Mr. Caplan that many parents did this for their children.\" Many parents? Well, apparently, he's right and I have personally heard stories just today of parents gaming the system in similar ways. Perhaps not having to pay that much money but the special accommodations, remember arose after the 1990 passage of the Americans with disabilities Act. And they were supposed to be reserved for people with actual disabilities. But the system's been abused by parents looking for an edge for their kids. And in some cases, this is happened on college campuses especially, by students. Just looking for an adder all prescription, sometimes they use them, sometimes they go on and sell them.  But that brings us to the question of the students themselves who took part in this fraud. Now prosecutors indicated that most were unwitting participants.",

Because once the crime is discovered, the car is impounded by the authorities and returned to its rightful owner.  So a slot in the freshman class of let's say, Yale University or University of Texas or USC is kind of like the car. It's the fruit of the crime. So a deserving, hardworking, ethical student should be given these spots and I bet there are a lot more spots than just the ones we're talking about in this fraud.   Now coming up on the show, you don't want to miss this. We had a huge reaction last week to Dr. Drew when he came on and he's going to discuss the obsession with status that drives parents to commit these brazen crimes so you don't want to miss that.

A pathetic dereliction of duty by Democrats and Republicans that will unfortunately be aided by all those who claim to be working for the President's agenda, right? Well to deny the President this declaration, basically you're contending two things.  First, this isn't a crisis worthy of an emergency, maybe it's not even a crisis at all and second, we have no need to further protect American citizens or our sovereignty. Well, perhaps these renegade Republicans should consider a couple of gut wrenching cases tonight that just came to light.  An alien who's been deported two times from the United States is now charged with raping a 12 year old girl in Alabama. David Ramirez Gonzalez, 29 years of age is charged with first degree rape, first degree sexual abuse and resisting arrest. Now he's been known by authorities to use several aliases and tonight he sits in jail. Little comfort, no doubt, to that 12 year old girl or her family. And how about this shocking case out of San Jose tonight? An illegal immigrant with a criminal history has been arrested after a gruesome murder. Carlos Eduardo Arevalo Carranza stalked and then killed Bambi Larson in her own neighborhood, allegedly beating and stabbing her to death. ICE agents reportedly tried to deport Carranza at least nine times before. But their detainer requests, guess what, were not honored by LA and Santa Clara counties, both sanctuary cities.",

As you all know on the panel, that was probably the third or fourth version of that speech, it was edited. The first version of that speech contained a phrase where Hillary Clinton emailed someone from overseas, from her private account because she didn't have a government account. That person she emailed was Barack Obama. Now Laura, why is that a problem? Because Obama insisted in a televised interview nationally that he didn't know about Hillary's email. We found about it from the media but that's not possible, Laura because Obama had a Blackberry where those emails that come in from private addresses would have had to been whitelisted, meaning somebody would have had to tell the Obama staff that Hillary had a private email in order for her to get through those firewalls.

They did send classified information around the system the State Department sent, and they looked the other way. They winked at it and they got away with it. Is it criminal? The good news is that the Justice Department a year ago did ask U.S. attorney from Utah John Huber to investigate this, the inspector general did, the same inspector general, Mike Horowitz, who brought down Andy McCabe.

      "utterance": "Hannity, great show tonight and we are jam packed. I'm Laura Ingraham and this is “The Ingraham Angle” from New York City tonight. Now he says Americans will never have faith in the United States government until the FBI's handling of the Hillary Clinton email probe is actually investigated. I mean, really investigated for obstruction of justice. Former NYPD Commissioner Bernie Kerik is here to explain plus Jay Leno, I don't know if you saw this, he just believes comedy is officially dead in the age of Trump and Dolly Parton taking on Elizabeth Warren, that's choice. That and more on seen and unseen with Raymond Arroyo and just moments away, counsel to the President, Kellyanne Conway has a message for you Republicans not backing the President on the border issues. Stay tuned for that plus a brand new feature in the show where you the viewer actually get involved. God help us out. Now, we begin tonight with two stories that demonstrate why we need repercussions for egregious unlawful conduct. First up, lawbreaking by the privileged and under privileged, that is the focus of tonight's “Angle.” Now right off the bat, I need to tell you that we did not actually intend to lead our show tonight with the college admissions scandal that was the subject of last night's “Angle” but late in the day we decided that we had to. Your response to last night's show was one of overwhelming disgust and outrage. And now there are growing demands for a re-evaluation of the college admissions process as a whole and severe repercussions for wrongdoers. Now of course, if it's a scandal involving mostly Hollywood celebs and rich liberal elites though, it has to be linked to Donald Trump, right? Well, this is one of the more pathetic attempts to couple the President with this nation-wide admission scam."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "They never stop. I saw them, I said, of course they did. Well, the truth is, it was the Trump DOJ that busted this racket. The FBI paid actress Lori Loughlin, an early morning visit today, a taking her into custody for her role in the fraud. She and her fashion designer husband Mossimo Giannulli allegedly shelled out half a million dollars in bribes to get their two daughters accepted at USC as recruits for the rowing team. Even though neither rowed crew. Both are out on bond. Now actress, Felicity Huffman and 32 other high profile, well connected parents from the legal world, from private equity were also charged for participating in the scheme. But one aspect of the story was overlooked, I think, when this news first broke, part of the reason, we wanted to do this again tonight. And it's an aspect that speaks to just how low they can go. According to The New York Times, \"the conspiracy relied on the parents getting medical documentation that would entitle their children to extra time on the test, an accommodation normally made for students with disabilities. Students who need extra time generally take the test alone supervised only by a proctor providing the opportunity for the bribed proctor to rig the outcome. Now Mr. Singer advised parents on how to get the medical documentation needed to qualify.\" Remember Rick singer is the man at the center of this whole admissions ring and he was recorded by the FBI telling parent Gordan Caplan, \"for $4000 or $5000, a psychologist he worked with would write a report saying Mr. Caplan's daughter had disabilities and required special accommodations. He assured Mr. Caplan that many parents did this for their children.\" Many parents? Well, apparently, he's right and I have personally heard stories just today of parents gaming the system in similar ways. Perhaps not having to pay that much money but the special accommodations, remember arose after the 1990 passage of the Americans with disabilities Act. And they were supposed to be reserved for people with actual disabilities. But the system's been abused by parents looking for an edge for their kids. And in some cases, this is happened on college campuses especially, by students. Just looking for an adder all prescription, sometimes they use them, sometimes they go on and sell them. But that brings us to the question of the students themselves who took part in this fraud. Now prosecutors indicated that most were unwitting participants."

    {
      "speaker": "UNIDENTIFIED MALE",
      "utterance": "It's not an accident that there are no students charged in these charging documents. The parents, the other defendants are clearly the prime movers of this fraud, it remains to be seen whether we charge any of the students."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "But maybe we should look at it this way. Now if a parent steals a car and then give the car to his son. Well, the sun doesn't get to keep the car. Because once the crime is discovered, the car is impounded by the authorities and returned to its rightful owner. So a slot in the freshman class of let's say, Yale University or University of Texas or USC is kind of like the car. It's the fruit of the crime. So a deserving, hardworking, ethical student should be given these spots and I bet there are a lot more spots than just the ones we're talking about in this fraud. Now coming up on the show, you don't want to miss this. We had a huge reaction last week to Dr. Drew when he came on and he's going to discuss the obsession with status that drives parents to commit these brazen crimes so you don't want to miss that. And now from fraud by wealthy U.S. citizens to violent crime by illegal immigrants."

A pathetic dereliction of duty by Democrats and Republicans that will unfortunately be aided by all those who claim to be working for the President's agenda, right? Well to deny the President this declaration, basically you're contending two things. First, this isn't a crisis worthy of an emergency, maybe it's not even a crisis at all and second, we have no need to further protect American citizens or our sovereignty. Well, perhaps these renegade Republicans should consider a couple of gut wrenching cases tonight that just came to light. An alien who's been deported two times from the United States is now charged with raping a 12 year old girl in Alabama. David Ramirez Gonzalez, 29 years of age is charged with first degree rape, first degree sexual abuse and resisting arrest. Now he's been known by authorities to use several aliases and tonight he sits in jail. Little comfort, no doubt, to that 12 year old girl or her family. And how about this shocking case out of San Jose tonight? An illegal immigrant with a criminal history has been arrested after a gruesome murder. Carlos Eduardo Arevalo Carranza stalked and then killed Bambi Larson in her own neighborhood, allegedly beating and stabbing her to death. ICE agents reportedly tried to deport Carranza at least nine times before. But their detainer requests, guess what, were not honored by LA and Santa Clara counties, both sanctuary cities."

That is a true dereliction of duty. And that's THE ANGLE. All right, joining me now Tom Homan, former Acting ICE Director. Now Fox news contributor. Tom, you heard the Police Chief, he's out in San Jose. The disconnect between the law enforcement and the elected leaders out there, Gavin Newsom, Kamala Harris, Jerry Brown before Gavin, Nancy Pelosi, they talk a good game about the kids and the children and we care about the children and we care about women and me too, what about these victims?

Well, the Trump administration focusing on these criminals and before that the Obama administration trying to get these people out, couldn't get them out of the country, couldn't get these communities to hold these individuals. And in Alabama, I got to tell you this, case in Alabama, this David Gonzalez. This little 12-year old girl, brutally raped. They found him hiding in a closet in Arab county in Alabama. Friends of mine in Alabama were so enraged when this came across their local news, they said, is anyone going to cover this on national news? I got bombarded. I got a lot of friends. Anyone care? What about the people who care about the little girls? They don't care about these victims, they care about their choice stories that advance their narratives for open borders.

Human traffickers out, the illegal flow of people, particularly those unaccompanied minors and families coming from the Northern triangle or you're not and he doesn't believe you can divorce the two just because you want to hide behind a process argument. He is focused on the substance as he has been for four straight years now and the substance is very simple. When you look at the drugs flowing in, not just at the ports of entry but we saw data today, about all the fentanyl, this ultra-lethal synthetic opiate that's coming between the ports of entry. A very important article today called the Fentanyl failure of all places in The Washington Post, brilliant article, the Fentanyl Failure, folks please read it.

There's all this money for the troops, we've got some other stuff in here that we're funding out like the opioid crisis, like some other measures and then he said but don't - you have to give me the wall funding. The Republican Congress assured, we'll get you that funding, this Congress and they didn't do it and now the Democrats certainly aren't going to do it. But you know what, this President says every day, he's moving on with the construction and this new budget has $32.5 billion for border security measures, that includes additional border patrol agents, that includes technology enhancements but it also includes money for the wall.

Well, it did happen and the Attorney General today, Barr has to investigate this. He has to conduct an investigation. He has to hold them accountable. He has to go after Hillary.

Yeah, I do think he's going to get to the bottom and Bernie's right. We shouldn't let this go away but let me give you the real bombshell in that little Comey speech. As you all know on the panel, that was probably the third or fourth version of that speech, it was edited. The first version of that speech contained a phrase where Hillary Clinton emailed someone from overseas, from her private account because she didn't have a government account. That person she emailed was Barack Obama. Now Laura, why is that a problem? Because Obama insisted in a televised interview nationally that he didn't know about Hillary's email. We found about it from the media but that's not possible, Laura because Obama had a Blackberry where those emails that come in from private addresses would have had to been whitelisted, meaning somebody would have had to tell the Obama staff that Hillary had a private email in order for her to get through those firewalls. Somebody is lying here, and the reason they took that out of the speech is because, I believe, they were covering up for the fact that Obama knew."

Comey a couple years after that press conference, Comey says, well, I wasn't really overseeing the matter. Remember, that in the book tour, the famous book tour? So what does you bar do here?

Laura, these are extraordinarily troubling things. The question is, do they rise to a level of criminality? And what we all know is that President Obama, Hillary Clinton, this was a scandal. They did send classified information around the system the State Department sent, and they looked the other way. They winked at it and they got away with it. Is it criminal? The good news is that the Justice Department a year ago did ask U.S. attorney from Utah John Huber to investigate this, the inspector general did, the same inspector general, Mike Horowitz, who brought down Andy McCabe. So I do have faith that the Justice Department system has the mechanisms are in place now through this inspector general investigation to shine a light on the Hillary investigation. We have to wait for Huber. Let's see what he concludes. And if he's got the goods, then it needs to be exposed."

With nearly 27,000 votes in, or Raymond is like Vanna White, 91 to nine percent against the GOP senators who will vote to block the president's emergency declaration on constitutional grounds.
