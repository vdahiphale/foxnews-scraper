A rare red wave hit Long Island, too, and Minneapolis voted against dismantling the police department.

And what you saw on the other night, listen, CRT was the fire that started really this revolution. But it was the parents being home for 18 months and seeing what the kids were actually being taught and how dramatic it was from the teachings of yesterday and so far left and radical that they said no, no, no this is -- don't insult moms and dads, okay. They are mama and papa bears and will take care of their children at all cost. And Terry McAuliffe's actions and the AFT, saying you have no role in this. It was what started it.

And so they thought, you know, this Joe Biden guy and has, obviously credibly close election, all the contested issues surrounding it, but that he was going to be a calming force. Remember, he talked about dignity -- bringing dignity back to the process. And then, what people found, and you and I were warning them about this, they found that Joe Biden was just too weak to ever stand up to the far left, so the far left took over the party and then they went to town and everything from critical race theory, to tax policy, to climate change, to cancel culture, and beyond. And so this was a reaction, not just to the education issue, but to all of it. It's a significant development, the White House knows it. Nancy Pelosi knows it.

She was the number one champion of defunding the police, called the police a cancer on Minneapolis. She was rejected by the people of Minneapolis. So what I think a lot of conservatives are saying rightly so. Now, it's time to go for her seat. Now, it's time to go into the inner city where these congressmen and congresswomen have been failing the people, and we should be going for broke in every state, in every locality, in every School Board election. It should be a 50-state strategy to take back America. You're not going to do it if it's about a few percentage points here or there. That's not enough. We have to roll this thing back from the West Coast to the East Coast and you cannot be afraid, and I think you go for her seat and you go for, you know, the entire squad.

But look, we had big victories in Seattle School Board races, Long Island, and the State Senate Chair in New Jersey. The most powerful person in New Jersey state politics, he was unseated by, you know, the truck driver. Paid -- spent 150 bucks on his campaign. I mean, Democrats answer to this is, okay, we want higher energy prices, we want more supply chain problems. We want to make life more difficult for the American people with all these new edicts and mandates and rules.

And then we see it here again what's happening right now today, using reconciliation, a rammed through massive spending bill that, quite frankly, takes away people's rights and freedoms. And what you saw on the other night, listen, CRT was the fire that started really this revolution. But it was the parents being home for 18 months and seeing what the kids were actually being taught and how dramatic it was from the teachings of yesterday and so far left and radical that they said no, no, no this is -- don't insult moms and dads, okay. They are mama and papa bears and will take care of their children at all cost. And Terry McAuliffe's actions and the AFT, saying you have no role in this. It was what started it. But then you throw in inflation, the cost of food and gas and home heating oil. It's out of control. And you saw basically, you know, we're going far left and we've been far right. Now, we're kind of going back to our sweet spot of this great, amazing country where people care deeply about the direction of it.

They will revolt. There potentially could be revolts in the streets, and I urge people do not commit violent actions over something like this. But this is so bad, Jesse.

It incentivizes others to do the same thing. It's wrong. And here we are, four times more than our Gold Star families get for people making the ultimate sacrifice, and he's going to give this money away. This 950 people right now have actually filed a claim. There's like 5,600 people who are basically in the pool of potential -- it could be billions of dollars. This is outrageous. And I agree with obviously -- with the former Congresswoman that yes, this is another flashpoint -- another like - - you can't make this stuff up type of thing. And the President once again, either doesn't know what he's doing, or is just completely misleading the American public and thinking he can pull something over on us and it's just not going to happen.

But the truth is any app, any website that has a chat client has the ability for a perpetrator to reach out to a child. So parents have to also consider coloring book apps, gaming apps, platforms that they assume to be really innocuous. That's a concern. My biggest advice for parents is to have really open and honest conversations with kids about online safety and not just once, but constantly because these are the conversations that need to be happening.

      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "I know what you mean. I don't know, really, I'm not a gearhead. But that's a nice car. And they shouldn't be doing that because anything could happen there. You can't run in front of someone's car like that. You could get squashed like a grape."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCDONNELL",
      "utterance": "Correct. But then they kind of just like fanned out to the side and the gentleman who was filming or the guy that was filming said, you know, how much does the money mean? I guess, it means a lot. He drives a Maserati, and he likes coal. So --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "All right, the car does not run on coal, it runs on gas. I just want to make sure everybody is aware of that. Also, we want to talk about Colin Kaepernick. We had to cover this. We didn't want to, but he said something so dumb, that we wanted to play it for you. Watch."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "COLIN KAEPERNICK, FORMER NFL PLAYER",
      "utterance": "What they don't want you to understand is what's been established is a power dynamic. Before they put you on the field, teams poke, pry, and examine, searching for any defect that might affect your performance. No boundary respected, no dignity left intact."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Kacie, I just want to say something. They have an NHL Draft. Those guys are all white. It doesn't have anything to do with slavery. You're going to invest millions of dollars in an athlete. You want to see how high they jump and how fast they run."

    {
      "speaker": "MCDONNELL",
      "utterance": "My fiancee plays baseball. I mean, if they say you're going to get this check every year, checkup every year, they do it. That's what they do in spring training."

      "speaker": "WATTERS",

    },

      "speaker": "MCDONNELL",
      "utterance": "Probably but he is -- you know, he is doing what he loves. He is playing baseball and it is all hunky-dory, but this man made $43 million just with the NFL, six seasons. So you say agent fees, taxes. Okay, let's say he took home 20. That's not his Nike deal. That's not other endorsements. This guy lives in a pretty nice lifestyle, and you look at the average American. They're making what? A handful a million in a lifetime. That's 40 years of work. Just go buy something."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Yes, go buy a brand. How about that? Yes, go buy a Maserati. That will cost you over 100K. All right, lastly, this is something Kacie has been pushing us to do. I didn't want to do it. It's really not in my wheelhouse. There's a stripper who has an emotional support monkey, we believe. Is this really her emotional support monkey? Well, it went wild and bit a kid. Is that what happened, Kacie?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCDONNELL",
      "utterance": "So, there is a lot of layers here. Her boyfriend is up for a college coaching position in Washington. The previous coach was fired because he wouldn't get the vaccine. Anyway, they had a childhood or I should say a neighborhood Halloween party and she had like a haunted house in our backyard. There are apparently two gates before you got to the monkey. Some kid went back, stuck his finger in the cage and got bit."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "And so the kid wasn't at the strip club."

      "utterance": "Yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "But she is a stripper with an emotional support monkey. Listen, I need emotional support if I was --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCDONNELL",
      "utterance": "Was the emotional support monkey vaccinated?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "It was an unvaxxed emotional support monkey? We need to find that out."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCDONNELL",
      "utterance": "I don't know. This is terrible."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "We're going to have find that for next week. Is that all right?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCDONNELL",
      "utterance": "I'll go out on the road. I'll head to Vegas now."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "All right, you go find that emotional support stripper monkey and you figured that. All right, Kacie, thank you so much. Up next, last call, a big announcement having to do with ratings."

      "utterance": "My favorite show besides WATTERS' WORLD, \"The Five\" was number one for the whole month of October beating MSNBC and CNN combined. Number one show on cable, beat Tucker, beat Hannity. Sorry, it just happened to be that way. Grateful for Greg and Dana, and all the other people at that table. Thank you guys for watching \"The Five,\" the number one show first time ever for the month. That's all for tonight. Be sure to follow me on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. \"JUSTICE WITH JUDGE JEANINE\" is next and remember, I'm Watters and this is my world.
