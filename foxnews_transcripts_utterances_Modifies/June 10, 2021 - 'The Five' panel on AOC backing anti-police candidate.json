      "sentences": "Hello, everybody. I'm Jesse Watters along with Katie Pavlich, Geraldo Rivera, Dana Perino and Greg Gutfeld. It's 5:00 in New York City and this is THE FIVE. Liberals getting called out for their selective outrage on crime. For example, 10-year-old boy was shot and killed in New York City. Disturbing video shows the suspect opening fire into a house. Bullets struck two people inside and killed that child. But so far, there's been deafening silence from the likes of AOC and Black Lives Matter. Apparently, AOC is too busy endorsing New York City mayoral candidate, Maya Wiley, who wants to defund the police but has private security guarding her block. Wiley says her partner is the one who is paying for it. And as crime surges across the country, Americans are fighting against defunding police. Residents in Minneapolis are suing the city and the mayor for cutting the police budget and failing to keep them safe. And the parents in Atlanta are suing city leaders after their 8-year-old daughter was shot and killed during violent protests last year. So, Greg, you know, you read these stories about these defund the police people and then it turns out they are big private security people. What say you?",

      "sentences": "Well, it's kind of a relief that we're doing these stories because we have been doing them consistently for quite a while. When the crime rate spiked and the riots in the summertime, we were the ones talking about this stuff when other -- the legacy media and the Democrats didn't want to talk about it. All of these problems have been going on forever, but now they are deciding to focus on it because it's going to hurt them politically, which is very sad. They were happy. If you remember last year with CNN, their prime time anchors were mocking -- the right wing for being upset about crime. Do you remember? We played that sot Lemon and Cuomo mocking people who were actually concerned about black on black crime and then Lemon, a couple of weeks later goes, hey, this could hurt Biden so we better do something about the crime. How bloodless is that to only care about suffering if it's politically contingent? All of these problems come from two sources that have been going on for decades, the rejection of law and order as something that is lacking in compassion. We talked about that with the border too. So, if you believe in law and order, you are a cold, heartless person. If you defend law and order, the second part of that is that you're racist. So, the left identifies the problem and then makes it unsolvable because every solution is somehow going to be racist. So now what you end up with as a result is the defunding movement and you've got incinerated cities. And all of this is caused by a media, well, it's assisted by a media generated narrative which said that cops were hunting blacks. And when you end up looking into the statistics, it's a huge lie that led to the Ferguson effect, cops pulling back leading to the riots. Of the two dozen or so shocking shootings deaths of unarmed human beings, half of them, more than half were white. The percentages where higher were white based on police stops. So a lot of the suffering and killing was completely, completely based on untruths.",

I think that Black Lives Matter is the most utterly failed movement in recent times.

But Joe Biden could ask his Justice Department to do something like Operation Legend, like the Trump administration did where the federal government partnered with local authorities to solve murders of children in these communities, especially in places where local officials have tried to defund the police and they don't have the resources to do this. But the idea that these politicians continue to want to defund the police while also taking away everybody's second amendment rights to defend themselves against violent criminals, it's not just hypocritical. It's elitist. And so they are willing to isolate themselves with private security that they can afford through political means and donations while forcing everybody else to be victims of crime and violence that is a result of their direct decision-making and policies to defund the police. I mean, it's an absolutely despicable, elitist way of governing. And we've seen this all over the country. And when it comes to how does this keep happening? How is it that little kids are being shot in their homes or road rage incidents, well, in places like L.A. and San Francisco, in New York, in Washington State? You have all of these D.A.s who are unwilling to actually prosecute criminals, violent criminals. They are letting them out of jail. And this is not just a fluke. This is an ideology promoted by Black Lives Matter. They say that they are all about justice. Justice for who? For the criminals who are willing to commit violent acts against children? What about the victims of these crimes? The mothers whose children are now dead as a result of these D.A.'s letting people out of jail and they go and re-commit crimes? That is their responsibility but it's not just a mistake. This is an ideology that they actually believe in.",

Now, it is almost universally agreed to that mayor de Blasio is the worst mayor in the history of the city. So, if were one of her opponents, I would be trying to tie that back to them. I do think that defund the police movement is now a liability for Democrats. For so long, Democrats -- and the right does this too -- when you ignore your moderates, it's to your peril because they swing. They could go back and forth. If Maya Wiley loses, which I don't know exactly what will happen. There is ranked choice voting for the first time in New York City. This is an experiment that we're all going to have to see how it works, but I do think Eric Adams is going to win. She is the political guinea pig for the progressive left. And if people like Abigail Spanberger, the congresswoman from Virginia who said we almost didn't keep the majority in the House of Representatives in 2020 because of all this radical leftist rhetoric, then maybe they'll pay attention to somebody like Maya losing.",

Liberals getting called out for their selective outrage on crime. For example, 10-year-old boy was shot and killed in New York City. Disturbing video shows the suspect opening fire into a house. Bullets struck two people inside and killed that child. But so far, there's been deafening silence from the likes of AOC and Black Lives Matter. Apparently, AOC is too busy endorsing New York City mayoral candidate, Maya Wiley, who wants to defund the police but has private security guarding her block. Wiley says her partner is the one who is paying for it. And as crime surges across the country, Americans are fighting against defunding police. Residents in Minneapolis are suing the city and the mayor for cutting the police budget and failing to keep them safe. And the parents in Atlanta are suing city leaders after their 8-year-old daughter was shot and killed during violent protests last year. So, Greg, you know, you read these stories about these defund the police people and then it turns out they are big private security people. What say you?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST",
      "utterance": "Well, it's kind of a relief that we're doing these stories because we have been doing them consistently for quite a while. When the crime rate spiked and the riots in the summertime, we were the ones talking about this stuff when other -- the legacy media and the Democrats didn't want to talk about it. All of these problems have been going on forever, but now they are deciding to focus on it because it's going to hurt them politically, which is very sad. They were happy. If you remember last year with CNN, their prime time anchors were mocking -- the right wing for being upset about crime. Do you remember? We played that sot Lemon and Cuomo mocking people who were actually concerned about black on black crime and then Lemon, a couple of weeks later goes, hey, this could hurt Biden so we better do something about the crime. How bloodless is that to only care about suffering if it's politically contingent? All of these problems come from two sources that have been going on for decades, the rejection of law and order as something that is lacking in compassion. We talked about that with the border too. So, if you believe in law and order, you are a cold, heartless person. If you defend law and order, the second part of that is that you're racist. So, the left identifies the problem and then makes it unsolvable because every solution is somehow going to be racist. So now what you end up with as a result is the defunding movement and you've got incinerated cities. And all of this is caused by a media, well, it's assisted by a media generated narrative which said that cops were hunting blacks. And when you end up looking into the statistics, it's a huge lie that led to the Ferguson effect, cops pulling back leading to the riots. Of the two dozen or so shocking shootings deaths of unarmed human beings, half of them, more than half were white. The percentages where higher were white based on police stops. So a lot of the suffering and killing was completely, completely based on untruths."

      "speaker": "WATTERS",

Going back to Maya Wiley and the private police force, it's do as I say, not as I do. I mean, that's pretty typical. But I want to say something a little bit bigger. I think that Black Lives Matter is the most utterly failed movement in recent times. You have a movement that pretends to care about black lives when in fact, as you demonstrated very graphically at the top of the show, Jesse, the black life they care about is the one taken by the cop."

    {
      "speaker": "KATIE PAVLICH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Yes. Well, then nothing will get done, unfortunately. But Joe Biden could ask his Justice Department to do something like Operation Legend, like the Trump administration did where the federal government partnered with local authorities to solve murders of children in these communities, especially in places where local officials have tried to defund the police and they don't have the resources to do this. But the idea that these politicians continue to want to defund the police while also taking away everybody's second amendment rights to defend themselves against violent criminals, it's not just hypocritical. It's elitist. And so they are willing to isolate themselves with private security that they can afford through political means and donations while forcing everybody else to be victims of crime and violence that is a result of their direct decision-making and policies to defund the police. I mean, it's an absolutely despicable, elitist way of governing. And we've seen this all over the country. And when it comes to how does this keep happening? How is it that little kids are being shot in their homes or road rage incidents, well, in places like L.A. and San Francisco, in New York, in Washington State? You have all of these D.A.s who are unwilling to actually prosecute criminals, violent criminals. They are letting them out of jail. And this is not just a fluke. This is an ideology promoted by Black Lives Matter. They say that they are all about justice. Justice for who? For the criminals who are willing to commit violent acts against children? What about the victims of these crimes? The mothers whose children are now dead as a result of these D.A.'s letting people out of jail and they go and re-commit crimes? That is their responsibility but it's not just a mistake. This is an ideology that they actually believe in."

Now, it is almost universally agreed to that mayor de Blasio is the worst mayor in the history of the city. So, if were one of her opponents, I would be trying to tie that back to them. I do think that defund the police movement is now a liability for Democrats. For so long, Democrats -- and the right does this too -- when you ignore your moderates, it's to your peril because they swing. They could go back and forth. If Maya Wiley loses, which I don't know exactly what will happen. There is ranked choice voting for the first time in New York City. This is an experiment that we're all going to have to see how it works, but I do think Eric Adams is going to win. She is the political guinea pig for the progressive left. And if people like Abigail Spanberger, the congresswoman from Virginia who said we almost didn't keep the majority in the House of Representatives in 2020 because of all this radical leftist rhetoric, then maybe they'll pay attention to somebody like Maya losing."

And also, he makes his mistake where he says, you know, in the part of the interview he talks about how his daughters are saying cancel culture is out of control or it's not good and then he says CRT is, you know, harmless. He doesn't see the connection between the two. The critical race theory helps create the cancel culture by saying that everybody who isn't non-white is an oppressor and therefore must be canceled. And finally, how does he not get that education is actually way more important than anything he just talked about, whether it was climate change or anything? His priorities are all contingent on solving education which is basically the pyramid base for everything else. I mean, if you look -- we talked about crime in the A block. If you look at people that are killed by police, you can trace it almost all the way back to their education. How was their education?"

Jefferson Davis was a great guy. Stonewall Jackson is the hero of heroes. Robert E. Lee is next to Jesus. You know, contemporary society sorts these things out. Now it's all the rage.

And they are a diverse group of parents who are -- who grew up with a legacy of Martin Luther King Jr., saying we want to judge our kids and each other by the content of their character, not by the color of their skin. And they have very publicly stated that the critical race theory, a curriculum that they are seeing their kids come home with, does the opposite of that. And it's teaching their kids and their kids of their neighbors who live on this the same street as them and the kids that they play baseball with, or sports with at school, to hate each other based on their skin color. And it's really not even about American history, it's about looking at someone in a hierarchy of skin color and saying because you're lighter than I am or because you're white, you have -- you have oppressed me even though you've never even done that. You know, you are -- you are a product of the sin of the people who came before you despite having zero or anything to do with the history of the country. And it lacks a ton of context when it comes to the progress that the country has made. And so, the bottom line is parents who are a fighting critical race theory don't want their kids to grow up looking at their fellow peers, and saying, I'm going to judge you based on your skin color and determine whether I should oppress you, you should oppress me, or whether we can move forward together as Americans. And so, they're just worried about their kids growing up to hate each other as a result of the curriculum.

But when it comes to Chris Harrison of The Bachelor, he tends to be seen as more of a Republican and therefore he has to lose his job. So, the left has made the rules here. And it would just be nice if once in a while they applied to their own side rather than to their political enemies. And overall, as Greg said, this eventually eats everybody. It's a miserable way to live. It's like you have to constantly be on eggshells about what you can say, what you've done, what your -- what you may have done when you were 19 years old at a ball. And so, eventually, I hope that they just say look, we're not going to be so sensitive to these things and they move on. But the left decide of the political spectrum who have engaged in this kind of behavior. So, the right has been wanting to move on."
