Just because Democrats ran a partisan process doesn't mean that there aren't very legitimate, concerning things with respect to the call and the context for the call. And I think that's what we are likely to see. I share the skepticism here at the table that this is unlikely to change a lot of minds. I've spoken to members of Congress who have said, in effect, we are not really looking for things to change our minds, on the Republican side.  But what people will see, I think tomorrow, that's different, is the testimony from these people that the White House has tried, I think, to make villains. And they will be able to determine whether that testimony is credible. Somebody like a Bill Taylor, the White House has portrayed him as a never-Trumper. He was in fact handpicked by the secretary of state to come in. He's not a never-Trumper.

Some protesters found photos posted to reporters Twitter accounts retraumatizing and invasive. Some students also voiced concern about the methods that \"Daily\" staffer used to reach out to them. Some of our staff members who were covering the event used Northwestern's directory to obtain phone numbers for students beforehand and texted them to ask if they'd be willing to be interviewed.

That's not what journalism is about. The subjects of your reporting are going to be frustrated with you sometimes. That's part of the job. The audience that you are reporting for is sometimes going to be frustrated with what you do and how you do your job. But your job isn't to make people feel comfortable.

I think what I would like to focus on right now is how \"The Harvard Crimson\" responded when it came under similar kind of pressure. And they - - I think this is very important, they listened to all of the complaints, they met with the students were completing about them, and then they issued a statement defending the coverage that they had engaged in and what they had done. So while this is a very depressing moment for those of us who believe in in the free press, I would sort of like to switch the attention over to the good news, which was at least \"The Harvard Crimson\" stood up, and by the way, in the face of even a vote by the student council there against them.",

So I don't know why -- that's where they learned it. Kiddos, life is retraumatizing. It's a sad fact about life, and I am reminded, as I am almost every day, of Charles Krauthammer and what he admonished many times.

When they can come out and say our feelings are more important than your freedom of press, they're more important than people getting information about what we are doing, then it's a dangerous precedent they're setting."

What's different in Northwestern and what makes it troubling is what they are being asked to be sensitive to.

It comes from \"The Daily Northwestern\" statement, this is \"The Daily Northwestern\" paper, this statement came out Sunday after coverage of Jeff Sessions there, a speech. \"One area of our reporting that harmed many students was our photo coverage of the event. Some protesters found photos posted to reporters Twitter accounts retraumatizing and invasive. Some students also voiced concern about the methods that \"Daily\" staffer used to reach out to them. Some of our staff members who were covering the event used Northwestern's directory to obtain phone numbers for students beforehand and texted them to ask if they'd be willing to be interviewed. We recognized being contacted like this is an invasion of privacy, and we have spoken to those reporters along with our entire staff about the correct way to reach out to students for stories.\" Which is what? The phone or the text or --"

Look, I think what we are seeing is a fundamental exposition of the problems with both journalism as it is practiced on campus but also the campus environment more broadly. The editor of the paper said nothing is more important than making fellow students feel safe. We want to show marginalized students more than anything that \"The Daily\" is really listening. That's not what journalism is about. The subjects of your reporting are going to be frustrated with you sometimes. That's part of the job. The audience that you are reporting for is sometimes going to be frustrated with what you do and how you do your job. But your job isn't to make people feel comfortable. It's not to make people feel safe. It's not to coddle anyone in the whole process. It's to tell the truth."

I would call for a little tiny bit of sympathy based on the youth of the offender in this case, who, according to this dean's letter, were subjected to what seems like an incredible sort of Twitter mob attack on their campus. And this isn't really a defense of what they said. It's trying to be a defense of what they were up against. I think what I would like to focus on right now is how \"The Harvard Crimson\" responded when it came under similar kind of pressure. And they - - I think this is very important, they listened to all of the complaints, they met with the students were completing about them, and then they issued a statement defending the coverage that they had engaged in and what they had done. So while this is a very depressing moment for those of us who believe in in the free press, I would sort of like to switch the attention over to the good news, which was at least \"The Harvard Crimson\" stood up, and by the way, in the face of even a vote by the student council there against them."

      "utterance": "Let's remember Joseph Pulitzer's line about afflicting the comfortable and comforting the afflicted. Look, what these people did is no worse than what \"The New York Times\" did. They folded like a cheap suit under pressure about the headline, a perfectly factually accurate headline they had in their newspapers, and it's supposed to be the greatest newspaper in the United States, they completely folded and changed their headline. So I don't know why -- that's where they learned it. Kiddos, life is retraumatizing. It's a sad fact about life, and I am reminded, as I am almost every day, of Charles Krauthammer and what he admonished many times. The moment conservatives walked off college campuses, they gave up the fight. And until that gets reversed or people just start getting common sense, we are in trouble."
