You wrote at the time: Those who question the direction of LBJ's policy were excluded from future deliberations on Vietnam. The president got the military advice he wanted.

There's not a lot of charities being funded by our nation's donor class that are dealing with Mountain Dew mouth in Kentucky. And so I think dealing with that culture war, figuring out a way that instead of having a civic breaking, we can have a civic reawakening that brings us apart, is the most important challenge that we have as a nation. Clearly the president's doing it in a pretty very divisive way, which I don't think is going to be the way that we come together as a nation, but we need to figure out how we pull ourselves together, how we fight battles between a progressive left that does want to tear us away from our civic ties and do it in a way that's tied to policy and where the president can use that momentum to get things done.",

And our European allies, the E3 they’re called -- France, Germany and the U.K. -- are supporting much more rigorous enforcement of the JCPOA and monitoring. One of the real problems with this deal is we can't really say with confidence that they are complying and we know from their behavior, their behavior broadly in the region, and their behavior within the agreement where they have walked up to the line, they have crossed the line several times in terms of the restrictions, that this is not a trustworthy regime. So, much more comprehensive monitoring is in order."

So, if he sees some real change, if he sees the ability of the Congress within U.S. law to address some of these problems associated with the deal. So, this -- in our legislation, the domestic law about the deal was really flawed because it was really just about cost reporting to each other. So, what the president has done is met with Congress to ask Congress help fix this domestic legislation and let's work on as Secretary Tillerson has said, a deal that can lay alongside the JCPOA and address its fundamental flaws. One of which you already mentioned, which is the sunset clause where Iran can just wait for a little while and reap all the benefits of sanctions relief to enrich the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, which is on a murderous brutal campaign across the Middle East."

And I would ask, as we always pay attention to our European allies and others, pay attention to our allies and partners in the region.

The Stalinist regime in Pyongyang this past week reissued its threat to move militarily against Guam, a U.S. territory. We have heard you and the president and others in the administration reaffirm many times that the so-called military option remains on the table. What would you like our adversary, in this instance Kim Jong-un, to know about that military option? Is it the same option military that was on the table when I used to hear Condoleezza Rice talk about it in 2005, or has in fact the North Koreans nuclear progress in that time served to constrain the military options that we have today?"

It’s having the opposite effect."

So, our military is getting stronger and stronger under military leaders are refining, improving plans every day. Plans we hope we don't have to use but we must be ready, we have to be ready.

We just have about a minute left, I want to ask about your 1997 book, \"Dereliction of Duty: Johnson, McManara, the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Lies that Led to Vietnam\". I was a big admirer of the book. It’s a deep archival study of how the joint chiefs were systematically excluded from policy-making in the process that gave us the quagmire in Vietnam. You wrote at the time: Those who question the direction of LBJ's policy were excluded from future deliberations on Vietnam. The president got the military advice he wanted. So, having made wartime dysfunction on the National Security Council your area of academic study, how do you apply the lessons you learned about the process in the Vietnam era to the running of the National Security Council today?"

And I think history can't give you the answer to today's problems, but it can help you maybe avoid some mistakes of the past. So, it really highlighted for me what we owe the president within the National Security Council, is to coordinate and integrate efforts across all departments and agencies and provide the president with multiple options -- options that are based on clearly articulated goals and objectives that we derive from an understanding of vital interests, with U.S. vital interest."

What the president does is he asks very tough questions and I think you've seen this in the development of a broad number of strategies from Cuba, to North Korea to South Asia. And so, what I think the president has done is helped us restore our strategic competence. He got the National Security Council out of the tactical day-to-day business and supervising cabinet officials who don't need supervision. They need -- they need support and they need effort to -- help in integrating their efforts with others."

The fact of the matter is, Iran is complying with the agreement. The White House is required to tell Congress if they are not and they have submitted absolutely no submissions. There is no chance that the deal is going to be renegotiated. The Iranians will not renegotiate it and neither will the Europeans. And so, if we were to pull all of this agreement as the president is threatening, Iran would get everything they want. They would be able to restart their nuclear program because we would be in violation of the deal, the Europeans would continue to grant them sanctions relief. Their economy would continue to grow, and they would look like the victim in this situation. So, there is absolutely nothing that accrues to our national security benefit if we ultimately fall out of this deal and it is an absolute fantasy to suggest that we are going to be able to restart negotiations."

Earlier this year, Republicans and Democrats joined together to pass new sanctions against Iran's ballistic missile program. But you know what? The president hasn't implemented those sanctions. So, the White House can't complain that Iran is still acting in the deleterious manner in the region and then not implement the powers that we have given him to try to stop that behavior. We should be working together to take on their support for terrorism, their ballistic missile program, their miserable human rights record. But if you allow them to get back on the path to a nuclear weapon, their activity in the region supporting our enemies is even worse. It's even more threatening to us if they become a nuclear power in that region. That should be unacceptable and that's what the deal was about."

He's really literally setting the entire health care system on fire just because the president is upset that the United States Congress won't pass a repeal bill that is supported by 17 percent of the American public. These subsidies going to the insurance companies help very low income people afford insurance. And without the subsidies, there will be many people who won't be able to provide insurance and afford it. And the other set of subsidies that go to individuals to access coverage will actually increase. Meaning that the deficit goes up, the amount of money that we spend overall on the Affordable Care Act goes up, because all that happens is the payments that used to be going to insurance companies now get substituted with increased tax credits for individuals to afford the coverage. The fact of the matter is the president is trying to sabotage the American health care system, trying to put a gun to the head of our constituents by taking away their health care or raising their costs in order to force us to repeal a bill that the American public doesn't want us to repeal."

Nobody should have that kind of powerful weapon to be able to kill 50 people in a period of 10 to 15 minutes. Nobody should be able to turn that kind of weapon into an automatic weapon.

They’re unconstitutional. A court has said so. And with the president focusing on middle-class families who are paying $30,000 to $40,000 a year for premiums plus deductibles on top of this. Think about that, $30,000 to 40,000 a year.

The payments are unconstitutional, according to a court, and his first responsibility is to uphold that. But we absolutely have to think about that family around the kitchen table, which is why I think Congress should pass them. Republicans have been trying to do so, but coupled with flexibility so that premiums can come down. Keep in mind, with those payments, that family is paying $30,000 to 40,000 a year. We’ve got to do something to lower their premiums. And so, if we continue on the short-term, have the regulatory flexibility to lower those costs and then do something like Graham-Cassidy to correct things long term, I think that's a good direction."

And someone told me that the CBO said they might pay a little bit less. If you speak about that family who’s just above federal poverty level, according to eHealth.com, a family of three making $82,000 a year, according to the Affordable Care Act definition, cannot afford their current policy on the exchange. They’re making $82,000 a year, and so, $30,000 to $40,000 is beyond their reach. The president also allowed flexibility for their employer to perhaps ban together in association health plans are for short-term insurance to be sold that would be much lower in cost to allow them to purchase that which they can afford."

We have a constitutional system that sets up a very robust executive branch of government. People had a problem with unconstitutional executive action. ObamaCare is very clear, there is no appropriation for bailouts to insurance companies. Now, because ObamaCare is unstable, the assumption that those bailouts would be given is critical to it. And what President Trump has done -- has said is that he's not going to continue to make those unconstitutional bailouts. Similarly, President Obama regulated short-term limited duration health plans, which are a great life boat away from ObamaCare for people who are suffering under it. President Trump is putting forth a proposal to allow those lifeboats to be used. The challenge of ObamaCare is that it's so fundamentally unstable that when people start getting into the short term limited durations like boats, It further destabilizes an incoherent plan. When you stop making unconstitutional payments to insurance companies, it starts destabilizing in a coherent plan. The challenges with ObamaCare is not what the president faithfully executing the duties of his office."

The president just doesn't like the agreement. I think because President Obama was the one to do it. Also because he -- he wishes that it looked at things like ballistic missiles or support for terrorism. And the fact is, there are better ways to deal with all those other issues and to make sure Iran is complying and crossing every T and dotting every I.

Ironically, people who don't like the deal, starting with Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas, do not want to move immediately to imposing the additional sanctions on Iranians because that will blow up the deal. The Europeans will stay in the agreement. The U.S. will walk away from it. Whether the Iranians continue to comply with -- at that point or not, who knows? I think what's going to -- what the attempts now is going to be, to get the Iranians to renegotiate parts of this agreement. I agree with Senator Murphy, I don't think that's very likely to happen. So I think we're headed toward a situation in which Congress is going to do what it usually does, which is not very much and it will be six months from now in a situation which, as you suggest, the president's going to have to decide, now do I pull the plug on the deal entirely or not.

I just don't think that's a good situation. Now, having said all that, I think one of the things we've learned in the last eight or nine months is that you have to step back from the kind of junior high level rhetoric and look at what people do, not what they say. And my guess is Bob Corker will continue to work with the administration on the Iran deal and John McCain will continue to work with the administration on North Korea.

And I think that's what the president is frustrated by. That's what he's articulating by. And we need to figure out, as a party, how do we come together, how do we accept that this is a president who made a more correct diagnosis of where the country is than any of the establishment Republicans who typically run for party or run for president.

Marie Harf, as a Democrat, is it healthy for the party to have leaders like Nancy Pelosi and Steny Hoyer and Dianne Feinstein, all of whom are in their late 70s, even their mid-80s, for a party that places such a premium on progressivism and novelty and youth?"

What's been interesting is that the Republican Party, who won, has this really serious level of infighting too. That actually I've been a little surprised about. So, yes, I think the Democratic Party needs new leaders. We need a message that makes clear to middle-class voters around the country why I believe and we believe our policies are best for them. But, look, if the Republican Party is going to spend its time and it's money primary challenge and a bunch of Republican senators instead of putting that money into ten Democratic Senate races where there are states where Donald Trump won in 2016, and we have venerable senators, I'm not sure this is going to be a win for the Republicans. Sure, we have problems on the Democratic side, but speaking to what we were just talking about, the Republican Party has its own problems. And 2018, at this point, could really go either way."

Age is important. If you take a look at the age break that was in the Democratic Party in Washington, it is between people like Seth Moulton and Tim Ryan who say, we need to have a message, like Marie said, that appeals to a middle class. That's not the big division of the Democratic Party. An interesting piece in this week's \"New Republican\" says, can't a socialist and the liberals get together and work together? The Democratic Party, outside of Washington, is split between a very hard left, the resistance that has energy and enthusiasm, and then you have the traditional liberals, like Dianne Feinstein. So De Leon is going to -- going to appeal to the hard left of the Democratic Party that in opposition to this president is going even more hard left and spinning out of control."

I mean the Values Voter -- and, by the way, who would have guessed this a few years ago that Donald Trump was the champion of the value voters, but that's kind of what happened. And they form a large part of the Trump base right now. And he is speaking to them. And, obviously, the NFL protest, which you referred to, is an attempt to say something I think which was very important in 2016 and under appreciated, which is, a large part of the divide between Hillary Clinton voters and Donald Trump voters was cultural. It was not economic, it was cultural. And this is now shot through every political issue. We've seen it in our polling. And, you know, conversations about issues like the NFL now play into that as well. And I think it dominates the entire political conversation in some ways."

The Real Clear Politics average of major reliable polling where the president's job approval rating is concerned places him right now at 38 percent. Briefly, are these kinds of appeals going to be the thing that brings them above 50 percent?"

    {
      "speaker": "NEEDHAM",
      "utterance": "Well, I think the number one challenge that our country has right now is a civic coming apart where there is not trust between our nation's elites and the rest of the country. The rest of the country feels that our elites would rather be at Davos or worrying about the problems of the world than worrying about real economic and other anxieties that people fell in this country. There's not a lot of charities being funded by our nation's donor class that are dealing with Mountain Dew mouth in Kentucky. And so I think dealing with that culture war, figuring out a way that instead of having a civic breaking, we can have a civic reawakening that brings us apart, is the most important challenge that we have as a nation. Clearly the president's doing it in a pretty very divisive way, which I don't think is going to be the way that we come together as a nation, but we need to figure out how we pull ourselves together, how we fight battles between a progressive left that does want to tear us away from our civic ties and do it in a way that's tied to policy and where the president can use that momentum to get things done."

These players have said, we are patriotic. We love this country. But there are serious issues we have to talk about and we're not, as a nation, having that conversation. I want that to be the conversation, not these divisive, cultural wars that the president's trying to rely on because he's got nothing else done, like health care or tax reform or infrastructure.
