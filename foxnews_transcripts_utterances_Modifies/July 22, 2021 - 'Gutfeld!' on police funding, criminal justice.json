So while crime spreads like a virus on a plane full of Democrats, at least we know true justice is being done. A Florida man has been sentenced to eight months in jail for breaching the Senate chamber on January 6th carrying a Trump flag. The only surprise he didn't get life without parole. Now, we're not liberals, so we get it. You do the crime? You do the time. We got that from Beretta for anybody watching who's younger than 75. Baretta. He had a parrot. Now does it ring a bell? But you can still question the penalty. And, you know, if he were BLM, he would be a OK. But it's obviously -- the obvious that they overdid the sentencing. In fact, they even admitted as one assistant U.S. attorney said, it will send a loud and clear message, so there won't be a next time. But you got to worry when you become a message, because then you're screwed. It's a threat, like finding a horse's head in your bed or a book signed by Andrew Cuomo. Sensing should only be for the crime, and not for a greater message, especially a message so manufactured, you heard it yourself. The breach was the worst thing since the Hindenburg, the JFK assassination and synchronized swimming, all rolled into one.",

But why send a message about this and not other things that are killing people. And I'm not talking about climate change or misgendering your friend Danny, hundreds of people arrested in riots last year have all had their charges dismissed. And these include people who threw projectiles at cops and burn private property, assault in civilians and of course there was the looting and the destruction of businesses. In Minneapolis alone, you have over a half billion dollars in damages. 1500 properties damage 150 buildings set on fire, countless police injured. Maybe it's hard to prosecute mobs and masks. But imagine if the government had devoted the time and resources to punish these thugs with the same intensity. They devoted to hunting down trespassing grannies who didn't wear masks. Stores could be open again, in minority neighborhoods, parked cars wouldn't get air conditioned by broken windows. We could get M.S.13, down to M.S.5 or Six but they didn't. Instead they egged on the civilians to narc on each other. They turned America into a nation of mafia rats, because they hate anything that smells of Trump. And so, ignoring the helpless cries of citizens, our government created an artificial danger to keep us divided that America is now at the mercy of a white supremacist movement. Not a crime wave that's parallelizing cities across the country. Yet we know which one is real and which one isn't. Even the judge who sentence the Capitol Hill guy use the same exact words from the media. Judge Randolph Moss told the guy although you were only one member of a larger mob, you actively participated in a larger event that threatened the capital and democracy itself. Now, you could say that about the crime wave but they won't. But that sentiment about January 6th had already been put into play over and over by the media. That this day threatened democracy. Of course the Capitol reopened and our dear leaders were back to pretending to work within hours. Meanwhile, countless businesses will never come back since the crime wave began. There are the dead who paid the price for the cowardice of liberal leaders. Remember David Dorn? You should because the media won't. But good for you judge, you got some misguided Nutter tossed into the clink. You save democracy. Not really. You just parroted the media's message, which is who cares about criminal gangs. We've got the dumb white protester covered. Here are some San Francisco locals describing what it's like to run a business now overrun by looters.",

Man has she gone quiet on that? So the government has made a choice. It's not based on justice, but fear. Terrified of the elite activist class they decided to let the mob steal while locking up crackpots and funny hats. The guy didn't hurt anyone or damaged property. What's he going to tell his cellmate that he's in for? Loitering? So he's a political collateral damage, a Trump supporter but the media sees as subhuman. No recipient of mercy.

Mayors and other officials in roughly 20 cities around the country defunded police well spending millions on security details for themselves in their defense. It's gotten really dangerous lately. The one thing these cities have in common, they're all being run into the ground by Democratic mayor's and nonprofit group filed Freedom of Information Act requests and found which city offices had police details and how much it costs. Some low lights. In Chicago, home of murder. The city spent 3.4 million for 22 officers last year to guard unnamed city officials. Baltimore spent 3.6 million for 14 cops to cover the mayor, the state's attorney and the police commissioner. And in S.F., the city spent 2.6 million last year to protect Mayor London Breed. So she's protected. But of course the stores aren't. Here's two dudes casually walking out of a TJ Maxx in L.A. with arms full of crap. It looks like they're boarding a flight.

The regular officers of Seattle Police Department in the precinct if one calls in sick or calls out, they prioritize her details still. They won't take away cops from that. So, it leaves that the actual precinct -- the actual precinct and protection of citizens even more lean and understaffed than defunding already does. And my favorite quote because there's no cell service up there in her neighborhood, apparently, and there's no bathroom. So one, one cop said literally, and I quote, \"You just sit there and stare and think about how (BLEEP) your life is for four or five hours.\" So then the residents socialist cycle or city council is to want, she led a protest up to the mayor's house chanting about how they need even more communism there in the city.

So while crime spreads like a virus on a plane full of Democrats, at least we know true justice is being done. A Florida man has been sentenced to eight months in jail for breaching the Senate chamber on January 6th carrying a Trump flag. The only surprise he didn't get life without parole. Now, we're not liberals, so we get it. You do the crime? You do the time. We got that from Beretta for anybody watching who's younger than 75. Baretta. He had a parrot. Now does it ring a bell? But you can still question the penalty. And, you know, if he were BLM, he would be a OK. But it's obviously -- the obvious that they overdid the sentencing. In fact, they even admitted as one assistant U.S. attorney said, it will send a loud and clear message, so there won't be a next time. But you got to worry when you become a message, because then you're screwed. It's a threat, like finding a horse's head in your bed or a book signed by Andrew Cuomo. Sensing should only be for the crime, and not for a greater message, especially a message so manufactured, you heard it yourself. The breach was the worst thing since the Hindenburg, the JFK assassination and synchronized swimming, all rolled into one."

But why send a message about this and not other things that are killing people. And I'm not talking about climate change or misgendering your friend Danny, hundreds of people arrested in riots last year have all had their charges dismissed. And these include people who threw projectiles at cops and burn private property, assault in civilians and of course there was the looting and the destruction of businesses. In Minneapolis alone, you have over a half billion dollars in damages. 1500 properties damage 150 buildings set on fire, countless police injured. Maybe it's hard to prosecute mobs and masks. But imagine if the government had devoted the time and resources to punish these thugs with the same intensity. They devoted to hunting down trespassing grannies who didn't wear masks. Stores could be open again, in minority neighborhoods, parked cars wouldn't get air conditioned by broken windows. We could get M.S.13, down to M.S.5 or Six but they didn't. Instead they egged on the civilians to narc on each other. They turned America into a nation of mafia rats, because they hate anything that smells of Trump. And so, ignoring the helpless cries of citizens, our government created an artificial danger to keep us divided that America is now at the mercy of a white supremacist movement. Not a crime wave that's parallelizing cities across the country. Yet we know which one is real and which one isn't. Even the judge who sentence the Capitol Hill guy use the same exact words from the media. Judge Randolph Moss told the guy although you were only one member of a larger mob, you actively participated in a larger event that threatened the capital and democracy itself. Now, you could say that about the crime wave but they won't. But that sentiment about January 6th had already been put into play over and over by the media. That this day threatened democracy. Of course the Capitol reopened and our dear leaders were back to pretending to work within hours. Meanwhile, countless businesses will never come back since the crime wave began. There are the dead who paid the price for the cowardice of liberal leaders. Remember David Dorn? You should because the media won't. But good for you judge, you got some misguided Nutter tossed into the clink. You save democracy. Not really. You just parroted the media's message, which is who cares about criminal gangs. We've got the dumb white protester covered. Here are some San Francisco locals describing what it's like to run a business now overrun by looters."

But AOC will tell you those criminals are only stealing bread to feed their families as they funnel the goods through an elaborate fencing network making millions for syndicates. Man has she gone quiet on that? So the government has made a choice. It's not based on justice, but fear. Terrified of the elite activist class they decided to let the mob steal while locking up crackpots and funny hats. The guy didn't hurt anyone or damaged property. What's he going to tell his cellmate that he's in for? Loitering? So he's a political collateral damage, a Trump supporter but the media sees as subhuman. No recipient of mercy.

Everyone that broke into a building burned down a building stole a bottle of water, up to hundreds of thousands of dollars in damages to stores and buildings should also be given the same stiff penalties.

And I think what's hard for me to swallow as well as a criminal defense attorney, is the fact that the prosecutors are failing to do their job. The system exists in a certain way. So that it protects both sides. So that yes, the defendants are protected, but so are the victims. There are advocates and representatives of -- representatives of everyone in the system in the court. But here what we're seeing is the complete erosion of that duty on the prosecutorial side. So you're talking about the slow dying, I mean, we watched before our eyes, Portland burned to the ground essentially over 100 straight days of riots, and looting and fires. And of all of the federal crimes that were referred for prosecutions, the D.A. dropped half of them. And of those half none went to trial. And instead of the ones that got any type of sentence, it was literally doing community service or \"encouraging people to vote.\" Those were for crimes like assaulting a Federal officer."

Now, if the white -- and a white person does it, walks into the thing does the same thing he would have got a, well, he needed food. He needed it for his family. So, I subtract him for having the courage to go in there and take what's his for his family. We just changed the roles now. Now it's white America that's the problem because they didn't want equality, they want opportunity and advantage. When you have opportunity advantage. You can profit from it. And as long as it doesn't happen in their yard where everyone gets crazy sentences you can -- they can eat themselves and then you can profit from it. And that's what we're seeing this country. We just -- we have just switched roles."

This one's going to piss you off too. According to a new report from Forbes Magazine. Don't miss there -- this year swimsuit issue, Joey. The cover at Stuart Varney and a thong. Mayors and other officials in roughly 20 cities around the country defunded police well spending millions on security details for themselves in their defense. It's gotten really dangerous lately. The one thing these cities have in common, they're all being run into the ground by Democratic mayor's and nonprofit group filed Freedom of Information Act requests and found which city offices had police details and how much it costs. Some low lights. In Chicago, home of murder. The city spent 3.4 million for 22 officers last year to guard unnamed city officials. Baltimore spent 3.6 million for 14 cops to cover the mayor, the state's attorney and the police commissioner. And in S.F., the city spent 2.6 million last year to protect Mayor London Breed. So she's protected. But of course the stores aren't. Here's two dudes casually walking out of a TJ Maxx in L.A. with arms full of crap. It looks like they're boarding a flight. If they got any more relaxed, you'd have to carry them as well. And why not? A new law makes the apps below 950 bucks worth of stuff, a misdemeanor instead of a felony.

The regular officers of Seattle Police Department in the precinct if one calls in sick or calls out, they prioritize her details still. They won't take away cops from that. So, it leaves that the actual precinct -- the actual precinct and protection of citizens even more lean and understaffed than defunding already does. And my favorite quote because there's no cell service up there in her neighborhood, apparently, and there's no bathroom. So one, one cop said literally, and I quote, \"You just sit there and stare and think about how (BLEEP) your life is for four or five hours.\" So then the residents socialist cycle or city council is to want, she led a protest up to the mayor's house chanting about how they need even more communism there in the city. So then it got real and the mayor came out called it a riot. And then they sued each other, so it was like this crazy infighting because yes, when it comes to their front door is only when the mayor's protest. And final point, I just have to say that Adam (INAUDIBLE) guy behind like finding all this stuff out and he's constantly exposing the government's payments and everything.
