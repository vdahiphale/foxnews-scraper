Hard to gauge here. But they're making the issue here all of this paperwork that dates back to the time Judge Kavanaugh was a lawyer in the Bush administration and oversaw all documents that passed through that White House, that administration, as the staff secretary.  Judge Andrew Napolitano here with us on how is sort of reading all of this.  Now, there's a lot of information there, Judge, that is best left not addressed to the public, because a lot of it is privileged information. But Democrats are saying, until they get it, there's really no reason for them to go on with this, right?",

They're also looking for comments made by him in memos that they think he made, but they haven't seen, which is critical of Roe vs. Wade, that would probably lose Senator Murkowski and Senator Collins. If they can't do that, then their goal, since there's really very little attack him for -- his qualifications are so extraordinary, his experiences is so vast, his opinions as a judge are public, and anybody can read them - - their goal is to attack the process and say, aha, there must be something in these documents. Otherwise, why would you be keeping them from us?  That's sort of a way to gin up their base against the president and against the Republicans. That's how I read what they did this morning.
