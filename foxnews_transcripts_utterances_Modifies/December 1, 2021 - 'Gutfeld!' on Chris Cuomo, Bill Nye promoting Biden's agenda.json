Following that logic, I better start building a trophy case tonight because I hate my guts. But as Chris is being dragged, we're missing the big picture. And I don't mean a photo of Brian Stelter's ass, strology sign. Chris is in trouble for supporting his brother. So he's a terrible journalist, but a hell of a brother.   But what's the media's excuse for doing the same thing? Hate him or not? Chris would any family member would do and broke whatever journalistic law CNN still observes in the process. Fire him, I guess. But if CNN fired everyone for violating basic journalism, their newsroom would be emptier than your medicine cabinet after Kat visits you. Anyway, if anything were to happen to a sibling or a child and your family, jerk or not, you probably do everything possible to help them out. Except maybe Jesse Watters' family. Kidnappers could mail them one of Jesse's fingers and they'd be like, hey, he's got nine more. But if I ever get busted for something, and my sisters don't help me bury the bodies, they are out of the will. Their loss is Cars for Kids gain. Seriously, what's the point of having relatives if they're going to rat you out about the body under all that venison you have in the freezer?  That's why Joe let Hunter run all those bribery schemes that and the 10 percent. So I get Chris, but the media, they don't have that excuse. They anointed his brother, the next president because they liked his press conferences. They're so easy to fool that Jussie Smollett wishes they were his jury. The media love the governor, and they weren't related except by ideology. Now the same people who say now that he should be fired, we're right there fawning over his brother as nursing home patients bodies were stacking up like sandbags, along a swollen riverbank.  They cared more about anti-sex life than investigating the nursing home calamity that was right in front of them. And it took sexual harassment to pique their curiosity. I get it. Sexual harassment is bad. If anyone's butt is getting slapped, it's my own. And I pay consenting adults dearly for that service. But it is interesting how the media prioritizes and how they happily disowned the very people they have protected for so long when it suits them. But for a while they were on Team Cuomo. Apparently top aides had been working the press to convince them to support the governor. And they did. In one case, Cuomo aides reached out to schmooze a writer for The Atlantic, who then quickly wrote a piece entitled, Of Course Andrew Cuomo Isn't Going To Resign. Well, that aged as well as Macaulay Culkin. Yes. Like you.",

They've unloaded fake news like it was free government cheese. James Clapper, it gets caught lying to Congress about intelligence. Then CNN hires him to analyze intelligence. The Russian collusion lie undermined every institution for years. Their attacks on police led to the defunding of cops contributing to violence that destroyed cities. They covered Florida when their COVID numbers spike, now that the lowest in America, they're quieter than Matt Lauer's work phone. They targeted Trumpers while coddling rioters.

This network had -- I would say a pretty extreme transparency when in an op ed, the executive producer talked about how she was groped by him. The same action that his brother is being prosecuted for under his own laws here in New York State, forcible touching. He admitted so in an email to her and yet the network looked the other way. So that kind of culpability combined with his brother, that us as New York residents, we've already paid $9.5 million for his legal fees. Chris Cuomo to me is just another fly in the ointment.

He also invited students to report him to his superiors if they felt discriminated against. Damn, why not just hand your execution or the X? So despite waving his wokester credentials, he got fired.

So, this policy could make you quarantine without COVID. It's an idea that's testing positive for being totally up. The new policy will apply to all foreign travelers as well as returning U.S. citizens regardless of their vax status.

But honestly, migrants are showed more compassion than our own citizens. It feels lousy. It's like the government is Bill Clinton, the immigrants are any other woman and we're Hillary.

Following that logic, I better start building a trophy case tonight because I hate my guts. But as Chris is being dragged, we're missing the big picture. And I don't mean a photo of Brian Stelter's ass, strology sign. Chris is in trouble for supporting his brother. So he's a terrible journalist, but a hell of a brother. But what's the media's excuse for doing the same thing? Hate him or not? Chris would any family member would do and broke whatever journalistic law CNN still observes in the process. Fire him, I guess. But if CNN fired everyone for violating basic journalism, their newsroom would be emptier than your medicine cabinet after Kat visits you. Anyway, if anything were to happen to a sibling or a child and your family, jerk or not, you probably do everything possible to help them out. Except maybe Jesse Watters' family. Kidnappers could mail them one of Jesse's fingers and they'd be like, hey, he's got nine more. But if I ever get busted for something, and my sisters don't help me bury the bodies, they are out of the will. Their loss is Cars for Kids gain. Seriously, what's the point of having relatives if they're going to rat you out about the body under all that venison you have in the freezer? That's why Joe let Hunter run all those bribery schemes that and the 10 percent. So I get Chris, but the media, they don't have that excuse. They anointed his brother, the next president because they liked his press conferences. They're so easy to fool that Jussie Smollett wishes they were his jury. The media love the governor, and they weren't related except by ideology. Now the same people who say now that he should be fired, we're right there fawning over his brother as nursing home patients bodies were stacking up like sandbags, along a swollen riverbank. They cared more about anti-sex life than investigating the nursing home calamity that was right in front of them. And it took sexual harassment to pique their curiosity. I get it. Sexual harassment is bad. If anyone's butt is getting slapped, it's my own. And I pay consenting adults dearly for that service. But it is interesting how the media prioritizes and how they happily disowned the very people they have protected for so long when it suits them. But for a while they were on Team Cuomo. Apparently top aides had been working the press to convince them to support the governor. And they did. In one case, Cuomo aides reached out to schmooze a writer for The Atlantic, who then quickly wrote a piece entitled, Of Course Andrew Cuomo Isn't Going To Resign. Well, that aged as well as Macaulay Culkin. Yes. Like you."

They've unloaded fake news like it was free government cheese. James Clapper, it gets caught lying to Congress about intelligence. Then CNN hires him to analyze intelligence. The Russian collusion lie undermined every institution for years. Their attacks on police led to the defunding of cops contributing to violence that destroyed cities. They covered Florida when their COVID numbers spike, now that the lowest in America, they're quieter than Matt Lauer's work phone. They targeted Trumpers while coddling rioters.

CNN comes out when they suspend him indefinitely with the statement that says, we now understand the extent of his involvement for these documents with his brother. Really because meanwhile back in May, Chris Cuomo said on air, he admitted that he broke the network's rules and advising his brother in public relations. This network had -- I would say a pretty extreme transparency when in an op ed, the executive producer talked about how she was groped by him. The same action that his brother is being prosecuted for under his own laws here in New York State, forcible touching. He admitted so in an email to her and yet the network looked the other way. So that kind of culpability combined with his brother, that us as New York residents, we've already paid $9.5 million for his legal fees. Chris Cuomo to me is just another fly in the ointment. But to your point, I mean, I think that's generous of you to want to extend him due process. I think at this point, we should just vigilante justice him."

After Professor Christopher Trogan mixed up the two students' names, they e-mailed him saying they felt disrespected. Believing the mix up happened because of their race. In response, he sent an e-mail to the entire class. It's stupid. And then he assured students his class was \"Centered specifically and explicitly around issues of justice, equality and inclusion.\" And that he devoted his entire life to such issues.

So, this policy could make you quarantine without COVID. It's an idea that's testing positive for being totally up. The new policy will apply to all foreign travelers as well as returning U.S. citizens regardless of their vax status. So far, the Biden administration has not indicated that the new strident policy will apply to illegals crossing the southern border. They'll have to ask Kamala the next time she emerges from hiding. But honestly, migrants are showed more compassion than our own citizens. It feels lousy. It's like the government is Bill Clinton, the immigrants are any other woman and we're Hillary. No wonder she's angry. But it's important to put Omicron into perspective.

So, you arrive and you're supposed to -- one country was 14 days, one country was seven days, and you supposed to do this. Now, I will say that my observation was most people paid no attention whatsoever to the self-quarantine, they arrived back in country and you know, they were often doing their own business and not staying at home or staying in a hotel. So, I'm not sure about the effectiveness of it. And then that question is OK, well, if you're going to enforce it now, what does that bring into play?"

For more, we go to a woman whose family says they are sick of having to pick her up from jail every December 26th for the things she does during her Christmas Day blackouts."
