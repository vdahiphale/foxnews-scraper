When one hysterical hoax collapses, they create another like they're a rotten chef constantly attempting a souffle and failing. But there's a reason why the press can't cover this story. Because if they cover it, they end up having to cover their own cover up. It's a lot of work.

They go back to the Rogan buffet and fill up on the same old hysterics. They've just replaced Trump with Joe. The good news. Even Dems see through this. According to one poll, pile of Dems want to see Hillary investigated if only to stop her from running for president every four years until 2084. Roughly three out of four of those polls said they think it's important that prosecutors investigate Clinton for her role in Russiagate. That includes 66 percent of Dems. So you think the media who caters to Democrats like their royalty would embrace this story since so many Democrats want to know more? But they can't because it calls into question the last six years of their bogus (BLEEP) it exposes their corruption. Turns out the Trump-Russian collusion story was just a deflection from the Hillary-Russian collusion story. It's a terrific strategy really. When you're afraid of being accused of being unfaithful, just accuse your partner first. When someone's on the defensive, it's just harder for them to come after you for real crimes. That's true. The Russian story, the everyone is racist story, the all cops are bastards narrative and the COVID story. Remember when it was racist to be for the travel ban? Each example to flex from something similar and awful that the left is doing. It's the Russian case. In the Russian case, they went hog wild for years creating accusations conflict in anger. Think of the strife, the emotional costs, not to mention Trump supporters being targeted just because their guy won. Of course there needs to be a trial but no doubt it will be ignored by the same nincompoops. Yes, I use that word. Who drooled every time Robert Mueller broke wind. And you can forget this guy? Do you think he'll say it's worse than Watergate?",

Of course, the story barely merits aside because so many journalists made money, got promotions, landed cushy jobs because of Russiagate. It was CNN's bread and butter for years. If you don't believe me, look at Stelter's waistline. So now we've learned that this is way worse than just spying. Some might say it's a conspiracy to destroy a presidency. An actual threat to democracy. But those some don't work at the networks that caused this very mess. Or they might say this it's indeed worse than January 6, because it helped justify it.",

They're getting close to indictments, and they will indict. People are now giving information. They've got an organized criminal enterprise. This is a fraud against the United States government. They not only tried to surveil a campaign, but actually had some kind of surveillance in the White House. I mean, this is -- this is an outrageous scenario.

Even Ellen DeGeneres who took hers off only so she could spit on foreign and former employees and foreign ones. That's not true. She's a delightful person. We're getting brunch tomorrow. It's almost like people are realizing this safety theater was just that theater, except the actors in the show no longer want to play their roles. The city health department repeatedly noted that all attendees would be required to wear a mask inside the stadium. They even gave up upgraded KN- 95 masks. Perfect for when you want to cheer and soak in your own drool. But none complied clearly, and they shouldn't have to wear masks except it makes them all hypocrites. When you consider the fact that kids in California still left a mask up in school. And the kids will have to still wear masks even after California's mandate is lifted on Tuesday. I guess the feeling is, if they were attractive, their parents could afford private school. Am I right? But it raises a question with their faces covered. How will the kids learn to judge each other by race? I bet the left did not think of that. Did they? So, Chadwick, may I call you Chadwick?",

Meanwhile, terrified women are in full retreat because D.A.s won't keep the crazies off the streets. Last week, a Salt Lake City woman was attacked by a homeless man after letting him inside her apartment to shower. The police responded to the scene to find the woman in critical condition, bleeding profusely from her throat which was slit by the psycho that she tried to help. Thankfully doctors were able to save her life. The suspect was found a few days later not far from the scene. Now, that was Salt Lake, far from places like L.A. or Manhattan. Speaking of Manhattan, another woman was also attacked in an apartment by a homeless lunatic. Authorities found her bloodied body in the bathtub having been stabbed to death. The guy who did it was you guessed it, a career criminal out on bail, who appears to have secretly followed the woman inside. The victim's landlord blames New York's woke, D.A. Alvin, nothing to brag about, Bragg, in his soft on crime policies that allowed unhinged repeat offenders to continue roaming the streets. So, let's recap. The murderer, the homeless male, check, a career criminal, check. Out on the streets with multiple open cases, check; the murder victim, a female, check. The murder victim Asian, check. Murder weapon, a knife and not a product of gun violence, check. So, how many more of these do you need? Crime rates keep rising, and the most frequent victims are women and people of color.

So it turns out Hillary does know how a server works except for the one that kept her e-mails and a bathroom closet.

They go back to the Rogan buffet and fill up on the same old hysterics. They've just replaced Trump with Joe. The good news. Even Dems see through this. According to one poll, pile of Dems want to see Hillary investigated if only to stop her from running for president every four years until 2084. Roughly three out of four of those polls said they think it's important that prosecutors investigate Clinton for her role in Russiagate. That includes 66 percent of Dems. So you think the media who caters to Democrats like their royalty would embrace this story since so many Democrats want to know more? But they can't because it calls into question the last six years of their bogus (BLEEP) it exposes their corruption. Turns out the Trump-Russian collusion story was just a deflection from the Hillary-Russian collusion story. It's a terrific strategy really. When you're afraid of being accused of being unfaithful, just accuse your partner first. When someone's on the defensive, it's just harder for them to come after you for real crimes. That's true. The Russian story, the everyone is racist story, the all cops are bastards narrative and the COVID story. Remember when it was racist to be for the travel ban? Each example to flex from something similar and awful that the left is doing. It's the Russian case. In the Russian case, they went hog wild for years creating accusations conflict in anger. Think of the strife, the emotional costs, not to mention Trump supporters being targeted just because their guy won. Of course there needs to be a trial but no doubt it will be ignored by the same nincompoops. Yes, I use that word. Who drooled every time Robert Mueller broke wind. And you can forget this guy?

If you don't believe me, look at Stelter's waistline. So now we've learned that this is way worse than just spying. Some might say it's a conspiracy to destroy a presidency. An actual threat to democracy. But those some don't work at the networks that caused this very mess. Or they might say this it's indeed worse than January 6, because it helped justify it."

Meanwhile, terrified women are in full retreat because D.A.s won't keep the crazies off the streets. Last week, a Salt Lake City woman was attacked by a homeless man after letting him inside her apartment to shower. The police responded to the scene to find the woman in critical condition, bleeding profusely from her throat which was slit by the psycho that she tried to help. Thankfully doctors were able to save her life. The suspect was found a few days later not far from the scene. Now, that was Salt Lake, far from places like L.A. or Manhattan. Speaking of Manhattan, another woman was also attacked in an apartment by a homeless lunatic. Authorities found her bloodied body in the bathtub having been stabbed to death. The guy who did it was you guessed it, a career criminal out on bail, who appears to have secretly followed the woman inside. The victim's landlord blames New York's woke, D.A. Alvin, nothing to brag about, Bragg, in his soft on crime policies that allowed unhinged repeat offenders to continue roaming the streets. So, let's recap. The murderer, the homeless male, check, a career criminal, check. Out on the streets with multiple open cases, check; the murder victim, a female, check. The murder victim Asian, check. Murder weapon, a knife and not a product of gun violence, check. So, how many more of these do you need? Crime rates keep rising, and the most frequent victims are women and people of color. But if you ask the media, today's most pressing issue is taking down podcast hosts."

They'll get a room next to the ice machine for old times' sake. Last week, Hudson officials announced that they decided to allow ice fishing on the lake anyway.

My intent, \"my intent to inject a bit of dry humor to make a point about this, in the midst of a cold, snowy February was grossly misunderstood.\" But maybe he's right. Maybe ice fishing does lead to prostitution. Because when you think about it, all really miserable hobbies are just there to keep you from calling a hooker. Why do you think they invented books?

And I'm sure that there, there's a lot to make fun of with all Joe, like the ice cream. Hey, look, I eat a lot of ice cream and you know things like that. It's going to be a lot of fun. I think most of these guys are going to be nice. If they're not, we'll just call it misinformation. I'll get Jen Psaki and open up a file on you with Homeland Security, call you a domestic terrorist.
