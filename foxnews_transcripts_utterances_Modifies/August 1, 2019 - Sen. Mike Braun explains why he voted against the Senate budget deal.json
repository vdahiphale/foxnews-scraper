      "sentences": "Trade war on, stocks off a lot, as the president prepares to take off for a big rally tonight in Ohio, but he's taking reporters' questions as we speak. Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto.  And, this time, it wasn't the Fed. It was the prez. Yesterday's sell-off blamed on a Federal Reserve chairman who the president says didn't cut rates enough, today's on a president who, when it comes to rattling China trade talks, did more than enough.  Via a tweet, President Trump promising new tariffs on China that rocked the corner of Wall and Broad within minutes. Stocks reversed what had been a healthy triple-digit gain. Triple-digit losses ended up being the result, and all because the president was upping the trade ante with China, promising to slap 10 percent tariffs on another $300 billion worth of Chinese goods.  Now, that is in addition to the 25 percent tariffs already in effect on virtually all other Chinese goods. So, come September 1, that means that tariffs will be in effect on pretty much everything we get from China.  Stocks weren't the only thing tanking in the face of this tougher trade war. So was oil, on the prospect that global demand could slide right along with the global economy, which is why interest rates started tumbling, and the dollar started tumbling. And one of the few havens in times of a crisis, gold, well, those prices was soaring.  So time to start connecting.   We begin with FOX Business' Ed Lawrence and what got everything going. Hey, Edward.",

Now, we have learned from Chinese sources within the last half-hour or so the meeting in Shanghai didn't go well between the two trade teams. In fact, the Chinese sources are telling us that China said they will not add in any of the concession language that they had taken out of the agreement. Now, the Chinese telling us the U.S. trade representative -- or telling the U.S. trade representative that the U.S. needs to just trust them, that they will protect intellectual property without enforcement provisions. Now, within China, the departments have been given the directive to start decoupling from the United States, so China no longer has to rely on U.S. products. That can be seen in an agreement they made with Russia basically helping the Russian soybean industry, meeting the demand of the Chinese.  Now, this is what the president is reacting to by these tariffs, announcing 10 percent tariff on basically the rest of what China imports into the United States. Now, these tariffs will affect more of what you buy. We're talking about pantyhose or stockings to alarm clocks and watches to roller skates.   This is a hard line from the White House. It's getting an immediate response from Democrats, actually support from those Democrats. Listen.",

And China has had a rough 20 -- this is their worst year in 27 years, according to yesterday's Wall Street Journal. I don't want that. But when my people came home, they said we're talking.

After that briefing, that is when we got the statement that was put out on Twitter by the president, in which he said that China is not living up to its to its expectations to have an ag buy from the U.S., that China is not slowing down the sale of fentanyl that is making its way into this country and killing people all across the country. And the president said he was disappointed with President Xi about it. And that's also when the president announced that, come September 1, which should be days before the next meeting of the trade teams of the United States and China here in Washington, that the next batch, that $300 billion worth of goods, will have a 10 percent tariff attached to it. What we just heard from the president just now is a reminder that it'll be at 10 percent for the moment, but it could go up, could potentially go higher than 10 percent. And, as you mentioned, there's also that $250 billion that is currently at 25 percent. So, essentially, all U.S. goods or goods coming from China into the U.S. will now face this tariff, and now will face tariffs at least of some kind. And according to my colleague at the FOX Business Network Edward Lawrence, Chinese sources are telling us that the directive in Beijing now is to -- quote, unquote -- \"decouple' from reliance on the U.S. You start to add all of this up, Neil, including the comments that we heard from the president now for days that maybe China is trying to wait him out, trying to wait out his presidency, and you have got to wonder where things go from here -- Neil.",

I have said all along, however, that the president was right to take on China. As has now recently been proven again, China doesn't keep his word -- or their word. China cheats when it comes to trade. And we have to take them on. I think the president did, however, make a mistake when he began all this by not engaging our allies, and taking China on in a unilateral fashion. This makes it easier for China to retaliate. And then, finally, let's be clear. One of the reasons that nobody wins a trade war is that a tariff is a tax. And that tax is paid by American companies and American consumers. And it's already hurting the U.S. economy. And that's, I think, why you see some market jitters, because this is not going to be good for the U.S. economy. But it's complicated. Let's give the president credit for taking them on.  But let's hope that he can get it right and engage our allies and actually change Chinese behavior.",

I'm Neil Cavuto. And, this time, it wasn't the Fed. It was the prez. Yesterday's sell-off blamed on a Federal Reserve chairman who the president says didn't cut rates enough, today's on a president who, when it comes to rattling China trade talks, did more than enough. Via a tweet, President Trump promising new tariffs on China that rocked the corner of Wall and Broad within minutes. Stocks reversed what had been a healthy triple-digit gain. Triple-digit losses ended up being the result, and all because the president was upping the trade ante with China, promising to slap 10 percent tariffs on another $300 billion worth of Chinese goods. Now, that is in addition to the 25 percent tariffs already in effect on virtually all other Chinese goods. So, come September 1, that means that tariffs will be in effect on pretty much everything we get from China. Stocks weren't the only thing tanking in the face of this tougher trade war. So was oil, on the prospect that global demand could slide right along with the global economy, which is why interest rates started tumbling, and the dollar started tumbling. And one of the few havens in times of a crisis, gold, well, those prices was soaring. So time to start connecting. We begin with FOX Business' Ed Lawrence and what got everything going. Hey, Edward."

Now, we have learned from Chinese sources within the last half-hour or so the meeting in Shanghai didn't go well between the two trade teams. In fact, the Chinese sources are telling us that China said they will not add in any of the concession language that they had taken out of the agreement. Now, the Chinese telling us the U.S. trade representative -- or telling the U.S. trade representative that the U.S. needs to just trust them, that they will protect intellectual property without enforcement provisions. Now, within China, the departments have been given the directive to start decoupling from the United States, so China no longer has to rely on U.S. products. That can be seen in an agreement they made with Russia basically helping the Russian soybean industry, meeting the demand of the Chinese. Now, this is what the president is reacting to by these tariffs, announcing 10 percent tariff on basically the rest of what China imports into the United States. Now, these tariffs will affect more of what you buy. We're talking about pantyhose or stockings to alarm clocks and watches to roller skates. This is a hard line from the White House. It's getting an immediate response from Democrats, actually support from those Democrats. Listen."

Now, they may break up a little bit here in the short run. But I think what's happening is, you are going to have a tremendous amount of debt right now. And when you have that much debt, it's really hard to push things higher.

So does he have -- what's his deadline? Is it by March of next year that he has to get this together? I think, listen, the U.S. stock market is $34 trillion in equity value.  The U.S. economy is $22 trillion. Is this $300 billion a drop in the bucket? Can it weather it? That's the question mark.

We've taxed China on $300 billion worth of goods and products being sold into our country. And China eats it because they have to pay it, because what they do is they devalue their currency and they push money out. Our people haven't paid. As you know, we're also charging them 25 percent on $250 billion. So we're taking in many billions of dollars. There's been absolutely no inflation. And, frankly, it hasn't cost our consumer anything. It costs China. Now, what has happened is a lot of companies are moving out of China so they can, you know, avoid. And China has had a rough 20 -- this is their worst year in 27 years, according to yesterday's Wall Street Journal. I don't want that. But when my people came home, they said we're talking. We have another meeting in early September. I said, that's fine. But in the meantime, until such time as there's a deal, we'll be taxing them. We're just getting -- and we're getting very good numbers from the border, the 21,000 soldiers supplied by Mexico. And I want to thank Mexico.  They're doing a great job. The numbers are way down at the border."

But I'm very happy the way it is right now. My people came back. They're going to meet again in September. I said, look, if you meet, that's great.  But in the meantime, we're going to pay -- they're going to pay a tariff, and it'll be a very substantial tariff. Now, if you remember, when I did the 25 percent, I did it in stages. And this can also be lifted, ultimately, in stages, or it can be taken off.  But it can be lifted in stages. So we're starting at 10 percent, and it can be lifted up to well beyond 25 percent. But we're not looking to do that necessarily. But this would be done in stages. So I put on 10 percent on 300 -- it's approximately $300 billion. We already have a 25 percent tariff on the first $250 billion. So, the 10 percent follows the $250 billion at 25 percent."

But maybe at some point we'll get together and we'll get it straightened out.  But what happened in Baltimore is disgraceful. And it's not only Baltimore. It's other Democrat-run cities, and you ought to report on it some time. Thank you. He's heading out to Ohio for a campaign event tonight. Just real quickly, on this ongoing trade tiff that's turned into an outright war with the Chinese, the president effectively announcing today that, come September 1, $300 billion worth of goods we get from China will be slapped with a 10 percent tariff, on top of the $252 billion to $265 billion dollars worth of goods that already have a 25 percent tariff on them. What that would essentially mean is everything that we get from China will eventually be subject to a tariff. The president hoping to move the needle on the Chinese on the talks. But he says that he's in no rush, says this is the right thing to do. But it did surprise a lot of folks and prompted what had been a triple- digit advance of the markets into a triple-digit tumult. Blake Burman at the White House with the very, very latest. Blake, where do we stand on all of this?"

      "speaker": "BLAKE BURMAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "I think it's a good reminder, Neil, as you just said, that we are indeed in the middle of a trade war right now between the United States and China. Let me just sort of walk you through how everything shook out today.  Earlier today, here at the White House, there was a meeting. The president was briefed by his team that was over in Shanghai earlier this week about the discussions there, briefed by Steve Mnuchin, Robert Lighthizer, other members of the economic team. After that briefing, that is when we got the statement that was put out on Twitter by the president, in which he said that China is not living up to its to its expectations to have an ag buy from the U.S., that China is not slowing down the sale of fentanyl that is making its way into this country and killing people all across the country. And the president said he was disappointed with President Xi about it. And that's also when the president announced that, come September 1, which should be days before the next meeting of the trade teams of the United States and China here in Washington, that the next batch, that $300 billion worth of goods, will have a 10 percent tariff attached to it. What we just heard from the president just now is a reminder that it'll be at 10 percent for the moment, but it could go up, could potentially go higher than 10 percent. And, as you mentioned, there's also that $250 billion that is currently at 25 percent. So, essentially, all U.S. goods or goods coming from China into the U.S. will now face this tariff, and now will face tariffs at least of some kind. And according to my colleague at the FOX Business Network Edward Lawrence, Chinese sources are telling us that the directive in Beijing now is to -- quote, unquote -- \"decouple' from reliance on the U.S. You start to add all of this up, Neil, including the comments that we heard from the president now for days that maybe China is trying to wait him out, trying to wait out his presidency, and you have got to wonder where things go from here -- Neil."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "REP. DAN KILDEE (D-MI)",
      "utterance": "Well, nobody wins a trade war. I think we have pretty well established that during the course of recent history. I have said all along, however, that the president was right to take on China. As has now recently been proven again, China doesn't keep his word -- or their word. China cheats when it comes to trade. And we have to take them on. I think the president did, however, make a mistake when he began all this by not engaging our allies, and taking China on in a unilateral fashion. This makes it easier for China to retaliate. And then, finally, let's be clear. One of the reasons that nobody wins a trade war is that a tariff is a tax. And that tax is paid by American companies and American consumers. And it's already hurting the U.S. economy. And that's, I think, why you see some market jitters, because this is not going to be good for the U.S. economy. But it's complicated. Let's give the president credit for taking them on.  But let's hope that he can get it right and engage our allies and actually change Chinese behavior."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "KILDEE",
      "utterance": "Well, I mean, I think -- honestly, I think the Fed has done a good job over both administrations, recent administrations, in helping to do their part to manage the economy. And I think they're doing essentially the right thing. I think Mr. Powell has been responsible. It is worrisome, though, that they now have seen the need to reduce the Fed rate. They only have so much room to go down. And that's one of the reasons that I know that Chairman Powell has been really reluctant to go in that direction, because you get to a certain point, and your tools are taken away. But it is an indication that there is some weakening in the U.S. economy when the Fed sees the need to lower the rate."

      "speaker": "KILDEE",
      "utterance": "Yes, I think it would be a mistake to simply walk away. I do think, though, the president needs to consider a different approach.  And while he's on the phone with Mr. Putin -- I know he engages with world leaders on a regular basis. When he's doing that, I think he would be wise to ask them to join us in taking on China. We're not the only country that suffers because of the bad practices that China employs. They have a lot more patience than we do. So we have to find other tactics. And I think it would be a mistake to walk away. But what we're seeing right now is simply ratcheting up unilaterally against China with increased tariffs is a tax on American companies and consumers. And the Chinese just have more patience than we do. So we're going to have to engage our allies to try to have much greater heft in dealing with them."

We do get normally left kind of holding the bag on explaining about government shutdowns and all the things that go along with trying to hold the line on spending. And I'm just hoping -- been here seven months now -- that, when we win in November of 2020, we remember the roots of what conservatism is about. And that's not running trillion-dollar deficits on a budget that's our size year after year, when we got all this debt. So, hopefully, it's a wakeup call. I'm going to keep saying the same thing. And I was glad at least 22 others stood in line to make a strong statement."

He's in now the reality of D.C., to where, when you have been doing this for so long, it just gets to be part of the system. And I hope, because I will be mentioning to the administration, leadership in the Senate, we can't keep doing it. We're going to lose credibility with the core of who supports us. And it's not people that look at this kind of behavior to where you say the same thing every year, and never change it. So it's up to those of us that are new. I know Governor Rick Scott from Florida, Mitt Romney. We're the three new business guys in the Senate. We have doubled the Business Caucus. Maybe voters need to send more of us here. We know how to do a budget, make a payroll, make the hard decisions."

      "speaker": "BRAUN",

I voted against the defense reauthorization bill out of principle, because how do we expect to ever hold the Democrats accountable when we hold defense as because sacrosanct? Believe me, there's waste and ways to cut 1 percent or freeze it until we get back in order.

And you need to rely on so many different types of intelligence in order to confirm. And we want to make sure we confirm he's dead. We don't want to say stuff -- like the Russians said Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of ISIS, was dead, and then he resurfaces. We don't want something like this to happen. And it's so significant because if -- I mean, he is more than likely dead, but if he's dead, that kind of wipes out the future leadership of Al Qaeda, because he was more of a millennial generation. He's a 30-year-old. Ayman al-Zawahri, who's the chief of Al Qaeda now, is a lot older. He's pushing 70, maybe in his 70s. And he just didn't have the charisma or the name or even the ability to kind of stick his neck out, for lack of a better term, to get out there and threaten. And Hamza was -- he was the new -- the new, you know, leader of Al Qaeda, leader of the caliphate."

And we did find Khalid bin Laden. And we -- some of my guys were able to kill him in a gunfight. And then his brother -- I believe it was Saad bin Laden -- was killed in a drone strike a couple years prior. And then Hamza wasn't in the building. But we found intelligence in the compound in Abbottabad in 2001 that said Usama bin Laden wanted Hamza to come up to be groomed because he was the most charismatic, and like his father, Usama bin Laden, very charismatic. His people loved him. And he felt the same way about Hamza. And he was going to push Al Qaeda into the future. And, hopefully, we can confirm this. We will be able to eventually, but it takes a lot of intelligence, signal intelligence, human intelligence."

Frankly, what the people coming to these events are looking for is a shot in the arm to the base, a message of patriotism from this president. And, frankly, with a president that's got a unique set of skills at the podium and in front of the camera, they're looking to be entertained. Coming on the heels of the debate, they're looking for the needle the Democrats. Now, Ohio is a red state, but Hamilton County, where we are now, is a deep blue county.
