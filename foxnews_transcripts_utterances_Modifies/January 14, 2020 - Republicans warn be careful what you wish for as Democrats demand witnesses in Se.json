I will be watching Hannity, though. And thirdly, she wants to handcuff Bernie and Liz Warren in the swamp while her favorite candidate, Joe Biden, gets to roam free and close by himself in Iowa. Now, all of those reasons are purely partisan, political reasons. They have nothing to do with fulfilling her duty to carry out her constitutional duty to check and balance the president of the United States. But we knew that, all right? Now, if I were a Republican in the Senate, I would say no witnesses. The House had its chance. That is not our job to do witnesses. Plus, it was a radically unfair deal in the House. You're not going to get that fairness from us. And if you guys want to roll the dice on witnesses, I think there is more of a risk for Democrats then there are Republicans. Because you know they're going to acquit the president. But what you don't know is what's going to come out of the testimony under oath from, I don't know, where is Hunter, or how about the whistle-blower, or Shifty Schiff, or to Chalupa (ph), our friend Chalupa (ph).

You know, about a six day process. So I think we're looking at two weeks. I would say this. I don't think that you can any longer underestimate Nancy Pelosi. Yes, there were stories, including stories about Democrats rousing about Pelosi and delaying the transmission of the articles. But I think what you said is right. Clearly now, there's a tremendous focus on the Republicans on admitting witnesses and documents and having a full trial. There is not going to be any speedy acquittal, which was initially what the White House and Senator Mitch McConnell, the Senate Majority Leader, were thinking about. And I would say Hunter Biden.

It's like summer vacation. You've got to get the kids back in school. So they're going to try to make this hiccup into a heart attack with their rhetoric. And what I resent -- and I'm going to betray my own weakness here, Dana. I resent that the Democrats in the media are playing the tune and making us dance. We have to dance to this tune. This is not a story. The media is like a drunken cowboy firing its six shooters at our feet, saying dance, dance. And so we have to dance and we have to pretend that this is real. We know that this is an emotional exercise to score points against Trump. We know that's all it is. The Dems -- look, I get it, and the person giving the advice to the Democrats, they're basically going through a wedding even though all signs point to divorce. We know how this is going to end. Trump is going to maintain his presidency. And he is going to redefine impeachment as a badge of honor. And I'm trying to tell the Democrats, this is going to hurt you. It's going to hurt you, but they don't listen. And why don't they listen? I will tell you why, Dana. Sunk costs, sunk costs are the investment in something that you don't get back, right? In a relationship, you stay with a bad relationship because of a sunk cost. You stay at a job forever because of a sunk cost, because you feel like you can't leave. That is what impeachment is to them. It's an emotional investment that they are seeing as a real investment, so they can't abandon all that work. When they should just step back and go, you know what, we won. We poked daddy in the eye with impeachment. We can move on. But they're not. They're going to chase this thing down.

And you have to go all the way back to the bathroom. So no one cares. No one is going to remember this. And by the way, this is the Senate's, however, opportunity to show a measured, impartial response that the House theatrics were anything but.

Third, find common ground by blaming Trump, because you know he is evil despite doing more for minorities than the clowns running against him like Sanders. It is hard not to love this. Watch the crocodile that is identity politics eat the party that fed it for years, relegating candidates to warring collections of traits and grievances. Each and now buys for the most oppressed.

Look at Cory Booker, Stanford grad, Rhodes Scholar, Yale Law, pro-school choice in the city where Democrats demolished public education. But even in his exit, he made it about identity. They didn't lose Cory Booker, no. They lost the black guy. At some point, the Dems must realize that America is about unity, not difference. Trump got that.

And she turns around and, A, rats him out, and it is obvious with it. So we see her as desperate. And B, it's quite plausible him denying it. I didn't say a woman couldn't win. Like, you know me. Tulsi even -- did you guys see, came out today and she said I had that same candid conversation with Bernie. And he showed me the greatest respect and encouragement that he is known for. So I think he and his camp is -- again, that plausible deniability, he is not that kind of guy that would hell no. Women couldn't win. Like, of course, he is not going to. And then I think the third thing, there was a person in Iowa actually that was quoted that I think summed up this. She's just a random voter. But the issue with Bernie supporters is that they get the sense that it's Bernie or no one.

What does that mean for this exact investigation? What I want to know is the specific questions that the FBI has that they're not responding to. Because at this point, we just have someone saying I asked for this, I asked for help, and Apple says we gave it to you. What does that mean for the investigation for our safety moving forward?

You got to go in and attack a deeper structure which is they do business with people like them and people, they've known, and people who have their track record. It's not the case that women can't direct film. That's not the case that minorities can't act. I mean, it's crazy, but it's not the Oscars per se, it's the system. So I think you're right.",

She wanted to squeeze concessions out of McConnell and frame the thing as rigged. She wanted to make sure the Democrats could participate at the debate tonight on CNN. I will be watching Hannity, though. And thirdly, she wants to handcuff Bernie and Liz Warren in the swamp while her favorite candidate, Joe Biden, gets to roam free and close by himself in Iowa. Now, all of those reasons are purely partisan, political reasons. They have nothing to do with fulfilling her duty to carry out her constitutional duty to check and balance the president of the United States. But we knew that, all right? Now, if I were a Republican in the Senate, I would say no witnesses. The House had its chance. That is not our job to do witnesses. Plus, it was a radically unfair deal in the House. You're not going to get that fairness from us. And if you guys want to roll the dice on witnesses, I think there is more of a risk for Democrats then there are Republicans. Because you know they're going to acquit the president. But what you don't know is what's going to come out of the testimony under oath from, I don't know, where is Hunter, or how about the whistle-blower, or Shifty Schiff, or to Chalupa (ph), our friend Chalupa (ph). So anything could come out of that, which could bury the Biden which could expose the hoax from the get- go. And I don't think a Bolton testimony hurts the president at all."

And two, the selection of managers in terms of who's going to actually argue the case and how it's going to done apparently along the lines of how it was done during the Clinton impeachment. You know, about a six day process. So I think we're looking at two weeks. I would say this. I don't think that you can any longer underestimate Nancy Pelosi. Yes, there were stories, including stories about Democrats rousing about Pelosi and delaying the transmission of the articles. But I think what you said is right. Clearly now, there's a tremendous focus on the Republicans on admitting witnesses and documents and having a full trial. There is not going to be any speedy acquittal, which was initially what the White House and Senator Mitch McConnell, the Senate Majority Leader, were thinking about. And I would say Hunter Biden. He will never be a witness. You know why? Because the moderate Republicans, who are now, I think, starting to assert themselves because of Nancy Pelosi --"

Look, viewers need to be aware that the media is going to turn up the flame on the rhetoric because of the problem you stated before, that there has been this lapse in time. It's like summer vacation. You've got to get the kids back in school. So they're going to try to make this hiccup into a heart attack with their rhetoric. And what I resent -- and I'm going to betray my own weakness here, Dana. I resent that the Democrats in the media are playing the tune and making us dance. We have to dance to this tune. This is not a story. The media is like a drunken cowboy firing its six shooters at our feet, saying dance, dance. And so we have to dance and we have to pretend that this is real. We know that this is an emotional exercise to score points against Trump. We know that's all it is. The Dems -- look, I get it, and the person giving the advice to the Democrats, they're basically going through a wedding even though all signs point to divorce. We know how this is going to end. Trump is going to maintain his presidency. And he is going to redefine impeachment as a badge of honor. And I'm trying to tell the Democrats, this is going to hurt you. It's going to hurt you, but they don't listen. And why don't they listen? I will tell you why, Dana. Sunk costs, sunk costs are the investment in something that you don't get back, right? In a relationship, you stay with a bad relationship because of a sunk cost. You stay at a job forever because of a sunk cost, because you feel like you can't leave. That is what impeachment is to them. It's an emotional investment that they are seeing as a real investment, so they can't abandon all that work. When they should just step back and go, you know what, we won. We poked daddy in the eye with impeachment. We can move on. But they're not. They're going to chase this thing down. It's going to hurt them and it's going to reel (ph) like Trump."

And then I fell like the problem with your analogy for the injured reserve, is that unlike the impeachment trial, everyone cares about the football game. We want that guy to come play. Everyone wants to know what is happening. With this, no, we don't. So this is like, to me, when you get all geared up to go skiing and then you have on your 60 layers and get -- you almost get to the chairlift and then you have to go to the bathroom. And you have to go all the way back to the bathroom. So no one cares. No one is going to remember this. And by the way, this is the Senate's, however, opportunity to show a measured, impartial response that the House theatrics were anything but. And if the impeachment managers from the House are the media horrors we know them to be, they continue to be this circus. They're going to attempt to by using that rhetoric especially, but hopefully the senators will stay away from that."

For anybody to say that a woman can't win doesn't make sense. Hillary Clinton won 300 million more votes than Donald Trump did in the last election. So there's some wires crossed here. But clearly, Bernie Sanders did not say that a woman could not win. It was a discussion about Trump, misogyny, sexism, and politics, and the difficulty of running in the era of Trump for women, the special challenges that women face in the era of Trump. But, you know, those conversations can sometimes get misconstrued."

First screw (ph) qualification, focus on skin color or gender, for that protective bubble of grievance. Second, always use the worst interpretation of a person's intent. If someone says they don't eat brown M&Ms they must be racist. So misconstrue and deny good faith. Without both, you have no bigotry. Third, find common ground by blaming Trump, because you know he is evil despite doing more for minorities than the clowns running against him like Sanders. It is hard not to love this. Watch the crocodile that is identity politics eat the party that fed it for years, relegating candidates to warring collections of traits and grievances. Each and now buys for the most oppressed. But since they already smeared half the country, the only people left to destroy are themselves. So it's not a fight between left and right, but Libs, who now see there is no escape from their mindless, angry peers. Look at Cory Booker, Stanford grad, Rhodes Scholar, Yale Law, pro-school choice in the city where Democrats demolished public education. But even in his exit, he made it about identity. They didn't lose Cory Booker, no. They lost the black guy. At some point, the Dems must realize that America is about unity, not difference. Trump got that. And the only way to beat him for his opponents to do the same thing, which means four more years of Trump. All right, Juan, let's do a little quiz --"

That he was saying to her Trump is a bully, a sexist, and it's got to be hard for a woman to beat him. And look at what happened with Hillary last time. Or you could have her saying, what I'm hearing you tell me, Mr. Sanders is that a woman can't beat Donald Trump.

And they start talking, as Juan said, X's and O's, didn't have a great success running Hillary against Trump last time. Trump may match up better against a woman for a certain reason.

Because the reality of that situation is probably actually how you described, which is a reality, X's and O's conversation, where he maybe he said something to the effect that look, I'm not sure if this will -- you're spit-balling, discussing. And she turns around and, A, rats him out, and it is obvious with it. So we see her as desperate. And B, it's quite plausible him denying it. I didn't say a woman couldn't win. Like, you know me. Tulsi even -- did you guys see, came out today and she said I had that same candid conversation with Bernie. And he showed me the greatest respect and encouragement that he is known for. So I think he and his camp is -- again, that plausible deniability, he is not that kind of guy that would hell no. Women couldn't win. Like, of course, he is not going to. And then I think the third thing, there was a person in Iowa actually that was quoted that I think summed up this. She's just a random voter. But the issue with Bernie supporters is that they get the sense that it's Bernie or no one. But with Elizabeth Warren that there's a broader coalition that they believe that bigger coalition might have the possibility and the propensity to actually galvanize more people. And then that will get them eventually that win. So that is the other side of that coin."

We call on Apple and other technology companies to help us find a solution so that we can better protect the lives of American people and prevent future attacks."

Our responses is to their many requests since the attack have been timely, thorough, and are ongoing.\" So I'm curious about this one, Dana. Because Apple designs their phones so no one can get into it. There is no backdoor. But the government is of the opinion that they can do more than what they have done."

    {
      "speaker": "PERINO",
      "utterance": "Yeah. So I -- this is the encryption battle that we saw, remember in the San Bernardino terrorist situation. And this happened over and over again, where Apple is approached by the FBI. Can you help us? We need to get into this phone. And Apple has been very adamant that they have this technology. They think that it is bad for business. They say that they are cooperating. You know, I always tend to lean towards the law enforcement side, saying, well, look, if -- we know this was a terrorist attack. We know he had two phones that he tried to destroy. We are trying to see if there any co-conspirators, because we want to find out if there's anybody here that could possibly can hurt somebody. And Apple, in a way, I think they're on the shooting range with the attorney general, saying you aren't helping us track down a terrorist suspect. Now, from Apple's perspective, I think -- they think they have a pretty good answer as to the technology is the way that it is, that this is encrypted. This is their technology, that they will do what they can. But I think that Congress is going to have to get involved to try to help solve this. Congress is always years behind new technological developments, but this is not going to end with this one incident. It is going to keep going."

    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "So Emily, here's my thought. If you put in the code, if you are Apple, well, then that's the end of privacy, right? For me, for you, for everyone at this table, everything about you, easy access, the government will have it. So the question is do you trust Apple or do you trust the government with everything about Emily?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "COMPAGNO",
      "utterance": "Well, that is part of Apple's argument. And their additional argument is that if they create that backdoor, as you said, that it will be available for bad guys to exploit too. It's not just for the good guys. They argue if we create this, it is a Pandora's Box. Now, to be clear, in that San Bernardino case, what's interesting is that the FBI ended up dropping their suit because a third party vendor is what they use to get in. So Apple never had or potentially never provided -- I don't know if it exists, they argue it doesn't -- an encryption free version of iOS. And for viewers, I think the question remains -- for myself, too, when Apple says that it complied, they say they provided iCloud backups, they provided details of transactional data, and they provided account information for multiple accounts, what does that mean? What does that mean for this exact investigation? What I want to know is the specific questions that the FBI has that they're not responding to. Because at this point, we just have someone saying I asked for this, I asked for help, and Apple says we gave it to you. What does that mean for the investigation for our safety moving forward? But the answer to your question about private companies versus the government? I mean, the answer we see in public every day all day, which is all of us with our phones that China has access to and these private companies have access to, and no one cares."

He's going to crack into that phone before the Feds can, watching his employees getting murdered by Saudi terrorists. He's not going to wait. He's going to get in there and get justice for his employees, and he's going to try to, as you said, prevent future attacks on Americans. Right now, he's so far removed from reality, he's living in this land of theory and these pure principles while someone could be plotting attack right now. And we have in this country rights to life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness. Right to life. He's putting a dead foreign terrorists privacy rights -- if they even have any -- above our rights as Americans. And I think that's totally misguided and he needs to get some sense knocked into him."

      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "What is a phone? I mean, what is it? How is a phone different than your house or your car? It contains things of personal value that is true. But the difference -- oh, but the phone is encrypted. So they create a language that then creates a new environment that we're supposed to respect. Oh, my God, a phone is different. This is different. Actually, it's not because the information has been shrunk. You have the entire space program on your phone, right? So you actually have more dangerous stuff in your phone than you would if you had stockpile bombs in your house. But you can't -- but that law enforcement can still get a search warrant and go into your house, they can get into your car. So this is a bogus -- it's a bogus idea. The but the bigger story for me is that we just had a terror attack on our soil, and it didn't really get a lot of press. And the reason why it didn't get a lot of press because we're living in a different era, the Trump era where a lot of the press is devoted to Trump and the people who hate Trump. I mean, the people that -- yes, the never Trumper or so you have. All the attention is on the impeachment, all the other attention is on Trump, and what's -- what we're forgetting is that terrorists still exist. We routed ISIS, that was a great victory, but the war continues to go on, and it's ongoing and endless. And especially with technology, when you marry terror plus technology, well, I always talk about the drone with anthrax, we're in a whole new era that's going to make 9/11 look pretty small. And I think that's one reason why Trump got the Republicans behind him is because he swore that was his number one thing to take terrorists seriously, and I hope to God we still do."

But if you're Dan Hill, you sometimes don't have a choice. He got locked in his gym while swimming laps when the staff left without realizing it was there. And he documented his entrapment with a Facebook post saying I am literally locked inside 24 Hour Fitness right now. They closed the doors and went home while I was swimming laps in the pool, which I don't get because it's 24 Hour Fitness, but anyway. So Dan called his wife and she told him, find a comfortable place to hunker down and sleep, and the police rescued him just before 1:00 a.m. And he -- apparently he said he's going to take some new precautions to make sure he isn't missed in the pool again. Thanks to Gail Hauser. She was on Twitter. She sent me that today. That's pretty funny."

As you know, I purchased the peloton for the wife, but she hasn't used it yet, but I've used it. I'm having a hard time getting on that damn thing with the shoes. I have some footage of me trying to get on the peloton. That's really hard. It's like takes me forever to get on there and try to clip the shoes in. So I'm often just kind of there.
