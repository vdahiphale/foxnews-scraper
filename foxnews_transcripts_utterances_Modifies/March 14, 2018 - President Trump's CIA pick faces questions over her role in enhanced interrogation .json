A 33-year vet, more than qualified to run the place with deep knowledge of our worst enemies and how to handle them, which means she must be stopped:",

The world she operated in and the villains she faced, she didn't have the luxury of just talking about what to do, she had to do, because the call she answered demanded it. So, was it torture? It wasn't back then. And just because you don't like a tactic, that doesn't make it torture. Of course, you could discuss the merits of such choices with pundits on TV rather than doing her job. She'd probably be paid more. But instead, she took the risk and responsibility, so we didn't have to. She responded not just to the worst attack on our country since Pearl Harbor, but to a world-ending threat.   Sure, it's easy to say, but we're better than that, from a shiny newsroom. But if you think whatever she did was wrong, what is your alternative? Do you have anything beyond \"don't do that\"? Have you ever even thought this through all the way? So here's a question for Haspel's critics\" Imagine being in a situation where your family is in danger and a terrorist is withholding key information that could save them. Would you still consider \"enhanced interrogation\" sadism? With everything that's considered \"mean\" be off the table? Something tells me you'd rather leave that question up to people like Gina Haspel. So, Dana, you know this story probably better than anybody. They keep calling this torture. Do they have a reason to call this stuff torture? I don't -- it's an opinion.",

To that story, the reason why the Republicans succeed on this sanctuary city thing is because liberals have yet to realize that a wish is not a plan.

No. 1, I said a while ago you don't want to let these causes be hijacked by other causes. Women's march, Planned Parenthood, the Center for American Progress. That happened. That bugs me. No. 2, a protest should never be tied to a kind of implicit reward, meaning you're getting out of class. That taints it a little bit for me. I don't think the protest should accompany a reward. I think it should've been before class or after class. It has a feeling of a field trip. And you couple that with the attention you get from networks, it's a pretty exciting field trip. So I think there's a certain award -- reward there that taints the protest a bit. And then I'm also worried about what it's like for students who don't participate. Will their teachers and the students that they go to class with treat them differently? Will there be peer pressure? Will the teacher think less of them? You know, I did extra credit in high school for the nuclear freeze, a very left-wing thing. That amped up my grade. I got a better grade for doing that. So I think there is going to be a correlation between participating in this and how you're graded. But now the last thing, which is -- you know, it bothers me, is there's a bit of artificial restraint from parents or adults with this issue. It's like we're abdicating our responsibility to debate and criticize. We should be challenging teenagers, especially if they don't have the facts. If you're talking emotionally, you turn teenagers into adults by challenging them with facts. Emotion that's untethered to facts continues, especially when you're a teenager. I know. I was a teenager. I lived off emotion. I was a liberal. So I think that it's important. And also, you know, the FBI, an FBI executive just confirmed that there was an explicit, explicit tip about Cruz. So this isn't really about guns. It's about a lack of a follow-up, failure to catch a needle in a haystack, lack of a database that's very necessary. And I'm glad we're hardening the schools.",

The world she operated in and the villains she faced, she didn't have the luxury of just talking about what to do, she had to do, because the call she answered demanded it. So, was it torture? It wasn't back then. And just because you don't like a tactic, that doesn't make it torture. Of course, you could discuss the merits of such choices with pundits on TV rather than doing her job. She'd probably be paid more. But instead, she took the risk and responsibility, so we didn't have to. She responded not just to the worst attack on our country since Pearl Harbor, but to a world-ending threat. Sure, it's easy to say, but we're better than that, from a shiny newsroom. But if you think whatever she did was wrong, what is your alternative? Do you have anything beyond \"don't do that\"? Have you ever even thought this through all the way? So here's a question for Haspel's critics\" Imagine being in a situation where your family is in danger and a terrorist is withholding key information that could save them. Would you still consider \"enhanced interrogation\" sadism? With everything that's considered \"mean\" be off the table? Something tells me you'd rather leave that question up to people like Gina Haspel. So, Dana, you know this story probably better than anybody. They keep calling this torture.

Now, we're almost 17 years after the fact and they still want to, you know, pick at this scab and not allow a woman who has an amazing record of public service to be able to serve?

So get off your high horse, get off your soapbox. This woman is a patriot. She was trying to save lives after 9/11. I remember, George Bush on his last press conference said exactly what you said. You don't remember what it was like here after 9/11. They had to make a lot of tough decisions. And she made some tough decisions. And the head of her operation, Jose Rodriguez, says enhanced interrogation saved lives and foiled plots. You know who also said it? Leon Panetta, the Obama intelligence chief. And he said that enhanced interrogation led to the location of Osama Bin Laden. Speaking of Leon, also Brennan, Clapper, and Morell, all the top intelligence people under the Obama administration all support this woman. So does Dianne Feinstein, which I find interesting -- Stein, excuse me. And the whole thing about her destroying the tapes, so she was told to destroy tapes and she did. Hillary destroyed tapes because she wanted to and that was under an active investigation."

Torture is illegal. But in this administration with President Trump, who by the way, is always putting down the CIA, but said he thinks torture is effective. What about Mike Pompeo who was the former CIA director? He too has said, yeah, I think torture might work. So the question becomes, wait a second, are we going backwards here?

The United Nations has been decent, you know, in terms of trying to profile and put this out here so that we can stop this, but it's like really widespread in countries you'd be very surprised of as well.

About the arrest, originally this was seen as a martyr and an innocent person, and that is because the media is always desperate to find their poster child for their specific issue. We've been guilty on the right, but mostly the left, the media, they always try to find that exact perfect victim and it never turns out. This is why -- if you see something that sounds too good to be true, they're ripping the mother away from the kids, it's probably not. Whenever we're about to do a story and we go, this sounds really, really, like, right up our alley, you've got to look at it and you'll find out there's a whole story behind that story. This is not -- you have to look at the background, and you find out it's too good to be true. Sorry, guys. You didn't get a poster child out of this one. To that story, the reason why the Republicans succeed on this sanctuary city thing is because liberals have yet to realize that a wish is not a plan. You know, wishing that everybody could come over here, it's not a plan. So the actual liberal plan for everything, from the welfare state to homelessness, illegal immigration, step one, wish. Step two, see step one. Republicans always have a step two. Step one is like, sure, we want to have good people coming over here. Step two, we want them to go through the proper entrance with an enforced border policy. That's step one too."

      "utterance": "A few things. Because we try to -- we tiptoe around this, because it's like teenagers. And I'm a little bit tired of tiptoeing. And -- but I want to be very careful about this. No. 1, I said a while ago you don't want to let these causes be hijacked by other causes. Women's march, Planned Parenthood, the Center for American Progress. That happened. That bugs me. No. 2, a protest should never be tied to a kind of implicit reward, meaning you're getting out of class. That taints it a little bit for me. I don't think the protest should accompany a reward. I think it should've been before class or after class. It has a feeling of a field trip. And you couple that with the attention you get from networks, it's a pretty exciting field trip. So I think there's a certain award -- reward there that taints the protest a bit. And then I'm also worried about what it's like for students who don't participate. Will their teachers and the students that they go to class with treat them differently? Will there be peer pressure? Will the teacher think less of them? You know, I did extra credit in high school for the nuclear freeze, a very left-wing thing. That amped up my grade. I got a better grade for doing that. So I think there is going to be a correlation between participating in this and how you're graded. But now the last thing, which is -- you know, it bothers me, is there's a bit of artificial restraint from parents or adults with this issue. It's like we're abdicating our responsibility to debate and criticize. We should be challenging teenagers, especially if they don't have the facts. If you're talking emotionally, you turn teenagers into adults by challenging them with facts. Emotion that's untethered to facts continues, especially when you're a teenager. I know. I was a teenager. I lived off emotion. I was a liberal. So I think that it's important. And also, you know, the FBI, an FBI executive just confirmed that there was an explicit, explicit tip about Cruz. So this isn't really about guns. It's about a lack of a follow-up, failure to catch a needle in a haystack, lack of a database that's very necessary. And I'm glad we're hardening the schools."

So she's got to have a very nice umbrella, and specifically she gets Fulton umbrellas."
