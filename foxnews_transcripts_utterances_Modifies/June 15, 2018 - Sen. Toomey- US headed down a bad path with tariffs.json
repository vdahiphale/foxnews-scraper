Democrats, particularly those in areas where they feel industry has been harmed and American workers, jobs have been harmed, it's a big deal to them.  So it's kind of an upside-down world.  Let's get the read from Pennsylvania Republican Senator Pat Toomey, what he makes of all of this.  It is weird. I don't know where you stand on this.

I do think that we should distinguish between the challenges, the unique challenges the China poses and the sort of ordinary commerce that occurs between the U.S. and Canada, Mexico and the E.U., for instance.  But the Section 232 tariffs, I think, are a very bad idea, bad for our economy, and could lead to a really problematic cycle.
