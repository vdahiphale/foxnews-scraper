That's straight ahead. But before we get to that, President Joe Biden, the unity candidate delivering a welcome gift to embolden progressives shoving his administration as far-left as possible. As Michelle Goldberg of the New York Times writes quoting here: \"A number of the officials Biden has selected would have fit easily into an Elizabeth Warren administration. Biden has signed Executive Orders increasing food stamp benefits, took steps to institute a 15 an hour minimum wage for federal employees and contractors and announced plans to replace the federal fleet with electric vehicles. His administration is working on a child tax credit that would send monthly payments to most American parents.\"   The President demonstrating an aggressive use of the power of the pen to get things done so far, with 40 executive orders and actions to date and more on the horizon, as progressives continue to push.  Now, more than 50 Democratic lawmakers led by squad member representative, Ilhan Omar, are appealing to President Biden for recurring so called survival checks, monthly $2,000 COVID relief payments to their constituents as the pandemic drags on. And here's the Progressive Caucus Chair Pramila Jayapal.",

They told us that the Trump chemotherapy was far worse than the hard-left cancer. And that's what they got, is the hard-left cancer.  And the question is, why is Biden doing this? And the process is scary. It's all by executive fiat. It's hard left and there's no explanation, no press conferences, no one on one interview. He's just doing it. And I think the conventional wisdom, Trace, was wrong. Everybody said what his winks and nods that he'd be a first term, or only one term president was wrong.  That's a liberating experience in his mind. I don't think he cares of the consequences on the midterms or whether he would be reelected. He's going to be there for four years. And I don't think he wants to play the useful idiot to the left. The good old Joe Biden from Scranton was the veneer that got them across the finishing line.   I think more seriously, he thinks that he's going to do what Barack Obama the much more heralded and iconic charisma figure never did, that is be the first president in 50 years to get a hard-left agenda, threw him for years and then bow out at 82.

It doesn't -- I'm, I'm equally stunned.    I think Victor's assessment is phenomenal. Where Joe Biden very well could have been a centrist president. He could have governed with the only mandate that he had, which is that he is not Donald Trump. That's the only mandate that he had, he does not have a mandate to ban fracking on federal lands. He doesn't have a mandate to get rid of the Keystone XL pipeline, he certainly doesn't have a mandate to do what he did with the transgender executive order.  None of that stuff was articulated in campaign platforms or how he communicated to voters in Pennsylvania or Ohio. And I think that the, the brilliance what Victor said there is that he does not care about any sort of political consequence. This stuff is very unpopular with the American people. And any sort of margin that Biden enjoyed in some of these swing states was not because of radical left-wing policies.  It was simply based on just let's say, ups -- people that were upset with Donald Trump.

And my assessment is a little different. I'm not sure whether Biden is acting from, from frustration, from defiance from despair, what his motivation is, but I think he recognizes that he has no wiggle room, he has no leverage at all in the legislative branch. Congress is so equally divided, he'll never get anything done, unless he does it himself. And what he is doing, what he has chosen to do, in some cases, I think, will rebound very soundly against the Democratic Party in the midterms. Oil and gas here in Ohio, where fracking is a big deal in the southern southeastern part of the state to ban, you know, the exploration for fossil fuels, I think will be crippling to the Ohio economy and very, very unpopular, Trace.",

Even today at his press conference, we saw that the first 45 minutes, he didn't even bring up the bombshell scathing independent investigation. And it was only when the press started asking him questions. He continues to brush this under the rug, rug. There needs to be subpoenas issued immediately.

It goes through a number of levers, levels, it needs to be settled according to DTC rules and needs to be the, the firm doing the trade, taking the trade needs capital. It's not a seamless process. You get there, you get the price that you pay when you execute the trade. But your trade takes some time to happen. And that's what overloaded Robin Hood systems even though it has decent systems, it would have overloaded Merrill Lynch's systems last night. That's why they stopped the trading and it's, it's kind of simple as that and the making a big political story. Now it's a, it's a good line, you get an excellent Facebook.",

Marc Thiessen, American Enterprise Institute: Of course, it's about court packing. But look, my old boss, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, always used to say, there are no monuments in the parks of America to commissions. In Washington, when you want to punt on an issue, what you do is you form a commission. And so, that's what Joe Biden is doing here. He's caught between the American people who clearly oppose court packing and his liberal base who is demanding it. And so, what he's doing is he's punting and forming a commission to come up with some recommendations. The reality is, the left is frustrated because they have no chance of changing the ideological majority of the court without packing the court, because the only justice is likely to retire on Biden's watch is Stephen Breyer. And that would allow them to replace a young, an old liberal with a young liberal. But all the other conservative justices, they would want to flip, or young, except for Justice Thomas. So, the odds are that unless they do something to change the composition of the court, they have zero chance of changing its ideological makeup. And that's very, very frustrating.",

It works because when you have a president of one party, a Senate of another party, they have to compromise, or you have to wait, and you get alignment. And it goes back and forth. We have Democratic presidents, Democratic Senates, Republican presidents, Republican Senates, the system works. So, the only reason you want a commission is if you want to jam something through.

They're stranded on a highway in the middle of a snowstorm, a group of healthcare workers in Josephine County, Oregon knew they were running out of time before the remaining six doses of Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine expired. So, they started walking from car to car offering stranded drivers of chance to receive their first shot. Now, as you might imagine, some people weren't too willing to roll up their sleeves. But after nearly an hour, they were able to administer all six doses, including one to a sheriff's office employee who had showed up too late to get it at the clinic because of the snow. The county's Public Health Director Michael Weber called it one of the coolest operations. And he joins me now. Michael, it's a great story. Thanks for coming on. We appreciate it.

Biden has signed Executive Orders increasing food stamp benefits, took steps to institute a 15 an hour minimum wage for federal employees and contractors and announced plans to replace the federal fleet with electric vehicles. His administration is working on a child tax credit that would send monthly payments to most American parents.\" The President demonstrating an aggressive use of the power of the pen to get things done so far, with 40 executive orders and actions to date and more on the horizon, as progressives continue to push. Now, more than 50 Democratic lawmakers led by squad member representative, Ilhan Omar, are appealing to President Biden for recurring so called survival checks, monthly $2,000 COVID relief payments to their constituents as the pandemic drags on.

      "speaker": "VICTOR DAVIS HANSON, SENIOR FELLOW, HOOVER INSTITUTION",
      "utterance": "I think he is just getting started. He's delighted the hard left and he's kind of embarrassed that never Trump right. They told us that the Trump chemotherapy was far worse than the hard-left cancer. And that's what they got, is the hard-left cancer. And the question is, why is Biden doing this? And the process is scary. It's all by executive fiat. It's hard left and there's no explanation, no press conferences, no one on one interview. He's just doing it. And I think the conventional wisdom, Trace, was wrong. Everybody said what his winks and nods that he'd be a first term, or only one term president was wrong. That's a liberating experience in his mind. I don't think he cares of the consequences on the midterms or whether he would be reelected. He's going to be there for four years. And I don't think he wants to play the useful idiot to the left. The good old Joe Biden from Scranton was the veneer that got them across the finishing line. I think more seriously, he thinks that he's going to do what Barack Obama the much more heralded and iconic charisma figure never did, that is be the first president in 50 years to get a hard-left agenda, threw him for years and then bow out at 82. And it's kind of aeolistic idea, but I think that's what's happening."

And, Charlie, it's interesting to me that, you know, you know, a couple of months ago, you had right after the election, you had some of these centrist Democrats that were blasting these progressive saying, you know, your policies cost us seats in the House. And now, here you have it a few months later. I mean, they've been fairly quiet, Charlie."

And one positive out of all this far left turn is at least it looks like the filibuster might remain intact, thanks to Senator Manchin and Senator Sinema, from Arizona, but we'll see if they actually mean that when it comes to the really big items that come up in the United States Senate. It doesn't -- I'm, I'm equally stunned. I think Victor's assessment is phenomenal. Where Joe Biden very well could have been a centrist president. He could have governed with the only mandate that he had, which is that he is not Donald Trump. That's the only mandate that he had, he does not have a mandate to ban fracking on federal lands. He doesn't have a mandate to get rid of the Keystone XL pipeline, he certainly doesn't have a mandate to do what he did with the transgender executive order. None of that stuff was articulated in campaign platforms or how he communicated to voters in Pennsylvania or Ohio. And I think that the, the brilliance what Victor said there is that he does not care about any sort of political consequence. This stuff is very unpopular with the American people. And any sort of margin that Biden enjoyed in some of these swing states was not because of radical left-wing policies. It was simply based on just let's say, ups -- people that were upset with Donald Trump. And so, I hope Joe Biden goes back to the middle here, I hope there's just a phase for the good of the country."

I mean, he keeps saying he's calling for unity, and so far as catering only the, only to the left. I mean, it's like having a dinner party, right? And you invite everybody including vegans and the people who are gluten free and allergies, and all you serve as beef bread and peanuts. I mean, it's just, you're not quite catering to everybody.

And my assessment is a little different. I'm not sure whether Biden is acting from, from frustration, from defiance from despair, what his motivation is, but I think he recognizes that he has no wiggle room, he has no leverage at all in the legislative branch. Congress is so equally divided, he'll never get anything done, unless he does it himself. And what he is doing, what he has chosen to do, in some cases, I think, will rebound very soundly against the Democratic Party in the midterms. Oil and gas here in Ohio, where fracking is a big deal in the southern southeastern part of the state to ban, you know, the exploration for fossil fuels, I think will be crippling to the Ohio economy and very, very unpopular, Trace."

But then there's the Washington post that writes the following quoting here: \"Biden's early moves on both policy and personnel should give Liberal Democrats, many of whom were deeply skeptical of him reason to hope that he could be one of the most liberal presidents of modern times.

He's not worried about centrist Democrats; Blue Dogs don't exist anymore. And he's -- the only person he's worried about is the pressure from the hard left. They're vocal. They're skilled. He's got some cognitive issues. They're going to spread rumors about his abilities that's going to come from the left. So, make peace with them, get their agenda across have a legacy, and Barack Obama will end up the most envious person in the world. I think that's the strategy"

He's pointed fingers at the seniors themselves at the nursing homes, basically blaming everyone but himself. In terms of following federal guidance. It is very clear that Governor Cuomo made the decision to put forth his executive order on March 25th, requiring nursing homes to accept positive COVID patients, regardless of their ability to isolate those patients and have proper PPE. That was in direct opposition to CDC guidance, and also CMS guidance. Seema Verma, the previous CMS administrator has been on record over and over and over again on that issue. Yesterday was the first step towards justice for 12,000 families who have been asking for just transparency and accountability and near by the governor's team."

And the reason why this is a criminal corruption scandal and not just a nursing home scandal is that they have known for months what the true count of deaths in nursing homes, whether it was in the hospital from a nursing home, or an individual who passed away in a nursing home, and they have withheld that from the public. Even today at his press conference, we saw that the first 45 minutes, he didn't even bring up the bombshell scathing independent investigation. And it was only when the press started asking him questions. He continues to brush this under the rug, rug. There needs to be subpoenas issued immediately. Both Democrats and Republicans in the state Senate and state assembly have agreed to that and the Department of Justice federal investigation, which I advocated for with my colleagues in Congress, that needs to continue forward and be protected by President Joe Biden, so that we can finally get to the truth, the facts and have accountability."

But here's something we do know, should James report, the Attorney General of New York be born out, it would occasion a serious reexamination of Cuomo's performance during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.\" And speaking of combs performance, I just want one more time to play this, that kind of vaudevillian act that he and his brother had on CNN and watch and get your final thoughts."

I mean, it is a compelling take that, a bunch of, you know, renegades on message boards with their, in their mom's basement apartments using Robin Hood, went out there and beat the man, you know, beat the big hedge fund guys at their own game. But this thing is much more complicated than that. First off, we should point out that part of the scandal of \"scandal\" that Rush and Looney Tunes like Peter Navarro are talking about these days is that Robin Hood stopped, yesterday stopped the trading in these in these stocks that have gone through the roof recently. Allegedly costing the small investors a lot of money to bail out the hedge funds. Totally untrue. You know, here's the bottom line with Robin Hood. They make more money when people are trading, OK? They sell their order flow to third parties because they get more money when there's more trading. Robin Hood simply didn't have the plumbing in place to handle what went on. And here's how you know that they went out today and raised a billion dollars in new cash to get the plumbing, to get the money so they can do a settle trade. So, this mean that it's us against them, and that's why they're screwed. And Charlie, totally insane."

      "speaker": "GASPARINO",
      "utterance": "Yes, but it fails the logic test on so many levels. And I might just say, listen, I've done more to beat up on banks and Wall Street than Rush Limbaugh ever has and Peter Navarro ever has. I mean, I'm hardly in the pocket of Wall Street, but some of this has to do with logic and someone has to do with reporting. If you understand the plumbing of Wall Street, you understand that there are flash crashes that there is, that when you do a trade, Trace, it's not like just turning on the light switch and it automatically happens. It goes through a number of levers, levels, it needs to be settled according to DTC rules and needs to be the, the firm doing the trade, taking the trade needs capital. It's not a seamless process. You get there, you get the price that you pay when you execute the trade. But your trade takes some time to happen. And that's what overloaded Robin Hood systems even though it has decent systems, it would have overloaded Merrill Lynch's systems last night. That's why they stopped the trading and it's, it's kind of simple as that and the making a big political story. Now it's a, it's a good line, you get an excellent Facebook."

I mean, clearly, it's monitoring this, there's no doubt about this. And clearly, that not all the information is in. And here's the scary thing about this. And I think it kind of misses the point, that we're in a situation now where the markets have been turned into a casino. And one of the major reasons it's, it's not necessarily Robin Hood's fault, it's not necessarily the Reddit's fault, you can just view anything you want on a message board. It's the fact that you have zero percent interest rates and where everybody's locked in their apartments and in their house. So, it encourages gambling. If you can't make a return on a uni-bond, you go out on the risk spectrum. If you can borrow money cheaply, which you can, you can enhance your position on Robin Hood. And that's essentially what's going on here. That never ends well, because guess what, some traders are going to make money on this, on this GameStop, GameStop stuff a lot more. They won't know when to get out in time. Trust me on this. In gambling, you always lose."

      "utterance": "Of course, it's about court packing. But look, my old boss, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, always used to say, there are no monuments in the parks of America to commissions. In Washington, when you want to punt on an issue, what you do is you form a commission. And so, that's what Joe Biden is doing here. He's caught between the American people who clearly oppose court packing and his liberal base who is demanding it. And so, what he's doing is he's punting and forming a commission to come up with some recommendations. The reality is, the left is frustrated because they have no chance of changing the ideological majority of the court without packing the court, because the only justice is likely to retire on Biden's watch is Stephen Breyer. And that would allow them to replace a young, an old liberal with a young liberal. But all the other conservative justices, they would want to flip, or young, except for Justice Thomas. So, the odds are that unless they do something to change the composition of the court, they have zero chance of changing its ideological makeup. And that's very, very frustrating."

So far, they have four members. Only Jack Goldsmith, who was in the Bush administration, a Harvard law professor, is the only one who would oppose this so far. They hope to have nine to 15 members, nine, of course, and that was not a very good number, so they'll probably go higher. But what do you make of this commission, Ari, that they're proposing to kind of get together and really, fairly settle this?"

      "utterance": "Settle what? I mean, Joe Biden just said it's out of whack, what's out of whack? It's actually in line. I mean, the system is working. Since 1869, our nation has had nine Supreme Court justices, that's 152 years. And it works. It works because when you have a president of one party, a Senate of another party, they have to compromise, or you have to wait, and you get alignment. And it goes back and forth. We have Democratic presidents, Democratic Senates, Republican presidents, Republican Senates, the system works. So, the only reason you want a commission is if you want to jam something through. And so, you need the cover of a commission to do so. Look, I think Joe Biden, if he really wants to run on unity, talk about unity, he should say the Supreme Court is staying at nine. We don't need this. I'm on to other issues."

This was the question was asked if Amy Coney Barrett is confirmed and Joe Biden is elected, should the Supreme Court include more than nine justices. And there's the big number, do not increase the court, 58%. Washington Post goes on to say this, though, Marc, each court should reflect the rich diversity of those that serves Trump not only halted, but also reversed any progress toward that goal. The new administration will have to go into overdrive, just to catch up. There is no time to waste. Your final thoughts on that, Marc, beginning with you?"

      "utterance": "Yes. If Hillary Clinton had won in 2016 and appointed three Supreme Court justices, they wouldn't think anything was out of whack. They wouldn't think there was any need for reform. And they, quite frankly, are responsible for their own -- for the mess that they're in. If they had not filibuster Justice Gorsuch, the Republicans would never have gotten rid of the filibuster for the Supreme Court justices. And if they had not gotten the filibuster, Brett Kavanaugh would have never been confirmed because they couldn't get 60 votes to confirm him and nobody would have gotten rid of the filibuster for him. And neither would Amy Coney Barrett. So, the Democrats by playing this filibuster game and by filibustering and getting rid of the filibuster for setting the precedent by getting rid of filibuster for lower court judges, has undermined their own position and created the opportunity for Donald Trump to do what he did. And now they're stuck with the results."

These disputes are settled by elections. Elected Democratic president, you get Democratic courts. You elect a Republican president. You get Republican courts. That's the ultimate arbiter.
