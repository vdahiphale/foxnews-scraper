Thanks so much for being with us. We'll have more from President Trump's first public event since COVID still ahead. But first, you know, I hate it when people lie to me. I even have a brand new book out called, \"Don't Lie to Me.\"  Tonight, through my guests, I will prove to you beyond a doubt that Joe Biden is not only a Trojan horse for the left, hiding his true intentions for America, but that he and Kamala Harris have lied so much and gone back and forth so much on the same questions that it is impossible to know the truth. Their disdain and condescension for you, the voters, is evidenced by the fact that they are now refusing to answer questions regarding the most important fundamental pillars of American democracy, like the United States Supreme Court.  Their conscious, intentional deception, and dismissive responses that you need not bother your little heads about whether or not they will pack the Supreme Court is evidence of their disdain, disregard and belittlement of the American people. So typical of those who believe they know better than you about the issues that matter. Issues that if you knew the truth, would prevent you from even considering them as candidates.   So let's get into all of it, and let's start with my first guest tonight. White House Chief of Staff, Mark Meadows joins me now. Good evening.",

You're talking about packing the courts, what does that mean to the American people? It means that Joe Biden is going to expand the court by three to five people, liberals, and what will that do?

It's something FDR at the height of his power tried to do at his own party, the Democratic Party said no, it would destroy the Court. And I'll tell you judge, that's actually why I wrote the book, \"One Vote Away.\" I wrote it this summer, obviously I didn't know we'd have a Supreme Court vacancy in October, but the reason I wrote it is because I think the single most important issue on the ballot on Election Day is the Supreme Court and what the book does, is it takes readers inside behind the curtain of the court. Before I was in the Senate, I was a Supreme Court litigator. What I did for a living was argue cases at the Supreme Court, and the book takes you behind the scenes on the big landmark cases, each chapter addresses a different fundamental right. One is on religious liberty. One is on free speech. One is on the Second Amendment. And it tells war stories, many of these landmark cases, I helped litigate, and it's stunning, Judge, you know this, but on issue after issue after issue, the big landmark cases, almost all of them are five-four, we are one vote away from our fundamental liberties taken away from us,",

It happened after a counter protester -- a counter protest against the militia group named Patriot Muster. We'll keep an eye on this investigation. But that's where it stands as of this moment. Anyway, finally tonight, my new book, \"Don't Lie to Me' is a \"New York Times\" bestseller and if you don't have your copy, you need to get it right away and don't lie to me that you have it when you don't. You can get it on Amazon or on the Judge Jeanine store. You can get a T shirt. You get a hat. You can buy a coffee mug that says \"Coffee, stupid.\" Anything you want or even \"Impeach this.\" Remember Christmas isn't that far away and it's so easy to wrap a book, I mean think about it, anyway. As always, thanks for watching. I appreciate your loyal support and watching my show. Remember to turn into FOX News coverage of the Amy Coney Barrett confirmation hearings all day Monday. It will be historic. I'm Jeanine Pirro advocating truth, justice and the American way. JUSTICE has been served. \"THE GREG GUTFELD SHOW\" is coming up. I'll see you next Saturday night, same time, same place, but I won't be here. That's for sure. I mean, I'm in a different place. I don't mean anything by it.

Thanks so much for being with us. We'll have more from President Trump's first public event since COVID still ahead. But first, you know, I hate it when people lie to me. I even have a brand new book out called, \"Don't Lie to Me.\" Tonight, through my guests, I will prove to you beyond a doubt that Joe Biden is not only a Trojan horse for the left, hiding his true intentions for America, but that he and Kamala Harris have lied so much and gone back and forth so much on the same questions that it is impossible to know the truth. Their disdain and condescension for you, the voters, is evidenced by the fact that they are now refusing to answer questions regarding the most important fundamental pillars of American democracy, like the United States Supreme Court. Their conscious, intentional deception, and dismissive responses that you need not bother your little heads about whether or not they will pack the Supreme Court is evidence of their disdain, disregard and belittlement of the American people. So typical of those who believe they know better than you about the issues that matter. Issues that if you knew the truth, would prevent you from even considering them as candidates. So let's get into all of it, and let's start with my first guest tonight. White House Chief of Staff, Mark Meadows joins me now. Good evening."

We just -- 30 seconds before the show started, we just got something from the AAP just released from the White House, according to the White House physician, and the President is no longer considered a COVID transmission risk to others, so he is not a transmission risk to others. And does that mean he is COVID free?"

    {
      "speaker": "MEADOWS",
      "utterance": "Well, that means that just like you would normally think of somebody, if you come into contact with them that you could potentially pick up the virus, the good news is, that's no longer the case with the President. He continues to improve. He is remarkably strong. You know, this is a guy that wants to get out and work on behalf of the American people. So it's good news, indeed. It's consistent with the C.D.C. guidelines, which says that after 10 days, you're going to be able to get out and really, really live your life as normal again. And so we're just very thankful for the American people, all the prayers and well wishes from across the nation and the President. As you saw today, he is ready to get back to work, ready to get back on the campaign trail. And indeed, he is going to do that."

But you know, it's interesting in your lead up, Judge, you mentioned something, and he is ready to make the contrast between Joe Biden on one key thing. You're talking about packing the courts, what does that mean to the American people? It means that Joe Biden is going to expand the court by three to five people, liberals, and what will that do? It means your Second Amendment rights will be gone and major religious liberty will be gone. It means that they will give additional support to illegals that are here, all through the court since they can't do it through the American people and Congress."

You know, he only had one day really in the residence and then he came to the Oval Office and said, you know, we've got to be serious about the people's business and getting that done and whether its heads of states calls, whether it's working on disaster relief for Americans, whether it's actually making sure that we're working on that tax plan that actually is going to reduce taxes for the American people, he has been all over it. And while Joe Biden is looking to increase taxes, this President is looking to decrease your taxes. You know why? Because he believes that the American people can spend money better for themselves instead of Washington, D.C. deciding how best to spend the American taxpayer dollar."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "MEADOWS",
      "utterance": "Well, he is willing to do a Town Hall. He is willing actually to debate. You know, it's interesting when we have the Debate Commission that actually surprises everyone, makes a decision in the morning and announces that they're not going to have a debate, when indeed we already know that that the President is not only negative in terms of his COVID, really his COVID contagiousness at this point, and yet here we are trying to make sure that they hide the football. And so I'm ready for the President to make his case to the American people, whether it's a debate in-person, or whether it's going on a little bit further and taking his message straight to the American people."

    {
      "speaker": "GIULIANI",
      "utterance": "Well, I certainly expect it. That's the commitment that Biden and the Biden campaign made. So if this first debate, the second debate is put off in the third debate should be the week after that. Now, I think he has done everything he can to avoid a debate despite the media nonsense about him, he got destroyed in the last debate. I mean, it was Trump and Wallace that were debating, not Biden. The issue for the President was Wallace and I think he handled it well. Biden was a nonentity. Basically, he was inarticulate and nervous."

He just gets terribly confused. And you wonder, is that the result of dementia? Or is it the result of somebody talking to him or -- I mean, he did the Pledge of Allegiance a couple of days ago --"

So you put him in a hermetically sealed chamber with all of those people around him, we're not going to find out how badly impaired he is or isn't. Plus, it's very hard to nail him then on his inconsistencies. For example, he will be the most pro-abortion President in the history of America. They're taking abortion right up to the moment of birth in the Democratic platform."

We know on the other side of the country, in New York, that Governor Cuomo and de Blasio are looking to limit the number of people who go to church and synagogue and even stopping synagogues from opening. What can you tell us if Biden were to be elected, how people's religious rights would be affected?"

I don't know if you know this, but they took God out of their platform in 2012. They took any mention of God out of their convention. You never hear a Democrat mention God. Nancy Pelosi is always praying for the President. But she is in favor of, you know, killing babies a minute before they are born. So you have -- you wonder what kind of religion that is. And the same thing with Biden. Biden wears his religion on his sleeve. It's kind of disgusting, actually. But when you look at his religion and him, they're at war with each other. I mean, this man is actually endorsing the Governor of Virginia, who actually believes you can kill babies after they're born, which is really extraordinary."

You're not going to meet strict scrutiny if you put more restrictions on a church than you are on Black Lives Matter who can march thousands in the street spitting at each other while they are yelling \"Kill police.\""

Look, right now, the economy, and COVID seem to be at the top of the list of people and their concerns as it relates to this election. However, I suspect that on Monday, when the confirmation hearings begin with Amy Coney Barrett, people will start to recognize the importance of the Supreme Court, and the fact that both Biden and Harris are refusing to answer the question, will you pack the Supreme Court? Can you please tell my viewers what the significance of packing the Supreme Court is aside from the arrogance of thinking you don't have to answer the question?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CRUZ",
      "utterance": "Well, both Biden and Harris are refusing to answer it. Kamala -- Vice President Pence asked her four times, she refused to answer it. Today, Joe Biden said the voters don't deserve to know an answer. And the reason they're doing this is because the answer is yes. Their party, the Democratic Party is captive to the hard left of the party. They intend to pack the court which would politicize it, it would destroy its independence. It's something FDR at the height of his power tried to do at his own party, the Democratic Party said no, it would destroy the Court. And I'll tell you judge, that's actually why I wrote the book, \"One Vote Away.\" I wrote it this summer, obviously I didn't know we'd have a Supreme Court vacancy in October, but the reason I wrote it is because I think the single most important issue on the ballot on Election Day is the Supreme Court and what the book does, is it takes readers inside behind the curtain of the court. Before I was in the Senate, I was a Supreme Court litigator. What I did for a living was argue cases at the Supreme Court, and the book takes you behind the scenes on the big landmark cases, each chapter addresses a different fundamental right. One is on religious liberty. One is on free speech. One is on the Second Amendment. And it tells war stories, many of these landmark cases, I helped litigate, and it's stunning, Judge, you know this, but on issue after issue after issue, the big landmark cases, almost all of them are five-four, we are one vote away from our fundamental liberties taken away from us,"

      "speaker": "CRUZ",
      "utterance": "Well, that's actually right. There are nine justices on the court. There have been nine justices for 150 years. As I said, FDR, he didn't like how the Supreme Court was ruling. So he proposed to pack it and increase it from nine to 15 justices and Democrats in Congress said, well, that's a terrible idea. It turns the court into a political body instead of an independent judiciary following the law."

And the polls now I believe are more inaccurate now than they were four years ago given the state of fear that most people are in and admitting that they support the President.

The polling methodology is garbage. We watch all of these network news, \"The New York Times\" and \"The Washington Post\" they come out with these polls to show the President way down, trying to create this false narrative to suppress our vote. That's not going to happen. This President is out there, and he is going to work incredibly hard between now and Election Day, and I've got to tell you, he beat COVID.

You come out. You stare it down, and you defeat it, and then you're triumphant. It's like he didn't -- you know, he was told he had to shut the country down. Now, they want to shut it down again, on one scientist's word. But the President right now is out there. He has got three weeks left. What do you expect to accomplish in the next three weeks?"

We know that he is going to talk to the American people about the promises he made four years ago, and all of those promises that he has kept. And you know, the left doesn't want to talk about it, but the states like Ohio and Iowa and the great white whale for the Democrats of Texas where every four years we hear they're going to have a chance in Texas. Those states are now off the map. Georgia is going to go Republican without any question. North Carolina, when you really start looking at this map, Judge, the American people have seen what this President has been able to accomplish and we are really getting down to just a few battleground states. We know Pennsylvania and Michigan are going to be battleground states, but Donald Trump is going to be the first Republican since Richard Nixon's re- election to win the State of Minnesota.

They're making sure that the Republicans and Independents in that state and in Wisconsin and in Michigan all see exactly the difference.

He sent our friends over there. No more riots taking place in those places because this President has been very clear. When we have law and order and people are safe, they feel better.

Dueling protests in Denver turn deadly. One group was pro-police organization, Patriot Muster, while reports indicate the other was characterized as Black Lives Matter Antifa. The right leaning protester allegedly maced the BLM protester. After that, the BLM protester opened fire with a handgun. Police have cleared the scene and are currently investigating the incident as a homicide. Stay with FOX News Channel as we continue to update this developing story. I'm Anita Vogel.

So a group of these progressives are now trying to move Kamala and Joe Biden to the left and I want to read you what they what they put out after the VP debate, okay, because they weren't happy with Kamala. And when they were talking about fracking, AOC comes out and says something like, fracking is bad, and actually, that's like a zinger to Kamala. But what they want to do is free public healthcare, universal childcare, millions of green jobs, canceling all student debt, $15.00 minimum wage, shifting all money away from police departments, to investments in schools and the communities.

He is managing to lie to both sides of his side of the aisle. What he is doing, Judge, is he is telling the liberals with a wink and a nod. Don't worry, I've got you. I'm going to do this, this, this and this. And then he turns around, screws over the liberals looks at the moderates in the party, and he says, don't worry, wink and a nod. I got you, too. Ignore those crazy liberals. I can prove it to you. Here's a perfect example of how Biden is conning all of them and people are starting to get hip to this, including the libs. He's telling the liberal side, don't worry, there are going to be massive tax hikes and I'm going to repeal the Trump tax cuts. The libs are like, great, more money for the government; then he is telling the moderates, don't worry, I'm not going to hike middle class taxes.

And that is -- his language, by the way, is consonant with that which we read in the left-wing newspapers and the news outlets, corporate news in this country. It's not just fake news. It's corporate news. NBC owned by Comcast, CNN owned by AT&T, but they don't want you to know that. Because right now, Corporate America is suffocating freedom of speech.

We're now watching as we approach three weeks to the election. The Dems in New York are threatening to sue the President in perpetuity. They are attacking him and planning to attack him after he leaves the presidency which hopefully will be in four years.

You can buy a coffee mug that says \"Coffee, stupid.\" Anything you want or even \"Impeach this.\" Remember Christmas isn't that far away and it's so easy to wrap a book, I mean think about it, anyway. As always, thanks for watching. I appreciate your loyal support and watching my show. Remember to turn into FOX News coverage of the Amy Coney Barrett confirmation hearings all day Monday.
