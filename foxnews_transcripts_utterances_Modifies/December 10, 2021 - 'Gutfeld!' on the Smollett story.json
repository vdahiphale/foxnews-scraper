      "sentences": "Yes. It's not their fault. It's just a natural reaction. Yes. Natural reaction if you wanted it to be true because you invested so much in the notion that America is full of white male racist. But this is their MO, turn the news faucet on, then magically turn it off. Because the media is hoping the same people who easily bought the Smollett hoax when they championed it, won't find it now that their own feverish fantasies turned out to be false. Now I'm going to tell you the story of Smollett from the press side view. When the story first broke, we were all sitting around a green room, betting how many Twizzlers Dana Perino could eat. 400. And we were all thinking the same thoughts. I wonder if Jessica's water broke. Anyway, that she wasn't pregnant then. Actually, we all knew Smollett was lying because the lie was too much on the nose. Like a hysterical plot point from law and order. But we couldn't see it just yet because we're too afraid of being called racist by other people in the media. Even though we knew the story was as plausible as seeing Brian Stelter at SoulCycle. Because what Smollett concocted was the exact kind of story the media preferred and demanded. It fit their learning assumptions of a systemically racist evil White America. See, it's not a hoax if it reflects your own fantasies. It's like a psycho stalking a famous actress and convincing himself the actress has the same feelings for him. To him it's not a fantasy, it really exists. And I should probably apologize to Kathy Bates. Unfortunately for them the media's need for racist hate crimes. It's like Xanax at The View. The demand far outweighs the supply. Meanwhile, some scrappy local Chicago reporters bravely chase the hoax down. Rafer Weigel and Rob Elgas, they need to be commended. Wiegel actually was criticized for going on Fox News to discuss the rapidly disintegrating hoax. And his defense, Fox was the only network to ask him to come on. No one else would. They were too scared that their own narratives would collapse. But what he was doing was real journalism. No wonder the legacy media didn't recognize it. But that's the good news about the press. The bad news for every one of those guys, there are 300 Don Lemons. So why did the media fall for this? Well, you can't accept a ludicrous story like that unless you have two elements in place. A nickel bag and a bong. I wish. Actually you need to be primed for it. And then you want it to be true. The priming consists of a repetitive grim narrative pushed by outlets like CNN in which America is full of bigots. This false narrative was the table setting that served up whatever race hoax would pop up. And there were lots. Banana peels left outside. That had to be racist because only white people have access to fruit. A rope at a race car garage that was about a similar to a noose as a play to fettuccini. Workout gear in an Oakland Park also became a collection of nooses. Who knew that Jack LaLanne was a Klansmen. And covered furniture became a man in a KKK robe in a hood. Who hasn't made that mistake before? Is that the Grand Wizard or a lazy boy recliner? The media primed the environment so that any racist hysteria could become reality. Smollett being the enterprising race grifting baiter saw this as a perfect opportunity to enhance his career. And so he did. It's what narcissistic predators do. He could have gotten away with it, but his only problem, he's an idiot. He hired two black guys to play two white guys. It's not only a violation of cultural appropriation, but it's just terrible casting. That's like casting Gwyneth Paltrow to play Rosa Parks. And who's wandering around a frigid Chicago night holding rope and bleach. Angry penguins that are into bondage on their way to clean swimming pools? That makes no sense. And perhaps the biggest improbability of all, what white MAGA heads would ever recognize Jussie Smollett. He's asked to show his I.D. and family gatherings and yet the media pot at all because like a really bad drug dealer they were getting high on their own supply. Feeding off their own race fantasies. It's if they could believe in anything.",

Not to mention the breast implants. Some were even accused of an inflating body parts using rubber bands to make them look better. So, that's how it works. Anyway, roll past that joke. That joke. Anyway, it's a big loss for the disqualified but they're still eligible for next year's swimsuit issue. Now, breeders compete for more than $66 million in prize money.

Who knows? All right. Former staff members for Kamala Harris described the vice president as a bully and a soul-destroying boss. Harris denied the rumors that said to an intern, I suppose you'll be wanting the entire day off for Christmas too. One of Kamala's current aides tweeted a picture of himself looking happy with the caption. I absolutely love my job. And just for that, the guy got an extra food pellet this week. It was reported this week that the White House was working behind the scenes with the media to get positive press coverage. They sent flowers to CBS, thank you notes to NBC, and hand lotion to CNN. That's more I like it. More masturbation jokes. Hillary Clinton released her master class online where you can pay to watch or read the unused victory speech from the 2016 election. For an extra 50 bucks, you can also hear a bitch about how she didn't get asked to the prom. Nice. After nearly 20 years, Keanu Reeves is back with an updated Matrix movie. Except this time, the blue pill is Viagra. Texas officials announced they've seized 160 pounds of fentanyl coming across the southern border this year. Experts say that's enough to kill 200 million people or give Hunter Biden a buzz. This week, Miley Cyrus and Pete Davidson appeared on the Jimmy Fallon show, forming what astronomers call a talent black hole. A bomb squad rushed to an English emergency room after a patient arrived with a World War Two artillery shell shoved up his rectum. The surgical removal of the bomb has been dubbed the Battle of the other bolts. He later admitted his favorite porn site is the History Channel. That's good. And here's the weird part, the guy's wife is named Peg. Also, World War Two ass bomb is the name of my favorite bar down. Progressives in Congress are backing a bill for a four-day workweek, although they're facing opposition from their core voters who don't want their work week doubled. Nice. Alec Baldwin and his family were spotted in New York City picking out a Christmas tree. They went with the first one that didn't duck when he pointed at it. Retiring MSNBC anchor, Brian Williams, had his final broadcast last night he said, he'll find it hard to stay away from the lights and cameras, especially since he invented them. He signed off by saying that after 28 years at NBC, he plans to spend more time lying to his family. And that's pretty good. I like that one. And finally, New York restaurant Junior's is struggling to get the high fat ingredients they need to make their famous cheesecake due to the supply chain problems. Out of respect, flags will be lowered to half-staff outside Brian Stelter's office. And that's Greg's Leftovers. Don't go away. We'll be right back.",

      "utterance": "Yes. It's not their fault. It's just a natural reaction. Yes. Natural reaction if you wanted it to be true because you invested so much in the notion that America is full of white male racist. But this is their MO, turn the news faucet on, then magically turn it off. Because the media is hoping the same people who easily bought the Smollett hoax when they championed it, won't find it now that their own feverish fantasies turned out to be false. Now I'm going to tell you the story of Smollett from the press side view. When the story first broke, we were all sitting around a green room, betting how many Twizzlers Dana Perino could eat. 400. And we were all thinking the same thoughts. I wonder if Jessica's water broke. Anyway, that she wasn't pregnant then. Actually, we all knew Smollett was lying because the lie was too much on the nose. Like a hysterical plot point from law and order. But we couldn't see it just yet because we're too afraid of being called racist by other people in the media. Even though we knew the story was as plausible as seeing Brian Stelter at SoulCycle. Because what Smollett concocted was the exact kind of story the media preferred and demanded. It fit their learning assumptions of a systemically racist evil White America. See, it's not a hoax if it reflects your own fantasies. It's like a psycho stalking a famous actress and convincing himself the actress has the same feelings for him. To him it's not a fantasy, it really exists. And I should probably apologize to Kathy Bates. Unfortunately for them the media's need for racist hate crimes. It's like Xanax at The View. The demand far outweighs the supply. Meanwhile, some scrappy local Chicago reporters bravely chase the hoax down. Rafer Weigel and Rob Elgas, they need to be commended. Wiegel actually was criticized for going on Fox News to discuss the rapidly disintegrating hoax. And his defense, Fox was the only network to ask him to come on. No one else would. They were too scared that their own narratives would collapse. But what he was doing was real journalism. No wonder the legacy media didn't recognize it. But that's the good news about the press. The bad news for every one of those guys, there are 300 Don Lemons. So why did the media fall for this? Well, you can't accept a ludicrous story like that unless you have two elements in place. A nickel bag and a bong. I wish. Actually you need to be primed for it. And then you want it to be true. The priming consists of a repetitive grim narrative pushed by outlets like CNN in which America is full of bigots. This false narrative was the table setting that served up whatever race hoax would pop up. And there were lots. Banana peels left outside. That had to be racist because only white people have access to fruit. A rope at a race car garage that was about a similar to a noose as a play to fettuccini. Workout gear in an Oakland Park also became a collection of nooses. Who knew that Jack LaLanne was a Klansmen. And covered furniture became a man in a KKK robe in a hood. Who hasn't made that mistake before? Is that the Grand Wizard or a lazy boy recliner? The media primed the environment so that any racist hysteria could become reality. Smollett being the enterprising race grifting baiter saw this as a perfect opportunity to enhance his career. And so he did. It's what narcissistic predators do. He could have gotten away with it, but his only problem, he's an idiot. He hired two black guys to play two white guys. It's not only a violation of cultural appropriation, but it's just terrible casting. That's like casting Gwyneth Paltrow to play Rosa Parks. And who's wandering around a frigid Chicago night holding rope and bleach. Angry penguins that are into bondage on their way to clean swimming pools? That makes no sense. And perhaps the biggest improbability of all, what white MAGA heads would ever recognize Jussie Smollett. He's asked to show his I.D. and family gatherings and yet the media pot at all because like a really bad drug dealer they were getting high on their own supply. Feeding off their own race fantasies. It's if they could believe in anything."

In an OutKick exclusive, one anonymous team member said, quote, pretty much every one individually has spoken to our coaches about not liking this is my favorite part. Our coach just really likes winning. He's like most coaches. I think, secretly, everyone just knows it's the wrong thing to do. And adding, when the whole team is together, we have to be like, oh, my gosh, goalie. That's great. You're amazing. It's very fake. Now, I for one know a lot about making others feel uncomfortable in the pool. The Speedo was not quite big enough, and you're supposed to wear it on your lower body. Lesson learned. All right. Carley, I just assume you're an athlete."

Thirty- eight seconds ahead of that competitor, it's not a competition. It's just a predetermined outcome. So, it's not fair to the other female athletes. Absolutely not. Caitlyn Jenner has talked about this before. And her perspective is that if there is a young girl who takes a hormone therapy at a young age, then she can compete in female sports. But when you transition -- when you're already an adult, you know, two years ago, is I think when Lia started taking hormone pills. It's not fair."

Like they were very, very honest with you about why. The coach wants it so that he can win. This isn't about her. This isn't about our ideology. This isn't what we actually -- hey, we're going to win this. And guess what, not only are we going to win, but when you look in the record books, we're going to be there in every single cabin. We're going to run swimming forever. It's going to belong to us. And they just own it now. But the funny part to me is, I like to watch progressives get eaten by other progressives."

Let's say it's a team sport, and each team has a trans-athlete on it, do they have to match that trans-athlete? Is that how you do? Or do you just make everything coed? Or in the individual -- or if it's an individual sport, then do they -- is it only trans versus trans? Because this clearly is going down a path that doesn't make sense."

All -- I think it's bad that we can't talk about it though like, this girl said it's all fake. If you want trans acceptance, you should want trans acceptance. And that's not the same thing as fake acceptance. And this is a complicated issue. And to say that this is complicated, it's not as simple as what they're doing now. That's not a transphobic thing."

      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "Should dozens of camels get dumped for enhancing their humps? Yes. Camels were banned for the rest of their lives for getting more surgery than the Real Housewives. Forty-three Camels, not to be confused with what Kat smokes during lunch, have been disqualified from a popular beauty contest in Saudi Arabia for using Botox fillers and other cosmetic enhancements. Not to mention the breast implants. Some were even accused of an inflating body parts using rubber bands to make them look better. So, that's how it works. Anyway, roll past that joke. That joke. Anyway, it's a big loss for the disqualified but they're still eligible for next year's swimsuit issue. Now, breeders compete for more than $66 million in prize money. And if they win, they can sell the camel for a higher price. But it raises a question, is it wrong for camels to use the very same tools that humans do to enhance their beauty, whether it's Botox or fillers? We go to someone who understands this more than anyone. What do you think?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TIMPF",
      "utterance": "Yes, I got a face full of surgery. I think I'd be more voluptuous looking if that were the case. But what's up? Oh, I don't know. I didn't get this. I didn't -- I didn't know that a camel could be hot, you know?"

      "speaker": "GUTFELD",

They're going to have a llama beauty contest very, very soon coming out of Hollywood."

      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "Yes. Time once again for Leftovers. It's the jokes we didn't use this week, but now they get a second chance. As always, this is my first time reading them so they may suck. Who knows? All right. Former staff members for Kamala Harris described the vice president as a bully and a soul-destroying boss. Harris denied the rumors that said to an intern, I suppose you'll be wanting the entire day off for Christmas too. One of Kamala's current aides tweeted a picture of himself looking happy with the caption. I absolutely love my job. And just for that, the guy got an extra food pellet this week. It was reported this week that the White House was working behind the scenes with the media to get positive press coverage. They sent flowers to CBS, thank you notes to NBC, and hand lotion to CNN. That's more I like it. More masturbation jokes. Hillary Clinton released her master class online where you can pay to watch or read the unused victory speech from the 2016 election. For an extra 50 bucks, you can also hear a bitch about how she didn't get asked to the prom. Nice. After nearly 20 years, Keanu Reeves is back with an updated Matrix movie. Except this time, the blue pill is Viagra. Texas officials announced they've seized 160 pounds of fentanyl coming across the southern border this year. Experts say that's enough to kill 200 million people or give Hunter Biden a buzz. This week, Miley Cyrus and Pete Davidson appeared on the Jimmy Fallon show, forming what astronomers call a talent black hole. A bomb squad rushed to an English emergency room after a patient arrived with a World War Two artillery shell shoved up his rectum. The surgical removal of the bomb has been dubbed the Battle of the other bolts. He later admitted his favorite porn site is the History Channel. That's good. And here's the weird part, the guy's wife is named Peg. Also, World War Two ass bomb is the name of my favorite bar down. Progressives in Congress are backing a bill for a four-day workweek, although they're facing opposition from their core voters who don't want their work week doubled. Nice. Alec Baldwin and his family were spotted in New York City picking out a Christmas tree. They went with the first one that didn't duck when he pointed at it. Retiring MSNBC anchor, Brian Williams, had his final broadcast last night he said, he'll find it hard to stay away from the lights and cameras, especially since he invented them. He signed off by saying that after 28 years at NBC, he plans to spend more time lying to his family. And that's pretty good. I like that one. And finally, New York restaurant Junior's is struggling to get the high fat ingredients they need to make their famous cheesecake due to the supply chain problems. Out of respect, flags will be lowered to half-staff outside Brian Stelter's office. And that's Greg's Leftovers. Don't go away. We'll be right back."
