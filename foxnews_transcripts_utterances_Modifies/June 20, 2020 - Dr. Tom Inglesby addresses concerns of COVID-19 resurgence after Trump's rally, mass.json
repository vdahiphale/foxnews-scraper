Then, the rally coming at a tough time for the country as protests over police violence have changed the narrative in the race for the White House and some Democrats urged Joe Biden to pick a woman of color as his running mate. We'll talk with Biden campaign senior advisor Symone Sanders and get reaction from Trump campaign senior advisor Mercedes Schlapp.  Plus, a look at the barrage of accusations in John Bolton's tell-all book about the Trump White House.

The virus has claimed the lives of at least 120,000 Americans as well as millions of jobs, and the country's underlying racial divisions of boiled over into protests and riots.

I think it's a little bit -- even more than a little bit different than having a large indoor gathering.

Dr. Inglesby, how much of that do you think is just the fact that we're testing more people?

They should also be really strongly encouraging people -- leaders should be encouraging people to use the tools that we know work. We should be encouraging people to wear face coverings, to stay at a distance, to avoid large gatherings, to use hand sanitizer or wash your hands.

There's something on the order of 70 or 80 countries where the virus is on the rise.  So it's a serious, serious pandemic and, as the WHO said, we are in a new phase of intensity in many parts of the world. Vaccine development is going as quickly as it's ever gone for any vaccine in the world and there are a couple of vaccine trials that are really ramping up in the next month, so that's all good news, but we don't know yet whether or when that vaccine will work. We hope we'll have a vaccine by the end of this year but I don't think we can count on it yet.

And again, Chris, this is about public health. No one is saying, you know, we want the economy to reopen, we want folks to get back to work, more than 20 million Americans are still out of work. Almost 120,000 people have died due to COVID-19. Those jobless, those deaths did not have to happen. We'd have to take precautions, Chris.

And, guess what, because of President Trump, we have ended these endless wars. He's the one that's been able to work on trade deals with China. You talk to Secretary Pompeo, you talk to Robert O'Brien, you talk to Secretary Esper, these are individuals who know that the president is focused on keeping America safe and ensuring that we keep working with our allies in all the areas of foreign policy, whether it be North Korea, whether it be the Middle East and being tough on Iran. Contrast that to Joe Biden, which basically their administration gave cash to the Iranian regime. We're being tough on Iran. We're being tough on Cuba. Let's be real.",

Well, the federal judge in the Bolton case ruled yesterday that the book can be released on Tuesday, but he didn't like John Bolton off the hook. I want to put up a little bit of his ruling. Judge Royce Lamberth wrote, \"defendant Bolton has gambled with the national security of United States. He has exposed his country to harm and himself to civil and potentially criminal liability.

But in terms of the politics here and whether this will matter, you know, John Bolton has put himself in the same category as James Comey. He has done no services with the judge, as you've just displayed with this quote. He can't find friends on Capitol Hill, whether they're Republicans or Democrats. He certainly has no friends left in the White House. And he's limited his credibility because he did not say these things when the House was going through their impeachment inquiry process.

The second question, I don't think it will play that much of a role. Look, I'm not going to downplay or say it's not newsworthy that you have not only Bolton, but as you mentioned in your question to Mercedes in the last segment, whole group of former top officials in the administration, Trump's own administration. Former secretary of state, former secretary of defense, former national security adviser, former White House chief of staff all saying or questioning the president's fitness for office. That means something. And you get to a point where it's about the principle, not about one, you know, lone, disgruntled person. But in terms of the controversy broadly over the book, this feels to me like a very D.C. story overall. I'm sure -- I'm sure Simon & Schuster is popping champagne corks that there was a whole legal fight over this book. It's probably going to help them sell books. But I think to average voters, the notion that this is going to move people one way or the other, John Bolton's book, by the time November rolls around, I am very skeptical of that.

President Trump is back holding rallies for the first time since the coronavirus pandemic ripped our nation, and how the world and the race for the White House have changed in the last few months. Joe Biden has become the presumptive Democratic nominee for president. The virus has claimed the lives of at least 120,000 Americans as well as millions of jobs, and the country's underlying racial divisions of boiled over into protests and riots. We'll drill down on all of that this hour. But first, Mark Meredith with the latest from Tulsa, a coronavirus hot spot where Trump supporters gathered last night."

Some wore masks, while most shrug off concerns about catching coronavirus. Before the rally, Black Lives Matter demonstrators came face-to-face with Trump supporters in Tulsa streets, but overall, the situation remained relatively calm. Campaign organizers canceled an appearance by the president at an outdoor overflow venue because of sparse attendance. Inside the Bank of Oklahoma Center, supporters built about two-thirds of the arena with many empty seats in the upper deck, the president telling them the coronavirus was making his record look bad."

I guess the good news was there wasn't as big a crowd as expected, but as an epidemiologist watching that rally last night, what did you see?"

And what I saw was that people were sitting quite close to each other, didn't see very many people wearing masks. There were some people handshaking without hand sanitizer, lots of shouting. All of those things will increase the risk of spread."

      "utterance": "We have seen in the past few months around the world that indoor gatherings have been the source of most super-spreading events, and those are events where one person can give it to -- give the virus to many people. So there's an opportunity for much more spread in a short period of time, so I am worried about that. I know that many people in the public health community are worried about the potential for a big spreading event."

    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "I want to pick up on that because a number of conservatives point out that a lot of the media, and even some public health experts, not you, but some of your colleagues, didn't express the same concerns when there were tens of thousands of people taking to the streets in protest over the death of George Floyd, many of them not wearing masks. Is there some hypocrisy where public health concerns depend upon the politics of the gathering that's being held?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGLESBY",
      "utterance": "Well, they shouldn't depend on the gathering that's being held. I think the public health principles are the same, whether it's for one purpose or another. I certainly sympathize with the motivations of the demonstrations that have gone on across the country, but I do worry that they are an opportunity for spread. I think it's a little bit -- even more than a little bit different than having a large indoor gathering. We know that outdoor risks are less than indoor risks and if people can maintain their space, then that will help, but certainly I think there is a risk with large-scale protesting as well for increased spread."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "Let me ask you about that, because there has been some testing of protesters after the big events in Minneapolis and New York and at least so far -- and I understand incubation period goes on, there has not been any clear spike detected as a result of those. Is it possible the public health experts are exaggerating the risk from these big public gatherings?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGLESBY",
      "utterance": "I don't think they are exaggerating the risks. I do think -- again, we know from what we've seen so far in the last few months that outdoors is less of a risk than indoors and that mask use has a major impact, so to the extent that people are wearing masks in a particular gathering, that will help a lot, and it is also a little bit too soon to say whether or not the protests have led to increased cases, although I am very glad to see the initial studies do show that there doesn't seem to be increase rate of spread. It's quite different in an indoor setting where people are sitting shoulder to shoulder for a long period of time and really in close quarters like that."

Dr. Inglesby, how much of that do you think is just the fact that we're testing more people? How much of that do you think is the fact that maybe we are reopening too soon and how much of that do you think is that there is, in fact, a spread, a spike in the virus in some of these states where there has been reopening?"

And you can distinguish what is more testing from what is more serious disease from looking at hospitalization rates, ICU rate, and the percent positivity of the overall tests in a given state. And in many states, in the ones that you just showed, particularly Arizona, Texas, the Carolinas, Florida, what we are seeing is increased positivity in testing and in many cases increased hospitalization, so serious illness happening. That's not just because we're doing more testing in a state, that's because there is more serious disease in a state. So that's a --"

      "utterance": "I don't think we need to go into lockdown in these places at this point. I think each state has a different story, each state has its own reopening process and they're all slightly different. I do think that governors should be guiding their public to avoid large gatherings where we see the greatest potential risk. They should also be really strongly encouraging people -- leaders should be encouraging people to use the tools that we know work. We should be encouraging people to wear face coverings, to stay at a distance, to avoid large gatherings, to use hand sanitizer or wash your hands. And those are the things that we know work and leaders really should, I think, double down in communicating that across the country. Those are the things that we have seen work and will work."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGLESBY",
      "utterance": "Well, the first thing to say, is it's not fading away. The U.S. has more cases than a tad in many, many weeks. If you compare us to other parts of the world, our numbers are on the rise, the European Union -- last week we had 25,000 cases on a particular day and the European Union had 4,000 cases, so it's not fading away in the U.S., it's not fading away in the world. There's something on the order of 70 or 80 countries where the virus is on the rise. So it's a serious, serious pandemic and, as the WHO said, we are in a new phase of intensity in many parts of the world. Vaccine development is going as quickly as it's ever gone for any vaccine in the world and there are a couple of vaccine trials that are really ramping up in the next month, so that's all good news, but we don't know yet whether or when that vaccine will work. We hope we'll have a vaccine by the end of this year but I don't think we can count on it yet. So I think really people need to focus on what they can do to decrease transmission while we wait for a vaccine and continue to do the things that we know work in terms of preventing spread."

Look, Donald Trump's debacle of a rally last night will long be remembered, lest we not forget, the president's campaign required that folks who were attending his rally sign a waiver so that if I were to get sick the coronavirus, that the campaign would not be held liable. But I think the most damning thing from that rally last night, Chris, was in fact the president's admission that he, quote/unquote, said to his people to slow down the testing. This is an appalling attempt to lessen the numbers only to make him look good. And so, I think that's what will be remembered long after last night's debacle of a rally. The admission of the president that he slowed testing for his political benefit and it's not for the American people."

I want to pick up though on this whole question of the public health of these mass gatherings, Symone, because when there were tens of thousands of people marching in the streets and, quite rightly, in protest for the death of George Floyd and the issues of police brutality, there were so many of them -- not maybe most, but many of them were not wearing masks. At that time the president called -- the vice president, Joe Biden, called those rallies right and necessary, with no mention of public health. I guess the question is, why the double standard where the protests were okay, but this rally was dangerous?"
    },

      "speaker": "SANDERS",

The difference here is, Chris, we are talking about the president of the United States whose vice president, by the way, heads the White House Coronavirus Task Force, holding a rally, not following their own precautions that his own public health officials have put out. Look, the president has to lead, Chris, and President Trump has demonstrated in so many times, in every sense of the word, that he is unable to do so. And so, the difference between folks going out and protesting police brutality and the president planning a rally where six of his own advanced staffers before the rally contracted COVID-19 is as clear as day. And again, Chris, this is about public health. No one is saying, you know, we want the economy to reopen, we want folks to get back to work, more than 20 million Americans are still out of work. Almost 120,000 people have died due to COVID-19. Those jobless, those deaths did not have to happen. We'd have to take precautions, Chris. We have to do what is necessary in order to protect the American people, and months ago, the president --"

Why didn't Vice President Biden say, look, I understand the concern, but these may be potential super-spreaders?"

So I'm not sure what you're asking or what you're suggesting. Look, Vice President Biden has really exhibited leadership on this issue. You know, we have been out campaigning. I also heard you say we haven't really been on the campaign trail. We've been on the campaign trail since March. We've been campaigning virtually. But you have seen Vice President Biden go back out into the actual campaign trail and our events are safe. They are socially distant. They adhere with the CDC guidelines. Vice President Biden wears a mask. People participating wearing masks because this is about being safe, Chris. This about ensuring the safety of everyone involved. And what President Trump has demonstrated yesterday is that he actually is not concerned with the public health, he is concerned with his ability to hold a rally.

But he -- by the large part, he has not found the campaign trail and he could have felt certainly more socially distanced events.

As we pointed out, the president is trailing Joe Biden in the latest Fox poll by 12 points, 50 percent to 38 percent. But I want to point to some things inside the poll because I know one of the arguments as well, that's just a national poll. If you look at swing states, Biden leads in five of them and is basically tied in the sixth, North Carolina. And one of the big reason for the president's recent drop appears to be that 31 percent approve of his response to the protest after George Floyd's death and 56 percent disapprove. Mercedes, by wide margins, people in the Fox poll think that Joe Biden respects racial minorities and President Trump does not."

I mean we can go down the list. He did not provide any significant change for the black community. In fact, he supported mass incarceration when it came to supporting the 1994 Crime Bill. This is in complete contrast to President Trump, who has been focused on uplifting the black community. Just this week he signed an executive order on the police reform where in essence he's ensuring that these police departments implement these best practices and they get incentive for this."

Well, the federal judge in the Bolton case ruled yesterday that the book can be released on Tuesday, but he didn't like John Bolton off the hook. I want to put up a little bit of his ruling. Judge Royce Lamberth wrote, \"defendant Bolton has gambled with the national security of United States. He has exposed his country to harm and himself to civil and potentially criminal liability. But these facts do not control the motion before the court. The government has failed to establish that an injunction will prevent irreparable harm.

The judge also said there's potential that the government case against him, based on the allegation there's classified information in the book, could still proceed based on the merits. And if you look at what the attorneys for Bolton were arguing is that, because they had leaked the book to a number of newsrooms, therefore it's already out there and you can't take it back and -- and therefore they should be able to proceed. But in terms of the politics here and whether this will matter, you know, John Bolton has put himself in the same category as James Comey. He has done no services with the judge, as you've just displayed with this quote. He can't find friends on Capitol Hill, whether they're Republicans or Democrats. He certainly has no friends left in the White House. And he's limited his credibility because he did not say these things when the House was going through their impeachment inquiry process. He even praised the president for his foreign policy decisions and said that he was having a positive impact in -- on the world."

So, you've got to keep in mind, though, that he did agree to testify in the Senate trial on impeachment and it was Republican senators who blocked John Bolton from testifying and in some cases were quite explicit that it was for political reasons that his testimony would make it harder to excuse or to -- and then eventually acquit the president.

The second question, I don't think it will play that much of a role. Look, I'm not going to downplay or say it's not newsworthy that you have not only Bolton, but as you mentioned in your question to Mercedes in the last segment, whole group of former top officials in the administration, Trump's own administration. Former secretary of state, former secretary of defense, former national security adviser, former White House chief of staff all saying or questioning the president's fitness for office. That means something. And you get to a point where it's about the principle, not about one, you know, lone, disgruntled person. But in terms of the controversy broadly over the book, this feels to me like a very D.C. story overall. I'm sure -- I'm sure Simon & Schuster is popping champagne corks that there was a whole legal fight over this book. It's probably going to help them sell books. But I think to average voters, the notion that this is going to move people one way or the other, John Bolton's book, by the time November rolls around, I am very skeptical of that.

For all the concern about public health, before the rally, the big story ended up being the crowd or, more specifically, the lack of a crowd. At least a third of that arena was empty. For a president who talks so much about drawing a crowd and the campaign talked about a million people wanted to get in, there was a lot of empty space in -- in the arena and the overflow event had to be canceled because there was no overflow."

So if we want to compare and contrast, which elections, that's what they're about, President Trump still has the upper hand on that. When -- when it comes to what he talked about and the details of what he went after Joe Biden on, I think when you look at the news cycle and the things going around -- on around the country, President Trump talked about not bending in knee to the mob. And when you have rioters burning down neighborhoods and destroying the livelihoods of Americans and the most vulnerable in our cities, that message, I think, will resonate, especially while Joe Biden refuses to get out on the campaign trail and President Trump is making that effort."

      "utterance": "Juan, maybe I'm making too much of this, I'd like your reaction, but, you know, the president was billing this as, you know, the reopening to America, the transition to greatness and I'm getting back and he said he was starting his campaign -- in fact, he started it before the coronavirus, but it was certainly a restart of his campaign. Do you think the fact that a relatively small crowd showed up is an issue?"

But, I mean, this, you know, the larger point to me is this was less a reset for the president. He went to a deep red state to draw on energy and instead of a reset it largely was a flop. It was a repeat. I mean the whole theme, this thing about the protests are anarchists, they are violent, they are communists, their looters. I mean, at some point people have to say, Americans have a right to protest and overwhelmingly these protests have been not only peaceful, they have been impressive. But the president is on a rant here. He's wants to present himself as Mr. law and order. He's going to correct us. He's going to, you know, put everything back in order. Joe Biden is just a puppet of the left. And at some point you say, gosh, I think I've heard these things before and it just doesn't have the same power it did not only in 2016, but just a few months ago. It seems empty at this point, like a hollow bell."

I might not get in the building. I'm just going to wait and watch from home. Of course I think the virus is a huge part of this. People ultimately, when push came to shove, said, I'm going to hold off on this. And there were lots of people watching at home. I do think that is an insignificant number. In terms of the polling, it's clear why President Trump is trying to goad Vice President Biden out from the basement to get back to a more normal campaign because I think they're betting in the Trump campaign, the more people see from Joe Biden, the less impressed they'll be.

And for Father's Day he released a music video for \"Don't Let the Old Man In,\" a song about not letting father time have his way. As you may have heard, I have a new book that's been out for almost two weeks now. I want to thank all of you for making \"Counter 1945\" the best- selling hardcover book in America, fiction or nonfiction. And that's it for today. Have a great week, Happy Father's Day to all you dads out there, and to all the sons and daughters, especially mine, give your old man a call today, and we'll see you next FOX NEWS SUNDAY.
