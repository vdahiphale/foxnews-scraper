Meantime, his legal team is putting the finishing touches on the case that they will present to the Senate as soon as next week. As we told you several weeks ago, the White House counsel, Pat Cipollone, will be leading off the president's legal team with the assistance of his deputies Michael Purpura and Patrick Philbin. Jay Sekulow, the president's lead outside counsel, will also be taking a prominent role. In fact, he could make the closing arguments before the Senate. And the Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz is also still under serious consideration to be a part of the team. Last night, Senator Lindsey Graham talked to the president about the upcoming trial.

While Senator Mitch McConnell said that there was no appetite or hardly any for any kind of motion to dismiss, it wouldn't come, again, until after the case is heard. So they may entertain it then. Senator Ted Cruz, though, said today that he supports taking the matter all the way to a vote, which he believes will be a not-guilty vote, a vote to acquit the president, Senator Cruz believing that the president will be in a much stronger position politically, if, rather than dismiss the case before they hear it, that it goes all the way, and then the president is acquitted. And in a real point of irony here as well, Neil, as the trial gets under way in the Senate, the president will be touching down in Davos, Switzerland, to make an appearance at the World Economic Forum there.

And I'm nearly certain even the ones that are interested in witnesses, that it would be reciprocal if you ever got there. And then I think it becomes a faux argument, because, of course, they're not going to want to bring in Hunter Biden or the whistle-blower or Joe Biden. So, I think that's a lot of posturing, when we do know probably all the information that we're going to really need is there. We're going to get through phase one. I was at the lunch today. And there are 53 Republicans that are unanimous in that we go through phase one, just like we did in the Clinton trial. And if we need more information, I say you be flexible to it. I think, also, I heard Trey refer to the fact that the public might say, hey, it's been ad nauseam way back before we even got to Ukraine. I mean, we had the Mueller report. We had talk of impeachment before the president's inauguration. To me, that tainted the process. And I think, finally, at last, we're here. Pelosi was between a rock and a hard place politically, when the polls went south on her, to where Trump was beating the Democrats in Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania. It's her worst nightmare.

And I think, if his attorneys do the job, that they're probably, even among the ones that have been talking about flexibility on witnesses, may say, enough is enough. The case has been made now that it's here in the Senate. Any of the weaknesses, any of the rushing, any of the peculiarities that have come from the House, that's part and parcel of what happens when you're on a predetermined mission from the moment the president got inaugurated to get to this point.

All of this was proven wrong, but the Europeans continue to be committed. What is changing right now, Neil, is the fact that they see that this regime may not last. And in good calculations, they understand, if the majority of the population is not with the regime, give it one year, two years, maybe much lesser than that, it will change, and they need to cut a deal with the next government.

There is a Congressional Gold Medal Ceremony in the -- in Statuary Hall here at the Capitol late tomorrow afternoon. And so they will probably do that early in the day. And the tentative plan -- and this is all subject to change -- is that they would then have the procession where they walk the articles of impeachment over to the Senate late in the day on Wednesday. And then, on Thursday, according to the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, he indicates that that's when they would actually start with the first day of the trial, bring the chief justice of the United States, John Roberts, across the street, and actually receive the impeachment managers. We will find out who they are tomorrow, and also formally start the trial. Now, the meat and potatoes of the trial, the heart of the trial probably does not start until next Tuesday. And just today, Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, indicated that vote to set the parameters for the trial, kind of adhering to the Clinton model, having 24 hours of the prosecution, 24 hours of the defense, and then 16 hours for senators to pose questions through the chief justice, they would probably vote on that Tuesday.

That's down a point from October. Joe Biden, he's up by five points. But the president has really closed the gap pretty significantly over the last three months.

While Senator Mitch McConnell said that there was no appetite or hardly any for any kind of motion to dismiss, it wouldn't come, again, until after the case is heard. So they may entertain it then. Senator Ted Cruz, though, said today that he supports taking the matter all the way to a vote, which he believes will be a not-guilty vote, a vote to acquit the president, Senator Cruz believing that the president will be in a much stronger position politically, if, rather than dismiss the case before they hear it, that it goes all the way, and then the president is acquitted. And in a real point of irony here as well, Neil, as the trial gets under way in the Senate, the president will be touching down in Davos, Switzerland, to make an appearance at the World Economic Forum there. So here is another case where the president will be over there while all the news is right here -- Neil."

We have a number of Republicans, as I'm sure you're aware -- and I will be raising this with a Republican senator -- open to the prospect of witnesses. But it isn't that simple, right? It can get pretty involved, right?"

That's a pretty low standard. So you can't just call a couple. There may be a senator who wants to hear from some witness you and I have never thought up before. So what's the standard by which you judge whether or not to add witnesses? My position is, it is the House is job to investigate. And if they didn't think enough to call a witness during the investigation, then why should the Senate do it?"

It's a terrible optic. You can't do it in a courtroom. You shouldn't be able to do it in an impeachment proceeding. I mean, are you going to call a witness that you know is going to invoke the Fifth? Are you going to call a witness that is going to invoke attorney-client privilege? If you're not going to do that, and you can't do that in the real world, then why would you call a witness simply for the optic of having that witness say, I can't answer based on executive privilege?"

You need to watch their demeanor, the hesitancy or the speed with which they answer questions. How the hell do you do that in a deposition? I mean, I can't think of anything more boring than having Adam Schiff read deposition excerpts to me. So how's that going to help you determine whether or not the person's credible? You know what he or she said, but how do you determine credibility based on that?"

Make them watch this group for six weeks quasi-litigate a case. That is torture. It's not going to last six weeks. I don't support the motion to dismiss, because people don't like things being summarily dismissed. Let the House present its case, Neil. I mean, they don't they have the burden of persuasion? They're the ones that want to remove a duly elected president. They have the burden of persuasion. Let them go. Then you can entertain a motion to dismiss. I like it at the end. Go ahead, present your case. Vote on it. Vote on it like a regular jury votes on it, and then, if the voters want to weigh in, they can do that in November."

But, as I have been mentioning here, there are at least four Republicans who are open to the prospect of hearing from witnesses. Is my next guest one of them, Indiana Republican Senator Mike Braun? Senator, boy, you are getting a baptism by fire in your first year on Capitol Hill here. But so this will be your first impeachment. And some of your colleagues have talked increasingly about entertaining witnesses or being open to them. Are you?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SEN. MIKE BRAUN (R-IN)",
      "utterance": "Well, I think, in listening to Trey there, when you talk about witnesses in the abstract, I think anybody is going to say, yes, if it gets to that point and you mutually agree on it. But then the process falls apart, because they have only been talking about it in a vacuum of Bolton, Mulvaney. And I'm nearly certain even the ones that are interested in witnesses, that it would be reciprocal if you ever got there. And then I think it becomes a faux argument, because, of course, they're not going to want to bring in Hunter Biden or the whistle-blower or Joe Biden. So, I think that's a lot of posturing, when we do know probably all the information that we're going to really need is there. We're going to get through phase one. I was at the lunch today. And there are 53 Republicans that are unanimous in that we go through phase one, just like we did in the Clinton trial. And if we need more information, I say you be flexible to it. I think, also, I heard Trey refer to the fact that the public might say, hey, it's been ad nauseam way back before we even got to Ukraine. I mean, we had the Mueller report. We had talk of impeachment before the president's inauguration. To me, that tainted the process. And I think, finally, at last, we're here. Pelosi was between a rock and a hard place politically, when the polls went south on her, to where Trump was beating the Democrats in Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania. It's her worst nightmare. She bowed over to the left side of her party. And at least now we're here and we're going to get it started."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Are you worried, though, Senator, that some are looking at this process, however tilted and along party lines it was in the House, that it will be just the same in the Senate? That, I cannot imagine -- maybe you can -- a Republican would vote to impeach the president, so it would be the reverse of what happened in the House. And this makes you wonder where all of this went."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BRAUN",
      "utterance": "I think so. I think that part of what we need to do -- it's been a long journey to get here. But the one thing it's going to be different is, it is going to be balanced. You now have the prosecution coming from the House, and you have got the full-throated defense coming from the president. And we have not had that before. And I think, if his attorneys do the job, that they're probably, even among the ones that have been talking about flexibility on witnesses, may say, enough is enough. The case has been made now that it's here in the Senate. Any of the weaknesses, any of the rushing, any of the peculiarities that have come from the House, that's part and parcel of what happens when you're on a predetermined mission from the moment the president got inaugurated to get to this point. And it's political. We all know it. It's in the House -- or it's here now in the Senate. Let's go through the process and see what happens."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Do you know, Senator -- now, the president was eager to see if this whole thing could be dismissed? And maybe Mitch McConnell, colleagues, yourself, decided, no, you can't do that. What was the thinking behind saying, no, we can't just dismiss it out of hand?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BRAUN",
      "utterance": "The only time I was really looking at dismissing it as if they didn't bring it over here in a timely manner. I have been from the get-go -- and I think the president's really been there as well -- for full vindication, you have got to have the full process of his defense team making the case. So I think it is a hollow victory if you move to a vote to dismiss, but moving in a measured, somewhat speedy way, after you have heard both sides, to a vote on acquittal or conviction, I think, is what the American public wants. And I think we need to get this behind us, because there's so much other stuff on the shelf when it comes to health care, infrastructure, the things I came here for that we need to get busy with."

FOX News foreign affairs analyst Walid Phares joins us. Walid, what he's saying is that there was this act of war in place. Anything could and did and sadly ultimately happened. What do you make of that?"

The demonstrations have been going on at least -- and it's archived -- since the end of 2017, 2018, 2019, and all the way to now. But more important was the fact that the Iranian militia, which was involved in suppressing the Iran protest, was the one that started their military actions against our forces, forcing us, forcing the president to respond. So, in the framework of all that conflict, when the Iranian regime and its bureaucracy fail in making sure that they're not shooting at civilian airplanes at the time that they shut down their air to all other civilian airplanes, and they commit that action that killed dozens of people, I don't understand how a prime minister or other leaders would blame America even half, even 1 percent. It's -- all the blame is to the regime."

They have been trying the same thing now, to little success. What do you make of the difference now?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PHARES",
      "utterance": "Well, the difference is huge. It's a historical, diametrical difference. It's the difference between the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917 and the Anti-bolshevik Revolution in Eastern Europe 1989 and '90. It's that big, that large. Those who are rising now, most of them were not even born after the Cold War, and certainly nobody was there during the communist age. I'm talking about the young people. What they're calling for is beyond the reformation, beyond the fact that they lack of everything -- the list is very long -- economics, health, political suppression, they want an actual change of that government, of that regime. And these are not Americans. These are Iranians who are calling for it. So, I believe, Neil, that this is irreversible. The regime can push back, can do violence, but they have to be very careful, because at this point in time, and unlike last year and the year before, the United States, its president and others in the region have committed to monitor what's happening, which means that there will be actions, including legal and other, against those who are engaged in violence against the protesters."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "PHARES",
      "utterance": "It is weird, but it is transitional. I will explain why very quickly. The Europeans, the core, Germany, France, Italy, and Britain, the European Commission, in general terms was committed to the Iran deal for economic reasons. Essentially, their companies are -- have been making, will be making money because of that and because of a theory that, if you engage economically with this regime, it's going to mollify, become moderate, so on and so forth. All of this was proven wrong, but the Europeans continue to be committed. What is changing right now, Neil, is the fact that they see that this regime may not last. And in good calculations, they understand, if the majority of the population is not with the regime, give it one year, two years, maybe much lesser than that, it will change, and they need to cut a deal with the next government. So they are doing those calculations at this point in time."

She remembers their one-on-one a year-and-a-half ago like this.\"Among the topics that came up was, what would happen if Democrats nominated a female candidate? I thought a woman could win. He disagreed.\" Sanders now says that's ludicrous. And he adds: \"It's sad that three weeks before the Iowa caucus and a year after that private conversation, staff who weren't in the room are lying about what happened.\" There were no witnesses to this dinner between old friends. So it is a classic he said/she said that some activists on the left now are worried about hurting their chances next year. The Progressive Change Campaign Committee says this back and forth is counterproductive for progressives. They want everybody working together to try to beat President Trump in the general election. And this is going to be the first debate tonight since President Trump ordered the drone strike to take out the Iranian General Soleimani.

And I can't tell you how many people have said to me, do you think America is ready for a woman? Do you think a woman could beat Donald Trump? These are women that are asking me.

So I don't think that, even if this comes out, even if it were true, that you could say that Bernie Sanders is -- it's a long way to go to say, he said this comment, I'm not sure that a woman could beat Donald Trump, and that means, therefore that he's a sexist.

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Well, it was a bad day for Boeing. American Airlines says it will ground all 737 MAX flights through at least June 3. Maybe the company's new CEO then should listen to this guy. Former U.S. Navy SEAL officer Jocko Willink is out with a new book, \"Leadership Strategy and Tactics.\" He goes into just describing the kind of things that can make this sort of crisis that Boeing is having avoidable in the first place. It's a little late for them, Jocko. It's good to see you. But I was thinking of you and some of the warnings that you have about having an open atmosphere, being willing to challenge the boss, people talking openly and freely with each other. This seemed to be like just a cancerous environment that fed on itself."

And then it all results in the company not really taking and the leadership of the company not taking ownership for these mistakes and saying, look, this is absolutely my fault. This is what happened. And I will not allow it to happen again. And here are the steps I'm going to take to prevent it. And then you got to make sure some drastic changes. So, absolutely, it's a failure in leadership. And it's hard to watch."

      "utterance": "But, normally, you try to deal with that before it gets out of control. Now, in Boeing's case, it was faulted for only responding after two crashes, which now we find out with e-mails and communications were well- telegraphed, engineers saying that all of these guys were jokes, the bosses were clueless, and the CEO himself was out to lunch. So it was just feeding on itself."

And when I'm in charge of something, if I'm not receiving pushback from my team, if they're not raising their hands and saying, hey, boss, we don't agree with this, I'm wary right then, because that means they're afraid to tell me what's really going on. So I need to, like you said, open up my door, go down, talk to the troops, find out what exactly is going on, and make sure that there's no problems going on below me in the chain of command that I'm not hearing about."

    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

All you have to do is crucify one of your subordinates that raises his hand and said something. You crucify them. You're not going to hear anything else. Maybe that happened for a couple years, and they just stopped talking."

You say: \"I realized that the further back of the patrol you were, the less you knew.\" But, sometimes, like you coming from Navy SEALs, I mean, that's the toughest of the tough. That's just life. So, whose responsibility is it to know what's going on? Do you -- are you really going to communicate to the guy or gal in the furthest back to make sure they're all on the same page? You don't have time."

There's technology today to be able to communicate to everyone the important things, the important strategies, the important changes that you're making within your company. You put that word out. Yes, it's absolutely mandatory for the leader to spread that word all the way through the chain of command."

The rap against this president, for example -- I'm not meaning to disparage him. I'm just saying that he doesn't like those who challenge him. You never mention the president. You never mention individuals, per se, like this. But you did say: \"This concept sometimes worries a leader, because essentially what I'm saying here, subordinates should always be pushing back against their leaders, always asking their leaders why things are being done a certain way. Some leaders would rather just have their subordinates do exactly what they are told to do. And when someone challenges them, there is hell to pay.\""

Look, I -- if you're a Democrat, and you maybe have different views on policies that the president has, OK, well, let's at least try and form a relationship with the president, talk to him about things that are going on and try and find some compromise, instead of attacking his ego. And guess what? Yes, sure, obviously, President Trump has got an ego. And what happens to people when you attack their ego? They attack back. They dig in. They defend even harder. They go on the attack. And so that's what we end up with here, where we have got two sides that aren't talking to each other."

And like you just said, the points for Kennedy went up after he took the blame for the Bay of Pigs.

So, when you make a mistake, you own it, and people say, OK, it wasn't a great move, but at least he's owning it. And it's probably not going to happen. If I make a mistake and then I say, it wasn't my fault, you look at me and say, well, he's going to do that again, whereas, if I say, hey, made the mistake, this is my fault, here's why I won't let it happen again, then you actually say, OK."

Now, we had some indication earlier in the day that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi would send the articles of impeachment to the Senate tomorrow. Now, what I have been told is that that short debate and vote probably happens in the early part of the afternoon. There is a Congressional Gold Medal Ceremony in the -- in Statuary Hall here at the Capitol late tomorrow afternoon. And so they will probably do that early in the day. And the tentative plan -- and this is all subject to change -- is that they would then have the procession where they walk the articles of impeachment over to the Senate late in the day on Wednesday. And then, on Thursday, according to the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, he indicates that that's when they would actually start with the first day of the trial, bring the chief justice of the United States, John Roberts, across the street, and actually receive the impeachment managers. We will find out who they are tomorrow, and also formally start the trial. Now, the meat and potatoes of the trial, the heart of the trial probably does not start until next Tuesday. And just today, Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, indicated that vote to set the parameters for the trial, kind of adhering to the Clinton model, having 24 hours of the prosecution, 24 hours of the defense, and then 16 hours for senators to pose questions through the chief justice, they would probably vote on that Tuesday. But there's some people who don't know -- there's a lot of people here who don't know how long this trial might last. And we think it might go well through the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary -- Neil."

      "utterance": "Crucial state, Neil. And President Trump is set to begin speaking just one hour before tonight's Democratic debate, the last debate before the first votes in that primary. So expect that to be a very big focus tonight, Bernie Sanders in particular, because the Trump campaign now believes that Bernie Sanders is the indisputable front-runner among the Democrats. So, really watch for that. And here in Wisconsin, according to the latest FOX News polling, Sanders is ahead by four points in a head-to-head matchup with the president. That's down a point from October. Joe Biden, he's up by five points. But the president has really closed the gap pretty significantly over the last three months. So the Trump campaign really has its work cut out for them in this state, a state that Hillary Clinton famously forgot about in 2016, so much so that Democrats are determined not to make the same mistake in 2020. This city, Milwaukee, is where they're going to be holding their convention this summer in July, but President Trump really has a strong economy on his side. And take a look at this video from overnight. This is a group of supporters who waited outside to get in here to this rally overnight in freezing temperatures in a little bit of snow. Hundreds, thousands of people now inside, but it just goes to show you, Neil, if they're willing to wait outside in the Milwaukee winter, you know that they will go to the polls on Election Day -- Neil."
