CHARLES LANE, OPINION WRITER, \"WASHINGTON POST\": Well, what happened was Kyrsten Sinema said she didn't want to vote for anything that raised the capital gains rate or the corporate tax rate or the individual rate. Incidentally, this wasn't even Joe Manchin's objection. He was willing to raise the corporate rate, although he objected to a lot of spending. What strikes me is the enormous disconnect between what seems to be emerging from all of this and where the president started in his campaign and what he promised to do with the tax code, which was essentially undo a lot of the Trump tax can you say in 2017. With the exception of corporate minimum tax and this proposal on billionaires, which has got a lot of details left to be worked out, to put it mildly, that all seems to have gone out the window now, and that when all is said and done, the individual tax rates may remain from the Trump system. And I must say that, from a progressive or a liberal point of view, that's a very murky kind of an outcome. Yes, sure, it's great to nick the billionaires a little bit more.

MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR, \"THE FEDERALIST\": Think about how there is no Republican engagement with this because of how extreme it is. So we have the variation from super progressive folks to so-called moderates who are still willing to have trillions of dollars of additional spending. And this is pretty radical. It's very different from what President Biden promised in his campaign. Chuck is talking about what he talked about the tax code, but he also said that he would be a moderate and a centrist, that he would unite the country. And he's pushing through a far left agenda. And it does seem like there is not a lot of thought going into it. I understand transportation funding is about to run out and they want to get the infrastructure bill passed. But it's also true that this scheme of having a few hundred billionaires is probably not the most effective way to handle it, because nothing like this has been done before, so we don't know what the effects of it would be. Mitt Romney talked about how this could cause people to move offshore. Wealth inequality is a big problem. But taxing the rich more is a less effective way than making sure that the middle class, which has suffered so much since the 1970s, could grow and expand.",
