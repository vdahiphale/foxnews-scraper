And some progressives and other Democrats were thinking he should have done this a lot earlier. And there were some questions about that in the briefing room today. But it certainly came across as a strong statement from this president, putting full responsibility for the January 6th riots and attack of the capitol on the former president, and doing so in a way that, though he has said so before, today really came across very strongly from him.",

MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR, \"THE FEDERALIST\": I thought it was interesting, I say as a former resident of Wyoming, how much she trashed the people of Wyoming in her interview with you. But even more interesting was that she said something that was not true, and it has serious implications. She falsely told you she's the ranking member on the committee. Ranking member means the top minority party appointed person, that means that, who the Republicans appointed to the committee. She was actually hand-selected by Nancy Pelosi and is not the ranking member. And the reason why that's important is because the rules for this committee require consultation with the ranking member, with the top Republican appointed person on the committee when you are subpoenaing people, or when you are bringing people in for testimony. And they know they are not doing that because Nancy Pelosi, of course, kicked the ranking member, appointed by the Republicans, Jim Banks, off the committee back in July. And so this is something that -- I was very surprised she said something that was not true, falsely claiming that she represents the Republican Conference on that committee. That is simply not true, and she needs to stop saying that. And I have reported actually in November she was falsely presenting herself this way. She confirmed it tonight.
