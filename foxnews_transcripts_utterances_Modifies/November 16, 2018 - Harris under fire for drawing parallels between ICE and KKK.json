I don't think she went in to the meeting with Nancy Pelosi thinking, hmmm, maybe I could get something out of this.

So -- what I do think, though, is the Democrats should just focus on substance and qualifications and not throw an ism out there. Every argument they have is sexism, racism, nativism, we're just sick of it. We'd rather just talk about the facts. And what this does, I think, is foreshadows what you're going to see in the Democratic primary when people run for president. You're going to have a woman who thought she was a Native American running against another black woman. Running against a straight white male. Maybe there's a gay Democrat in there. There's going to be so much, as Greg likes to say, identity politics on that stage. It's going to be interesting to see if Democrats really go after each other on those issues. Are they able to pull back and really debate on substance? I don't think they're going to be able to. It's too tempting for Democrats to throw these ism cards down because that's all they know."

The scary thing about this is, it's shifting from -- it used to be if the left disagreed with you, they thought you were evil, remember? We think they're wrong. They think you're evil.
