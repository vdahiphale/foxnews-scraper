It is 9:00 in New York City and this is \"The Five.\" We begin tonight with major developments on terrorism front from all over the world. In Paris today, a man attacked a police officer with a hammer while reportedly shouting \"This is for Syria\" before police shot and wounded him.  And in Australia, a man of Somali descent killed one and took a woman hostage before police shot him dead. ISIS is claiming responsibility. But first, new details are emerging about missed opportunities to Saturday's attack in London. Khuram Butt, one of the three London terrorists even appeared in a British documentary called \"The Jihadist Next Door.\" London police haven't yet confirmed it's him in the video but several media organizations have verified this authenticity.

The other thing that's happened is that their radicalization is speed up. So, as ISIS strengths its territory get strong. They are at now basically deputizing everybody around the world and saying, don't wait for us. Don't even come here to the caliphate. Just try to do your work there.  And the radicalization is speed up so much that now you actually have terrorists that are younger and younger. So, to Jesse's point, I understand like the desire to try to round them up but, and then, what to do with them from there? And like what are the charges that they are actually citizens of Western countries.  JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST, \"THE FIVE\": It's very difficult. And again, what you can do in a situation that you just described is, if people have dual passports, then take away their British citizenship. So, they can't come back in our country.

According to a statement from Operation Inherent Resolve, what we call the anti-ISIS coalition, U.S. backed forces have launched an offensive to drive ISIS from Raqqa, the so- called capital of the Islamic State. Recently, Rob O'Neill, the guy who killed bin Laden, told me the only way to destroy ISIS was to take back Raqqa and Mosul to prove the Islamic State was no state at all, because once you do that, you prove everything that ISIS has said to its groupies as a big, fat lie. Exposing that they are deadbeats makes it hard for them to recruit new bodies. No one wants to join a loser. ISIS was able to recruit because they portrayed themselves as teeming hordes raging across the desert, forcing those in their path to bend to their brutal demands. And they said God approved. For some reason, we took forever to counter this message. We thought they were JV! So we let it slide, as sexual losers the world over brought into this ISIS fantasy. Now, we must kill them all, and it seems that that's the plan. For example, you don't hear much about taking prisoners anymore. Maybe I missed it but I haven't seen a single prisoner. And ever since that first Gulf War, we've gotten used to seeing the march, surrenders, the taking of cities, the toppling of statues. Yet we see so little of that now. Maybe there's a reason for that? Maybe it's because what we're doing now is so unbending and so relentless the way it should have been all along. Dana, I don't know if my reasoning is correct.

In Paris today, a man attacked a police officer with a hammer while reportedly shouting \"This is for Syria\" before police shot and wounded him. And in Australia, a man of Somali descent killed one and took a woman hostage before police shot him dead. ISIS is claiming responsibility. But first, new details are emerging about missed opportunities to Saturday's attack in London. Khuram Butt, one of the three London terrorists even appeared in a British documentary called \"The Jihadist Next Door.\" London police haven't yet confirmed it's him in the video but several media organizations have verified this authenticity.

Being called a racist or Islamophobic which allows a force field. So, you can't touch them. I kept thinking, what if you divorced religion from their murderous assertions, then you would have a serial killer. And what if a serial killer announced before he was going to serial killed his plans publicly beforehand. Like one of these terrorists did when they were in an airport in Italy when he says, I am going to fight terror. You would, that is not a crime. But you could actually institutionalize them because they are insane. If somebody says that they are going to embark on mass murder, you could probably out of the -- that he might be mentally ill -- put them away. These people are insane. Put them away."

That is sad to me. Because we are really hindering the ability of law enforcement to do the job that they have been sworn to do to protect and serve. And instead, they want to give apologies to people like this for telling us directly what it is that it's in their hearts, that's in their minds, they are forecasting their intentions. But that's still not good enough. What do you want? Like only after the fact that the act is completed, that's sufficient? That's not what the law says. If you can catch people like this conspiring and you can catch like an act and further and stuff, that should be sufficient. And now, look, the world has to see this. Can you imagine how offensive and just deeply disturbing it is to the family members that have to watch these videos and hear these words and know that these people were identified and on the radar and absolutely nothing was done? Whose side are you playing for? That's what's bothers me so much. I mean, I don't understand. You know, mail it in. Hand it over to them. We are sorry. Are you offended? Have we offended your right to kill us? That's what I don't get. And we are seeing it play out in London. It's playing out throughout the world and it's playing out here in the United States.

What you are is, if you are a terrorist sympathizer or appear in a video, you are an unlit fuse and all it takes is one strike of a match and kaboom and people are dead. So, British authorities have to start rounding up unlit fuses right away because they can't let this stuff happen over and over again. It's kind of like child pornography.

The other thing that's happened is that their radicalization is speed up. So, as ISIS strengths its territory get strong. They are at now basically deputizing everybody around the world and saying, don't wait for us. Don't even come here to the caliphate. Just try to do your work there. And the radicalization is speed up so much that now you actually have terrorists that are younger and younger. So, to Jesse's point, I understand like the desire to try to round them up but, and then, what to do with them from there? And like what are the charges that they are actually citizens of Western countries. JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST, \"THE FIVE\": It's very difficult. And again, what you can do in a situation that you just described is, if people have dual passports, then take away their British citizenship. So, they can't come back in our country.

According to a statement from Operation Inherent Resolve, what we call the anti-ISIS coalition, U.S. backed forces have launched an offensive to drive ISIS from Raqqa, the so- called capital of the Islamic State. Recently, Rob O'Neill, the guy who killed bin Laden, told me the only way to destroy ISIS was to take back Raqqa and Mosul to prove the Islamic State was no state at all, because once you do that, you prove everything that ISIS has said to its groupies as a big, fat lie. Exposing that they are deadbeats makes it hard for them to recruit new bodies. No one wants to join a loser. ISIS was able to recruit because they portrayed themselves as teeming hordes raging across the desert, forcing those in their path to bend to their brutal demands. And they said God approved. For some reason, we took forever to counter this message. We thought they were JV! So we let it slide, as sexual losers the world over brought into this ISIS fantasy. Now, we must kill them all, and it seems that that's the plan. For example, you don't hear much about taking prisoners anymore. Maybe I missed it but I haven't seen a single prisoner. And ever since that first Gulf War, we've gotten used to seeing the march, surrenders, the taking of cities, the toppling of statues. Yet we see so little of that now. Maybe there's a reason for that? Maybe it's because what we're doing now is so unbending and so relentless the way it should have been all along. Dana, I don't know if my reasoning is correct. I know there is no press so I'm wondering if it -- is it chicken or the egg? Is there no press so there will be no mercy or there is just no press there and that's why we don't see it?"
