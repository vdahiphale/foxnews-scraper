I went back and looked at a column by 1987 by Richard Cohen in the \"The Washington Post\" about Joe Biden's first foreign major policy address as a candidate for president back then to Harvard. And he had a line in it about a generation renowned for not doing its homework may have met its next leader. To me, that's a real problem that we see with this approach. It really fails to learn from even recent history in terms of dealing with Russia. And unfortunately, I really believe that this foreign policy seems to have all the hallmarks of being about pleasing everybody but America. Does it care more about Brussels than it does about Chicago? Is the situation right now where Joe Biden is going over to Russia, having allowed the pipeline to continue over there, having completely ignored the Belorussian air piracy incident, and having floated this ludicrous idea that we are going to engage in some kind of trade of cyber criminals as if there is some moral equivalency or criminal equivalency between those that are participating on the Russian side and those that are active on American soil? It's absolutely ludicrous. I think that the Europeans, our allies, over there may be happy with a lot of it because it sounds rhetorical note that will receive a lot of praise, but in terms of the practical results, it does not do anything to actually confront Russia where it matters, to hold them to account for what they have done and for what they will continue to do.",

And the fact that she continues to get support from fellow members of the squad, fellow members of the Democratic Party, in a way is indicative to me of a very dangerous effect that's going on where we might see the issue of Israel and our alliance with it and our alliance with the Jewish people historically here in America becoming a more mono-partisan issue. That's always a dangerous thing. It's not good for the country. It's not good for our alliances.

      "utterance": "Ben? BEN DOMENECH, PUBLISHER, \"THE FEDERALIST\": That sounds like a forgone conclusion. It sounds like he is already spinning something that he expects to happen. I went back and looked at a column by 1987 by Richard Cohen in the \"The Washington Post\" about Joe Biden's first foreign major policy address as a candidate for president back then to Harvard. And he had a line in it about a generation renowned for not doing its homework may have met its next leader. To me, that's a real problem that we see with this approach. It really fails to learn from even recent history in terms of dealing with Russia. And unfortunately, I really believe that this foreign policy seems to have all the hallmarks of being about pleasing everybody but America. Does it care more about Brussels than it does about Chicago? Is the situation right now where Joe Biden is going over to Russia, having allowed the pipeline to continue over there, having completely ignored the Belorussian air piracy incident, and having floated this ludicrous idea that we are going to engage in some kind of trade of cyber criminals as if there is some moral equivalency or criminal equivalency between those that are participating on the Russian side and those that are active on American soil? It's absolutely ludicrous. I think that the Europeans, our allies, over there may be happy with a lot of it because it sounds rhetorical note that will receive a lot of praise, but in terms of the practical results, it does not do anything to actually confront Russia where it matters, to hold them to account for what they have done and for what they will continue to do."

This one, the G-7 at least, the communique, 25- pages long, was pretty watered down even when it came to China and Russia. A few sentences in there maybe expressed concerns, but not really pointed. The one thing, though, out of NATO today that raised my eyebrows and perked my ears was that they are considering adding Ukraine as a NATO member. And if that is, in fact, the case, that is a huge deal for that region. Here's the president answering a question about that."

But that would be a phenomenal move, to say, you know what, Ukraine is with us now. So don't mess with them anymore. That's what I'm talking about. Don't give a sermon. Show me a sermon. Don't give a stern lecture like Obama did and kick out a bunch of nameless diplomats after Russia tried to interfere with our election. That's all he did is kicked out a bunch of diplomats and not a single one of us can name one he kicked out. Not one."

She clarified the moral equivalency comment which was asinine and completely wrong. She has said other things in the past that I don't agree with. There are some Democrats I don't agree with, and there are many Republicans I don't agree with. I think substantive debate we should welcome, but when it's hateful and it's, frankly, it lacks a factual basis, it has to be challenged."

Bret, here's my point. We are going to disagree with people. We should have these substantive conversations. I would say that the congresswoman and some of her supporters who thought that the criticism she received, Congresswoman Omar, the criticism she received was unfair, maybe racist or Islamophobic, you're entitled to free speech, but you're not entitled to people's analysis and critical judgment of your speech. We should welcome that and want that."

We see an absolutely virulent and disturbing rise in anti-Semitic hate crimes across this country that should concern all of us. And the fact that the congresswoman continues to engage in this kind of behavior and this kind of speech is very disturbing. And the fact that she continues to get support from fellow members of the squad, fellow members of the Democratic Party, in a way is indicative to me of a very dangerous effect that's going on where we might see the issue of Israel and our alliance with it and our alliance with the Jewish people historically here in America becoming a more mono-partisan issue. That's always a dangerous thing. It's not good for the country. It's not good for our alliances. And it's something that I would hope would receive much stronger condemnation from the leadership of the Democratic Party along the line of what we saw from Bill Clinton in his Sister Souljah moment and that historically has been an element of leadership within that party."

What I fear are the smart, reasonable Democrats like Harold Ford Jr., Jim Himes, Kyrsten Sinema, that's what I fear. The anti-Jewish, anti-American, anti-cop Democrats like Representative Omar, I hope she lives and serves forever because she is the best hope we have at retaking the House."
