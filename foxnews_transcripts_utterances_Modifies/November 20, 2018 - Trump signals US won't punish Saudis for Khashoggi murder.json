President Reagan did that very well. President Trump is either incapable or unwilling to do that.

If was basically if they are going to give us money, we need them. And I'm competing for contracts with the Russians and the Chinese.  And I think there is no better statement from his ally, Rand Paul, who said this is not America first, this is Saudi Arabia first.

Everyone is worrying about this terrible opioid crisis. I'm reminded of C.S. Lewis who said when in a flood, don't grab for the hoses. We are making this problem worse. There are more people in drug treatment for marijuana than all other drugs combined. And if you want to know how people get into other serious drugs, it's through marijuana. Not primarily through the mis-prescription, the overprescribing of drugs at CVS, but it's from marijuana. So be careful.   Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

And it's an astonishingly frank, realist kind of statement, and I think even his supporters wish he could probably find more of a middle ground. I think John was suggesting that, more of a middle ground to take more into account, the humans right issues involved, at the same time still reaffirming the relationship between the U.S. and the Saudis."

      "utterance": "Right. I think, A.B., that his supporters say this is somebody speaking out without the filter, and that other presidents might not have said it publicly but this is what they were probably thinking. The foreign minister from Iran tweeted out, Zarif, \"Mr. Trump bizarrely devotes his first paragraph of his shameful statement on Saudi atrocities to accuse Iran of every sort of malfeasance he can think of it. Perhaps we're also responsible for the California fires because we didn't help rake the forests -- just like the Fins do.\" So getting in a jab there from Iran's perspective."

      "utterance": "The message that this sends around the world to our allies and our adversaries is one of weakness and abandonment of our values. The president fails to affirm our commitment to the values that make us great. His statement said -- it was a statement of standing with Saudi Arabia. There was no balance, there was none of the values and commitments that you discuss your commitment to and then you pivot to the importance of a relationship. If was basically if they are going to give us money, we need them. And I'm competing for contracts with the Russians and the Chinese. And I think there is no better statement from his ally, Rand Paul, who said this is not America first, this is Saudi Arabia first. The condemnation has been swift and profound, and it's because the president is not acting in the best interests of this country when he solely makes this a business arrangement."

      "utterance": "I think in Massachusetts, a lot of celebration, first sale of recreational marijuana. I will predict that they will come to regret this, as they are coming to regret this in Colorado. They will make a lot of money, but if you want to invest, you should probably invest in treatment centers, because you will see a huge explosion in that. Everyone is worrying about this terrible opioid crisis. I'm reminded of C.S. Lewis who said when in a flood, don't grab for the hoses. We are making this problem worse. There are more people in drug treatment for marijuana than all other drugs combined. And if you want to know how people get into other serious drugs, it's through marijuana. Not primarily through the mis-prescription, the overprescribing of drugs at CVS, but it's from marijuana. So be careful. Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.
