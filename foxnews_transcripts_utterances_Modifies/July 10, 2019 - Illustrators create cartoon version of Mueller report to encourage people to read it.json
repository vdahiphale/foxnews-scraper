      "sentences": "Good evening, and welcome to “Tucker Carlson Tonight.” Like many of you, we've been watching with amazement and some real alarm, as leaders of the Democratic Party day after day attack the country they say they want to govern. It is remarkable. And it's a very new development by the way. Just a few years ago, even the most liberal Democrats in Congress felt obligated to say patriotic things about America. They may not have felt it, but they said it and that matters.  Now, it's routine to hear Democratic presidential candidates question the basic legitimacy of the United States, even supposed moderates like Joe Biden join in. And that should worry you. No country can survive being ruled by people who hate it. And we deserve better.  For all of our country's flaws, this is still the best place in the world. Most immigrants know that, and that's why they come here. It's also why we've always been glad to have them here. But now there are signs that some people who move here from abroad don't like this country at all.  As we told you last night, one of those people now serves in our Congress.",

      "sentences": "In fact, the United States is the kindest, most open-minded place on the planet. The U.S. has done more for other people and received less in return than any nation in history by far. Americans like to help, it makes us feel good. Some of our deepest satisfaction as a country comes from watching penniless, immigrants arrive on our shores, buy into our values and thrive. We call it the American dream and nothing makes us prouder.  It was in that spirit that in 1992, the United States welcomed 10-year-old, Ilhan Omar and her family. Omar was born in Somalia, one of the world's poorest countries, who was then ruled by a Marxist military dictatorship.   When Omar was six, she and her parents and their six siblings fled a worsening Civil War and wound up in a refugee camp in Kenya. They spent four years there until America offered the family asylum here and let them settle in Minneapolis. Omar's father drove a taxi at first, then got a job at the Post Office working for the government. Omar, meanwhile, grew up free in the world's richest country with all the bounty that that implies. She became a citizen, then went to work for the State University. A few years later, she became a Member of Congress elected by voters who were proud to see an immigrant succeed.   Omar is now at the age of only 36, one of the most powerful women in America. It's an amazing story really. Only in this country could it have happened. Ilhan Omar has an awful lot to be grateful for, but she isn't grateful. Not at all. After everything America has done for Omar and for her family, she hates this country more than ever. In a recent piece in \"The Washington Post,\" the reporter put it this way, quote, \"In Omar's version, America isn't the big hearted country that saved her from a brutal war and a bleak refugee camp. It wasn't a meritocracy that helped her attend college or vaulted her into Congress. Instead, it was the country that had failed to live up to its founding ideals, a place that had disappointed her and so many immigrants, refugees and minorities like her,\" end quote.  If anything, that's an understatement. Omar isn't disappointed in America, she is enraged by it. Virtually every public statement she makes accuses Americans of bigotry and racism. \"This is an immoral country,\" she says. She has undisguised contempt for the United States and for its people.",

      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "sentences": "Think about that for a minute. Our country rescued Ilhan Omar from the single worst place on Earth. We didn't do it to get rich. In fact, it cost us money. We did it because we are kind people. How did Omar respond to the remarkable gift we gave her? She scolded us and called us names. She showered us with contempt. It's infuriating.  But more than that, it's also ominous. The United States admits more immigrants in any country on Earth, more than a million every year. The Democratic Party demands that we increase that number and admit far more. Okay. Americans like immigrants, but immigrants have got to like us back. That's the key. It's essential, otherwise the country falls apart.  We made that point last night. We'll continue to make that point because it's true and it's important to say it out loud, even if no one else is willing to. Needless to say, the left went berserk. They hate it when you say the truth things.  Ilhan Omar and her allies in Congress immediately demanded that this show be pulled off the air. They didn't rebut what we said, any of our points or even acknowledge them. They just tried to silence us. That's how they operate. And of course they called us racist. On one level that's amusing given how absurd the charge is. This show more than any other show on television has taken an aggressive position in favor of colorblind equality and against racism, particularly the casual racism of the modern world left.  We despise the current habit of judging people on the basis of their skin color. It's wrong. We say that virtually every night. Racist? No. We're against racism, adamantly.   Omar consistently puts her own race at the center of the conversation, but to us, it's irrelevant. Ayaan Hirsi Ali, for example, would by the standards of identity politics by Omar's standards seem to have everything in common with Ilhan Omar. Like Omar she was born in Somalia, moved to Kenya and eventually came to this country. Unlike Omar, Ali loves and cares about the United States. She believes our country is superior to the country she came from and she says that. For saying that, the left despises her. Omar's friend Linda Sarsour once tweeted that Ali deserves to be mutilated for her beliefs. So two Somali immigrants, one among the most impressive people in America, the other among the least, it's not about race.  But of course Omar and her friends already know that. Nothing they say on the subject race is sincere. It's all a hustle designed to get them what they want.  Omar has made a career of denouncing anyone and anything in her way as racist. That would include virtually all of her political and personal opponents. It includes even inanimate objects like the proposed border wall, that's racist. So is the United States Congress, so as the entire state of North Dakota, she once tweeted. Omar maybe from another country, but she learned young that crying racism pays. The bigger question is who taught her that? She didn't arrive from a Kenyan refugee camp denouncing people as bigots for political gain, she wasn't always a professional victim. That's learned behavior. Unfortunately, she learned it here.   So in some ways, the real villain in the Ilhan Omar story isn't Omar herself. It's a group of our fellow Americans. It's our cultural gatekeepers who stoke the resentment of new arrivals and turn them into grievance mongers like Ilhan Omar. The left did that to her, and to us, blame them first.  Zudhi Jasser is a physician. He is also the President of the American Islamic Forum for Democracy and author of the book, \"A Battle for the Soul of Islam.\" We're proud to have him join us tonight.  Doctor, thanks very much for coming on. So just to boil it right down, does a country -- any country -- have a right and an interest in bringing in immigrants who love that country?",

So we shouldn't be accepting not only Islamists, but communists, and autocrats and party apparatchiks from any regime around the planet, we have an obligation to do that and that's the vetting my family went through.

She said we were terrorists, we were killing thousands of Somali citizens.  That's the world view she has which she has then come up with herself. That's the Islamist lobby. The left, the red-green lobby that she is a part of globally. And the left gets in bed with the Islamist because they want to tear down what America stands for globally and the power that we have to advance liberty and democracy. And I, as an American-Muslim, I take offense to the fact that they're gaslighting you into saying that you're a racist. This is gaslighting. There's no reality behind it. The bottom line is, Tucker, they don't want to have a conversation with us, Muslims, that we reject theocrats, that we have a diversity of opinion, that we're all just one bunch of ladies in hijab or whatever superficial description they want to have of us and not deal with the ideas in our hearts.",

At that time, everyone in the press was all in behind Hillary Clinton, even though she and her husband Bill made more than $150 million from 2001 to 2015 for doing basically no work. And then how about the Obama's? They're still pretty popular. What do you think they're doing these days? Saving the world making it better? No, they are cashing in. A lot of people want Michelle to run for President or that she received $65 million for a book advance in 2017, $65 million for a book. And last year, they signed a deal with Netflix to produce a special series. We don't know exactly how much they're getting paid. Probably, they're not working for free. No one seems to care about that at all. So you know what's going on.  The problem isn't that Joe Biden is too rich, though he is kind of greedy, it looks like, but that's not the problem. They can't find fault with his policies either. He's become just as extreme as the rest of the Democratic Party. For 2019 Democrats, the problem with Joe Biden is what he looks like, let's be honest. Okay. Well, speaking of rich people running for President, billionaire Tom Steyer has become the latest Democrat to enter the race. He previously spent his vast fortune trying to impeach the President and fight global warming. At least one of those things didn't work. Now he says, he is ready to spend $100 million to run the country. Does he have a shot?

      "utterance": "Good evening, and welcome to “Tucker Carlson Tonight.” Like many of you, we've been watching with amazement and some real alarm, as leaders of the Democratic Party day after day attack the country they say they want to govern. It is remarkable. And it's a very new development by the way. Just a few years ago, even the most liberal Democrats in Congress felt obligated to say patriotic things about America. They may not have felt it, but they said it and that matters. Now, it's routine to hear Democratic presidential candidates question the basic legitimacy of the United States, even supposed moderates like Joe Biden join in. And that should worry you. No country can survive being ruled by people who hate it. And we deserve better. For all of our country's flaws, this is still the best place in the world. Most immigrants know that, and that's why they come here. It's also why we've always been glad to have them here. But now there are signs that some people who move here from abroad don't like this country at all. As we told you last night, one of those people now serves in our Congress."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "In fact, the United States is the kindest, most open-minded place on the planet. The U.S. has done more for other people and received less in return than any nation in history by far. Americans like to help, it makes us feel good. Some of our deepest satisfaction as a country comes from watching penniless, immigrants arrive on our shores, buy into our values and thrive. We call it the American dream and nothing makes us prouder. It was in that spirit that in 1992, the United States welcomed 10-year-old, Ilhan Omar and her family. Omar was born in Somalia, one of the world's poorest countries, who was then ruled by a Marxist military dictatorship. When Omar was six, she and her parents and their six siblings fled a worsening Civil War and wound up in a refugee camp in Kenya. They spent four years there until America offered the family asylum here and let them settle in Minneapolis. Omar's father drove a taxi at first, then got a job at the Post Office working for the government. Omar, meanwhile, grew up free in the world's richest country with all the bounty that that implies. She became a citizen, then went to work for the State University. A few years later, she became a Member of Congress elected by voters who were proud to see an immigrant succeed. Omar is now at the age of only 36, one of the most powerful women in America. It's an amazing story really. Only in this country could it have happened. Ilhan Omar has an awful lot to be grateful for, but she isn't grateful. Not at all. After everything America has done for Omar and for her family, she hates this country more than ever. In a recent piece in \"The Washington Post,\" the reporter put it this way, quote, \"In Omar's version, America isn't the big hearted country that saved her from a brutal war and a bleak refugee camp. It wasn't a meritocracy that helped her attend college or vaulted her into Congress. Instead, it was the country that had failed to live up to its founding ideals, a place that had disappointed her and so many immigrants, refugees and minorities like her,\" end quote. If anything, that's an understatement. Omar isn't disappointed in America, she is enraged by it. Virtually every public statement she makes accuses Americans of bigotry and racism. \"This is an immoral country,\" she says. She has undisguised contempt for the United States and for its people."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Think about that for a minute. Our country rescued Ilhan Omar from the single worst place on Earth. We didn't do it to get rich. In fact, it cost us money. We did it because we are kind people. How did Omar respond to the remarkable gift we gave her? She scolded us and called us names. She showered us with contempt. It's infuriating. But more than that, it's also ominous. The United States admits more immigrants in any country on Earth, more than a million every year. The Democratic Party demands that we increase that number and admit far more. Okay. Americans like immigrants, but immigrants have got to like us back. That's the key. It's essential, otherwise the country falls apart. We made that point last night. We'll continue to make that point because it's true and it's important to say it out loud, even if no one else is willing to. Needless to say, the left went berserk. They hate it when you say the truth things. Ilhan Omar and her allies in Congress immediately demanded that this show be pulled off the air. They didn't rebut what we said, any of our points or even acknowledge them. They just tried to silence us. That's how they operate. And of course they called us racist. On one level that's amusing given how absurd the charge is. This show more than any other show on television has taken an aggressive position in favor of colorblind equality and against racism, particularly the casual racism of the modern world left. We despise the current habit of judging people on the basis of their skin color. It's wrong. We say that virtually every night. Racist? No. We're against racism, adamantly. Omar consistently puts her own race at the center of the conversation, but to us, it's irrelevant. Ayaan Hirsi Ali, for example, would by the standards of identity politics by Omar's standards seem to have everything in common with Ilhan Omar. Like Omar she was born in Somalia, moved to Kenya and eventually came to this country. Unlike Omar, Ali loves and cares about the United States. She believes our country is superior to the country she came from and she says that. For saying that, the left despises her. Omar's friend Linda Sarsour once tweeted that Ali deserves to be mutilated for her beliefs. So two Somali immigrants, one among the most impressive people in America, the other among the least, it's not about race. But of course Omar and her friends already know that. Nothing they say on the subject race is sincere. It's all a hustle designed to get them what they want. Omar has made a career of denouncing anyone and anything in her way as racist. That would include virtually all of her political and personal opponents. It includes even inanimate objects like the proposed border wall, that's racist. So is the United States Congress, so as the entire state of North Dakota, she once tweeted. Omar maybe from another country, but she learned young that crying racism pays. The bigger question is who taught her that? She didn't arrive from a Kenyan refugee camp denouncing people as bigots for political gain, she wasn't always a professional victim. That's learned behavior. Unfortunately, she learned it here. So in some ways, the real villain in the Ilhan Omar story isn't Omar herself. It's a group of our fellow Americans. It's our cultural gatekeepers who stoke the resentment of new arrivals and turn them into grievance mongers like Ilhan Omar. The left did that to her, and to us, blame them first. Zudhi Jasser is a physician. He is also the President of the American Islamic Forum for Democracy and author of the book, \"A Battle for the Soul of Islam.\" We're proud to have him join us tonight. Doctor, thanks very much for coming on. So just to boil it right down, does a country -- any country -- have a right and an interest in bringing in immigrants who love that country?"

So we shouldn't be accepting not only Islamists, but communists, and autocrats and party apparatchiks from any regime around the planet, we have an obligation to do that and that's the vetting my family went through.

She said we were terrorists, we were killing thousands of Somali citizens. That's the world view she has which she has then come up with herself. That's the Islamist lobby. The left, the red-green lobby that she is a part of globally. And the left gets in bed with the Islamist because they want to tear down what America stands for globally and the power that we have to advance liberty and democracy. And I, as an American-Muslim, I take offense to the fact that they're gaslighting you into saying that you're a racist. This is gaslighting. There's no reality behind it. The bottom line is, Tucker, they don't want to have a conversation with us, Muslims, that we reject theocrats, that we have a diversity of opinion, that we're all just one bunch of ladies in hijab or whatever superficial description they want to have of us and not deal with the ideas in our hearts."

Omar said the real villain in the story is, you guessed it, America, because America caused what she called systemic alienation in the terrorists and drove them towards violence. It's our fault.

Yes, she has commented on Israel, but she has built a career on attacking American-Jews. She has said that American-Jews control Congress. She has insinuated, for example, that Jews have dual loyalty, she has tweeted support for Hamas. These things have nothing to do with Israel. They are direct attacks on American-Jews, a minority community in the United States. And what she does is she hides behind the fact that number one, she is a Muslim and a woman as though that insulates her from criticism, and anybody who criticize what she says is automatically Islamophobic or racist. And she also hides behind, \"Well, you know, I'm just criticizing Israel.\" But think about if you had a problem, for example, with the Chinese government, would you turn around to local Chinese-Americans and discriminate against them?

Most people in the left, embrace the so-called BDS Movement, the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions Movement, which advocates for commercial discrimination, illegal commercial discrimination against Israeli Jews. My organization, for example, right now is suing the National Lawyers Guild, one of the oldest lawyers guilds in America, because they have a resolution and they've implemented that resolution and refuse to do business with Israeli Jews. The rise of anti-Semitism, not just in the Democratic Party, but in the left, I think, is that the level of a national emergency. I mean, we have over half of all hate crimes in this country target Jews, target Jewish- Americans, but you wouldn't know that from you know, reading the media. And so when you have, you know, Jewish children, for example, going to school with armed guards in this country, in 2019, we have a major problem with the rise of anti-Semitism here and Ilhan Omar is just a small part of it and a symptom of it."

Recent financial disclosures show that Biden and his wife made $15 million in the last couple of years, mostly from book deals and speeches. Some Democrats are not happy for his success.

No one seemed to believe that during the 2016 Democratic race. At that time, everyone in the press was all in behind Hillary Clinton, even though she and her husband Bill made more than $150 million from 2001 to 2015 for doing basically no work. And then how about the Obama's? They're still pretty popular. What do you think they're doing these days? Saving the world making it better? No, they are cashing in. A lot of people want Michelle to run for President or that she received $65 million for a book advance in 2017, $65 million for a book. And last year, they signed a deal with Netflix to produce a special series. We don't know exactly how much they're getting paid. Probably, they're not working for free. No one seems to care about that at all. So you know what's going on. The problem isn't that Joe Biden is too rich, though he is kind of greedy, it looks like, but that's not the problem. They can't find fault with his policies either. He's become just as extreme as the rest of the Democratic Party. For 2019 Democrats, the problem with Joe Biden is what he looks like, let's be honest. Okay. Well, speaking of rich people running for President, billionaire Tom Steyer has become the latest Democrat to enter the race. He previously spent his vast fortune trying to impeach the President and fight global warming. At least one of those things didn't work. Now he says, he is ready to spend $100 million to run the country. Does he have a shot?

He was maybe unhappy that they didn't try to push impeachment enough, you know, and he is kind of a one trick pony. Like he's an impeachment guy.

If money was all it takes to be President, then you know, Jeb Bush would have been the nominee in 2016 for the Republicans and Hillary Clinton would be President today. It's not money that makes a big difference. You have to have \"it.\" And I don't think Tom Steyer has \"it.\" I know that people who know him like him very much. They say he is a really nice person. But I don't see the charisma and also he doesn't have any name ID. When President Trump entered the race late in 2015, he had almost universal name ID.

Tom Steyer, before it was impeachment, he was all in on climate change and the Green New Deal would seem to me to be like perfect, like right up his alley, but they've already adopted that. So what new are you bringing to the race? And I do think that the Democrats somewhat tried to give Hillary Clinton a hard time. Remember the whole debate about the transcripts of her speeches to Wall Street? Bernie Sanders and his team were the ones who were really kind of pushing on that. I think they're about to do the same thing to Joe Biden. But you know, Joe Biden has spent 45 years in public service. I don't begrudge him going out there and trying to make money in the market."

Instead, they farm out security to airlines who pay private contractors and trust them to stop explosives from ending up airborne in catering carts. But our investigation turned up TSA internal audits that prove these private contractors repeatedly failed to follow protocol.

This TSA document says that TSA inspectors around the country need to come up with changes to their catering security program. The TSA told me tonight they discovered these issues as part of a Special Emphasis Assessment giving us this statement saying in part, quote, \"As with each Special Emphasis Assessment, a working group convenes to discuss potential enhancements to policy security measures, training and procedures as a result of the assessments findings.\" Tucker, we obtained this Special Assessment and it shows food is not the only thing going on board unchecked.

Alejandro A.J. Jones told the \"Detroit Free Press\" he had a couple of vodka-based drinks and ordered shrimp and fish from a local food shack. And then after returning to the resort where he was staying, started to feel sick. He says he spent the next five days lying in bed then flew to Florida where he has a home. The day after arriving, he says, he collapsed, recovered for a while, then suddenly got stomach pains again and couldn't breathe.

Remember, he is appointed in May of 2017 because that's when the Inspector General exposes Mueller's team to this infamous texts about you know, \"Smelly Walmart people and how Trump and all of these things --\" So Mueller must know there's something going on there.

But what's fascinating is in the report, he leaves out all the information that indicates that the Trump team is in fact innocent. I'll give you one easy example. They talk about these contacts -- these dreaded contacts -- between Paul Manafort and this guy Konstantin Kilimnik who has connections to Russian it's made to sound all nefarious, by the time you're done reading, you're like, \"Oh my gosh, Paul Manafort is like Agent X from the X-Men or something, this is incredible. He sold us out.\" Until you find out later it is not in the Mueller report. That Konstantin Kilimnik was a source for the Obama State Department for a long time before that, and nobody brought up any of these issues. One more quick one, the attorney who shows up at Trump Tower for that evil Trump Tower meeting where he talked about Russian adoptions. The attorney who shows up was working for the team hired by Mrs. Clinton to gain oppo research on Trump -- you're not going to find that anywhere in the Mueller report, which is really the Mueller op-ed.

      "utterance": "It's appalling. It's a very nasty story that's going on right now in San Francisco. It's more than about free speech and censorship, though it is about that. And it's not just about philistinism, which is hostility toward art, and what art does, and in this particular case, ignorance and illiteracy about the particular art and question. It's much worse. What we're talking about here is really vandalism. What's going on here is no different than the Taliban blowing up the Bamiyan Buddhas in Afghanistan or ISIS destroying tombs in Palmyra, Syria. This is really a destruction of a work of art. It's nothing else than -- nothing besides vandalism."

You know, I'm a liberal, I get it. But don't do this.\" We couldn't find a single person other than you. Why? Why is nobody saying anything?"

      "utterance": "I think they're a coward. The feeling is that you'd be attacked as a racist, or white supremacist if you objected to this. There has been some liberal pushback. There Bari Weiss's piece in \"The New York Times\" that prompted my letter to \"The Times.\" There were some I thought rather tepid statements from the arts honchos in in San Francisco, very well-crafted, careful statements supporting the murals themselves. Although, in one example, one of the guys said, \"Well, maybe we could just cover them up rather than destroy them.\" And by the way, this is not about the covering up of the works of art, it's about their destruction. One woman said that she will not be satisfied until the white paint goes on to the murals. There's a very vindictive, hostile, nasty quality to all of this."

      "utterance": "Well, the destruction of art is permanent. You can't get it back again. And this is done in the name of, you know, presumably protraction of the students there who are traumatized or affected by it. The Board of Education does not say, you know, \"We're philistines, we hate art.\" They say, \"We're protecting the emotional state of these students in the school.\" Of course, by that line of reasoning, Jewish students shouldn't read \"The Diary of Anne Frank.\" You really have a situation here where people are deciding -- taking upon themselves and deciding, the San Francisco School Board has total autonomy in this case, they decide what art can be available to people and what cannot and by the way, this is public art. This was done during the WPA by a communist painter, who wanted to show that that our general myths in America about George Washington have been a whitewash version of history. So you have Washington with slaves, you have colonists walking over a body of a dead Native American, et cetera."
