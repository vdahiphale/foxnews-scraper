The first is the phone call that Donald Trump is alleged to have made involves solicitation, acceptance, or receiving a donation from a foreign national in conjunction with an election. If that's the case, that's against the law, that is illegal, it's the FEC law. But it's the report that John Roberts put at the top of the hour where he talked about the White House saying they are taking the transcripts and trying to button them up versus what Nancy Pelosi is claiming is a cover- up. It was a transfer of the call to the coded computer server that I think is going to be the biggest problem for this White House. If people witnessed this call and were so troubled by it that they then transferred it to a separate computer system because it was politically damaging, and then they covered it up doing that, that is a big problem. And were there other instances? I think that to me was the most shocking part of the day.",

If certain things have transpired, we are getting indications that may not have happened, number one. Number two, that if it did happen, it happened as a result of calls being leaked as a precaution, not as a hiding the ball. That's their perception on the inside. CHARLES HURT, OPINION EDITOR, \"WASHINGTON TIMES\": And of course, we also spent the day listening to a guy we were told yesterday or in the last couple of days had threatened to resign or was going to resign over protests about this very issue, which turned out not to be true.  But the other thing is I think Democrats have a real hard time making the case that Donald Trump tried to cover something up when he and he alone made the decision to release this information, release not only the transcript of the phone call, but also the whistleblower report, which is not -- I don't think it's damning, but it's also not exactly a flattering thing either. And so if it's a cover-up it's kind of the worst cover of ever.  But throughout the whole process, Democrats have -- they are trying to thread this weird needle. For three years, we've been listening to Democrats say that they want to impeach Donald Trump for not taking Russian meddling in the 2016 elections seriously enough, and then evidence surfaces showing that he's trying to get to the bottom of meddling in the 2016 election, and now they want to impeach him for that.

The conversation with the prime minister of Australia and the president of Mexico.  And to Charlie's point, it's very interesting to compare the president's reaction here and Joe Biden. Joe Biden, if you bring of his son Hunter, that's unfair, don't ask questions, starts attacking the reporter, won't tell us what happened. I'd like to see if there was any advice at the time to him from the administration about that. Where President Trump released a transcript and now the complaint. And we go back on the complaint.

And to have Congress sitting there refusing to do anything about the USMCA, the trade deal with Canada and Mexico, when I think that it's clear that a majority of Democrats will go along with it -- the fact they are spending their time doing what they did today instead of that really makes them look bad, and makes Trump look serious and good.",

But it's the report that John Roberts put at the top of the hour where he talked about the White House saying they are taking the transcripts and trying to button them up versus what Nancy Pelosi is claiming is a cover- up. It was a transfer of the call to the coded computer server that I think is going to be the biggest problem for this White House. If people witnessed this call and were so troubled by it that they then transferred it to a separate computer system because it was politically damaging, and then they covered it up doing that, that is a big problem. And were there other instances? I think that to me was the most shocking part of the day."

      "utterance": "From this complaint, and you rightly say if, if it happened. And that is where we are in this. If certain things have transpired, we are getting indications that may not have happened, number one. Number two, that if it did happen, it happened as a result of calls being leaked as a precaution, not as a hiding the ball. That's their perception on the inside. CHARLES HURT, OPINION EDITOR, \"WASHINGTON TIMES\": And of course, we also spent the day listening to a guy we were told yesterday or in the last couple of days had threatened to resign or was going to resign over protests about this very issue, which turned out not to be true. But the other thing is I think Democrats have a real hard time making the case that Donald Trump tried to cover something up when he and he alone made the decision to release this information, release not only the transcript of the phone call, but also the whistleblower report, which is not -- I don't think it's damning, but it's also not exactly a flattering thing either. And so if it's a cover-up it's kind of the worst cover of ever. But throughout the whole process, Democrats have -- they are trying to thread this weird needle. For three years, we've been listening to Democrats say that they want to impeach Donald Trump for not taking Russian meddling in the 2016 elections seriously enough, and then evidence surfaces showing that he's trying to get to the bottom of meddling in the 2016 election, and now they want to impeach him for that. I feel like Democrats, they need to pick one or the other."

      "speaker": "TRUMP",
      "utterance": "Basically, that person never saw the report, never saw the call. He never saw the call -- heard something, and decided that he or she or whoever the hell it is -- sort of like almost a spy. I want to know who's the person that gave the whistleblower, who's the person that gave the whistleblower the information? Because that's close to a spy. You know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart, right? The spies and treason, we used to handle it a little bit differently that we do now."

      "utterance": "Look, I think the president has a point. He doesn't trust the intelligence community, and I think he has good reason to. Remember, we had two chiefs, I believe John Brennan and Mr. Clapper, calling him a Russian agent on television. The calls -- if they move the calls, part of that was they'd been leaked before. The conversation with the prime minister of Australia and the president of Mexico. And to Charlie's point, it's very interesting to compare the president's reaction here and Joe Biden. Joe Biden, if you bring of his son Hunter, that's unfair, don't ask questions, starts attacking the reporter, won't tell us what happened. I'd like to see if there was any advice at the time to him from the administration about that. Where President Trump released a transcript and now the complaint. And we go back on the complaint. I don't think a court will say that the law applies to the president. He's not a member of the intelligence community, and I just don't --"

    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Here's the impeachment process, the initiation process, six committees conduct investigations. Next stop usually initiated when a resolution leaves the Judiciary Committee. Judiciary conducts an investigate, can mark-up articles of impeachment for a full House vote. If the House approves the impeachment resolution, it heads to the Senate, then for a trial. Do you sense, Mary Anne, that we are going to get to that very point where there is a vote? Are we heading there? Do they have the votes?"

    {
      "speaker": "MARSH",
      "utterance": "I don't think we know that today, but I think you are seeing the possibility of it, because people are looking into every element of this. If Trump made the call that I referenced about solicitation, that is illegal. There are many other actions underneath that that are illegal. You could see how this ends up to a vote in the House. But what is most interesting to me was the unanimous vote in the Senate to release the whistleblower complaint. And you're starting to see some cracks in Republicans, including on the Republican House side. So I think this looks more possible than people think."

    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "But the DNI said today that he didn't stonewall, he just delayed, and he moved the complaint, and actually the inspector general sent it to the DOJ. The DOJ then sent it to the FBI, which than the determination was made that there wasn't an illegal act committed in campaign finance."

    {
      "speaker": "MARSH",
      "utterance": "So the DNI process when it says shall provide to Congress doesn't stop at the DOJ, stop at the White House, and get a bunch of opinions. It should have gone directly to Congress. The problem here is the same thing happened with the Mueller report. Mueller gave the report to Barr. Barr made it his own version. Not only did he put it to the Congress weeks later, to this very day we do not have the full Mueller report, the evidence, or the documents associated with it."

      "speaker": "HURT",
      "utterance": "I have a slightly different read on that unanimous vote. Obviously, there are some never-Trumpers, anti-Trumpers in the Republican Party. There always and there always will be. I take that as being a confidence among Republicans that they want the stuff out there because, first of all, they believe in airing the information, but also because, like Donald Trump, they're not concerned about the truth being out there because it doesn't amount to impeachment in the end."

He listed them off, a lot of individual leaders as well as the western hemisphere leaders about Venezuela, Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Chile, Ecuador, Peru. A lot of interesting conversations. We are back with the panel. Charlie, obviously the news overtook this moment, but it was kind of a big week."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HURT",
      "utterance": "Yes, and I think, quite frankly, it sort of a dangerous situation I think Democrats could find themselves in because when you're talking about things like the situation in Iran or the situation with these trade deals, and it's important to remember President Trump wins or loses based on the economy, and the reason that a lot of us think he's going to win in 2020 is because the economy is doing very well and he's working very hard to get some of these trade deals squared away. And to have Congress sitting there refusing to do anything about the USMCA, the trade deal with Canada and Mexico, when I think that it's clear that a majority of Democrats will go along with it -- the fact they are spending their time doing what they did today instead of that really makes them look bad, and makes Trump look serious and good."

      "utterance": "I think they can do both. What was striking to me was Trump's speech. I think many people thought he would talk about Iran more and the situation in the Middle East. He gave a very nationalistic speech, extolling nationalism at the U.N., which was founded in the wake of World War II that was brought on by nationalism. And I thought that was a very striking speech. You've never seen another president of the United States give a speech like that at the U.N. And I think it says a lot about where Donald Trump is today and what's going on around the world with so many leaders embracing populism."

I'm not going to shy away from it. I will say one thing that got lost in the news, a pet interest of mine, the president had some strong language on Hong Kong, warning the Chinese. Before he talked about the trade deal, this time he mentioned the joint declaration. It's very important because in a few days we are going to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the Communist Party in China, and people are expecting things not to go well in Hong Kong. It was interesting that the president had a paragraph or two on that."

And I think you're seeing - - what's so interesting to me is the way Trump campaigns and nationalism and populism in the United States and you start to look at the Democratic primary where you start to hear that -- Elizabeth Warren and the blue- collar workers and the hardworking middle America workers, where Trump and someone like Warren could meet, that's going to be a fascinating debate."
