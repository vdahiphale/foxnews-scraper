How dare you laugh at the suffering of others? So, speaking up lots of crazy stuff going around on the world and really, it's not fair to President Biden, or the Democrats for that matter. You see, after Trump, things were supposed to get really easy, right? The only thing that Democrats had to do was make sure Trump was out of the picture that everything was going to be all right. There would be rainbows and daffodils and sunshine and unicorns. I think I'm describing the sheets on Beto O'Rourke's bed. Not that I know. It was supposed to be returned to normalcy. You know, if you think it's normal to sniff children's hair. In short, they didn't have to do anything. Something they're usually great at. So, imagine the surprise when Trump left massive problems arise that didn't exist when Trump was around. And I'm not just talking about Joe's word salads or Pete Buttigieg knocked up. He's going to be a great mom. We're talking the biggest inflation in 40 years, right? The highest crime since the 70s and not the 1970s but 1570s. I just saw a guy hold up a CVS with a crossbow. If they start burning witches, we'll never see Nancy Pelosi again. Oh. Red meat. Now like Joe's diaper rash, bad stuff is breaking out all over. In Ukraine, Putin moves troops into the Donetsk' People's Republic, which sounds like Ben and Jerry's flavor (INAUDIBLE) Here's a reaction on a Russian political show we call Beat The Press.",

And I know nothing. She's not even sure. I asked her hey, what's going on in Ukraine? And she says very pretty bird. All right. Anyway, so I asked my wife about Ukraine. She doesn't know anything. I said why don't you know anything? She says mind your own business that she moves tanks into our spare bedroom. And declared it the People's Republic of Do Your Own Laundry Stan. One thing I know, I don't trust anyone who claims to know what's going on or what to do, right? Especially, Mr. Magoo at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. I honestly don't trust anyone who cites territories, like Donbass is if they knew what it was an hour ago. It's like the guy who watches an earlier airing of Jeopardy and then pretends to know all the answers. You know, when the repeat comes on, Tyrus. So, that's cable news and network news. They read one article and suddenly they're the experts. But you'd learn more from a segment on Chicken Kiev on the Food Network. The funniest part, Russia took Crimea when Obama was president, and now occupies Ukraine with Joe in charge. Putin hopes Kamala wins in 2024 so, he can take Pittsburgh. When Trump was president, Putin did none of this. And it makes me wonder if this is causing anyone at CNN to reconsider their belief that Donald Trump was under the thumb of Russia. I doubt it. They're too busy with Brian Stelter's hourly feedings. You know, it's so cute when they throw the fish in the air and he catches them. Who knew you could train him?

Remember the good old days when we -- remember the good old days where we didn't know what Joe was saying but it didn't matter? Now it does matter. And Joe doesn't know what the hell he's saying. Fact is, Ukraine sucks, but it's not a top 10 crisis plaguing America. Crack people are in more danger at a weekend barbecue in Chicago. Again, we got inflation, crime, the border and I mean Canada's. We should roll our tanks in and liberate Ottawa. Yes. I didn't know. That we could -- we could make them part of the People's Republic of Vermont. One nation under maple syrup. I use it on my skin for youthful glow. And if there's any leftover Jesse Watters buys it from me and uses it for hair gel. Well, let's not forget the border down south. If it were any leakier, it would be Joe's bladder. Too easy. But maybe Biden wants us to focus on Ukraine because he realizes he can't do a worse job with that country than he's done with ours. Although by sending Kamala there, he sure making a run for it. I call her a disaster. But that would be an insult to the Galveston Hurricane of 1900. But really, let's really take a moment to understand the significance of what we're talking about.",

You know, all of the things they said would happen under Trump. These people are more wrong than a shirtless selfie of Geraldo. Yes. Huh? I wanted to whet your whistle with that one. Delicious, but I guess that's Trump's fault, too, right? How soon before the Dems say that? Hey, it's not our fault. We won. You guys shouldn't have let us cheat.

He says, she hasn't participated in the protest other than the donation. Which was 100 percent legal at the time, although it wasn't that weird Canadian money.

That's why I'm the first one out of every game of Simon Says I've ever played. Like Simon says, Pat your head. I'm like, Simon said that? (BLEEP) that guy, I don't ever listen to him. And everyone just goes around judging people off of one sentence with no context. And the worst part about that is that it feels pretty good. But if you judge people on one sense, with no context, doesn't that make you kind of a crappy person? Even that, even that, little bit of judging felt amazing. I feel good. I didn't do anything to deserve that. Which makes judging kind of like drug. And you should use drugs responsibly, and you should judge responsibly. That's why I judge people by signing up for prison pen pal programs, or I ask convicted murderers if they learning the lesson. I worry about being judged. I went to the doctor and I told him, I think, I sweat far more than most people. He ran some tests and he said, Joe, you have hyperhidrosis. So, if you're embarrassed, just explain to people that you have a medical condition that causes you to sweat much more than others. That was the solution. So, I've just been telling people I'm addicted to cocaine. I'm guilty of being sarcastic. That's my big problem. My friend told me the other night that his girlfriend came over and they both got naked. And he said, I'll leave the rest up to your imagination. So, I said a burglar broke in. And he said, oh my god, your bodies are disgusting. Thank you so much, everyone.",

How dare you laugh at the suffering of others? So, speaking up lots of crazy stuff going around on the world and really, it's not fair to President Biden, or the Democrats for that matter. You see, after Trump, things were supposed to get really easy, right? The only thing that Democrats had to do was make sure Trump was out of the picture that everything was going to be all right. There would be rainbows and daffodils and sunshine and unicorns. I think I'm describing the sheets on Beto O'Rourke's bed. Not that I know. It was supposed to be returned to normalcy. You know, if you think it's normal to sniff children's hair. In short, they didn't have to do anything. Something they're usually great at. So, imagine the surprise when Trump left massive problems arise that didn't exist when Trump was around. And I'm not just talking about Joe's word salads or Pete Buttigieg knocked up. He's going to be a great mom. We're talking the biggest inflation in 40 years, right? The highest crime since the 70s and not the 1970s but 1570s. I just saw a guy hold up a CVS with a crossbow. If they start burning witches, we'll never see Nancy Pelosi again. Oh. Red meat. Now like Joe's diaper rash, bad stuff is breaking out all over. In Ukraine, Putin moves troops into the Donetsk' People's Republic, which sounds like Ben and Jerry's flavor (INAUDIBLE) Here's a reaction on a Russian political show we call Beat The Press."

And I know nothing. She's not even sure. I asked her hey, what's going on in Ukraine? And she says very pretty bird. All right. Anyway, so I asked my wife about Ukraine. She doesn't know anything. I said why don't you know anything? She says mind your own business that she moves tanks into our spare bedroom. And declared it the People's Republic of Do Your Own Laundry Stan. One thing I know, I don't trust anyone who claims to know what's going on or what to do, right? Especially, Mr. Magoo at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. I honestly don't trust anyone who cites territories, like Donbass is if they knew what it was an hour ago. It's like the guy who watches an earlier airing of Jeopardy and then pretends to know all the answers. You know, when the repeat comes on, Tyrus. So, that's cable news and network news. They read one article and suddenly they're the experts. But you'd learn more from a segment on Chicken Kiev on the Food Network. The funniest part, Russia took Crimea when Obama was president, and now occupies Ukraine with Joe in charge. Putin hopes Kamala wins in 2024 so, he can take Pittsburgh. When Trump was president, Putin did none of this. And it makes me wonder if this is causing anyone at CNN to reconsider their belief that Donald Trump was under the thumb of Russia. I doubt it. They're too busy with Brian Stelter's hourly feedings. You know, it's so cute when they throw the fish in the air and he catches them. Who knew you could train him?

Fact is, Ukraine sucks, but it's not a top 10 crisis plaguing America. Crack people are in more danger at a weekend barbecue in Chicago. Again, we got inflation, crime, the border and I mean Canada's. We should roll our tanks in and liberate Ottawa. Yes. I didn't know. That we could -- we could make them part of the People's Republic of Vermont. One nation under maple syrup. I use it on my skin for youthful glow. And if there's any leftover Jesse Watters buys it from me and uses it for hair gel. Well, let's not forget the border down south. If it were any leakier, it would be Joe's bladder. Too easy. But maybe Biden wants us to focus on Ukraine because he realizes he can't do a worse job with that country than he's done with ours. Although by sending Kamala there, he sure making a run for it. I call her a disaster. But that would be an insult to the Galveston Hurricane of 1900. But really, let's really take a moment to understand the significance of what we're talking about."

You know, all of the things they said would happen under Trump. These people are more wrong than a shirtless selfie of Geraldo. Yes. Huh? I wanted to whet your whistle with that one. Delicious, but I guess that's Trump's fault, too, right? How soon before the Dems say that? Hey, it's not our fault. We won. You guys shouldn't have let us cheat.

He says, she hasn't participated in the protest other than the donation. Which was 100 percent legal at the time, although it wasn't that weird Canadian money. If true, that'd be counter to what the Canadian government said would happen when they pass the Emergencies Act. That only active members of the truck convoy would see sanctions. That's what happens when you have no bill of rights. And a prime minister with air like one of the Charlie's Angels. Now at this point, the Ottawa protests have been cleared. But for this boy band reject the damage might be done. A recent poll found that voter support for Canada's Conservative Party has jumped 10 points over the last month. I haven't seen -- yes.

If you come into really close contact with Hillary, you have to sleep with an intern. According to a legend comedian, Dean (INAUDIBLE), the symptoms of this persistent ailment include an unhealthy obsession with the former Secretary of State from spreading lies about her past actions to blaming her for events which has no connection, right. The CNN dribble is designed to dismiss the new John Durham report, which alleges that Clinton campaign spied on Trump before and after he was president.

Tanukana caused quite a stir, especially among men who sit on several pillows in their gaming chairs. She also added that short guys should consider bone lengthening surgery. Shortly afterwards, her contract with Cyclops Athletic Gaming was severed. There is debate over whether her statements were mistranslated, God, I hope not from the original Japanese because it -- but in the past, he's also said people with A-cup brats don't have human rights either.

We should all feel bad for Leonardo DiCaprio, ha. That's what I'm here for punching down. But I won't let this crowd turned the roads of Dallas that are shut down by a few snowflakes. So, buckle up. What I don't understand about cancel culture is to me, it seems like the movie \"Avatar\" really successful, but I don't know anyone that likes it. And I struggled with that jokes, I thought of another punch line that would be equally as apropos but would make a whole lot more people angry. cancel culture is a lot like President Biden, really successful, but I don't know anyone that likes him. Because millions of people love Obama, and millions of people love Trump, but even Biden's closest advisors like it's better if you don't talk. That's why he has less press conferences than Punxsutawney Phil. It's like they don't want you to think these days. A friend of mine said, you think that men are better than women at sports? And I said, well, a lot of time isn't that obvious? And she said, well, Ronda Rousey could beat you up. Why is it that every time there's an example of a woman that can beat up a man, it's Ronda Rousey? And why is it that every time there's an example of a man that can be beat up by a woman, it's Joe Machi? It's like people think that skepticism is bad, but not me. I think it's a great thing. That's why I'm the first one out of every game of Simon Says I've ever played. Like Simon says, Pat your head. I'm like, Simon said that? (BLEEP) that guy, I don't ever listen to him. And everyone just goes around judging people off of one sentence with no context. And the worst part about that is that it feels pretty good. But if you judge people on one sense, with no context, doesn't that make you kind of a crappy person? Even that, even that, little bit of judging felt amazing. I feel good. I didn't do anything to deserve that. Which makes judging kind of like drug. And you should use drugs responsibly, and you should judge responsibly. That's why I judge people by signing up for prison pen pal programs, or I ask convicted murderers if they learning the lesson. I worry about being judged. I went to the doctor and I told him, I think, I sweat far more than most people. He ran some tests and he said, Joe, you have hyperhidrosis. So, if you're embarrassed, just explain to people that you have a medical condition that causes you to sweat much more than others. That was the solution. So, I've just been telling people I'm addicted to cocaine. I'm guilty of being sarcastic. That's my big problem. My friend told me the other night that his girlfriend came over and they both got naked. And he said, I'll leave the rest up to your imagination. So, I said a burglar broke in.
