But then he and Kelly emerged together from that meeting as if to say all is well for now. During the meeting Kelly put Rosenstein on the phone with the President Trump who is in New York for the U.N. meetings to discuss the bombshell report in the New York Times that at a May 2017 meeting after FBI director James Comey was fired, Rosenstein discussed with then acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe and others the possibility of wearing a wire to record the president to document chaos in the West Wing, potential rally cabinet members to invoke the 25th Amendment and remove the president from office. Rosenstein says he was being sarcastic. And U.S. Ambassador to the U.N., Nikki Haley, today, said she's never once heard any conversation in the cabinet about the 25th Amendment leading some of the president's advisors to urge him to stay calm. Because this might have been a false flag designed by Andrew McCabe to get him to over-react and play into the hands of Democrats like Adam Schiff who would used the Rosenstein firing to build the case for impeachment.

There literally has been no corroboration. And I think the issue for the Senate, Martha, is can -- and allegations with no evidence be the standard by which we destroy a man's reputation and his career. Do we -- do we now want to live in a world where allegations with no corroboration are the -- are the new standard by which we destroy people. I don't think the United States Senators want to live in that world because the same tactics that are being used to destroy Brett Kavanaugh's reputation can be used to destroy them. Joe Manchin said today there has to be more than allegations. He's right. There has to be more than allegations. No corroboration, the Ford story, there's been no -- all the people who supposedly were there say not only were they -- did it not happen, they don't even know the about the gathering. The Ramirez story, the New Yorker, this is their article. The New Yorker has not confirmed with other eyewitnesses that Kavanaugh was present at the party. How do you go forward with a story? What kind of journalistic ethics do you go forward the story where you have is zero corroboration? The New York Times refused to publish this. They said that she said to her classmates that she wasn't sure if Kavanaugh was the person involved. How are we talking about this? How does this become the issue on which the United States Senate and the United States Supreme Court hangs in the balance in a man's life and reputation? Hangs in the balance, it's outrageous."

As Marc was saying, this is this is trashing someone's reputation in a way that can't get it back. It's had a huge impact on Dr. Ford as well. I'm sure it's going to have on Miss Ramirez. That's not how it's supposed to go. And if the Senate Democrats in particular Senator Feinstein had not held on to these allegations for six whole weeks and refused to do anything to look into them, that's the time when an FBI investigation may have been appropriate because it would have been confidential. That's when the Anita Hill investigation happened and that's appropriate. But at that point, after it became public, there wasn't an FBI investigation, that's when the Senate does its investigation.

But then he and Kelly emerged together from that meeting as if to say all is well for now. During the meeting Kelly put Rosenstein on the phone with the President Trump who is in New York for the U.N. meetings to discuss the bombshell report in the New York Times that at a May 2017 meeting after FBI director James Comey was fired, Rosenstein discussed with then acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe and others the possibility of wearing a wire to record the president to document chaos in the West Wing, potential rally cabinet members to invoke the 25th Amendment and remove the president from office. Rosenstein says he was being sarcastic. And U.S. Ambassador to the U.N., Nikki Haley, today, said she's never once heard any conversation in the cabinet about the 25th Amendment leading some of the president's advisors to urge him to stay calm. Because this might have been a false flag designed by Andrew McCabe to get him to over-react and play into the hands of Democrats like Adam Schiff who would used the Rosenstein firing to build the case for impeachment. Now remember, Rosenstein appointed the special counsel Robert Mueller now oversees his budget the scope of the probe and one of the president's lawyers today already says this might mean a pause to the probe.

      "utterance": "So joining us now Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz, a Republican and member of the House judiciary committee. Good to see you, Congressman. Thank you very much for being here. What do you think about the Rod Rosenstein situation? Do you think he's there -- you know, how much longer do you think he is there. Or do you think he should be fired or do you think he should leave on his own?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "REP. MATT GAETZ, R-FLA.",
      "utterance": "Well, no matter what the president does, Martha, the Congress has an obligation to exercise our oversight rule. Rod Rosenstein needs to be in the witness chair this week to explain the circumstances of this discussion. Let's take Ed Henry's report in the like most favorable to Rod Rosenstein that he was sarcastically joking about wearing a wire on the president. That is an inappropriate thing to do when you got subordinates and colleagues at the Department of Justice in your presence. That's the eco system that allows this type of nefarious activity to occur in an administration. Any member of Congress can call up Rosenstein's impeachment and it must be voted on within two days. If we don't have Rosenstein in the witness chair, Mark Meadows and I are prepared to do just that and keep the Congress in town to do its oversight work."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yes. I mean, you said on Friday, I believe that you thought an investigation needed to be undertaken into this. And there was some speculation that the reason that Rod Rosenstein might have decided to throw in the towel is that he doesn't want to go through that process. Do you think that's true?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GAETZ",
      "utterance": "I don't know. I know that Rod Rosenstein has been very evasive in answering questions to the judiciary committee. An appropriate context here, Martha, is that this is the same Rod Rosenstein that signed the FISA warrant, it's the same Rod Rosenstein that hired Robert Mueller the day after Donald Trump told Mueller he was not going to be the FBI director, and the same Rod Rosenstein that has withheld documents from Congress. So this isn't someone who has a great reputation with the judiciary committee at this time. And I think we ought to know what happened under oath so that it's not just speculation. And if he joked about these things, I just don't think it's appropriate for him to continue in his job."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Do you think that those things that you mentioned because it's long been discussed that there is a conflict here. Because he is also a witness in this investigation. Are there are reasons, substantive reasons that are now being discussed more seriously that they were before that would say that it's simply isn't right for him to be overseeing this investigation when he is a potential witness?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GAETZ",
      "utterance": "You are right that there is a cumulative effect to the bias and conflicts that we see in Rod Rosenstein. Whether it's the fact that he wrote the memo authorizing the firing of James Comey which could potentially be very importance evidence in the obstruction of justice case, or whether he's the person that defines the four corners of the Mueller probe while he signed the FISA warrant to allow collection of information on the Trump camapaign. So this -- those two circumstance provide that context, but this seems to be even more grave. If people are sitting around at justice joking about undermining the Office of the Presidency, that's very different than what Jim Mattis described at DOD, where he said if anyone was discussing this type of thing they would immediately be fired. We need that same standard across the entire federal government."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Let me ask you this. Take the temperature of how you see the White House reaction to this and the discussion of well, it's going to wait until Thursday and then the president will meet him. And whether or not it makes political sense for the president to move on this now or to maybe avoid the issue for the moment and wait until after the midterm elections? Politically how do you read it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GAETZ",
      "utterance": "I think the president has excellent political instincts. And I also think that, you know, it's very -- it's very inappropriate for us to act base solely on Andrew McCabe's assertions because as Republicans we've called McCabe a liar rightfully and repeatedly. So you can't just pick the things about McCabe that you think are honest and then discard those that you think are dishonest. So politically speaking, I don't know. I just know this is a bold president that doesn't think about the next election. He thinks about what's right or wrong. And I would be surprised if Rod Rosenstein made it to the midterms. I really would. Because I don't know how you can allow someone to continue if you feel they're even joking about trying to destabilize an administration that is working so hard."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Maybe so. John Brennan was tweeting again, and here is what he said. \"Any attempt by the White House to subvert or manipulate law enforcement should be resisted. Rather than resigning, officials should stand their ground and wait to be fired. Resisting abuse of presidential authority is not a policy difference, it is about adhering to the rule of law.\" Your thoughts?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GAETZ",
      "utterance": "You have to reject the premise of Brennan's tweets. No one here was protecting the country. There was no argument by Rosenstein that the president was being destabilizing. He was apparently joking about wiretapping him. And so I think that there is no predicate of that that would justify such a tweet from Brennan. But Brennan is really moved from being an intelligence official to being a political hack doing everything he can to try to make the country turn on Donald Trump. I don't think that he is really viewed with the same degree of objectify that he was when he was serving the Obama administration to sort of going to defend."

      "utterance": "More now with my exclusive interview with Judge Brett Kavanaugh. And he said the president will stand by him as he categorically denies claims that he sexually assaulted anyone. Particularly the two women who have raised this issue more than 30 years ago. The Supreme Court nominee says he wants a fair process which you heard him say many, many times. He wants to be heard which he also said repeatedly today. And we do expect that we're all going to get that opportunity to hear from him and also from Dr. Christine Ford on Thursday. Joining me now, Judge Andrew Napolitano, Fox News senior judicial analyst. Judge, let's start with Judge Kavanaugh, how do you think he did in supporting himself today?"

      "speaker": "ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST",
      "utterance": "I thought your questions were better than the answers. The questions were riveting and thorough and fair. I'm not just saying that because we're friends and colleagues but they were. There were times when I cringed because the questions were so strong. But he restrained himself from answering literally many of your questions. Because I don't think he wants to give the Democrats on the Senate judiciary committee other areas of his personal life and his personal thinking to interrogate. I also thought he was very measured in his answers for the same reason. I did not see -- and I think you ran this earlier in your show -- the righteous indignation, the towering voice of God that you heard from Clarence Thomas when he was similarly outrage. Now we may see that on Thursday. But we didn't see it with you."

      "utterance": "Well, we would love to have her on. Because if she wants to have an opportunity to speak before Thursday, she should certainly let us know and we are happy to do that with her. We reached out to pretty much everyone in this story over the last couple of weeks. I want to play one sound bite with regard to Roe v. Wade and get your thought so n how he responded to this, judge, and then I want to ask you about Rod Rosenstein."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "NAPOLITANO",
      "utterance": "That was a frustrating answering. But he is being very circumspect and judicial, if you will. If he says to you, what I believe and what many people watching us now believe, of course it's about Roe versus Wade. He opens up a can of worms for the Democrats on the judiciary committee to enter. And he doesn't want to do that. I am sure he has thoughts on this, I'm sure they've analyzed those thoughts till the cast come home over at the White House with him but he doesn't want to be seen publicly articulating them. Tremendous, tremendous self- discipline on his part."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "With regard to -- I want to get your thoughts on Rod Rosenstein. Because as you point out, there was a draft, you know, there was discussion that he was leaving the office. And as you point out there was even a draft that came out of the DOJ which talks about what the succession plan would be. That is not in effect as of right now."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "NAPOLITANO",
      "utterance": "I'm wondering if the White House hasn't telegraphed Attorney General Sessions to say that Rod Rosenstein's last day on the job will be Thursday. Now Jonathan Swan whom we both know from Axios has taken some heat for some of the things he's reported on this. He reported about seven or eight minutes ago that Attorney General Sessions has drafted a statement which congratulates Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein, names Attorney General Sessions as chief of staff as the new COO of the Department of Justice and puts Noel Francisco, the solicitor general in charge of the Mueller investigation as Mueller's boss."
