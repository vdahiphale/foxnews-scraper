The latest humiliation, a  dismal September jobs report that fell well short of all expectations. It  was the single worst jobs report of the entire year. But today, Joe Biden, well, he proudly announced that everything is going  according to plan. Watch this.",

Did COVID force us to withdraw from Afghanistan and the disastrous way that it did? Of course not. Is COVID causing the border to be wide open with COVID positive migrants are flooding into the country? Of course not. Is COVID causing  skyrocketing crime in American cities? Of course not. Is COVID causing skyrocketing inflation? Of course not. And all these lies, and that's a proper word to use here, lies, that the president and his chief handlers like Jen Psaki have tried to sell to the American people. Like in August, job creation missed by 500,000, a half million, in September, it missed by another 300,000, and there, the president is out there saying the job shows progress. That is a gaslighting  with dynamite marinated in kerosene. He also claimed that 3.5 trillion spending cause 0.0 dollars, that it will somehow cut taxes while inflation is almost sure to continue rising, that it will reduce the debt. All lies. And for anyone with ears, eyes in a halfway functional brain, these are about the best unintentional comedy you will hear, except the president is as serious as a heart attack when he's making them. And this is where we are now at this point.  You're right about the messaging. It is -- it is lying and it is deceptive and it is intentional.",

Look, the vice president wants as much  distance between herself and these catastrophes as possible. She's trying to preserve her own political viability. So, whether it comes to the economy or the border for the whole array of things that Joe Biden has given to her, she doesn't want to deal with it. She's not out there publicly. In fact, the latest video, she was talking to some kids about space exploration, which is not exactly on the top of most Americans' list of things.  But the rest of the cabinet, you're exactly right. They have hightailed it away from these controversies. They know his presidency is in freefall, they can see the poll numbers cratering and now you have the press, at least some of them, starting to report on the faltering economy and some of these other things because they can't ignore it. But make no mistake, when the press reports stuff like, for example, CNN today talking about how bad these jobs numbers are, they're not doing it  because they want to see Joe Biden fail, they're doing it as a warning to the White House that they better start getting their act together, particularly on the economy, because most Americans do vote on kitchen table issues.",

So if this spending bill gets passed and even if it gets shaved down what you think will happen to the economy? That is what people vote on first but three big takeaways from the polls when you peel away the onion. All right. So, Republicans are overwhelmingly are against the president, of course. Democrats, about 80 percent are still with him so they cancel each other out. I always look at independents because they are the people that decide elections in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Ohio, Georgia, and so on. Thirty-two percent of Americans approve of this president, less than one in three. Think about that, that's just nine months into office, that is the hockey season and a solid majority of voters believe the administration as a whole, Jason, is not competent running the government. That's a very difficult impression to undo. But finally on the economy, he's polling below 40 percent. On the border and Afghanistan, he is polling in the 20s. Crime is a huge issue as well.",

And the spending between the infrastructure package and the $3.5 trillion or $5.5 trillion or $2 trillion, whatever is going to be, people understand that it's untenable and unaffordable. It's like giving my high schooler -- because I'm single mom with two kids, as you mentioned, like giving my high schools on who gets a $10 a week allowance, it's like giving a platinum credit card to him to spend $100 a week at will, whatever he wants to do.

It undermines the trust and relationships you for Congress to actually work. And I look at the video you played and I'm disturbed because you and I both no, I was friends with Maxine Waters, disagreed with all of the things she promoted, all of her ideas but I was a friend of hers because it was interpersonal. And to think that that is what the Senate has devolved into, the decorum doesn't exist anymore. By the way, no one love to decorum in the Senate more than senators. I think what has happened here is you see Democrats very are afraid of their left flank. So, Chuck Schumer is afraid of AOC right now.

They can try to blame Americans who make choices about vaccines, they can try to blame a minority of Republicans in the House or the Senate or whatever, it is all 100 percent their fault. The real problem here, I think it is so interesting how much effort that the media and Democrats put on trying to pin all the blame, the only blame among Democrats on Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema when that is not the problem. Their problem is that they put Bernie Sanders in charge of the Budget Committee. The problem is Joe Biden once an actual enthusiastic communist in charge of the banks of America, and Nancy Pelosi is walking around doing the bidding of AOC. And as you pointed out, Sean, Chuck Schumer is terrified from his left flank of AOC. So, he puts the lunatics in charge of the asylum and they are surprised there is a mess on their hands? And you have Terry McAuliffe, who's a terrible retread running a campaign based on the idea -- I mean, he said this in the last debate, running a campaign on the belief that parents don't have a right to know what it is that their children are being taught in schools and they shouldn't have a say? This is what he said out loud in the middle of the debate and luckily, thank god, Glenn Youngkin was smart enough to realize that what he said was just absolute lunacy and nailed him on it and I think he's paving the way to become the first Republican in over ten years to win in Virginia, a statewide race in Virginia.

And what they have done here is the Biden administration has thrown police under the bus. Let's not forget the horse patrol who didn't whip anybody, who didn't do anything racist or wrong, now their jobs are done basically. Their careers are over. Let's also talk about all the Border Patrol agents who are not vaccinated, who are losing their career and are unvaccinated bear their purging the National Guard, the Department of Homeland Security, all of these institutions are being purged of everyone who doesn't agree with the Biden administration and not just the Biden administration because it's all of the people that nobody voted for. The puppet masters and the people from Open Society Foundations, all of the advisors and NGOs, right, who claimed to be charities and do charity work but are really a kind of enforcement of this radical political strategy. And it's -- there are hundreds of miles of border right now that are unprotected and nobody is having a conversation about the national security risk and there are very few people in this country on both sides of the aisle, left and right, who actually want what is happening now. So, you know, we are looking at a very, very serious situation where anybody wants to can come across the southern border and you are absolutely right about the narcotics. This is the most dangerous time in the history of this country in terms of street drugs. We have never had such powerful drugs, they have never been so prolific, they have never been so easy and cheap to manufacture, they have never been more American kids dying of overdoses and we hear absolutely nothing about it.

And we -- because of the rise of the delta variant, because of the fact that even though it was a vaccine that was approved under a Republican administration, even though we now have full FDA approval, and even though it is widely available across the country, we still have a quarter of the country -- less than that -- 20 percent of the country who have decided not to get vaccinated. No question that's having an impact. Of course, as the president has said, the buck stops with him. That's far and away the biggest issue in the minds of the American people and it's impacting a lot of issues."

And they got her into the hospital but the waiting room was so crowded, things were so backed up, they couldn't even get her to be seen initially. So because I knew this person, I called the desk, the receiving nurse and asked what the situation was."

We are still in the middle of the pandemic and people are struggling and he is saying, look, I elbowed my friend and his wife to the front of the line. I would also love to know how many people in that particular hospital system have been laid off or fired because they refused the facts, therefore creating a huge backlog due to short staffing."

      "utterance": "It is the worst messaging I have seen and you can go back and study this, in the modern political era, and to blame COVID as Jen Psaki did, it's all they have. Did COVID force us to withdraw from Afghanistan and the disastrous way that it did? Of course not. Is COVID causing the border to be wide open with COVID positive migrants are flooding into the country? Of course not. Is COVID causing skyrocketing crime in American cities? Of course not. Is COVID causing skyrocketing inflation? Of course not. And all these lies, and that's a proper word to use here, lies, that the president and his chief handlers like Jen Psaki have tried to sell to the American people. Like in August, job creation missed by 500,000, a half million, in September, it missed by another 300,000, and there, the president is out there saying the job shows progress. That is a gaslighting with dynamite marinated in kerosene. He also claimed that 3.5 trillion spending cause 0.0 dollars, that it will somehow cut taxes while inflation is almost sure to continue rising, that it will reduce the debt. All lies. And for anyone with ears, eyes in a halfway functional brain, these are about the best unintentional comedy you will hear, except the president is as serious as a heart attack when he's making them. And this is where we are now at this point. You're right about the messaging. It is -- it is lying and it is deceptive and it is intentional."

She's just literally flying to Palm Springs when they are trying to do critical things with the United States Congress but the cabinet is nowhere. I mean, we've got this major problem with shipping off the shores. You got off load of shipments that are coming into these ports and no trucks to go underneath these containers. Where's Pete Buttigieg? I mean, their cabinet is pretty well absent from the discussion."

Look, the vice president wants as much distance between herself and these catastrophes as possible. She's trying to preserve her own political viability. So, whether it comes to the economy or the border for the whole array of things that Joe Biden has given to her, she doesn't want to deal with it. She's not out there publicly. In fact, the latest video, she was talking to some kids about space exploration, which is not exactly on the top of most Americans' list of things. But the rest of the cabinet, you're exactly right. They have hightailed it away from these controversies. They know his presidency is in freefall, they can see the poll numbers cratering and now you have the press, at least some of them, starting to report on the faltering economy and some of these other things because they can't ignore it. But make no mistake, when the press reports stuff like, for example, CNN today talking about how bad these jobs numbers are, they're not doing it because they want to see Joe Biden fail, they're doing it as a warning to the White House that they better start getting their act together, particularly on the economy, because most Americans do vote on kitchen table issues."

So if this spending bill gets passed and even if it gets shaved down what you think will happen to the economy? That is what people vote on first but three big takeaways from the polls when you peel away the onion. All right. So, Republicans are overwhelmingly are against the president, of course. Democrats, about 80 percent are still with him so they cancel each other out. I always look at independents because they are the people that decide elections in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Ohio, Georgia, and so on. Thirty-two percent of Americans approve of this president, less than one in three. Think about that, that's just nine months into office, that is the hockey season and a solid majority of voters believe the administration as a whole, Jason, is not competent running the government. That's a very difficult impression to undo. But finally on the economy, he's polling below 40 percent. On the border and Afghanistan, he is polling in the 20s. Crime is a huge issue as well."

With Biden's approval numbers in the tank and multiple major crises on the rise, the Democratic Party is starting to fracture. Yesterday after minority leader McConnell ever so generously offered a lifeline to Democrats on the debt ceiling, Chuck Schumer decided to take a victory lap on the floor of the Senate and fellow Democrat Joe Manchin was not so pleased.

They're in total and complete disarray, and for many of them, they think this is a game. This is not a game to the American people. Inflation is taxation.

And when you look at the crises of the border, whether it's the Afghanistan exit or botched evacuation that we had, whether it's the 400,000 illegal aliens that are about across the border in the month of October, and you see the devastation with the increased spending, the kind of spending that AOC and Bernie Sanders are writing, people can see that the far left want to fundamentally change our country. And the spending between the infrastructure package and the $3.5 trillion or $5.5 trillion or $2 trillion, whatever is going to be, people understand that it's untenable and unaffordable. It's like giving my high schooler -- because I'm single mom with two kids, as you mentioned, like giving my high schools on who gets a $10 a week allowance, it's like giving a platinum credit card to him to spend $100 a week at will, whatever he wants to do. And everyone knows we can't afford to do this, and it's the extremities of the far left. We have AOC literally writing the budget, writing and describing how we're going to spend your tax dollars. AOC is not president. So the number one question I get from people is who is in charge and why are we doing this to our country?"

It really is scary. And I'm glad you're in the fight, Congresswoman Mace. Thank you so much for joining us tonight on HANNITY. All right. Here with more reaction, FOX News contributor Sean Duffy and Charlie Hurt. Gentlemen, thanks for joining us. Congressman Duffy, I served with you in the United States Congress and we were talking about this earlier this week, it's really hard to believe and fathom that Nancy Pelosi is still to this day does not require members of Congress to actually show up to do their jobs. They have proxy voting and you've got some Democrats who have never been, in Congress, since the day they were sworn in."

      "utterance": "No, it's unheard of, Jason. You have to show up on the House floor and you have to vote with your little card that you're issued in each Congress. And what happens during that process, you and I both no, you see people, you communicate, you build trust and build relationships which is why it is so disturbing, the Chuck Schumer speech, you know, that Mitch McConnell is raising the debt limit which by the way is bad for America but good for Democrats, and then Chuck Schumer stabs him in the back? It undermines the trust and relationships you for Congress to actually work. And I look at the video you played and I'm disturbed because you and I both no, I was friends with Maxine Waters, disagreed with all of the things she promoted, all of her ideas but I was a friend of hers because it was interpersonal. And to think that that is what the Senate has devolved into, the decorum doesn't exist anymore. By the way, no one love to decorum in the Senate more than senators. I think what has happened here is you see Democrats very are afraid of their left flank. So, Chuck Schumer is afraid of AOC right now. AOC is going to run against him for his Senate seat and like he is running a college campus activist group and all rules to the win and let's have a free-for-all food fight."

Even he is admitting out loud that Joe Biden is not very popular right now. Democrats seem to be at each other's throats. How did they get to be to the point where they are actually unified? Because right now, progressives from my vantage point seem to be rolling the day as opposed to the promise of Joe Biden which is, we are going to be ruling from the center. That is not what they are doing."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHARLIE HURT, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Yeah. No, it's not at all. Of course, Democrats have no one but themselves to blame for this. You know, the sort of sweet thing about everything that's going on right now is that Democrats, they own everything. They control every lever of power, every failure that happens right now is 100 percent their fault. They can try to blame Americans who make choices about vaccines, they can try to blame a minority of Republicans in the House or the Senate or whatever, it is all 100 percent their fault. The real problem here, I think it is so interesting how much effort that the media and Democrats put on trying to pin all the blame, the only blame among Democrats on Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema when that is not the problem. Their problem is that they put Bernie Sanders in charge of the Budget Committee. The problem is Joe Biden once an actual enthusiastic communist in charge of the banks of America, and Nancy Pelosi is walking around doing the bidding of AOC. And as you pointed out, Sean, Chuck Schumer is terrified from his left flank of AOC. So, he puts the lunatics in charge of the asylum and they are surprised there is a mess on their hands? And you have Terry McAuliffe, who's a terrible retread running a campaign based on the idea -- I mean, he said this in the last debate, running a campaign on the belief that parents don't have a right to know what it is that their children are being taught in schools and they shouldn't have a say? This is what he said out loud in the middle of the debate and luckily, thank god, Glenn Youngkin was smart enough to realize that what he said was just absolute lunacy and nailed him on it and I think he's paving the way to become the first Republican in over ten years to win in Virginia, a statewide race in Virginia. That really tells you something about how badly Joe Biden and the Democrats have completely screwed things up."

      "speaker": "CHAFFETZ",

When he went over to the House of Representatives after they didn't achieve the vote and make the numbers, and then you have a Democrat saying I don't even know why he showed up over here, that is probably not a good sign for your party. But, Sean, Charlie, thank you both for joining us tonight, gentlemen. I've got to keep going. So, straight ahead, Biden's border crisis continues to spiral out of control.

Over the past week, the drug cartels, it appears, suspected cartel members have been actually moving into the Rio Grande River area. Heavily armed with AK-47s, they appear to be Mexican military or police uniforms or tactical gear. They've been taunting the Texas National Guard, as well as the Texas Department of Public Safety. There is enormous concern that they are trying to get a reaction from our law enforcement. That means they are trying to persuade them to shoot back or get them to act in a certain manner. They're hoping the reason is that they are going to try to videotape that and let me have National -- this is National Border Control Council, Chris Cabrera, explaining why the belief that and why they believe the Biden administration has made this more dangerous than ever."

The other thing we are seeing is I think there was something that came out last week or earlier this week were some guys were standing in the middle of a river with long rifles just taunting us on our side and there's no fear.

And President Biden literally said today that his administration is creating more jobs, and unfortunately, he's made the cartels more powerful. He's creating jobs for them. The cartels are moving more drugs in this country than CVS and Walgreens combined. We know that there's an increase -- dramatic increase in homicides, in places like Tucson, Arizona. We know that opioid and drug overdoses are the leading cause of deaths for teenagers in our second largest county, so this is having a dramatic impact in real-time, real-world and make no mistake about it. As a result of the Biden administration policies this country is a more dangerous place. People are dying now. It isn't a theoretical problem. Our kids are dying of drug overdoses, and he's empowered the cartels who've essentially seized operational control of our borders."

      "speaker": "LARA LOGAN, FOX NATION HOST",

That leaves you with less and less and less of the institutions that you don't actually respect and you don't actually want because if you look at it, the people who believe in open borders, the Open Society foundations and -- that are of that same political mind-set, they want the immigration agency is gone, they want the border patrol gone, they want to please god, they want the prisons gone, and so on and so on. And what they have done here is the Biden administration has thrown police under the bus. Let's not forget the horse patrol who didn't whip anybody, who didn't do anything racist or wrong, now their jobs are done basically. Their careers are over. Let's also talk about all the Border Patrol agents who are not vaccinated, who are losing their career and are unvaccinated bear their purging the National Guard, the Department of Homeland Security, all of these institutions are being purged of everyone who doesn't agree with the Biden administration and not just the Biden administration because it's all of the people that nobody voted for. The puppet masters and the people from Open Society Foundations, all of the advisors and NGOs, right, who claimed to be charities and do charity work but are really a kind of enforcement of this radical political strategy. And it's -- there are hundreds of miles of border right now that are unprotected and nobody is having a conversation about the national security risk and there are very few people in this country on both sides of the aisle, left and right, who actually want what is happening now. So, you know, we are looking at a very, very serious situation where anybody wants to can come across the southern border and you are absolutely right about the narcotics. This is the most dangerous time in the history of this country in terms of street drugs. We have never had such powerful drugs, they have never been so prolific, they have never been so easy and cheap to manufacture, they have never been more American kids dying of overdoses and we hear absolutely nothing about it. And you know what the Biden administration is pushing for? A reduction of the minimum mandatory sentences for fentanyl. They're actively working to implement that at a time when more American kids are dying of fentanyl overdoses ever in the history of this country."

But talk to me about not only the sheriff and the national guard and others, local law enforcement there in Arizona, one of the rules of engagement for them and how do they continue to deal with this massive push of human trafficking, sex trafficking, drug trafficking, what are they supposed to do?"

You have sheriff's that are pulled out of community law enforcement border sheriff that have to help out with people illegally crossing the border. I was talking to some ranchers and these are Arizona cowboys, not California cowboys. These are tough hombres, and they don't want to be at the border, because all the violence, and all the people they haven't seen come across these types of dangerous folks in generation. And so, this is something that is in Arizona's backyard now, but make no mistake about it, it is being spread throughout the country. It is the cartels enrich and empower themselves, I think it's going to have a destabilizing effect on Mexico, which is actually going to create further problems. So, you're going to see an increase in violence on the streets of American, in our cities. You're going to see more drug overdoses and meanwhile, the Biden administration is doing absolutely nothing to address it. And that's why me and some of my colleagues, we have a lawsuit in federal court trying to force the Biden administration to build the wall because that's what the law requires."

As five of his art prints were sold for $75,000 each to anonymous buyers, while he prepares for his New York City art show. Well, joining us now with reaction is -- for the latest with the Hunter Biden scandal is FOX New contributors Leo Terrell and Lisa Boothe. Lisa, I know you were in the bidding for one of these paintings of a blood clot or whatever he has. I know you've got the beautiful place that you wanted to just put one of his pieces up on the wall, but come on. This is insane."

      "utterance": "Leo -- does anyone at home, does anyone on this panel believe that if Hunter Biden's last name wasn't Biden, he would be selling his paintings for $75,000 to $500,000? He had a pop-up exhibition in Los Angeles. The mayor showed up, Moby the musician showed up. Would they be showing up if his last name wasn't Biden? Of course not. This is a scam with the Bidens. This is what they do. It's the Biden corruption family, but not just that. I mean, they get away with everything and that is the problem. You can go through a list of the Biden family members who have had run-ins with the law, no arrest -- or no charges, none have served jail time. You go down the list. Hunter Biden, drug possession, the charges were expunged, Joe Biden's daughter Ashley allegedly attempted to obstruct a police officer. No charges. Frank, his brother, allegedly petty theft, ended up not getting charged as well. So, you can go down the list where these people get away with everything, and that's why they're going to continue to do these sorts of things."

      "utterance": "Yeah. Come on. But Bidens do come evidently. Last year, Senator Portman and Senator Carper came up with a bipartisan report. This is a report that said, if you want to launder money, one of the ways that Russians and others do it is they do it through art because it is one of the legal but unregulated ways to do it. Not suggesting this is what Hunter Biden has done but it is -- the reason there is so much speculation about Hunter Biden and art is United States Senate in a bipartisan way just said this is the way you scam people out of money at all of a sudden, Hunter Biden is an artist. Maybe that is coincidence but maybe it is not."

      "speaker": "LEO TERRELL, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Let's not embarrass or tarnish the word \"art.\" Hunter Biden is a con artist. He is a shakedown artist. He peddles influence and tries to use his father as a bridge. Eric Garcetti, as Lisa mentioned, was there, you know why? Because Eric Garcetti is in the twilight zone. He's being nominated to be an ambassador to India and he's held up. They are trying to buy influence. Hunter Biden is going to try to make as much money on his name up until 2024. The only reason he is not facing investigation is because the Democrats control the White House and the Justice Department. He should be in jail, he should be in jail for all of his criminal activities. But I guarantee you, Jason and Lisa, 2024 will be the day of reckoning because this man currently has criminal investigations ongoing but nothing is going to happen and why all the Bidens are in charge of the White House. That will come to a crashing end in 2024."

      "speaker": "CHAFFETZ",
      "utterance": "Lisa, he has the issue with the gun, that is one but remember, it was Hunter Biden and the White House that said they were going to make sure they were the open and transparent since the dinosaurs roamed the Earth, but they weren't going to get involved in Hunter Biden's art business. But there are Hunter so-called paintings hanging evidently in the White House, for goodness sake. This is hardly what the Bidens promised the American people when they went after this, and Hunter Biden was going to be oblivious to who he met with? But that they had an art show!"

      "speaker": "BOOTHE",
      "utterance": "Of course they don't care. I mean, it's all lies, all a scam. Joe Biden sat there and lied to the American people. This is the guy when he was vice president, he flew his son on Air Force Two to China, shook the hands of one of his business partners and that business license hunter Biden had been trying to get for over a year was miraculously approved, right? So, that is what this family is about. And we still don't know, has Joe Biden profited of all of this? Joe Biden is the big guy. He was supposed to get 10 percent of the deal with the Chinese conglomerate. The family got $11 million from one of the Chinese executives that was involved. To Joe Biden get 10 percent of it? We still don't have the answer of some basic questions that, if Joe Biden cashed in on all of this? We know that China wanted Joe Biden to win. The night of the election, China's currency took a nosedive when it looks like President Trump was going to win reelection, then it shot right back up when it was going to be Joe Biden. Why is that, right? So, what favors have they been calling in for Joe Biden when it comes to China, when it comes to their family that have made all of this money out of all of these business dealings, and shady ones at that."

It really is stunning and the lack of intellectual curiosity and duplicity of the national media on this is just unbelievable. Thanks for joining us tonight. Really do appreciate it.

      "utterance": "Welcome back to this special edition of HANNITY. The Department of Justice is taking heat this week after Attorney General Merrick Garland directed the FBI to prepare strategies for addressing unruly parents at school board meetings. The Republican members of the Senate Judiciary Committee did not like the sound of that so they sent a letter to Garland asking that he reassure us Americans that are owned Department of Justice won't be infringing on our First Amendment rights to free speech. And Biden's problems go far beyond just parents who are upset with critical race theory. Black leaders are starting to lose patience with Joe, pointing out he is saddling Kamala Harris with solving all of the administration's worst problems. Back with us, Leo Terrell and Lisa Boothe. We had some technical difficulty with Dr. Ben Carson tonight. Thanks for joining us again. Leo, I want to start with you. To get the Department of Justice involved and engaged with school board meetings, how do they justify this?"

      "speaker": "TERRELL",
      "utterance": "You can't. And as a lawyer, you cannot. This is pure intimidation, Jason. Let's be clear, critical race theory is racist and parents at the local level have a First Amendment right to address your local school board. These are local issues and what I find insulting is we are ignoring the fact that critical race theory is trying to teach our kids to be little racist individuals. And these parents are fighting back. They have a direct right, say so in the curriculum and what their kids are being taught at school. This is all part of a federal lies game in conjunction with the national teachers union to basically indoctrinate our kids on how to hate each other. I find it offensive. Not only as a civil rights attorney, not only as a lawyer but as a former schoolteacher. It is outrageous!"

      "speaker": "CHAFFETZ",
      "utterance": "Lisa, I don't believe there is any federal jurisdiction to get the FBI involved in our local school board meeting. But once word gets out on this, how do you think the next school board meeting is going to go when there is an open meeting for parents to talk about how to educate their own children?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOOTHE",
      "utterance": "Well, first of all, the whole point of critical race theory for the left is if you say the country is inherently racist, if it is rooted in slavery, then the country, makes it easier to burn down to the ground and that is with the left is trying to do to with that but we are not just creeping towards communism in America, the Democrats have hit their pedal on the accelerator towards communism and authoritarian nation. I mean, think about it. The DOJ and FBI are targeting parents in America and the FDA recently sat before Congress and said, they are not tracking left-wing bias like Antifa but what is on their reader? Parents in America because the system is falling apart and starting with the schools. America standing up for the kids. You got 1.5 million students or more have been pulled out of schools. Homeschooling has tripled because people are seeing the things their children are taught and standing up for it. So, they are trying to preserve the system and that is why they are trying to get the DOJ and FBI involved because otherwise the public school system will fall apart now that parents actually know what is going on in these schools."

    {
      "speaker": "CHAFFETZ",
      "utterance": "Yeah. I think they are inadvertently making the case for school choice along the way but I think you're right, I think it is time for parents to double down. Leo, I have got to get your very quick take, though. There's been some criticism of what Joe Biden is giving Kamala Harris to work on. Some black leaders say that he is giving her all the real difficult things, the things that are really hard like immigration and voter suppression and all those types of things and they are complaining instead of giving her the softballs that she supposedly wants."

      "speaker": "TERRELL",
      "utterance": "It is totally pandering. Look, she is in the vice presidency, she should be able to handle every type of job on the planet. She is the second most powerful person in the world. And let me be clear, but she's not qualified, she is not competent and I have no doubt to say this, I am more competent than she is. Those black leaders, whoever they are, they don't represent me, they don't represent black America. There is no black voice for all people. Kamala Harris should stand up and do something and so far her nine months have been disastrous. She doesn't have one accomplishment. She is horrible. Did I say horrible? She is horrible!"
