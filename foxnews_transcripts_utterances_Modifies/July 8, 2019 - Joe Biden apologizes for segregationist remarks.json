To make his point he used segregationists who were the backbone of the Democratic Party. But unfortunately, we live in a world where deliberate misinterpretation is weaponized. Kamala Harris, new Biden wasn't being racist and that he wasn't complementing segregationist. On the contrary, it was their heinousness that served the example well. Everybody knows that. But as long as there's room enough to slide in, I've got you. There's room enough to gain an edge. Among Democrats saying got you is speaking truth to power. So Joe's example of being able to work with racists became Joe's throwing slumber party with cross burners, while they braided each other's hair and wrote each other love poems in their yearbooks.  So now Biden limps along like an injured gazelle on the Serengeti, unaware that his apologies is but the first in a long line of ones he'll be giving because one is never enough, and two is just the appetizer. He'll be apologizing until the desert is served and the check comes. And Joe has been around a long time. For today's left, just being alive in the past is proof of collaboration and worthy of a witch burning. And remember, Joe was born less than 100 years after the end of slavery. So I want to feel bad for Joe, but then I remember this.",

On the Biden situation, big difference between Trump and Biden is this, Biden runs away from controversy and Trump runs towards it. And if you look at Trump over the last couple of years, even a controversial things in his own party, he's tough on tariffs, on the border, on the travel ban, even his personal so-called scandals he's really dug in hard. Whereas Joe Biden over the course of four months, basically, has changed positions or apologized on the Hyde amendment, segregationist, Anita Hill, inappropriate touching, the Chinese threat. And this is the worst form of apology because it's insincere, it was force, he didn't want to give it, but he had to give it. And it looks like the base is leading him instead of him leaving the base. It doesn't look like he has the presidential timber.  Whereas, President Trump, highest approval rating he's gotten so far in the latest poll by ABC, Washington Post, and I think that's because the Mueller report has kind of slowed things down. You had two very successful overseas trips in Europe and in Asia. And the American public is kind of beginning to contrast the president with some of these other Democrats, and they're looking at him more favorably, plus the great economic news coming out in June.",

And if you are in a deep blue district and any Democrat is going to get elected in your district then, yes, it is easier to be a firebrand and -- it's easier to do all of those things. And Speaker Pelosi has a different responsibility and a different role, like her job is to try to keep the majority and to try to figure out a way to do as many of the things the Democrats want to do with the reality that they live in. And if they continue to go the way that they are, those 31 districts in the House that helped Nancy Pelosi become speaker again could very easily flip back to being Republican when President Trump is at the top of the ticket. Bringing Republicans back in because not as many people vote in the midterm. The other thing is, she did this interview -- Speaker Pelosi did an interview with Maureen Dowd in the New York Times. Got a lot of attention, that's where these quotes come from where she's saying that these guys don't only have their twitter game. But it came in an interesting time because she had just lost a fight with in her caucus, but it wasn't from the left. It was from the middle. But they've said we have to vote for this funding for the border. So, I think that she's trying to be wise, and I think that -- I understand why a push up against her, but if I had to put Pelosi's political skills up against AOC at this moment from what they need, if I were the Democrats I'll say, can't you guys just work together because together they can be quite powerful, but I don't know if it's possible.",

AOC and Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib are interested in the cultural battle overall. They're activist. They don't have to worry about getting reelected in their district necessarily.

And I think that their lawyers are actually going to the remediation right now and that's something that they can deal with, because they've showed it in their performance and they show it in the fact that they get the revenue that the people are coming to watch it.

Kamala Harris, new Biden wasn't being racist and that he wasn't complementing segregationist. On the contrary, it was their heinousness that served the example well. Everybody knows that. But as long as there's room enough to slide in, I've got you. There's room enough to gain an edge. Among Democrats saying got you is speaking truth to power. So Joe's example of being able to work with racists became Joe's throwing slumber party with cross burners, while they braided each other's hair and wrote each other love poems in their yearbooks. So now Biden limps along like an injured gazelle on the Serengeti, unaware that his apologies is but the first in a long line of ones he'll be giving because one is never enough, and two is just the appetizer. He'll be apologizing until the desert is served and the check comes. And Joe has been around a long time. For today's left, just being alive in the past is proof of collaboration and worthy of a witch burning. And remember, Joe was born less than 100 years after the end of slavery. So I want to feel bad for Joe, but then I remember this."

On the Biden situation, big difference between Trump and Biden is this, Biden runs away from controversy and Trump runs towards it. And if you look at Trump over the last couple of years, even a controversial things in his own party, he's tough on tariffs, on the border, on the travel ban, even his personal so-called scandals he's really dug in hard. Whereas Joe Biden over the course of four months, basically, has changed positions or apologized on the Hyde amendment, segregationist, Anita Hill, inappropriate touching, the Chinese threat. And this is the worst form of apology because it's insincere, it was force, he didn't want to give it, but he had to give it. And it looks like the base is leading him instead of him leaving the base. It doesn't look like he has the presidential timber. Whereas, President Trump, highest approval rating he's gotten so far in the latest poll by ABC, Washington Post, and I think that's because the Mueller report has kind of slowed things down. You had two very successful overseas trips in Europe and in Asia. And the American public is kind of beginning to contrast the president with some of these other Democrats, and they're looking at him more favorably, plus the great economic news coming out in June."

I mean, David Axelrod, again, over the weekend saying, I don't know if this guy can make it to the end based on all of his flip-flopping. And in the end, what's the point of having a moderate lane in the Democratic primary if Joe Biden is just going to continually change his position? And when he gets to a general if he becomes the nominee, which is not inevitable, by the way, what is he going to actually run on considering he's changing all of his position?

And Speaker Pelosi has a different responsibility and a different role, like her job is to try to keep the majority and to try to figure out a way to do as many of the things the Democrats want to do with the reality that they live in. And if they continue to go the way that they are, those 31 districts in the House that helped Nancy Pelosi become speaker again could very easily flip back to being Republican when President Trump is at the top of the ticket. Bringing Republicans back in because not as many people vote in the midterm. The other thing is, she did this interview -- Speaker Pelosi did an interview with Maureen Dowd in the New York Times. Got a lot of attention, that's where these quotes come from where she's saying that these guys don't only have their twitter game. But it came in an interesting time because she had just lost a fight with in her caucus, but it wasn't from the left. It was from the middle. But they've said we have to vote for this funding for the border. So, I think that she's trying to be wise, and I think that -- I understand why a push up against her, but if I had to put Pelosi's political skills up against AOC at this moment from what they need, if I were the Democrats I'll say, can't you guys just work together because together they can be quite powerful, but I don't know if it's possible."

I think she is, you know, has -- she knows how to work it. And I think that they could probably learn from that. It does bother me that she didn't vote for the bill. I mean, that's kind of strange when you accuse others of hurting migrant children and then you deny their aid.

I bet they wish they could go back to the days of being on the cover of Rolling Stone when Nancy Pelosi was on the cover with Ilhan Omar. Be a little bit more, you know, cooperation then, but this is too past, right? So, Nancy Pelosi is doing what Dana talked about. She's looking to govern. Looking for policies. Looking for results to go back to these districts and say, we're not just talking about things, we're actually passing legislation that is not getting pass in the Senate because the mean Republicans won't take it up. AOC and Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib are interested in the cultural battle overall. They're activist. They don't have to worry about getting reelected in their district necessarily. They want to change the narrative as a whole with the whole country, and they're doing that. I mean, people are talking about them. The media oxygen is being -- taken up by them. Last week, AOC accused the border patrol of forcing illegal immigrants to drink out of toilets and that was something that everyone has to respond to.

So, actually I think only four to six weeks after the livers have been replaced, they regenerate to full size and Ed actually had to lose 10 to 15 pounds before doing this. And he can't drink for six months afterwards and it's just an amazingly selfless thing he's going to be doing and we wish Ed and Colleen the best of luck. Also, good luck to me because I'll be on Hannity tonight."

Also, I wore my big sunglasses and he took a nap and then Peter took him in the Harley to get some ice cream while I did Fox News Sunday. And you know you're going to love this. Look at that. But the best part is that this is how he started his Monday. Watch this. Watch this, he is going to be the first-round draft pick. That was a Frisbee catch. We should have highlighted that maybe.

Powerful lightning bolt struck a boat in the Columbia Yacht Club in South Boston. No one on board, but it was an electrifying moment as you saw caught on cell phone video by Henry Minucci. He saw lightning in the distance trying to record it when the lightning came a little bit too close. National Weather Service saw the video and tweeted a reminder, \"when thunder roars, go indoors.\" Not bad advice. You should know America.
