Democrats are turning every issue into a political lightning rod. Many on the left are even accusing President Trump of being personally responsible for the spread of COVID-19.  Just today, Congressman James Clyburn floated a conspiracy theory that Trump didn't have a plan to battle the virus because it was spreading in blue states.  But at today's coronavirus response hearing on Capitol Hill, Dr. Fauci painted a much different picture. He actually credited the president with saving lives. Take a look.",

But then they say there's no plan. They see tests go up. They criticized the president for not having enough testing. The president, we're almost 800,000 tests a day now, which is a revolutionary number. Then they criticized too many positives because more people are being tested. All they wanted to do was attacked the president and I think today, I really wanted to question Dr. Fauci about the decisions that were made by President Trump to take leadership to develop a plan and ultimately, Jason, to save American lives. And Dr. Fauci right down the line on every question I asked him confirmed that, number one, President Trump has a very solid plan, he works with the smartest doctors in the world on that plan, and the president's plan is saving lives every day.  And Jim Jordan touched on the idea that, you know, if you can say you can't go to church but you can go to a protest, we know protests like any other large gathering spread the disease. Going to church, you can do it safely where it won't spread the disease, and there is a dichotomy and it's like they don't want to even acknowledge that that exists.",

The president is doing what a president to do. He's leading a lot of the detail decision to the local states and mayors. That's what the Tenth Amendment says.  But where there is the need for a national decision whether it's closing traveled from China or restricting it to other country, the president has taken those actions. He's gotten ventilators available for states. It turns out he got more than anybody even needed. He's done exactly what he's supposed to do, I hope this campaign will hammer that message and I think what Congressman Scalise did today and that hearing was incredibly valuable in showing that there is not this big fight between the science of what Dr. Fauci wants to do and what the president is doing. He's doing what he should do. The interesting thing the Democrats say, there ought to be a national plan. But if he does say, let's go and protect federal property in places like Portland, suddenly, they come unglued and they say he has no business being there, when in fact he does. So that's the insanity of all of this. It's not about safety. It's not about science. It's not about making sure that we're safe from COVID.

They want to make it conservative corona. They think corona only spreads when Republicans come together, when Republicans go to church, when Republicans rally in Tulsa. All of a sudden, there's always this -- this coverage of outbreaks.  But when Black Lives Matter or Antifa or whatever tries to destroy federal property, this is the -- you know, this is all consistent with the First Amendment and just fine and even Tony Fauci is playing into the politics of that. It's all about politics. Look, the president did things we've never done in our history. We've never prevented Americans from coming back into the country over a health scare. The president made sure that if they tested positive, that they wouldn't be able to come into the population until their health improved. We did the same thing with cruise ships. We shut down our economy. We shut down schools. We shut down churches. A lot of conservatives have concerns with those things.  But you can't level the charge against the president of the United States that he didn't take extraordinary, unprecedented, historic steps to try to keep us safe.

We don't have a big meeting at 9:00 on the Saturday morning in the speaker's office with the speaker of the House, Senate minority leader, the White House chief of staff and the secretary of the treasury unless you're dealing with a big crisis. That's what they are wrestling with right now. They try to get some resolution, try to jump-start these talks. They are not going to have any aides in the room, and that tells you a lot. Under normal circumstances, if the sides were at an impasse like this, even on a big bill, you likely stop talking. But the coronavirus crisis is so severe, they can't. White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows has he made multiple offers to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, all were rejected. Meadows says the Democrats are entrenched, aren't fudging. Why, they may not have to. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says he has 20 Republicans who oppose any big bill that the Democrats want, or even doing another bill at all. So, Democrats think they will hold the cards because any new bill will require Democratic votes. Pelosi indicated today that she thought they would eventually be a bill, although some Republican sources are skeptical. There are differences between the sites. Democrats oppose an interim bill for the end of the employment benefits until there is a sense that a broader bill is within reach. The Senate meets next week, and expect Senate Republicans to set up a number of votes on unemployment benefits to make Democrats squirm. Here's what to watch for: more economic pain. The next set of jobless numbers are set to be released a week from today. If it's a bad number, they could jump-start these talks -- Jason.",

Bernie Sanders is saying it. AOC has said something similar. And, certainly, Congresswoman Omar is now saying it. We should believe them, shouldn't we? ERIN PERRINE, TRUMP 2020 DIRECTOR OF PRESS COMMUNICATIONS: We should absolutely take Democrats at their word that Joe Biden would be the most progressive socialist candidate that any party has ever seen in the United States. His policies certainly fit the mantra, whether it's amnesty for 11 million illegal immigrants in this country or raising taxes to the tune of over $7 trillion. Let's remember Hillary Clinton was considered pretty progressive at her $2 trillion tax hike, but Joe Biden actually wants to raise taxes over $7 trillion on the American people. It makes sense because he is Beijing Biden. I mean, he's more interested in raising the American corporate tax rate to higher than communist China then he is about protecting jobs and making this a free country.

So, Fauci will comment on baseball, football, schools, going to bars, cruise ships, but he won't directly address the massive nationwide protests that are still ongoing. And don't forget -- Democrats closed businesses, churches, beaches, bars, restaurants and restricted who you can have in your home and whether or not you can even sing in church. Joining us now with reaction is House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, FOX News contributor, Governor Mike Huckabee, and American Conservative Union chairman, Matt Schlapp. Thank you all for being here. Congressman, I want to -- I want to go with you. You did a great job of -- of questioning. But Fauci just wouldn't go to certain areas. What was the mood within the room and what did the congressmen leave at the end of the hearing with?"

      "speaker": "SCALISE",
      "utterance": "Jason, good to be with you. And, look, the mood in the room was very serious because we are making big decisions. We are seeing states make big decisions all based on data and, you know, they are -- the Democrats are literally trying to mislead the country and say there's no plan and say that -- they criticized the plan, by the way, when the president does things like shutdown flights from China. But then they say there's no plan. They see tests go up. They criticized the president for not having enough testing. The president, we're almost 800,000 tests a day now, which is a revolutionary number. Then they criticized too many positives because more people are being tested. All they wanted to do was attacked the president and I think today, I really wanted to question Dr. Fauci about the decisions that were made by President Trump to take leadership to develop a plan and ultimately, Jason, to save American lives. And Dr. Fauci right down the line on every question I asked him confirmed that, number one, President Trump has a very solid plan, he works with the smartest doctors in the world on that plan, and the president's plan is saving lives every day. And Jim Jordan touched on the idea that, you know, if you can say you can't go to church but you can go to a protest, we know protests like any other large gathering spread the disease. Going to church, you can do it safely where it won't spread the disease, and there is a dichotomy and it's like they don't want to even acknowledge that that exists."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "MIKE HUCKABEE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "I think what Congressman Scalise did was to show that there was very specific leadership on the part of the president and the administration. And let's be real clear. The president is doing what a president to do. He's leading a lot of the detail decision to the local states and mayors. That's what the Tenth Amendment says. But where there is the need for a national decision whether it's closing traveled from China or restricting it to other country, the president has taken those actions. He's gotten ventilators available for states. It turns out he got more than anybody even needed. He's done exactly what he's supposed to do, I hope this campaign will hammer that message and I think what Congressman Scalise did today and that hearing was incredibly valuable in showing that there is not this big fight between the science of what Dr. Fauci wants to do and what the president is doing. He's doing what he should do. The interesting thing the Democrats say, there ought to be a national plan. But if he does say, let's go and protect federal property in places like Portland, suddenly, they come unglued and they say he has no business being there, when in fact he does. So that's the insanity of all of this. It's not about safety. It's not about science. It's not about making sure that we're safe from COVID. It's about hating Donald Trump and trying to make sure he's not president for the next four years."

    {
      "speaker": "CHAFFETZ",

They are trying to spin it a different way and remember it in a different way because I tell you what, when Donald Trump was limiting travel from China, it wasn't in the front page news. They called them all sorts of things, a xenophobic and all these types of things. But this hearing really did expose that the Democrats are playing political games."

      "utterance": "Well, thank God for Steve Scalise and for Jim Jordan and several others of the Republicans who are on that committee, because a hearing is a place where we actually can listen and learn. And I think this is critical. When Nancy Pelosi said this is the Trump virus, that was when she said publicly what you're supposed to say privately, because what they're trying to do with this whole Chinese corona -- and I'm going to keep calling it Chinese corona, Jason, because they want to make it Trump corona. They want to make it conservative corona. They think corona only spreads when Republicans come together, when Republicans go to church, when Republicans rally in Tulsa. All of a sudden, there's always this -- this coverage of outbreaks. But when Black Lives Matter or Antifa or whatever tries to destroy federal property, this is the -- you know, this is all consistent with the First Amendment and just fine and even Tony Fauci is playing into the politics of that. It's all about politics. Look, the president did things we've never done in our history. We've never prevented Americans from coming back into the country over a health scare. The president made sure that if they tested positive, that they wouldn't be able to come into the population until their health improved. We did the same thing with cruise ships. We shut down our economy. We shut down schools. We shut down churches. A lot of conservatives have concerns with those things. But you can't level the charge against the president of the United States that he didn't take extraordinary, unprecedented, historic steps to try to keep us safe. The reason why they're not giving him any credit is because it's all about beating him, and I think the American people get it and I think the Democrats have way overplayed their hands because our health should not be a political football."

It was way, way over the line. Gentlemen, thank you all for joining us on this beautiful Friday night. We do appreciate it. All right, President Trump is now ready and willing to send another round of stimulus checks to Americans but according to him, Pelosi and Schumer are now standing in the way.

We don't have a big meeting at 9:00 on the Saturday morning in the speaker's office with the speaker of the House, Senate minority leader, the White House chief of staff and the secretary of the treasury unless you're dealing with a big crisis. That's what they are wrestling with right now. They try to get some resolution, try to jump-start these talks. They are not going to have any aides in the room, and that tells you a lot. Under normal circumstances, if the sides were at an impasse like this, even on a big bill, you likely stop talking. But the coronavirus crisis is so severe, they can't. White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows has he made multiple offers to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, all were rejected. Meadows says the Democrats are entrenched, aren't fudging. Why, they may not have to. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says he has 20 Republicans who oppose any big bill that the Democrats want, or even doing another bill at all. So, Democrats think they will hold the cards because any new bill will require Democratic votes. Pelosi indicated today that she thought they would eventually be a bill, although some Republican sources are skeptical. There are differences between the sites. Democrats oppose an interim bill for the end of the employment benefits until there is a sense that a broader bill is within reach. The Senate meets next week, and expect Senate Republicans to set up a number of votes on unemployment benefits to make Democrats squirm."

But I don't understand why Democrats just instantaneously want to take a continuing resolution off the table, one that may be just days in length in order to score some political points to try to create this narrative that, you know, hey, Republicans can't get things done?

      "utterance": "Yes, what we are looking at here is a typical situation we've been through literally the worst economic collapse this country has ever seen. It's on par with the Great Depression if not worse, and Democrats see it as an opportunity in an election year to score political points off of it. And I understand there's always going to be politics and decisions made by politicians trying to show up their opponents and to expose their opponents' weaknesses but that's not what's going on here. Democrats are trying to use the political process in order to crash the economy, to keep the economy cratered. It's why they don't want to open back up. It's why they want to continue all of these measures that have led to the cratering in the first place, because they want Donald Trump to go into the election with the terrible economy. It's the only way that they hope they can win. And actually, I think they're right about it. If they can manage to keep the economy cratered, that gives them some hope of winning."

      "utterance": "Well, at the beginning I was finding some common ground. But the conspiracy part I think is not accurate at all. The Democrats went along with the president to pass the CARES Act which was the biggest bill that the U.S. government has ever passed. They're not boycotting the president. If they were trying to tank the economy, they would've never agreed to do $2.6 trillion of rescue and relief money. They actually want to help the millions of people who have been unemployed. And the problem here is been the president -- I don't know if he doesn't want to be there or what. He's not getting involved in a detailed way, saying here's my specific -- here are my specific ideas of what I want to do. He is now a deathbed conversion to let's extend unemployment. They have been saying for weeks that they don't want to extend the unemployment, that they want to reduce it or may get zero. So I think the Republican Party in the Congress is confused at what the president wants to do. And I think inside the administration, they probably can't agree and that's why we are going back-and-forth on this."

And anything that Congress does that undermines people going back to work is going to -- goes towards destroying the economy. And that's the problem here. That's what I think that President Trump and Republicans and Democrats, I've given up any hope that they are in any way loyal opposition.

Thank you for joining us tonight here tonight. Erin, I want to start with you. The Democrats are promising that Joe Biden will be the most progressive president in the history of our nation. Bernie Sanders is saying it. AOC has said something similar. And, certainly, Congresswoman Omar is now saying it. We should believe them, shouldn't we? ERIN PERRINE, TRUMP 2020 DIRECTOR OF PRESS COMMUNICATIONS: We should absolutely take Democrats at their word that Joe Biden would be the most progressive socialist candidate that any party has ever seen in the United States. His policies certainly fit the mantra, whether it's amnesty for 11 million illegal immigrants in this country or raising taxes to the tune of over $7 trillion. Let's remember Hillary Clinton was considered pretty progressive at her $2 trillion tax hike, but Joe Biden actually wants to raise taxes over $7 trillion on the American people. It makes sense because he is Beijing Biden. I mean, he's more interested in raising the American corporate tax rate to higher than communist China then he is about protecting jobs and making this a free country. It's pretty clear he's not only progressive, he is dangerous for this country."

Now, Tammy, Vice President Biden has promised that he would do three debates.

But she's the only one he's who's already been vetted. You know, what you got is a problem here, like with Bass, is that some surprise could come up. If you're going to choose someone who the media and the right have only now begun to look at, you're going to have some interesting October surprises. So, he already limited himself by excluding the entire talent pool, and I understand he's pandering to people but what you want is leadership. We found with the Obama administration that because someone looks like you doesn't mean that their policies are going to directly help you or be good for you. So, this is the dynamic that he has set up for himself. I mean, look, the Democrats made a lot of promises and very infrequently do they deliver, except on this progressive platform. This is what Americans are not going to see. They have been afraid of a platform fight at the convention but now that very few people are going to be allowed in, about 300, I can guarantee you, media is going to be controlled. You're not going to see the fight about the real platform. Forget Joe Biden's platform, it's going to be about the Democratic Party's platform and this is about the left taking over the party and looking at 2024 and they are destroying it. They don't realize. It's like anything that destroys the host, they don't care that they are destroying the host, but the American people are watching it happen in front of them."

    {
      "speaker": "PERRINE",
      "utterance": "Well, it truly and honestly doesn't matter who Joe Biden picks to be his vice presidential nominee. Why? Because not only do they have to try to defend his socialist manifesto, the Bernie-Biden plan that they put out to try and defend that disastrous policy which would stifle economic opportunity and on day one undo the Trump tax cuts which sent businesses soaring in this country. But then they have to try to defend almost 50 years of Joe Biden's failures before he tried to run for president this time. What does it include? Well, Beijing Biden yet again cozying up to China, sending jobs overseas instead of defending America."

A lot of people have been hurt. A lot of law enforcement people have been hurt and they should've done it 60 days ago. So, now, they have freed up the park, cleaned out the park, and they are moving their way. If they have any other problems, we are going take very strong offensive force. It seems to be cleaning up and if it doesn't clean up, we are going to do something very, very powerful because we have no choice. Not that I don't want -- I don't want to do it but we have no choice."

When you have a Democrat-run city, you have a city with problems. If Joe Biden is elected president, the chaos and bloodshed will spread to every community in our land. You'll have a Portland everywhere. Look at Portland. It's like from -- from 100 years ago."

In other news about your security, the Trump administration has just gotten a big win. The Supreme Court has denied a request to halt construction of the border wall. Joining us now for reaction, DHS Acting Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli. Thank you so much for joining us tonight. I'd like you to first react to the Supreme Court clearing the way for some $2.5 billion of Pentagon allocated funds to be used for the border wall."

      "speaker": "KEN CUCCINELLI, DHS ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY",
      "utterance": "Yes, two enthusiastic thumbs- up. This is -- look, the president has told us and he has directed his administration to press ahead aggressively but always within the boundaries of the law, always within the boundaries of the law, and the Supreme Court acknowledged today and has let the building of the wall continue. We passed 200 miles more than a month ago. We'll pass 300 miles before -- well before the end of the summer, and we'll pass 400 miles not long after that. We'll certainly get well over 400 miles by the end of the year, just as this president promised. So, Supreme Court has -- has kept us free to do that. Customs and Border Protection and the Army Corps of Engineers are pressing ahead hard to make it happen, and today's win was a big one to make sure we stay on track for that goal."

      "utterance": "//FoxNews.com, which is this idea that half, half of police departments are getting budget cuts in this time and age right now. I've got to tell you, it's going to be devastating to the country and its residents. They are supposed to be protecting the citizenry. You can't just go and cut their budget and not expect to have a consequence."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CUCCINELLI",
      "utterance": "You know, that's why police become police officers, is they want to do good and protect their communities. Of course, you have the every so often bad apple, but there's no profession on earth that doesn't have that. And now, for purely political reasons, you have left-wing governments, city councils, mayors and so forthcoming these budgets."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "And let's be really clear about who's hurt the most",
      "utterance": "where do you need policing the most? You needed them most of the poorest communities, the communities that are most crime-ridden and they are disproportionately minority, and this president is upset about it. He fights that continuously, as you know. He passed criminal justice reform. So, it's a balance. He's very tough, very tough on crime. He also knows we need to get it right. He did what his predecessor wouldn't do on the reform side. And now, we have all these left-wing local governments that are trying to gut their police departments. We have seen it in New York. We are seeing it all over the country, and it is bad news for the communities that need it the most."

    {
      "speaker": "CHAFFETZ",
      "utterance": "It's amazing to me that Democrats' love of government, government employees and more government, except when it comes to law enforcement, then they just want chaos and they are okay with rioting and domestic terrorism. I mean, that's the way I see it. That's what I see is going on. I need you to comment. Give us the latest about Portland, because there was a transition based on what the governor was doing with the state police. Where's the line? When President Trump might step in with the National Guard, is it getting better and will it solve the problem?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CUCCINELLI",
      "utterance": "Well, it's -- violence was declining this week and then last night, the state police did what we have been asking them to do for months and that's to show up. And they did show up, and they began doing the policing that the Portland police wouldn't do around the courthouse and the federal facilities. And lo and behold, in two months, we had our first night without violence last night. All -- and this is \"I told you so\" moment really, but we have still got to get through the weekend. Weekends are always tougher for the - - from the rioting and violence standpoint. We'll see how tonight and tomorrow night go. But we're going in the right direction. Part of the reason we were positioned to go on the right direction is because President Trump supported us in advancing officers into Portland to protect that courthouse, to protect the federal facilities and, frankly I think the state and local governments were just embarrassed that we were holding out the way we were and doing our job and performing our mission where everywhere else in America, even other cities where the president is at odds with the mayor, we still cooperated with the professional law enforcement level but not in Portland. And Governor Brown has changed that. I will give her that credit. This is a win-win for the president and this administration and Governor Brown and her state police. It makes Portland look pathetic, more pathetic. But be that as it may, they did what we asked. It took them a long time to do it, but as soon as they did it, it started to work."

Some documents show previously unknown communication between Epstein and Maxwell, while others suggest Bill Clinton traveled to Epstein's infamous island. Joining us now with the latest updates is FOX News' Trace Gallagher -- Trace."

      "speaker": "TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Jason, good evening. Ghislaine Maxwell claimed she hasn't been in contact with Jeffrey Epstein for more than a decade and yet court documents from a civil case Maxwell was involved in back in 2015 contradict that statement showing that Maxwell and Epstein had lengthy email exchanges, including in 2015 where Epstein tried to counsel her on how to defend yourself against allegations of illegal behavior, telling Maxwell she has, quote, done nothing wrong and she should, quote, go outside, head high, not as an escaped convict. Go to parties. Deal with it. The judge in Maxwell's current case says she has again sought to muddy the waters. She is accused of helping Epstein recruit and traffic underage girls for sex. And the documents show one of the accusers, Virginia Giuffre, remember seeing former President Bill Clinton on Jeffrey Epstein's private island, quoting, you know I remember asking Jeffrey, what's Bill Clinton doing here? Saying Epstein laughed it off, responding, quote, well, he owes me a favor. Giuffre goes on to say she didn't know if Epstein was serious -- Jason."

New today, President Trump responded to the divisive and politically charged eulogy delivered by former President Obama yesterday at Congressman John Lewis' funeral, during which he attacked President Trump for the use of federal forces to help with the surging violence in cities across America among other topics, and linked actions taken by President Trump and his administration to those of segregationist George Wallace -- happens to be a Democrat, by the way."

Joining me now with their reaction, radio talk show host Larry Elder and civil rights attorney Leo Terrell. Leo, I want to start with you. Do we really think that President Obama kind of solved all the race relation problems? I mean, I was in Congress with -- while he was the president for eight years. I didn't really see an improvement at all when it was Obama-Biden."

      "speaker": "This is what President Trump has done",
      "utterance": "lowest black on appointment rate. He has funded historical black colleges. That's a fact. He signed an executive order on justice reform bill and more importantly, the First Step Act ended with the crime bill of Joe Biden created in 1994. I challenge any Democrat, send me an email, write down all the things that Obama and Biden did for blacks. It will probably be an empty sheet of paper but send it to me because President Trump has a record to run on for African-Americans. Send it to me if you're a Democrat. There's nothing on it."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "LARRY ELDER, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST",
      "utterance": "Well, Jason, at the John Lewis funeral, Barack Obama compared Donald Trump to Bull Connor. For the young ones out there, Bull Connor is that Southern law man who would sic water hoses and dogs on civil rights workers. As Leo pointed out, what Donald Trump done has signed the First Step Act that allowed about a thousand people, mostly young black men to have their sentences looked at and reduced an average of seventy (ph) months. Obama also compared Donald Trump to George Wallace. That man, for the young ones out there, stood in front of the University of Alabama and said, segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever. Donald Trump wants to give urban parents the right to opt out of an underperforming government school and go to any school they want, public or private, if they can get into it, slight difference. Once again, you have Barack Obama pulling out the race card because he knows that if he gets black people angry and guilty why people stirred up, they will go in there and pull that lever for Barack Obama. But the commencement exercise Obama, the one that goes to Howard University, says that these kids who were fresh eye and hopeful, he says to these kids, if you can be born anywhere, anytime, where would it be, when would it be, he says right here in America. So, it's B.S. that he sells election time for votes and it's disgusting and it's offensive to all the people who fought and died to make this country as perfect as we are trying to make it today."
