Hello and welcome to \"Justice\" live from DC. I'm Jeanine Pirro. Thanks for being with us. And thanks to all of you for once again making \"Justice\" number one last weekend. And for having made \"Liars, Leakers, And Liberals\" number one on the New York Times best sellers list. Coming up in a few minutes, a \"Justice\" exclusive. I'll be joined live by the governor-elect of Florida Ron DeSantis. His first interview since his opponent conceded just a few hours ago.  Also here tonight, Kellyanne Conway, Majority Leader Congressman Kevin McCarthy with Congressman Steve Scalise. Dr. Sebastian Gorka and Dana Loesch. They are all ahead. But first my open.  I for one am moving on from fake news. There is a new phrase in town, a new lingo with which to familiarize yourself, fake laws. That's what I said, fake laws. This is not about taking sides whether you are left, right, independent or agnostic, respect for our laws is essential. They are not fake, we are a nation of laws.  Now, Senators Kamala Harris, Kirsten Gillibrand, Cory Booker - ironically all three eyeing the 2020 Presidential run - and the left insist that ICE, Immigration and Customs Enforcement be abolished. The call was wrapped up this week when Harris asserted that ICE is perceived as the modern-day Klu Klux Klan. Take a look as she grills acting director of ICE Ronald Vitiello.",

      "sentences": "Since when are carrying out the duties of law enforcement akin to acting like a Klansman? Since when are men and women to whom we give badges and guns, you uphold the law and put their lives on the line considered domestic terrorists? Since when do we persecute men and women for doing the job the law empowers them to do?  Perception is one thing, but laws passed by Congress signed by the Commander-in-Chief are reality. Irrespective of our like or dislike of a law, no one can choose to ignore the law. The law is meant to be followed and enforced. Kamala, you were a prosecutor and Attorney General. You enforced the law by prosecuting those who didn't follow it. I doubt you asked the accused about their perception of the law, and I doubt you even cared. In fact, when you ran for Senate you promised to quote \"combat\" transnational gangs, working with Mexico to prevent them from bringing guns and drugs across our border. To fight human trafficking and to improve public safety.  How are you going to do that without ICE? Who are you going to call?  Ghost busters? Was it a con then or is the con now?  As someone who claims to champion minority communities, you know they are the ones most impacted by drug cartels and gangs coming through our porous border. Between 2017 and 2018, ICE seized more than 368,000 pounds of drugs and made almost 5,000 drug arrests. ICE made more than 1,700 arrests in gang investigations including MS-13 members. More than 430 criminal arrests in child exploitation investigations, rescuing hundreds of child victims, and you want to oppose ICE? You call them like KKK?  If you don't like a law, Kamala, there is a process to change it, and here is the rub. You can change it. As a United States senator, work within the framework of the exalted position to which you were elected; sponsor a bill, get support for the bill and get it passed.   Don't gin up people into a frenzy suggesting ICE is like the KKK with images of burning crosses and lynching of innocent African-Americans. In likening it to innocent Mexicans and Central Americans, you of all people should understand the anger and hate that that conjures up. As a woman who is half African-American, you of all people should understand the history and the role of the KKK played through the Democratic Party. So let me see if I get this right. ICE should be eliminated because it scares people. People who have broken our laws to come here. Many have already exhibited violence along the way, in Tijuana and Guatemala. Mostly men demanding entrance as if they are entitled to be here.  What you are doing is planting seeds of fear, resistance and resentment against ICE, among people who have no right to come here, who have already broken our laws to get here. And they are scared? People should be afraid when they violate our laws. The people though who should be afraid are innocent Americans at risk in sanctuary cities and states where illegals who are also criminals are given safe haven.  Your con puts those American citizens in jeopardy. How about a little dose of reality, Kamala and not your perception nonsense. Took at these pictures. Kate Steinle, Mollie Tibbetts, Nisa Mickens, Kayla Cuevas and the scores of American citizens killed by illegals. Your perception of ICE as a KKK is pure insanity. This is America. The law is the law. Respect it. Honor it, fear it. Damn it, fear it. Any questions? And that's my open. If you like my opening statements, you will love my new book, \"New York Times\" number one bestseller, \"Liars, Leakers, and Liberals: The Case Against the Anti-Trump Conspiracy.\"   And now with reaction to my \"Opening Statement\" and all the breaking news today, counselor to the President, Kellyanne Conway.

They were unceremoniously defeated throughout this, spectacularly defeated in 2010. She held that for two terms. She is a great fundraiser, they say, but she also represents San Francisco. That's not the rest of the country. If the Democrats want to win back states in the Presidential election that Donald Trump clobbered them in like Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Ohio, they need to reach into those areas for their leadership. So, if the generation is ideological, but she doesn't have the votes right now for speakership. I just think that the people on the committees who have been on the show since the Democrats won the House have been very careful to say, \"Well, we're not going to only investigate, we will legislate,\" and when asked what can you work on, the President is telling - - they still don't know the answer.

The KKK was the armed wing of the Democratic Party and to say that ICE are comparable to the KKK, ICE are the agents. They are just police officers who protect this nation from invading illegal immigrants, whether it is MS-13, whether it's human traffickers, whether it's drug smugglers, these are people who put on vests every day, put on bullet proof vests. Why? Because their life is in danger and as Dana pointed out, half of them are Hispanic and they're risking their lives for America every day. This woman should be ashamed of herself.

And for having made \"Liars, Leakers, And Liberals\" number one on the New York Times best sellers list. Coming up in a few minutes, a \"Justice\" exclusive.

Also here tonight, Kellyanne Conway, Majority Leader Congressman Kevin McCarthy with Congressman Steve Scalise. Dr. Sebastian Gorka and Dana Loesch. They are all ahead. But first my open. I for one am moving on from fake news. There is a new phrase in town, a new lingo with which to familiarize yourself, fake laws. That's what I said, fake laws. This is not about taking sides whether you are left, right, independent or agnostic, respect for our laws is essential. They are not fake, we are a nation of laws. Now, Senators Kamala Harris, Kirsten Gillibrand, Cory Booker - ironically all three eyeing the 2020 Presidential run - and the left insist that ICE, Immigration and Customs Enforcement be abolished. The call was wrapped up this week when Harris asserted that ICE is perceived as the modern-day Klu Klux Klan. Take a look as she grills acting director of ICE Ronald Vitiello."

      "utterance": "Since when are carrying out the duties of law enforcement akin to acting like a Klansman? Since when are men and women to whom we give badges and guns, you uphold the law and put their lives on the line considered domestic terrorists? Since when do we persecute men and women for doing the job the law empowers them to do? Perception is one thing, but laws passed by Congress signed by the Commander-in-Chief are reality. Irrespective of our like or dislike of a law, no one can choose to ignore the law. The law is meant to be followed and enforced. Kamala, you were a prosecutor and Attorney General. You enforced the law by prosecuting those who didn't follow it. I doubt you asked the accused about their perception of the law, and I doubt you even cared. In fact, when you ran for Senate you promised to quote \"combat\" transnational gangs, working with Mexico to prevent them from bringing guns and drugs across our border. To fight human trafficking and to improve public safety. How are you going to do that without ICE? Who are you going to call?  Ghost busters? Was it a con then or is the con now? As someone who claims to champion minority communities, you know they are the ones most impacted by drug cartels and gangs coming through our porous border. Between 2017 and 2018, ICE seized more than 368,000 pounds of drugs and made almost 5,000 drug arrests. ICE made more than 1,700 arrests in gang investigations including MS-13 members. More than 430 criminal arrests in child exploitation investigations, rescuing hundreds of child victims, and you want to oppose ICE? You call them like KKK? If you don't like a law, Kamala, there is a process to change it, and here is the rub. You can change it. As a United States senator, work within the framework of the exalted position to which you were elected; sponsor a bill, get support for the bill and get it passed. Don't gin up people into a frenzy suggesting ICE is like the KKK with images of burning crosses and lynching of innocent African-Americans. In likening it to innocent Mexicans and Central Americans, you of all people should understand the anger and hate that that conjures up. As a woman who is half African-American, you of all people should understand the history and the role of the KKK played through the Democratic Party. So let me see if I get this right. ICE should be eliminated because it scares people. People who have broken our laws to come here. Many have already exhibited violence along the way, in Tijuana and Guatemala. Mostly men demanding entrance as if they are entitled to be here. What you are doing is planting seeds of fear, resistance and resentment against ICE, among people who have no right to come here, who have already broken our laws to get here. And they are scared? People should be afraid when they violate our laws. The people though who should be afraid are innocent Americans at risk in sanctuary cities and states where illegals who are also criminals are given safe haven. Your con puts those American citizens in jeopardy. How about a little dose of reality, Kamala and not your perception nonsense. Took at these pictures. Kate Steinle, Mollie Tibbetts, Nisa Mickens, Kayla Cuevas and the scores of American citizens killed by illegals. Your perception of ICE as a KKK is pure insanity. This is America. The law is the law. Respect it. Honor it, fear it. Damn it, fear it. Any questions? And that's my open. If you like my opening statements, you will love my new book, \"New York Times\" number one bestseller, \"Liars, Leakers, and Liberals: The Case Against the Anti-Trump Conspiracy.\" And now with reaction to my \"Opening Statement\" and all the breaking news today, counselor to the President, Kellyanne Conway.

They are trying through this lame duck session to actually get things passed, to try to get action in immigration or trade or the economy. Those who are running in 2020 really have nothing of substance to say it seems and if America didn't get enough of Kamala Harris during the Kavanaugh hearings, they can see what her tactics are. They showed no dignity and no integrity during the Kavanaugh hearings trying to destroy this man and dehumanize him, and now here we are back.

They are worried that a vote for Nancy Pelosi looks like it's a vote for the past. She had that job for two terms before. They were unceremoniously defeated throughout this, spectacularly defeated in 2010. She held that for two terms. She is a great fundraiser, they say, but she also represents San Francisco. That's not the rest of the country. If the Democrats want to win back states in the Presidential election that Donald Trump clobbered them in like Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Ohio, they need to reach into those areas for their leadership. So, if the generation is ideological, but she doesn't have the votes right now for speakership. I just think that the people on the committees who have been on the show since the Democrats won the House have been very careful to say, \"Well, we're not going to only investigate, we will legislate,\" and when asked what can you work on, the President is telling - - they still don't know the answer. PIRRO; But how do you think they view this kind of left wing progressive lunacy? Do you think that's what got them the House as opposed to gerrymandering and people retiring?

Oh, boy, if he or she is running, I certainly should. But it's ideologically disparate, and yet, they really all share the same opinion on abortion, on guns, on the tax cut which none of them voted for, on deregulation.

So the President knows that, but he is so focused on his work. And look at what happened just this week. You have the governor's race finally called in Georgia and Florida.

We are already seeing such a great economy because we worked with President Trump to cut taxes for every single American and if you're a hardworking family out there, seeing more money in your paycheck, but you sure don't want to see Nancy Pelosi take that away, so I want to see us make sure that we fight to protect the gains that we've made, keep this economy growing and keep fighting for the hardworking people who elected us."

They are talking about exactly that right now, about more obstruction, about trying to just harass and subpoena and maybe even impeach the President, but, Judge, when I was out in a lot of those swing districts, the districts that went from Republican to Democrat that ultimately flipped the House. Those candidates were not talking about harassing the President. They were talking about a lot of the things we worked on, and so it's going to be interesting to see. Are they going to join up with Nancy Pelosi after their election? And be a part of that resistance movement, so it's going to be - I think it's going to be a real tough year for them in 2020 because that's not what they were elected on. But we're going to fight to defend the gains we made and if they want to harass the administration and the President, we're going to be stopping them using every tool we have, but in the end that is going to be Nancy Pelosi's decision to see which way she wants to go, but we're going to be there to fight her if she goes the wrong way or tries to reverse any gains we've made."

But way they play seems to be rather different from the way you guys play. They fight to win as Mark Elias so clearly. What do we fight to do?"

    {
      "speaker": "SCALISE",
      "utterance": "Well, Judge, they don't just fight to win, they literally will go around the rules. And what you are seeing right now, they are not trying to count every vote. They use that mantra, but if you voted legally in Florida and then all of a sudden, 10,000 votes just show up from under somebody's mattress and it just so happens to be for a candidate different than the one you voted for, then they are trying to steal your vote. And voter theft is something that is against the law, and so obviously, both teams have attorneys down there as they should to try to stop theft from occurring, but it's surprising when you see the same county, Broward County, they have had a history of not being able to get this right, but I am glad Ron DeSantis is down there with his team, Matt Gaetz and I talked a lot about this and what he is doing, to make sure the law is being followed. So we have our own folks making sure that they are not going to steal this election."

But I want to move on to your book. In your book, you talk about what happened to you. Was there ever a period of time, Congressman, when you said, \"You know what? I got shot. I almost died several times as a result of this injury.\" Did you ever think about not coming back and just hanging up the shingle somewhere and doing something else?"

I love the job that I have, the ability to work with this President to get this country back on track. And I wasn't sure if I was going to be able to recover from my injuries and that would have been the only thing that would have kept me back. But it was one of the things that motivated me to fight to get back and I talk about this a lot in the book. In \"Back in the Game\" - in the book, I wrote about the miracles that happened along the way, the heroes that saved my life and helped me to be able to recover, but just what the motivations were why I wanted to fight so hard to get back, to be able to be a part of some of the things that we were able to do historically over this last year, including the tax cut bill. It was something special to work on, working with President Trump, working with Chairman Kevin Brady and the rest of the team to do something that's truly transformed this country and the economy."

      "speaker": "PIRRO",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "DESANTIS",
      "utterance": "Well, yes, you had two counties -- Broward and Palm Beach County -- these ballots started appearing that were not initially logged. Because you know we track every vote, Judge. I mean, that's just how we do these elections now, so it started that they were all real big Democrat margins. And so Rick Scott's margin went down a lot. My margin started going down.  Now, I was never really in danger of losing because my margin was big enough. But what it did do was at least, in my case, it triggered a requirement to run the ballots through the machines again. So all the counties did this all through the machines and it basically didn't change anything. It was the same as it was. And so I am fortunate that this is behind us. I have been work since election tonight to do the transition. We are going to put good people in the administration and we've got a good agenda. But, now I can go forward without having to worry about this."

I mean, the lawsuit that was brought against her, the judge actually referenced what is allowed in terms of someone losing their job doing that kind of thing. I mean, he laid the ground work for that kind of thing as being appropriate."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DESANTIS",
      "utterance": "I don't think there is any question that there was a flagrant violation of the law. I mean, some of these votes that were counted late, a day or two after the election were supposedly cast during early voting and they were just never reported as having been cast, and we have a lot of transparency and legal requirements precisely because that's what confers legitimacy to these results. Brenda Snipes obviously, didn't follow that, but this isn't the first time.  I mean, two years ago she was reprimanded by a Federal court. She had destroyed ballots illegally in a race involving Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, and so I think the state's interest in this is, if people say, \"Oh, Florida has got all of these problems.\" Judge, Florida as a whole doesn't have the problems. I mean, we have 67 counties and 65 of them were able to do it well. You have Broward and you have Palm Beach. You know, Miami-Dade is more populous than Broward. They didn't have a single problem. It's a Democratic County. Bay County which got hit by Hurricane Michael, they had their results done. And so it's really Broward and Palm Beach and I think they've tarnished the image of the state."

    {
      "speaker": "DESANTIS",
      "utterance": "Well, obviously, I didn't know whether we would be in the majority or minority, but the fact that we are in the minority, I mean, quite frankly, I think it is going be tough in the House. I think a lot of the work we were doing unfortunately is going to come to an end when the new congress convenes because I think the Democrats, they are not going to want to hold anybody accountable for any of this stuff. Hopefully in the Senate, they will take over some of that and bring some accountability. So I'm glad I am where I am. I think I can do a lot more for Florida as Governor than being one congressman in the minority."

Every election this happens. We have to get it right.\"  Brenda Snipes has to go. I mean, I think that that's been universally acknowledged at this particular point. Broward needs to get it together, that's for sure. But DeSantis won. He was always going to win because his policies appealed to Floridians. That only made sense. The same with Scott, so the right conclusion finally took place and was rightfully acknowledged."

It was a repeat of what had happened over so many years, but I want to move on, and I would like to talk about the caravan. There is a statement here that we have from a caravan member that it want you to react to. Where the caravan member, I believe his name is Henry Salinas. He says, \"It's going to be all against one, one against all. All of Central America against one, and one against Central America. All against Trump, Trump against all.\" All right, this is someone who is violating our laws to come and live in this country and reap the benefits of being an American, breaking our laws to get here.

I don't understand why this is about President Trump. It seems weird that someone would say this when they are come together United States to seek asylum especially after rejecting the asylum and benefits that were offered by Mexico, which makes myself and a lot of other people legitimately wonder whether this is about asylum or whether it is about standing and making a point about this administration. But to that point, idea that somehow wanting individuals to enter legally and orderly. I mean, we just saw Billy Idol do it the other day, go through his naturalization ceremony for crying out loud, if Billy Idol can do it, anybody can do it. To somehow misrepresent that as you hate all immigration is disingenuous, it's intellectually fraudulent, and I'm so tired of seeing that argument from so many people on the left, so many elected Democrats. I really want to know, Judge. I want to know where Democrats stand on immigration policy in the Trump administration. Are they fine with letting these individuals in?"

    {

I have been to the border many times. I live in Texas. This is a huge issue in Texas and I've heard all of these individuals really laugh at remarks like this because she hasn't been the first person to sort of suggest that the motives of these individuals isn't that they are doing their jobs and they are enforcing the law, it's that they are somehow racist. They laugh. These Hispanic and Latino law enforcement officers, these people who are border agents, people who are in ICE, they all laugh at this idea, and it's also pretty offensive for someone like Kamala Harris to say this because to make that comparison, you have to do a leap of logic and suggest that somehow, skin color is akin to breaking the law. I don't really think that she thought this argument out all the way. But the bottom line is that these individuals - and Judge, I know you've talked about this on your show, they serve their communities, they put their lives on the line, and they do a great job."

You heard my open. For a woman, a former prosecutor, former Attorney General to plant the seed that ICE is like the KKK, suggesting that we should probably resist them, it puts not just Americans in danger, but and the ICE agents as well."

Because it wasn't the Republican Party.  Does she know which party President Lincoln, the great emancipator belonged to? It wasn't the Democratic Party. The KKK was the armed wing of the Democratic Party and to say that ICE are comparable to the KKK, ICE are the agents. They are just police officers who protect this nation from invading illegal immigrants, whether it is MS-13, whether it's human traffickers, whether it's drug smugglers, these are people who put on vests every day, put on bullet proof vests. Why? Because their life is in danger and as Dana pointed out, half of them are Hispanic and they're risking their lives for America every day. This woman should be ashamed of herself.

All of them are in favor of the open porous borders. All of them running for President in 2020. The underlying theme is let's get all the illegals in so they can vote because if you know from the Florida recount, even though Mark Elias denied it, in the transcripts themselves, it says that as they took out illegals in the recount, the lawyers for Gillum and Scott were like, \"No, no, no, keep them in.\" That's what it's about.

It's about locking in another voter base. When you see the African-American population double in their positive attitude towards the President, you see the potential for black America to break off the Democratic Plantation. They are desperate to lock in a new demographic and they want to do it illegally. When they say voter suppression, Judge, what are they talking about? They are talking about suppressing the votes of people who are committing a crime when they vote because they are not US citizens. That is exactly the votes we need to suppress because America is about rule of law, and you get to vote if you are an American citizen."
