We're exactly 12 hours away from one of the most anticipated senate hearings in recent memory. Tomorrow morning, Judge Brett Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford will make their case in front of the senate judiciary committee, and an outside sex crimes prosecutor. Well, we have every angle of this story covered tonight. You do not want to miss a moment. Including, we'll talk to a high school friend of Brett Kavanaugh who is mentioned prominently in the calendar that he submitted from the 1980's to the judiciary committee today. She'll join me in studio. Plus, an examination of a very flimsy polygraph submission by Dr. Ford, as well as some last-minute stall tactics by Democrats that may show them to be less confident than some would assume. What must Kavanaugh accomplish at tomorrow's hearing and how might performance mean more than substance? Raymond Arroyo is here with some seen and unseen insights. But we begin with the accuser's last act. That's the focus of tonight's \"Angle.\"    SEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL, D—CONN.: I have opposed his nomination. From the beginning. I've opposed it from the beginning. I think the nomination should be withdrawn. SENATE MINORITY LEADER SCHUMBER, D—N.Y.: I strongly believe Judge Kavanaugh should withdraw from consideration. And the president should withdraw this nomination if Kavanaugh won't do it voluntarily. HOUSE MINORITY LEADER NANCY PELOSI, D—CALIF.: I join leader Schumer and calling for Judge Kavanaugh to withdraw his name from consideration.",

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "sentences": "Oh, he looks adorable on that stage. So, of course, porn star lawyer, Michael Avenatti, delivers a gift today. He drafted an affidavit in which this woman, Julie Swetnick, claims that Kavanaugh, while a high school student in the early '80s, spiked drinks at house parties to loosen girls' inhibitions, and then essentially groomed them to be gang raped inside rooms. Swetnick further alleges that Kavanaugh was present at one such party in approximately 1982 when she, herself, was gang rape, though she says he didn't take part in it. Swetnick claims that there are witnesses who can vouch for her account. We haven't heard from them yet. Reacting to these outrageous charges, Kavanaugh today said the following, this is ridiculous and from the twilight zone. I don't know who this is and this never happened.   Now this is the third in a series of what certainly appears to be a carefully timed and coordinated smear campaign on Kavanaugh. First, there was Christine Blasey Ford, who's still scheduled, as I said, to testify tomorrow morning before the senate judiciary committee. Exactly no one has corroborated her claims, and the polygraph test that she submitted to the judiciary committee today, it read like it was conducted by Cory Booker. We have more on that in a few moments. Then, from state further left, came social justice advocate Deborah Ramirez, who claimed that Kavanaugh exposed himself to her during their freshman year at Yale. Ramirez, however, may have exposed the holes in her own salacious story by admitting to friends that she couldn't be quite sure if Kavanaugh was, in fact, the guilty party. Again, there are no corroborating witnesses. Kavanaugh has strenuously denied that it happened. And Ramirez herself admits to being bombed, slurring her words at the time, and she conceded that her memory was, quote, foggy. And then today, we saw a new addition to the playbill, Ms. Swetnick. Now like the other two heroines of the anti-Kavanaugh resistance, her allegations are already getting bad reviews. She says she attended at least ten parties where gang-rapes were taking place. What? She also said that she went back to one such party in approximately 1982 after knowing that these gang rapes were taking place, where then she herself was raped. And it's important to note in 1982, she was a sophomore in college. How many college students do you know who attend high school functions where gang-rapes had previously occurred? None of it makes much sense at all, but this does.  Tonight, we're learning a lot more about Avenatti's new prize, Ms. Swetnick. According to Politico, her ex-boyfriend paints a disturbing picture of her own character. In a phone interview with Politico, he said this about a 2001 injunction, right after I broke up with her, Swetnick, she was threatening my family, threatening my wife, and threatening to do harm to my baby at that time. I know a lot about her. She's not credible at all. He said not at all. Wow. Despite all of that, of course, the media today did what they always do, try to make President Trump out to be the bad guy in all of this. Another choreographed performance.",

We're exactly 12 hours away from one of the most anticipated senate hearings in recent memory. Tomorrow morning, Judge Brett Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford will make their case in front of the senate judiciary committee, and an outside sex crimes prosecutor. Well, we have every angle of this story covered tonight. You do not want to miss a moment. Including, we'll talk to a high school friend of Brett Kavanaugh who is mentioned prominently in the calendar that he submitted from the 1980's to the judiciary committee today. She'll join me in studio. Plus, an examination of a very flimsy polygraph submission by Dr. Ford, as well as some last-minute stall tactics by Democrats that may show them to be less confident than some would assume. What must Kavanaugh accomplish at tomorrow's hearing and how might performance mean more than substance? Raymond Arroyo is here with some seen and unseen insights. But we begin with the accuser's last act. That's the focus of tonight's \"Angle.\" SEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL, D—CONN.: I have opposed his nomination. From the beginning. I've opposed it from the beginning. I think the nomination should be withdrawn. SENATE MINORITY LEADER SCHUMBER, D—N.Y.: I strongly believe Judge Kavanaugh should withdraw from consideration. And the president should withdraw this nomination if Kavanaugh won't do it voluntarily.

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Oh, he looks adorable on that stage. So, of course, porn star lawyer, Michael Avenatti, delivers a gift today. He drafted an affidavit in which this woman, Julie Swetnick, claims that Kavanaugh, while a high school student in the early '80s, spiked drinks at house parties to loosen girls' inhibitions, and then essentially groomed them to be gang raped inside rooms. Swetnick further alleges that Kavanaugh was present at one such party in approximately 1982 when she, herself, was gang rape, though she says he didn't take part in it. Swetnick claims that there are witnesses who can vouch for her account. We haven't heard from them yet. Reacting to these outrageous charges, Kavanaugh today said the following, this is ridiculous and from the twilight zone. I don't know who this is and this never happened. Now this is the third in a series of what certainly appears to be a carefully timed and coordinated smear campaign on Kavanaugh. First, there was Christine Blasey Ford, who's still scheduled, as I said, to testify tomorrow morning before the senate judiciary committee. Exactly no one has corroborated her claims, and the polygraph test that she submitted to the judiciary committee today, it read like it was conducted by Cory Booker. We have more on that in a few moments. Then, from state further left, came social justice advocate Deborah Ramirez, who claimed that Kavanaugh exposed himself to her during their freshman year at Yale. Ramirez, however, may have exposed the holes in her own salacious story by admitting to friends that she couldn't be quite sure if Kavanaugh was, in fact, the guilty party. Again, there are no corroborating witnesses. Kavanaugh has strenuously denied that it happened. And Ramirez herself admits to being bombed, slurring her words at the time, and she conceded that her memory was, quote, foggy. And then today, we saw a new addition to the playbill, Ms. Swetnick. Now like the other two heroines of the anti-Kavanaugh resistance, her allegations are already getting bad reviews. She says she attended at least ten parties where gang-rapes were taking place. What? She also said that she went back to one such party in approximately 1982 after knowing that these gang rapes were taking place, where then she herself was raped. And it's important to note in 1982, she was a sophomore in college. How many college students do you know who attend high school functions where gang-rapes had previously occurred? None of it makes much sense at all, but this does. Tonight, we're learning a lot more about Avenatti's new prize, Ms. Swetnick. According to Politico, her ex-boyfriend paints a disturbing picture of her own character. In a phone interview with Politico, he said this about a 2001 injunction, right after I broke up with her, Swetnick, she was threatening my family, threatening my wife, and threatening to do harm to my baby at that time. I know a lot about her. She's not credible at all. He said not at all. Wow. Despite all of that, of course, the media today did what they always do, try to make President Trump out to be the bad guy in all of this. Another choreographed performance."

If Kavanagh drops out, we're halfway there. If Democrats are able to win the senate back, we'll have a path of blocking Trump for picking any of the arch conservatives on his short list.

Then a few hours ago, Dianne Feinstein urged Chairman Grassley to postpone tomorrow's hearing altogether. I predicted that would happen last night. You really can't make this up, folks. Well, here to analyze it all, former federal prosecutor, Fox News contributor, Andy McCarthy. Andy, for the record, we think sexual assault is a serious problem. I thought it was serious when Juanita Broaddrick said that she was raped by Bill Clinton, and we didn't get a lot of support from feminist back then. I think is important now. But I think what's been done to Brett Kavanaugh is one of the all-time travesties in American politics. It's despicable, it's a disgrace, and he's going to get confirmed, and there's no asterisk next to his name. I'm sorry. No way. Andy? I'm smoking over this.

And what they did here is exactly what you described. They sat on these allegations, they abuse the process, and they were permitted to do it. And the minute that you start to give delay to people who are seeking delay, you get more delay and more problems and that's why we're where we are now."

It's not a counterintelligence investigation like we've been talking about for a couple of years. The FBI ordinarily doesn't have jurisdiction to investigate state law crimes like assault and these kinds of sexual abuses. But what they do is, when the senate has to exercise, advice, and consent, they help that process by venting the candidates and bringing to the senate's attention information that they discovered during the course of that kind of investigation. It's not a full-blown criminal investigation. And a confirmation hearing is not a trial. The idea is, get enough information so that they can make a responsible decision about whether to approve this nomination or not. If they don't think that they can approve it, they shouldn't approve it. But it's not a trial, and the idea that the FBI can breathe life into an investigation that the state authority themselves wouldn't do because it's so time-barred and so stale, that it would be improper under the U.S constitution. Forget about the state statute of limitations. There's no state that we do this kind of investigation.

And given what we saw, not sure it's going to help her case much. First the questions consisted of the following. Number one, is any part of your written statement false? Number two, did you make any of it up? That's it. Well, not only was that it, but they didn't asked any specific questions about the specific charges. And further, the statements she submitted had multiple edits and contradictions. For instance, the letter says four boys and a couple of girls were at the party, but her letter to Feinstein says, me and four others were there. Lovely grammar. Even for a scientific polygraph report, this is really lame. It's like ACME polygraph. Here to react is Thomas Mauriello, former polygraph expert at the DOD, and current professor of criminology at the University of Maryland. OK, you've got to unpack this for us because I'm looking at this and I'm no expert. I think, what? It seems like it was done by one of the Democrats on the committee.

That's the question. And that's the question that should have been asked. When he asked a question about the letter, the letter has multiple issues in it. So, when you say, you know, you've been truthful to this letter, well, the letter itself doesn't have any specificity. It says, you know, four boys and a few girls. What's a few mean?

In fact, the members are saying the very opposite. Tomorrow I have a column in \"The Hill\" talking about what that standard might be, that they should apply something similar to a clear preponderance of the evidence, something that is higher than just preponderance, lower than beyond a reasonable doubt. But what worries me is that these members have been really working the airwaves to say, this is all politics, we are not a court of law. And that's too easy. There are two people who are going to have one heck of a day in front of that committee. Their lives, their reputations are at stake. These senators deserve -- they deserve, and these senators should be obligated to afford them some sense of how they're going to review the evidence. That is what we don't have here.

I could be doing this all day long. Should we continue for a little while? It doesn't matter to me. A couple of more? I don't care. \"New York Times,\" come on, the failing \"New York Times.\" Stand up. Go ahead. This is a very big moment for our country because you have a man who is very outstanding but he's got very strong charges against him, probably charges that nobody is going to be able to be able to prove. Someone could some and say 30 years ago, 25 years ago, 10 years ago, five years ago, he did a horrible thing to me. He did this, he did that, he did that. And honestly, it's a very dangerous period in our country. And it's being perpetrated by some very evil people. Some of them are Democrats, I must say, because some of them know that this is just a game that they are playing. It's a con game. It's at the highest level.

Our country will be better off for it. Stand and fight. It's the only way to win this. President Trump tells us that and shows us that every day. I'll see you back here tomorrow night.
