And we are all created equal and have an equal opportunity to succeed.  But, I think that what Thom Sowell is saying, it reminds me of what Daniel Patrick Moynihan said that in so many ways when we start to look at the black family especially in that post-civil rights era -- late 60s. You start to see a breakdown because so many of these policies, in fact, had negative repercussions in terms of separating. And we've seen obviously, a tremendous breakdown in terms of family formation in black America.

Does she receive slavery reparations from me? My great-grandparents got herein 1907, long after slavery was over and lived their entire lives in the North where Jim Crow was not in effect. It's almost impossible. I think, not almost, it is impossible to come up with a fair metric for recompensing slavery, 10 generations after slavery has end. If you want to say that recompense should be had for people who benefited from Jim Crow, again, for people who were harmed by Jim Crow, I think that's an easier case.

Again, if you -- if you look go back to the war on poverty, at that time, 20 percent of all black children were born into single mother families. Now, it's upward of 70 percent. The black poverty rate is essentially the same now as it was back in 1970. That does not suggest that throwing money at the problem is a cure for whatever historic ailments have been exhibited on the black community. And not just that. The reality is that we now live in a time where legalized discrimination is not only illegal. But it is for good reason. Look down upon sneered at by virtually all Americans.  And that means that the vast majority of decisions are in the hands of individuals. If we actually want people to rise in a society of any race, what we need to be doing now is focusing on making sure the incentives are aligned so that people make the right decisions to bring themselves up out of poverty.

And now, here we are talking about something that goes beyond that, we're talking about a child born alive as a result of an abortion and that fails and whether that child should receive the medical care necessary to keep it alive. And that is what this bill was about. It would require doctors to give the necessary requisite medical care to keep it born alive infants who survive an abortion going. And that's what the vote is about. And that's a pretty extreme position. And if you got, you know, these Democratic presidential contenders who are climbing out on that limb on that issue I think is very risky particularly when you put it together with all of these other, I think, it's fair to say extreme positions that someone in that party are now taking on everything from reparations as you discussed earlier to all of the elements of the green new deal, which are just remarkable how extreme they are.",

Infants who survive abortion arrive, in many cases, and they are an extremist and they need medical help. And this is not about the mother's health. This is about an infant child's health in America. And for her to say that is strikingly dishonest and misleading. But you know, this is a movement. This is the choice movement. The abortion movement is about euphemism like that, women's health, reproductive health. This is not about reproduction, abortion, and this certainly are not about reproduction. They are about non-reproduction. And what we are talking about here, Martha is this. What the defend -- what the opponents of this measure are trying to protect is not really a woman's health.

But what they're talking about is some compensation. Some way in that which you make up. I'm an opponent of reparations. Why? Because I -- in fact, I used to have these arguments with Charles Krauthammer. It was people who were saying, \"Yes, OK, let reparations happen.\" And that's the end of every effort such as affirmative action. Such as programs to help make up for problems in our public schools in this country. It was going to be like a one-time deal and then you're on your own.

And remember these things have been introduced in the Congress going back to the 80s, John Conyers and others, never gone anywhere. The American public overwhelmingly opposes this concept. So, it's not something that's realistic and pragmatic."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

He feels like the damage done was greater by the ways that were effort it to fix the problems -- the economic problems of the African-American community."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "Well, I think that's an overstatement because I don't think you can go back on slavery and the degradation of your humanity. The idea that you're to -- you know, was a three-fifths human in the Constitution is pretty insulting and obviously has done tremendous damage not only to black people but to the whole concept of America. And we are all created equal and have an equal opportunity to succeed. But, I think that what Thom Sowell is saying, it reminds me of what Daniel Patrick Moynihan said that in so many ways when we start to look at the black family especially in that post-civil rights era -- late 60s. You start to see a breakdown because so many of these policies, in fact, had negative repercussions in terms of separating. And we've seen obviously, a tremendous breakdown in terms of family formation in black America. I think now, 70 percent of black children born out of wedlock to me, this is a horrific -- just a horrendous social consequence. But, I don't think that you would want to say that's as bad as slavery."

      "speaker": "BEN SHAPIRO, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF FOR THE DAILY WIRE",

This is why Bernie Sanders is being called to account by a lot of members of the intersectional Democratic Party, who are deeply concerned and upset with the idea that he would not endorse slavery reparations. Now, it's hilarious is that what Bernie has said is he said all sorts of bad things have happened to black folks in America, and the best way to get beyond that is with my socialist redistributionist schemes. And Kamala Harris basically agrees with that. But because she calls it slavery reparations and Bernie doesn't, this means that Bernie is insufficiently -- he's insufficiently committed to the idea of race reparations in the country at large. It just goes to show you that race is the central issue for a huge swath of a Democratic Party and the big dividing line is going to be, which is more important, intersectionality or socialist redistributionist policies?"

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

How exactly are you going to repay the debt of slavery, and who is going to repay the debt of slavery, exactly?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHAPIRO",
      "utterance": "This exactly right, and Bernie Sanders said this last night on CNN. I mean, I'm sounding like a Bernie supporter here. But the fact is that Sanders is clearer on this than Kamala Harris or Elizabeth Warren. And when Kamala Harris is asked how, she immediately begins citing all sorts of kind of normal democratic government programs that you'd like to see pushed anyway. Which is not slavery reparations, that's just we would call the democratic political agenda."

      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHAPIRO",
      "utterance": "The reality is that slavery reparations per se are completely unworkable. Even big advocates of it like (INAUDIBLE), have failed to come up with any actual metric for how exactly we'd go about doing that. What do you do with, for example, Barack Obama whose father was black and not from the United States, and therefore, not having a history of slavery? And a mother who was white, would his family receive slavery reparations? How about Kamala Harris, whose father is Jamaican and mother is Indian? Does she receive slavery reparations? From whom? Does she receive slavery reparations from me? My great-grandparents got herein 1907, long after slavery was over and lived their entire lives in the North where Jim Crow was not in effect. It's almost impossible. I think, not almost, it is impossible to come up with a fair metric for recompensing slavery, 10 generations after slavery has end. If you want to say that recompense should be had for people who benefited from Jim Crow, again, for people who were harmed by Jim Crow, I think that's an easier case. But again, it's going to be hard to determine who pays, who should get how much, and who receives."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yes, and it amounts in the explanation that Kamala Harris gave, she talked about the LIFT Act which basically would be a tax credit for any families who make under $100,000. And she said that it would -- you know, obviously, include many families, but that it would include a lot of black families in her opinion. So, it is, as that as you say, another entitlement essentially. And when you look at -- you know, the amount of money in America that is going to entitlements, you go back to 2008, $430 billion. In 2020, the projected is almost double, $807 billion. So, it begs the question, if you continue to throw more money at the problem, what exactly does it -- does it solve necessarily?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SHAPIRO",
      "utterance": "This exactly right. I mean, that the war on poverty which was launched in part to rectify a lot of the racial imbalances and evils that hit -- that had been happening in the country but manifest in America. We've spent tens of trillions of dollars in the war on poverty, and there's been no actual real receipt from that as far as the number of black people who have been raised from poverty by the war on poverty. Again, if you -- if you look go back to the war on poverty, at that time, 20 percent of all black children were born into single mother families. Now, it's upward of 70 percent. The black poverty rate is essentially the same now as it was back in 1970. That does not suggest that throwing money at the problem is a cure for whatever historic ailments have been exhibited on the black community. And not just that. The reality is that we now live in a time where legalized discrimination is not only illegal. But it is for good reason. Look down upon sneered at by virtually all Americans. And that means that the vast majority of decisions are in the hands of individuals. If we actually want people to rise in a society of any race, what we need to be doing now is focusing on making sure the incentives are aligned so that people make the right decisions to bring themselves up out of poverty. Throwing money at the problem is not slavery reparations. In many cases, it is a way of ensuring that people have an incentive not to make the right decisions."

      "utterance": "I mean, it's surely nonsensical on a purely objective level. The fact is that Barack Obama in 2012 had African-Americans for Obama, and Jews, for Obama, and gays for Obama. The President Obama in 2012, basically decided that he was going to create an agglomeration of various groups associated by race, associate by sexual orientation. Women for Obama by sex, and then, he was going to stick all those groups together and hope that it was a majority. So, the notion that dividing people along racial lines is anything new in American policies is simply not true. The notion that Trump is specifically doing that or openly doing that right now, I'm not seeing the evidence of it."

      "speaker": "SHAPIRO",

Kamala Harris came out the other day and she said that people should stop ripping on identity politics because it's a way of shutting down the debate. Identity politics itself is the way that people shut down the debate. They say that weekends have a reasoned to conversation because I'm not a member of your group and you're not a member of my group. Well, then we can't have any discussions at all.

But realistically, this has been a talking point in the foreign policy establishment for several decades, this kind of no denuclearization, no peace. We must insist on complete, verifiable, irreversible denuclearization on the -- on the Korean Peninsula. That's just not realistic. And that's not to say I wish President Trump ill and achieving it, but even president Trump has said well that's probably not going to happen this time around. So people -- there are neoconservatives who will be prodding this president to put an economic stranglehold on Kim or you know, to threaten military intervention. But we just put out a report at the Eurasia Group Foundation that found the American people are very reluctant to want to use military intervention generally, much more reluctant than the foreign policy elite, and they -- and so they see -- they don't see this nuclear threat as existential as some in the -- in the foreign policy a community might want us to -- might want us to."

I mean, look, the reality is that Donald Trump has inherited a mess from his both Republican and Democratic predecessors who over the last 25 years kicked the can down the road and we've now run out of road. North Korea on his watch is on the verge of developing and deploying a ballistic missile that can deliver a nuclear warhead to the United States. So this is the reality that he's inherited. And you know, the one thing that he has done which we give him -- we should one, we should all be rooting for him to succeed and two, we should give him credit for the fact that he's trying something different. And the one thing he has done is he has basically said unlike -- the North Korean playbook and all these negotiations the way they played every previous president is they blow up some stuff that we know that they don't really need anymore and then we give them billions of dollars in aid.

The one that's going to be public tomorrow before the Oversight Committee, the Chairman has said you can't talk about Russia. As a matter of fact, he actually released a list of topics that he did want to talk about like the Stormy Daniels payoff and the Trump Foundation and possible Trump campaign finance violations and business practices and the Trump Hotel here in Washington.

Remember the Trump dossier he's mentioned by name 24 times in that, it would be interesting to ask him about some of that stuff, it's completely unsupported. The whole Trump Moscow, Trump tower Moscow deal he was a key player in that that.

Not -- it would not be unusual for, during the hearing for Republicans to question his credibility. He has not only pled guilty to lying to Congress.

There is nothing overtly religious inscribed anywhere on that cross but it stands in a big busy intersection in Maryland just outside of suburban D.C. here. And listen, a lot of folks there in the community say they have seen it for generations, it's been an honor for them to have it there but there has been an atheist group to come forward to say listen, it now sits on government land, it gets some government funding to upkeep the memorial and because it's in the shape of a cross, they don't care that it's a war memorial it doesn't work there and it's got to go. This case has raged for years. It lands at the Supreme Court tomorrow morning on Wednesday. We want to give you a little bit, folks, we talked to on both sides. One leading the group to tear it down and a veteran who says he's going to fight to save it. ROY SPECKHARDT, FILED ORIGINAL LAWSUIT IN 2014: Unfortunately, the cross can't be a symbol for all, it doesn't represent our veterans who served honorably who are Muslim, Buddhist, Jewish, and of course of no faith at all."

And of those names, an interesting point that a lot of folks have brought up is the fact that the service was very much still segregated at that point. There were black and white troops who fought overseas but they didn't serve together but the people who put together this memorial, those mothers in the American legion thought it was very important to list them all together. There's no segregation on this memorial. They just wanted to remember all of those 49 young men that they lost in their community. So, whether they get to do it with this memorial or whether the court says it's got to go, will know by late June. That's when they'll have a decision."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BREAM",
      "utterance": "Yes. And over the years, people have said this is a very muddled part of the jurisprudence of the Supreme Court because there's not a clear directive. They have decided cases on other public memorials and display but it's actually very hard to understand for a lot of folks. Even Justice Thomas has said it's anyone's guess what we would expect people to do. So, people really want to get a clarifying rule out of this. Justice Kavanaugh has been on the side of religious liberty issues in the past especially with respect to the HHS Obamacare contraceptive mandates for religious employers. We'll see how that translates here. But it sounds like even the court itself is ready to draw some lines so the people who put up these memorials or support them can have a real definition of what will qualify because some of the things these veterans are worried about are things like Arlington National Cemetery and other places where there are symbols that an opponent could argue are religious in nature."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HUME",
      "utterance": "Well, I think this ground is pretty far out of the mainstream, Martha. I mean, all of the polling that we've seen in recent times about pro-life versus pro-choice suggest that people are, you know, about split 50/50 on the matter. But when you start talking about abortions that are done late in a pregnancy, the numbers just plummet. There is very little support for that. And now, here we are talking about something that goes beyond that, we're talking about a child born alive as a result of an abortion and that fails and whether that child should receive the medical care necessary to keep it alive. And that is what this bill was about. It would require doctors to give the necessary requisite medical care to keep it born alive infants who survive an abortion going. And that's what the vote is about. And that's a pretty extreme position. And if you got, you know, these Democratic presidential contenders who are climbing out on that limb on that issue I think is very risky particularly when you put it together with all of these other, I think, it's fair to say extreme positions that someone in that party are now taking on everything from reparations as you discussed earlier to all of the elements of the green new deal, which are just remarkable how extreme they are."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HUME",
      "utterance": "Well, first of all, Martha, the most obvious point about that is, they were not talking about the woman's health here. We are talking about the health of an infant who is left in the mother's womb and is alive on the earth. And whether that -- whether that child should be entitled to the medical care that is required to keep it alive. Infants who survive abortion arrive, in many cases, and they are an extremist and they need medical help. And this is not about the mother's health. This is about an infant child's health in America. And for her to say that is strikingly dishonest and misleading. But you know, this is a movement. This is the choice movement. The abortion movement is about euphemism like that, women's health, reproductive health. This is not about reproduction, abortion, and this certainly are not about reproduction. They are about non-reproduction. And what we are talking about here, Martha is this. What the defend -- what the opponents of this measure are trying to protect is not really a woman's health. It's a woman's ability when an abortion has failed to achieve the same results by other means. That's what this is about."

Wade overturned that there is sort of, you know, a creep in that direction that's happening in the Supreme Court. And then you see all these states effort to, you know, to pass laws that will make sure that the state has the strongest possible laws allowing it. You know, do you think that ultimately, this issue because it is becoming so front and center once again in our society, that it becomes something that the Supreme Court has to deal with?"

And you know, my own thought about people who are in favor of abortion rights should be doing, is they should be willing to go along with restrictions on abortion that would bring the process within to the point where as it is practice, is approved by a majority of the public. By and large, we've had, you know, it's been close, but this kind of been a pro-choice country for a while. That may be changing and not in a way that the pro-abortion rights folks want.
