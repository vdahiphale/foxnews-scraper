      "sentences": "Tucker, great show. Thank you. Welcome to \"Hannity.\"  We begin tonight, a FOX News alert. We do have breaking news out of Arizona, a batch of newly-posted ballots from the liberal stronghold, the Pima County, are breaking for President Trump at a rate of almost 52 percent. That is huge news from a very liberal county.  Over the past 24 hours, the president has picked off -- we'll be on that -- over 24 other thousand votes. This margin, this trend continues. There's still almost 350,000 votes out there, outstanding, which many experts are predicting that the president will continue to do well, because a lot of those votes came in day of or the day before election. And the president has a good shot, according to observers, and people on the ground that I have been speaking to in Arizona to overtake that and win the state of Arizona.  Any call of Arizona was premature based on everybody that I've talked to that knows the numbers out there, which brings us to our top story night. As poll workers slowly continued to tabulate results, we have serious reports of irregularities and fraud and not allowing vote counters to observe, counting -- which is a matter of law. And they continue to come in, these reports from all over the country.  Now, in just moments, we're going to bring you live updates on the ground in Arizona, Nevada, Michigan, Pennsylvania. We'll also show you two bombshell videos from Project Veritas showing reported voter fraud at a frightening level.  And coming up, we'll hear from an eyewitness. We'll hear accounts from Americans who witnessed voter fraud firsthand.   But first, only moments ago, the president of the United States delivered an important message about what we're now witnessing in state after state, after state. Watch this.",

What have I been saying about big institution in this country? Failing we the people at levels I could never imagine. Same idiots, by the way, same networks, same people that lied to you for years about Russia, Russia collusion that never existed. They never told you the truth about the Russian disinformation dossier or the fact that that dirty Clinton bought and paid for Russian disinformation dossier was used to spy on the presidential candidate and then a president, or about Ukraine hiding as they did the entire campaign Biden family corruption, and quid and pro and quos, and big deals with China, and with Ukraine, and Russia.  They hid from you -- let's see, oh, the weak, frail and Joe Biden's obvious cognitive decline, acted like it didn't exist.  Now the mob and the media is only one powerful institution that has utterly failed. We, the American people, big tech, another one. Our educational system, another one. And I can keep going. We can no longer trust the vast majority of this country's pollsters who, yeah, once again, they got every thing wrong. And, by the way, now, the president, he described even the credibility of our election is in question, state after state.   Let's start in Pennsylvania where something strange and suspicious has been happening. In Philadelphia, election officials, they are biting tooth and nail to prevent poll watchers which the law allows from observing the ongoing vote count. Look at this summary of law, quote: Partisan voters may observe at polling locations and may still until the time that the counting of the votes is complete. Partisan observers are permitted to be present when absentee and mail-in ballot envelopes are open and when the ballots are counted and recorded. And post election, partisan observers may be present at the tabulation or canvassing of unofficial and official returns, and any recount or re-canvas.  That is the law. And it's in pretty much every state. It's that simple.  Now, the law is clearly being broken as we speak. In Philadelphia and other locations, you have officials blocking the Trump campaign from viewing the process as they have from the beginning. And according to a lawsuit now filed by the Trump campaign, quote: election officials are intentionally refusing to allow representatives and poll watchers for President Trump and the Republican Party. Listen to how one poll watcher described the scene. Take a look.",

Quote: the times, places, manners of holding elections for senators, representatives shall be prescribed in each state by the legislature thereof.   In other words, the state legislature, they decide election law and regulations, not local or city officials. And, by the way, it is illegal for them to block observers or strict location to 20 or 100 feet where you can observe. It is also illegal for the city of Philadelphia to disregard a court order, mandating that observers be allowed back in.  Does not invalidate the process considering they're violating the law? And what is the remedy? The only remedy I would see at that point, is they did it and they violated the law. Nobody can testify to the legitimacy of what they're counting was. What, a do-over in that state. By the way, something that has never been done in a presidential election.   By the way, I just got this breaking news as a relates to new ballots that have come out for Maricopa County. This is the Arizona result that I've been telling you about. The magic number of Maricopa, the president maintained 57 percent. Then the president would be well on his way to winning that state. Seventy-four thousand ballots have just come in for Maricopa, 57 percent for President Donald J. Trump, in keeping with the number that he would need to win the state of Arizona as that count keeps going. Keep in mind, today, when I started my radio show, 3:00 Eastern, the president was up by 108,000 in Pennsylvania. When I ended, it was down to around 70,000. Now it's down even further. During that four, or five, six-hour period now, Republican election observers were barred from doing their job and what the law allows. This is not the first time a poll watcher was blocked.   Take a look at this example actually caught on tape. Let your own eyes decide.",

Now, just this year, a Philadelphia judge of elections admitted that he took bribes to stuff the ballot box for Democratic candidates. The city's treasurer was fired after getting arrested by the feds for embezzling money. The city's former congressman was indicted on voter fraud and bribery. So, yeah, it's very important that Republican poll watchers observe the process as a matter of law in Philadelphia. That law has been broken and it is pure corruption that they are being blocked, especially since the state's top officials are openly and publicly hostile to President Trump. Now, before the election, October 31st to be exact, before any votes were counted, the state's attorney general was already predicting, quote, if all the votes are added up in PA, Trump is going to lose. That's why he's working overtime to subtract as many votes as possible from the process. Meanwhile, the Pennsylvania secretary of state tweeted using the title president before the word Trump really demeans the office of the presidency. Little bias there?   The state's lieutenant governor just referred to President Trump as, quote, just another internet troll during an interview with his friends on MSDNC, he all but guaranteed a Biden win.

Doesn't it then take away a huge legal right in the vote tabulation process? Because this ought to scare every American -- no checks, no balances, no authentication, no transparency, millions of mail in ballots, postmarked, no postmark, reports of dead people voting in states, and days and days of vote counting without observers, and tens of millions of ballots sent out. It'll be months before we ever sort out the legitimacy of where the ballots were sent, whether or not they're true or not, we weren't there to observe as a matter of law. This is the United States of America and that now, it is -- I can factually tell you tonight -- it will be impossible to ever know the true, fair, accurate election results. That's a fact.  And now we know why Democrats delayed needed aid dollars for American -- the American people and businesses on the first COVID relief package, this is the chaos they wanted and were fighting for and they got. Americans have every right to be suspicious. They have every right to distrust the legitimacy of the results. We have the greatest best technical minds in the world and we can't develop a voting system that we can have confidence and trust in, that that is a free and fair and honest election that prevents opportunity for fraud and corruption. And meanwhile, we can send people to the moon and back and fly you know rover to mars. Americans will never be able to believe in the integrity and legitimacy of these results an unmitigated disaster and frankly on the world stage, an embarrassment.

We do have breaking news out of Arizona, a batch of newly-posted ballots from the liberal stronghold, the Pima County, are breaking for President Trump at a rate of almost 52 percent. That is huge news from a very liberal county. Over the past 24 hours, the president has picked off -- we'll be on that -- over 24 other thousand votes. This margin, this trend continues. There's still almost 350,000 votes out there, outstanding, which many experts are predicting that the president will continue to do well, because a lot of those votes came in day of or the day before election. And the president has a good shot, according to observers, and people on the ground that I have been speaking to in Arizona to overtake that and win the state of Arizona. Any call of Arizona was premature based on everybody that I've talked to that knows the numbers out there, which brings us to our top story night. As poll workers slowly continued to tabulate results, we have serious reports of irregularities and fraud and not allowing vote counters to observe, counting -- which is a matter of law. And they continue to come in, these reports from all over the country. Now, in just moments, we're going to bring you live updates on the ground in Arizona, Nevada, Michigan, Pennsylvania. We'll also show you two bombshell videos from Project Veritas showing reported voter fraud at a frightening level. And coming up, we'll hear from an eyewitness. We'll hear accounts from Americans who witnessed voter fraud firsthand. But first, only moments ago, the president of the United States delivered an important message about what we're now witnessing in state after state, after state. Watch this."

We can no longer trust the vast majority of this country's pollsters who, yeah, once again, they got every thing wrong. And, by the way, now, the president, he described even the credibility of our election is in question, state after state.

Quote: the times, places, manners of holding elections for senators, representatives shall be prescribed in each state by the legislature thereof. In other words, the state legislature, they decide election law and regulations, not local or city officials. And, by the way, it is illegal for them to block observers or strict location to 20 or 100 feet where you can observe. It is also illegal for the city of Philadelphia to disregard a court order, mandating that observers be allowed back in. Does not invalidate the process considering they're violating the law? And what is the remedy? The only remedy I would see at that point, is they did it and they violated the law. Nobody can testify to the legitimacy of what they're counting was. What, a do-over in that state. By the way, something that has never been done in a presidential election. By the way, I just got this breaking news as a relates to new ballots that have come out for Maricopa County. This is the Arizona result that I've been telling you about. The magic number of Maricopa, the president maintained 57 percent. Then the president would be well on his way to winning that state. Seventy-four thousand ballots have just come in for Maricopa, 57 percent for President Donald J. Trump, in keeping with the number that he would need to win the state of Arizona as that count keeps going. Keep in mind, today, when I started my radio show, 3:00 Eastern, the president was up by 108,000 in Pennsylvania. When I ended, it was down to around 70,000. Now it's down even further. During that four, or five, six-hour period now, Republican election observers were barred from doing their job and what the law allows. This is not the first time a poll watcher was blocked.

Now, just this year, a Philadelphia judge of elections admitted that he took bribes to stuff the ballot box for Democratic candidates. The city's treasurer was fired after getting arrested by the feds for embezzling money. The city's former congressman was indicted on voter fraud and bribery. So, yeah, it's very important that Republican poll watchers observe the process as a matter of law in Philadelphia. That law has been broken and it is pure corruption that they are being blocked, especially since the state's top officials are openly and publicly hostile to President Trump. Now, before the election, October 31st to be exact, before any votes were counted, the state's attorney general was already predicting, quote, if all the votes are added up in PA, Trump is going to lose. That's why he's working overtime to subtract as many votes as possible from the process. Meanwhile, the Pennsylvania secretary of state tweeted using the title president before the word Trump really demeans the office of the presidency. Little bias there?

Doesn't it then take away a huge legal right in the vote tabulation process? Because this ought to scare every American -- no checks, no balances, no authentication, no transparency, millions of mail in ballots, postmarked, no postmark, reports of dead people voting in states, and days and days of vote counting without observers, and tens of millions of ballots sent out. It'll be months before we ever sort out the legitimacy of where the ballots were sent, whether or not they're true or not, we weren't there to observe as a matter of law. This is the United States of America and that now, it is -- I can factually tell you tonight -- it will be impossible to ever know the true, fair, accurate election results. That's a fact. And now we know why Democrats delayed needed aid dollars for American -- the American people and businesses on the first COVID relief package, this is the chaos they wanted and were fighting for and they got. Americans have every right to be suspicious. They have every right to distrust the legitimacy of the results. We have the greatest best technical minds in the world and we can't develop a voting system that we can have confidence and trust in, that that is a free and fair and honest election that prevents opportunity for fraud and corruption. And meanwhile, we can send people to the moon and back and fly you know rover to mars. Americans will never be able to believe in the integrity and legitimacy of these results an unmitigated disaster and frankly on the world stage, an embarrassment.

The sheriff in Philadelphia said, not only am I not coming down to enforce the order, but don't bother calling us back. Then the board of elections in the county said it will take us days to review the judge's order. They then turned around and took the case to the state Supreme Court in the state of Pennsylvania to try and get that judge's order stayed. So, individuals like me or you have no ability to go in and review the ballots which are being counted right now in the city of Philadelphia. They are behind armed guards. You have to go through magnetometers if you were to go there, and there's clearly an intimidation factor even once you get inside those doors with people wearing badges telling that -- telling our people, you have no right to videotape or take pictures."

There is no signature match. No true signature match for all this male and vowing voting. The fraud is unimaginable and already, just with public source data, our lawyers on the ground have found 3,000 people who are in this tally who don't even live in Nevada. That's obviously -- we made a criminal referral. We're going to see where that goes. But, Sean, I was 36 days in the Florida recount, there was a Democrat and a Republican that watched the counting of every single ballot. There are no Republicans in these rooms. Clark County is a Democrat-run Harry Reid machine. We wouldn't accept these election results from a banana republic.

Another 70,000 votes from Maricopa County have been released with President Trump grabbing 41,000 votes to Biden's 31,000. That's another gain of over 10,000 for the president, and that means Biden's lead in Arizona has shrunk to around 46,000, down from 68,000, down from 93,000 -- the only state were actually really seemingly doing it the right way. And it comes as the Trump team is continuing to project confidence that the president in fact will hold the state of Arizona. The analytics firm data Orbital has been crunching the numbers all day and night, laying out the president's path to victory in Arizona. Here to explain is the president of that company, George Khalaf is with us. George, you know, you've kind of said in the beginning, if the president maintained in Maricopa County 57 percent, he would come out on top.

You need to ask yourself. Do you truly believe this election is the best of what we, the U.S. are capable of? We have counted that -- you know, accounting here of everything being shrouded in secrecy, laws being just ignored, banning election observers, postmarks -- why are Democratic election officials against transparency? Frankly, it's causing a complete loss of confidence in the system among the American people. We were warning about this four months, the president was as well. This last minute change, mail out, tens of millions of ballots, lack of standards and safeguards to preserve the integrity of the ballot.

They're just ignoring the law, they're defying the law. And there's a reason they're doing that. There's a reason they're defying the law. The reason you don't want observers there is because you're doing something you don't want to be observed. And I am angry and I think the American people are angry because by throwing the observers out, by clouding the vote counting in a shroud of darkness, they are setting the stage to potentially steal an election not just from the president, but from the over 60 million people across this country who voted for him all across this country.

And we got it completed. And yet Philadelphia and yet Detroit and yet Las Vegas, they sit in a darkened room, in Detroit, they covered up the window so no one could look at them.

If someone goes in, say, to a bank and cuts off the security system and cuts off the cameras, is it because they just intended to deposit a check or is it because they intend to break the law? When these guys -- when these partisan operatives throw the observers out, the natural inference, which any court of law would take, the natural inference, if you don't want anyone seeing what you are doing, is that you intend to break the law, and the consequences here aren't just a Philadelphia City Council election, but it is the presidency of the United States.

Mr. Speaker, I have in my hands -- this is a copy of election observer laws. Let's see. Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, all of them have -- by the way, a lot of them mention partisan observers are permitted to be present when ballots are counted. But we get report after report that they are not being allowed to observe. Is that a violation of law? And how do you remedy that?"

      "utterance": "You know, I think, I've been active in this since 1958, that's 62 years. I am the angriest I have been in that entire six decades. You have a group of corrupt people who have absolute contempt for the American people, who believe that we are so spineless, so cowardly, so unwilling to stand up for ourselves that they can steal the presidency. And we will wring our hands, bring in a few lawyers, and do nothing. My hope is that President Trump will lead the millions of Americans who understand exactly what's going on. The Philadelphia machine is corrupt. The Nevada machine is corrupt. The machine in Detroit is corrupt. And they are trying to steal the presidency. And we should not allow them to do that. First of all, under federal law, we should lock up the people who are breaking the law. You stop somebody from being an observer, you just broke federal law. Do you hide and put up papers of nobody can see what you are doing? You just broke federal law. You bring in ballots that aren't real? You just broke federal law. I am sick and tired of corrupt left-wing Democrats who believe that we are too timid and too easy to intimidate, and therefore let's just go out and steal it. Now, that's exactly, no one should have any doubt, you are watching an effort to steal the presidency of the United States. And this is not about Donald Trump. This is about the American people. The American people have the right in an honest election, with honest legitimate ballots to pick their leader or are we now just sheep to be dominated by the high-tech businesses, the news media, and the various political machines that we are supposed to surrender? So, I think this is one of the great -- this is a crisis in the American system comparable to Washington on Christmas Eve or comparable to Lincoln and Gettysburg. This is a genuine deep crisis of our survival."

That's a signal. The president should simply calmly announce that anyone who is caught attempting to steal votes or attempting to block people from making sure it's honest --"

By the way, the great one Mark Levin will weigh in on what the role of state legislators should be, because ultimately, they decide the electors. If they believe the process has been corrupted, if laws have been violated, they should weigh in. Also, I'd like to know what the U.S. Supreme Court thinks about laws being violated and when they get testimony from eyewitnesses one after another after another, that say that they were denied illegal access to observe, what they will say about it. Fascinating days ahead. Chilling times. More \"Hannity\" after this."

You can prove that they were not allowed to observe the vote, that means the law would be violated. How do you legitimize that? Every American, regardless of party, should be concerned. Let your heart not be troubled -- Laura Ingraham, my heart is a little troubled when the law says even partisans have a right to watch the vote count, and the partisans are not -- denied the opportunity as a matter of law to observe the vote count.
