Dr. Joe Biden, not sure what medical school he went to, won't take no for an answer. Now, it's your -- it's your body, it's his choice, with an unconstitutional, illegal, unethical, federal vaccine mandate that, by the way, he said he would never support, one that Jen Psaki told us that it is not the role the federal government to do, one that Nancy Pelosi said they don't have the authority to do it, and Kamala Harris was the one that said, it's your body, you get to make the choice.  And to make matters worse, this has nothing to do with your health or safety. Instead, this is a cold, it is a calculated, it is a political ploy. Biden's presidency has been a complete disaster in every single way.  Think of one thing, can you name one thing that he's done that you could point to that you think is a success? He abandoned Americans behind enemy lines, can't even tell us how many he abandoned. Darrell ISIS says around 500. Thirteen American heroes are now dead because of Joe's Afghan disaster. When he had control of Kabul, he could have gotten every American out safely. Every Afghan ally out safely, all our equipment out safely. His poll numbers are in the basement. He's desperate to galvanize support around a shared common enemy. That enemy is some Americans that don't buy into his one size fits all unscientific medicine.  Think about this one -- one size fits all. No medical exemptions, let's start there. How is that following science? It's not, especially those who refuse to follow his vaccine rules and mandates, including Republican governors by the way who won't act like many dictators who actually believe strongly in a principle that Joe gives lip service to and it's called liberty and freedom and choice. Joe says it's not about freedom. It's not about choice. It is about freedom. It is about your choice. It is about your unique medical history, and your current medical condition and what your doctor thinks. Not a phony doctor or TV guys that think the doctor or play doctor on TV.  Americans that value their medical privacy, Americans that value doctor- patient confidentiality and anyone else who believes in personal freedom, Joe Biden's heartfelt unity pledge -- oh, that lasted all but seven months.   Now, it's us versus them, and Dr. Joe's patience is wearing thin. He wants to lecture you and scold you for not listening.",

It doesn't matter if you had COVID and you have T-cell immunity from a prior infection. Cleveland Clinic says the science is pretty clear on that so far. It doesn't matter if you prefer to keep your medical decisions private. The frail, the weak, the mentally incompetent impaired president, Dr. Joe, knows best. And, of course, the mandate is deeply unconstitutional on top of all of this. At least 10 governors are now planning legal action, including Governor Noem, Governor Abbott, Governor DeSantis.   And shadow president, Chief of Staff Ron Klain, he's now apparently congratulating himself calling the new mandate the ultimate workaround for a federal vaccine requirement but anyone with a functioning brain knows that the mandate is in serious legal jeopardy.

And obviously, the COVID problem that's happening when you then siphon all these undocumented immigrants that have COVID-19 in different communities across the country.  For whatever reason, that's not particularly an issue with this administration. But this decision, you know, it's crazy as far as what we're talking about with Kamala Harris for example who I just bought up, because she just did a speech a couple days ago. And she was talking about your body, your choice and that argument. And she said, quote: when people are able to make choices without government interference for themselves in terms of their well-being and the well-being of their family, we are a stronger society. Ah, okay, she wasn't talking about vaccines though. She was talking about abortions. So news outlets should press the White House on this contradiction, but it sounds to the lambs at this point. And it's pointless anyway because you'll find the knife that OJ used before you'll find Kamala Harris holding a solo press conference. But I think, Sean, we have to look at an example that we're not talking about very often, and it involves ESPN reporter Allison Williams, and this is the other side of the story or one of these people aren't talking about. She says that she and her husband want to have a second baby and she says the most important role I have is as a mother. Throughout our family planning with our doctor as well as our fertility specialist, I've decided not to receive the COVID-19 vaccine at this time while my husband and I try to have a second child. This is a very deeply difficult decision. It's not something I take lightly. So, now, she won't be on the sidelines for ESPN tomorrow for the first time in 15 years during a college football Saturday, and I just want somebody to ask the president or Jen Psaki about this, because Disney has a mandated -- you have to get the COVID-19 vaccine. They talked about this in July. We're at that 60-day point that they said you have to get the vaccine. And now, she actually won't be working this weekend.

Look again at your screen. We showed you this video of women being beaten, why for having the unmitigated gall to freely demonstrate in Kabul. We've documented the massive human rights abuses against innocent men, women and children in Afghanistan. Those that are standing up for their rights after being abandoned by Joe Biden. And now on the 20th anniversary of 9/11, America, well, it may be once again facing a new terror threat and, of course, that would mean a new era of Islamic radical extremism. And the Taliban, they are doing even more to embarrass America on the world stage, reportedly now preparing to hold their so-called government inauguration day on that's right 9/11. And just look at the new ad from the Senate GOP. It's entitled \"20 Years Later, America Abandoned.\" Take a look.",

These guys have swallowed Marxism, Black Lives Matters, Saint George Floyd, they swallowed all of that BS, and so, now, we have two separate national anthems being played at NFL games. The players that stood for that black national anthem \"Lift Every Voice and Sing\", it's a fine song, it's appropriate for churches. But they don't know the lyrics to this song. They don't know the history to this song. It's a song that was made and constructed and it was in celebration of Abraham Lincoln in 1900.

Dr. Joe Biden, not sure what medical school he went to, won't take no for an answer. Now, it's your -- it's your body, it's his choice, with an unconstitutional, illegal, unethical, federal vaccine mandate that, by the way, he said he would never support, one that Jen Psaki told us that it is not the role the federal government to do, one that Nancy Pelosi said they don't have the authority to do it, and Kamala Harris was the one that said, it's your body, you get to make the choice. And to make matters worse, this has nothing to do with your health or safety. Instead, this is a cold, it is a calculated, it is a political ploy. Biden's presidency has been a complete disaster in every single way. Think of one thing, can you name one thing that he's done that you could point to that you think is a success? He abandoned Americans behind enemy lines, can't even tell us how many he abandoned. Darrell ISIS says around 500. Thirteen American heroes are now dead because of Joe's Afghan disaster. When he had control of Kabul, he could have gotten every American out safely. Every Afghan ally out safely, all our equipment out safely. His poll numbers are in the basement. He's desperate to galvanize support around a shared common enemy. That enemy is some Americans that don't buy into his one size fits all unscientific medicine. Think about this one -- one size fits all. No medical exemptions, let's start there. How is that following science? It's not, especially those who refuse to follow his vaccine rules and mandates, including Republican governors by the way who won't act like many dictators who actually believe strongly in a principle that Joe gives lip service to and it's called liberty and freedom and choice. Joe says it's not about freedom. It's not about choice. It is about freedom. It is about your choice. It is about your unique medical history, and your current medical condition and what your doctor thinks. Not a phony doctor or TV guys that think the doctor or play doctor on TV. Americans that value their medical privacy, Americans that value doctor- patient confidentiality and anyone else who believes in personal freedom, Joe Biden's heartfelt unity pledge -- oh, that lasted all but seven months.

Joe's following the science really and you want to lecture Americans and scold Americans and tell them how bad they are and how they should be hated and give license to attacks on people that have different views or medical conditions you might not even know about. But you better get the vaccine or Dr. Joe Biden is going to unleash the full force of the federal government against you and your loved ones and your employer, and you will be cancelled in society all together you'll be shut out of everything. Illegal aliens, by the way, I see that Mayorkas won't use that term anymore, starting today apparently or yesterday. They -- they get no mandates and free trips to the state, right? They get free trips no mandates, get to go to the state of their choice and they get free health care and free education you pay for that, all while totally exempt from this mandate. Take a look."

It doesn't matter if you had COVID and you have T-cell immunity from a prior infection. Cleveland Clinic says the science is pretty clear on that so far. It doesn't matter if you prefer to keep your medical decisions private. The frail, the weak, the mentally incompetent impaired president, Dr. Joe, knows best. And, of course, the mandate is deeply unconstitutional on top of all of this. At least 10 governors are now planning legal action, including Governor Noem, Governor Abbott, Governor DeSantis. And shadow president, Chief of Staff Ron Klain, he's now apparently congratulating himself calling the new mandate the ultimate workaround for a federal vaccine requirement but anyone with a functioning brain knows that the mandate is in serious legal jeopardy. Even fake news CNN attorneys recognize this. And that's why a few months ago, several top Democrats promised there would be no federal vaccine mandate because it's not the role of the federal government. Take a look how things change."

As you indicated, you said more than two million people will cross our southern border illegally. According to ICE, 80 percent of them are unvaccinated. In countries like Honduras, the vaccination rate is one percent. So the Biden administration is saying that if you have entered the country illegally, you have the option whether you want to get the vaccine or not, and yet he's going to mandate it for hard-working American taxpayers. And I think that just exposes the hypocrisy of Joe Biden that he cares more about Central America than Middle America.

And then people not tested dispersed all over the country. You want to talk about a super spreader event? That's it right there. Good job, Joe. And talk about delta variant -- great job, Joe.

And obviously, the COVID problem that's happening when you then siphon all these undocumented immigrants that have COVID-19 in different communities across the country. For whatever reason, that's not particularly an issue with this administration.

And it's pointless anyway because you'll find the knife that OJ used before you'll find Kamala Harris holding a solo press conference. But I think, Sean, we have to look at an example that we're not talking about very often, and it involves ESPN reporter Allison Williams, and this is the other side of the story or one of these people aren't talking about. She says that she and her husband want to have a second baby and she says the most important role I have is as a mother. Throughout our family planning with our doctor as well as our fertility specialist, I've decided not to receive the COVID-19 vaccine at this time while my husband and I try to have a second child. This is a very deeply difficult decision. It's not something I take lightly. So, now, she won't be on the sidelines for ESPN tomorrow for the first time in 15 years during a college football Saturday, and I just want somebody to ask the president or Jen Psaki about this, because Disney has a mandated -- you have to get the COVID-19 vaccine. They talked about this in July. We're at that 60-day point that they said you have to get the vaccine. And now, she actually won't be working this weekend.

A shared passion for a sport, shared passion for a team, I high-five strangers, touchdown, grand slam, whatever it happens to be, you get to meet new friends -- every time, I've ever been to a stadium, I meet somebody new and I enjoy meeting new people. And now, we're adding politics to this. It's a bad idea. Now what happens if other groups want their anthems played? Would it be fair to say, well, if we have one group, we have to do every group? Where does this end? JASON WHITLOCK, HOST OF \"FEARLESS WITH JASON WHITLOCK\": Sean, you're talking about the injection of politics. I look at it as an injection of cowardice. Cowardice from Roger Goodell, the commissioner of the NFL, one of his top assistants, Troy Vincent. These guys have swallowed Marxism, Black Lives Matters, Saint George Floyd, they swallowed all of that BS, and so, now, we have two separate national anthems being played at NFL games. The players that stood for that black national anthem \"Lift Every Voice and Sing\", it's a fine song, it's appropriate for churches. But they don't know the lyrics to this song. They don't know the history to this song. It's a song that was made and constructed and it was in celebration of Abraham Lincoln in 1900. And it's not -- it has become the so-called black national anthem, but even having a black national anthem violates every tenet that football and sports are supposed to be about. And it's about unity and coming together under one umbrella, under one goal, under one mission."

      "utterance": "We have the most unifying event of people celebrating a shared passion. Sports fans are passionate. They're passionate about their sport, their home team, and it unifies everybody and I -- and I'm looking at this and I'm saying, you know something, this -- we are the United States of America and being together in an arena, in a stadium, wherever it happens to be, you're meeting new people. You're high-fiving strangers. You know, we have a national anthem that we all want to work one nation under god. I want to get to the point where we judge people by the content of their character as Martin Luther King famously said. And I think in those moments when it's unifying, keep them unifying. You had politics, you start dividing people immediately."

      "utterance": "And it's intentional though, Sean. There's people, Black Lives Matter, the trained Marxists of Black Lives Matter, there are people that don't want us unified. China, the communist Chinese party, they don't want us unified. And so, they are bullying cowards like Roger Goodell and Troy Vincent into adopting divisive Marxist principles such as having a black national anthem at an event that used to be unifying. This is people -- this is men being cowards. No one has the testicular fortitude to stand up and tell the Marxists and the atheists and the people that want to divide this country and tear it down, go sit the F down. We're not allowing it here. If Pete Rozelle and the people that built the National Football League into the powerhouse that it is and they did it by aligning the sport with patriotism and traditional American values they're rolling over in their graves watching these cowards tear it down."

I want to play this timeline and the song Michael W. Smith wrote at the request of George W. Bush after entitled \"There She Stands\"."

To all the families, all the people who tomorrow will have a tough day, to the kids that grew up not knowing mom and dad, all those families, our love, our thoughts, our prayers are with all of you. And they were at war with us, the 9/11 Commission report said. We weren't at war with them and look where we are today. My heart is troubled. Our prayers are with you this weekend.
