The Mexican government is promising to help stem the tide of Central American migrants and house some asylum-seekers trying to get into the U.S. The president is unhappy with the coverage, tweeting that there has been much false reporting -- surprise -- by the fake and corrupt news media such as Comcast/NBC, NY Times, and Washington Post. And I thought that the coverage for the first day or so was pretty straightforward, Guy. Lead story today in The New York Times this morning is that the deal consists largely of actions that Mexico had already promised to take in prior discussions with the U.S. over the past several months, according to officials of both countries. The president is calling that another false report in the failing New York Times.  BENSON: So, I think this is probably a legit scoop that the Times has printed. The way it is being characterized by a lot of journalists on social media is that aha, as we always suspected, Trump really got nothing out of all of this bluster, and he threw the economy into uncertainty and chaos for nothing. I am not a fan of what he did vis-a-vis to tariffs. However, in the very New York Times piece, the people are pretending prove that he gained nothing. Here is paragraph ten. \"The Mexicans promise to deploy up to 6,000 National Guard troops.\" It was larger than their previous pledge. So they increased the resources. I flip all the way to paragraph 26 and 27, talking about in May, there were only a thousand Mexican National Guard troops, we are going up to 6,000, and the agreement states that the two countries will \"immediately expand the protection protocols across the entire southern border when it comes to asylum seekers.\" So there's more resources and escalated timeline.

Jeopardy told the New York Times before the show that aired Monday that Holzhauer will lose. And interviews with both him and Boettcher, Holzhauer said she played a perfect game. The Times agreed to embargo the story. But then, at 10:30 Eastern Time, that morning, Monday morning, a CBS station in Montgomery, Alabama, aired that Jeopardy episode. So it was sort of out. The Times decided to publish its exclusive half hour later, but to hide behind spoiler alerts, so as not to ruin the event for the millions of people who are waiting to watch that night. Still, I was amazed that this didn't leak. No one gave the press the Mueller report, since public interest -- well, was almost as high. And that's it for this edition of Media Buzz. I'm Howard Kurtz.

I'm Howard Kurtz and this is \"Media Buzz.\" Nancy Pelosi was meeting with top House Democrats when, according to a leak to Politico, she said to President Trump, \"I don't want to see him impeached, I want to see him in prison.\" That came up when Trump sat down with Fox's Laura Ingraham at the 75th anniversary of D-Day in Normandy and said this about Pelosi an hour before his speech."

But there is real anger among journalists and commentators. Not that Trump hits back, he does that all the time, but that he did so just before delivering his speech honoring the bravery of American soldiers at D-Day in 1944. Fair or unfair critique?"

      "speaker": "GUY BENSON, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR, POLITICAL EDITOR AT TOWNHALL, RADIO SHOW HOST",
      "utterance": "Mostly fair, I think, because you see him launching these very significant political attacks and landing these haymakers and behind him are literally the graves of American soldiers who were killed during the D- Day invasion. I think in terms of optics, that's something that he should have been more aware of. However, think about all the heavy breathing that was done in the media over the \"lock her up\" chants and think about the heavy breathing about oh, you're not supposed to -- when Republicans would critique President Obama when he was abroad. You're not supposed to do that. Politics stops at the waters' edge, all of that that was supposedly something that was a norm in our politics. Here is the speaker of the House saying she wants to see the president in jail while the president is abroad, and the idea that he should just sit down and take that, I think, is ridiculous. I think both sides are violating norms and one of those norms violations are one -- one end of that is getting far more coverage than the other."

The reason is when she has almost 60 members in her caucus that want to move forward with impeachment, she's really trying to tamp it down because impeachment is not going to be good for the Democrats for a variety of reasons. So what I think she's doing with the messaging and having the so-called leak is to show that she is in solidarity with her caucus on their opinion of the president while trying to distance herself from the tactic of impeachment."

Clarence, what the president's detractors in the media are suggesting is that when he spoke to Laura Ingraham and he told her that the interview was delaying the D-Day ceremonies, whether that turned out to be true is not clear, is that he's slamming Nancy Pelosi and Robert Mueller in that one minute, somehow he could not have been sincere in delivering the D-Day tribute roughly an hour later."

So, when he went after Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, couple of days before the president landed, I kind of actually written an op-ed piece in The Guardian. This sort of got sloshing. It's so un-British to be rolling out the red carpet for this guy. His divisive behavior flies in the face of the ideals America was founded on. And the president goes on Twitter, calls him a stone cold loser and was asked about it on Sky News."

I think he was rightfully upset by what the mayor said, and of course he is going to fire back. I mean the idea that we are all clutching at our pearls, oh, my gosh, Trump attacked the mayor of London, look at what was said about him, think about what we've learned from the last -- I don't know, five decades of Donald Trump's adult life --"

      "speaker": "PAGE",

He was asked about she had once said she would move to Canada if he was elected. He said, I didn't know she was that nasty. Then he denied it. This came up with Piers Morgan on ITV because obviously this was a very big story in Britain. Roll it."

      "speaker": "TRUMP",
      "utterance": "CNN and some of the other phonies, they went out and they took the tape and they even tried to, you know, disgorge it from that. So what happens is, they talked about nasty, but we were talking about nasty, she was nasty to me. And that's OK for her to be nasty. It is not good for me to be nasty to her and I wasn't."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "It was all this media handwringing. He's lying. He's gaslighting. He did say \"nasty.\" What he is explaining is he meant that she had been nasty. In his mind, that is not the same as saying she is a nasty person."

      "utterance": "And also this isn't the only time we've heard the term \"nasty\" even on your show today. He also said that in reference to Nancy Pelosi. So I think it is his favorite word of choice in relation to women specifically. So, once again, we could say that we don't Donald Trump to talk this way. He is going to do it, I'm not going to hold my breath, but this story didn't help him out. I think it is fair to cover it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Let's pull back and take the 30,000 foot views. So, the president carried out his duties pretty well, I would say, overall. I mean, he had dinner with the queen. He wore a white tie. He chattered with Prince Charles about climate change. He didn't use the wrong fork. He gave a pretty good D-Day address, even quoting to some of his critics. Yet the tone of the coverage was, well, he is exaggerating the size of his crowds or he's minimizing the size of the protests, and the spats and what critics in the media say are his screw ups and missteps."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BENSON",
      "utterance": "Well, I think many in the media as invested in his failure, so they are going to find narratives that further that failure in their minds and cover that and focus on it."

      "speaker": "BENSON",
      "utterance": "Of course he does sometimes. Of course he does sometimes. And that is part of my consistent critique of him for the balance of his entire presidency thus far and will be, I think, for the next year and a half. That being said, you have to look at the totality of the trip, which I think overall was absolutely a success. The fact that it was treated as such and covered as such by the foreign press, which is not exactly a group of Trump lovers, I think is very telling. And particularly the speech that he gave in Normandy was extraordinary. It was very, very well crafted and delivered speech that really rose to that moment that even Jim Acosta made that point. And to get Jim Acosta to say something nice about the president is, you know, I felt like I saw a pig fly by the window behind me."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "And even Joe Scarborough said it was the best speech of Trump's presidency and he is hardly a Trump booster (ph) these days. I wonder whether the Beltway press is sort of stuck in this traditional mindset which is you have a president and maybe this reflects our culture, who ping-pongs between high and low. He is sticking into Nancy Pelosi, he is talking about Meghan Markle, he is talking about Bette Midler, who also criticized him and he went back against her. And it was oh, my god, how can he do this when he is in London, when he is in France? And yet he is also carrying out the duties of commander in chief."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAGE",
      "utterance": "He didn't mention Rosie O'Donnell, by the way, so maybe things are changing. No, things are not changing. This is Donald Trump. Again, we do this from the beginning. The coverage has been like coverage always is. The professional news people covered both sides. They gave broadcast speeches, et cetera. Commentators commented. And the viewers picked and chose what they remember and what they don't. But Donald Trump did not just up with nasty on Nancy Pelosi. Nasty, vindictive, horrible, and the kind of person who is disgusting, a disgrace, I forgot that part, and that she doesn't negotiate. I mean, who walked out of the last negotiation in regard to infrastructure? It was Donald Trump. So, you know --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "That was also interestingly in response to comments Pelosi had made to her follow Democrats about a cover-up. So, she has a way of getting on his skin. He hits back. The headlines often say, Trump denounces Pelosi. Now, the president was given some equal time, has been tweeting, no shock there. Yesterday, Beverly, he tweeted, \"Watched MSNBC to see what the opposition says. Such lies. No wonder their ratings along with CNN are way down. The hatred Comcast has is amazing\" This morning, the president at it again, this is interesting, \"I know it is not at all presidential to hit back at the corrupt media, but if you don't hit back, people believe the fake news is true.\" That seems to be a little bit about to the criticism that he is often bashing the press even it steps on his message."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HALLBERG",
      "utterance": "And I think it is a valid criticism at times. So even going back to the D-Day speech, I am glad that there are more people who talk about it being a good speech. But a lot of the coverage is on things that he didn't even do that were incorrect. For example, they talked about he was the one who delayed the start of the ceremony. The reports, it was actually the French president, and also where he signed his name on a joint letter with his allies. So these are those minor instances that happened --"

      "speaker": "HALLBERG",
      "utterance": "Well, I don't think Donald Trump wants to be presidential. I looked at that speech as like, ah, if he would only do this all the time, and I think a lot of us think that. But this is his style. This s the way he is going to approach it. I actually think it would be better for people to not take his bait. I think it is when the others retaliate, that actually plays poorly on them."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "It is sort of interesting to the criticism they usually ignore. Let me get a break here. When we come back, the president is declaring victory in that tariff showdown with Mexico and his myth that the press is not going along. And later, Dana Perino will join us on navigating the media minefield on presidential trips abroad."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "President Trump announced a last minute immigration deal with Mexico late Friday ninght in exchange for dropping his threat to impose a five percent tariff on all Mexican goods. The Mexican government is promising to help stem the tide of Central American migrants and house some asylum-seekers trying to get into the U.S. The president is unhappy with the coverage, tweeting that there has been much false reporting -- surprise -- by the fake and corrupt news media such as Comcast/NBC, NY Times, and Washington Post."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "And I thought that the coverage for the first day or so was pretty straightforward, Guy. Lead story today in The New York Times this morning is that the deal consists largely of actions that Mexico had already promised to take in prior discussions with the U.S. over the past several months, according to officials of both countries. The president is calling that another false report in the failing New York Times.  BENSON",
      "utterance": "So, I think this is probably a legit scoop that the Times has printed. The way it is being characterized by a lot of journalists on social media is that aha, as we always suspected, Trump really got nothing out of all of this bluster, and he threw the economy into uncertainty and chaos for nothing. I am not a fan of what he did vis-a-vis to tariffs. However, in the very New York Times piece, the people are pretending prove that he gained nothing. Here is paragraph ten. \"The Mexicans promise to deploy up to 6,000 National Guard troops.\" It was larger than their previous pledge. So they increased the resources. I flip all the way to paragraph 26 and 27, talking about in May, there were only a thousand Mexican National Guard troops, we are going up to 6,000, and the agreement states that the two countries will \"immediately expand the protection protocols across the entire southern border when it comes to asylum seekers.\" So there's more resources and escalated timeline. These are actual concessions."

    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "The other line here, Clarence, a Washington Post columnist went on MSNBC and said Trump manufactured the crisis and then claimed victory. The New York Times has another piece, he is the hero of his own drama. CNN's Charlie Dent, more bluster than anything else. But even if all of that is true, shouldn't the press acknowledge that Donald Trump's confrontational negotiating style sometimes yields results?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAGE",
      "utterance": "We see Trump has successfully sent out two messages here. One is at the New York Times front page that there is really nothing new here, folks, things are going along as they should. Whereas Trump himself says, ah, fake news, they are lying about me again. But we are making our victories anyway. It goes out to his base. His base doesn't read The New York Times. Many of them whom I have talked to, really want to believe Trump when he speaks. And I know he exaggerates. He has got them on his side and he just has to reassure them. That is what he has done with Mexico talks. That is what much really happened here."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Right. Trump has done this before with Canada, with NATO. He tends to blow things up and then try to get a deal that he thinks is going to be better than the deal he would have gotten otherwise. Let me turn now, Beverly, to the whole question of Vietnam, because after Pete Buttigieg, an Afghan war veteran, criticized the president, said he was lying about his bone spurs, that was what he got from Vietnam, there were a lot of stories about this. And it came up with Piers Morgan on ITV who asked him, would you like to have served when you were eligible for Vietnam draft? What the president said was that it was a terrible war, very far away, nobody ever heard the country. By then, demonstrations are every day. It wasn't like fighting Nazi Germany. And when Piers pressed him about the firm (ph), he said, well, I wouldn't have minded serving at all, I would've been honored, I think I make up for it right now."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HALLBERG",
      "utterance": "Yeah. Part of the reason why he said he makes up for it is because of the spending to the military. I don't think that takes the place of somebody putting their life on the line to go fight. But I also think there is a double standard with the story because we've had plenty of presidents who haven't served."

Ahead, left- wing Democrats and the press are piling on Joe Biden -- we were just talking about him -- for not completely towing the line on abortion. But up next, President Trump (INAUDIBLE) for boycotting an American company. It has to do with CNN. And some striking findings on who you blame for fake news."

      "utterance": "Maybe the media have largely grown accustomed to President Trump slamming private companies but this is pretty remarkable. When the president landed in London this week, he was perturbed to having to watch CNN, which is on across Europe. So he tweeted that \"it is all negative and so much fake news, very bad for U.S.\" And then he added, \"Why doesn't owner AT&T do something?\" The telecommunication giant has overseen CNN since winning control of Time Warner, a corporate takeover that Trump opposed during the campaign and which his Justice Department tried and failed to block in the courts. But wait, there was more. \"I believe that if people stop using or subscribing to AT&T, they will be forced to make big changes at CNN, which is dying in the ratings anyway.\" That was the president of the United States urging a consumer boycott of a major American company because he doesn't like the coverage of the network. There is no other way to describe it. There was some pushback obviously at CNN."

      "utterance": "I often find CNN's coverage of Trump unfair, especially certain anchors and reporters in the shows, but that's not the point here. Maybe there would have been more of a reaction if people thought Trump was going to seriously push a boycott rather than just unleash a tweet or two. The market certainly shrugged it off. AT&T stock closed that day up more than one and a half percent. The big headline, at least according to (INAUDIBLE), is that more Americans are worried about fake news than terrorism. Wow! But the details from the PEW research project are equally fascinating. Sixty-eight percent of Americans surveyed say that made-up news or information is causing them to lose confidence in government. Majority, 57 percent, say political leaders and their staffs create a lot of made-up news. Almost as many points activist groups, all 36 percent, blame journalists. But here comes the partisan split, you know this is coming, 58 percent of Republicans say journalists create a lot of false news. That is nearly three times as high as the 20 percent of Democrats who agree with that. Ahead, is Joe Biden really in another plagiarism scandal or is that media hype?

Absolutely, a net-plus across the board. I think some of the foreign press for President Trump was actually quite good. Here in the states, it was a mixed bag. But even people who are typically critics of him said that the D-Day speech was one of his very best.

But if you were at the White House and you're looking at this amazing trip, you could be -- you could say to the President now, don't tweet because we won't have good coverage. He got good coverage and he also coverage of things that were happening back home, the tariff fight, of course. You had him talking about Robert Mueller and Bette Midler.

The biggest example where some of his critics are really almost apoplectic has to do with about an hour before he gave the D-Day speech. He did an interview with Laura Ingraham and he went after Robert Mueller. And he really went after Nancy Pelosi saying she was nasty, vindictive, a disgrace. But of course, he just leapt from the day before that the House Speaker privately with the Democrats said she would like to see him in prison. So do you have any problem with the setting in which the President punched back at Pelosi?"

But look, even when George W. Bush was overseas, we were dealing with a lot of big issues, and in particular, the war. So it does happen. It is something that I would probably try to resist against, if I were in the office, but I'm not. I'm here. And I get to comment about it instead."

I do think this though, that the President has been able use social media the way that John F. Kennedy used television, or that Roosevelt used the radio. It's just the next generation.

I know the polls show that number one than the general left-wing base has been to this point. And they're going to hurt their backs carrying so much water for him, because they're directing him to this now. But they also have to do the after action repair here. They're going to have to say well, what he believed for 40 some odd years, it turns out he didn't really believe that. But he's making the right move.

When you look at the polling in the general election, which is the conversation we've been having about Joe Biden, nearly 60 percent of Americans don't feel like our tax dollars should go toward funding abortion. Joe Biden was running in the electability category, right. He was running a general election race in the Democratic Primary, which is why he was taking this more middle-of-the-road positions, not Medicare For All but fixing Obamacare, revising Obama's climate change plan to make it more aggressive, but not the green new deal for instance. So what has happened here because of the liberal media, Rachel Maddow as we're saying here, and also an activist in the party as well as his former colleagues in the Senate and in the government is that it has pushed him into the regular Democratic Primary race and out of the general election."

      "utterance": "... Wall Street Journal columnist Peggy Noonan who said we should break up Facebook, writing she got so annoyed when Mark Zuckerberg invited her to join a group of conservatives to talk about bias. She finally wrote an email calling him an imperious twerp. And that I think kind of captures why a lot of people are angry at these folks."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LARSON",
      "utterance": "Yeah, they are because we are now at a point where what are we going -- are we going to legislate a company because of the fact that they're really successful or are we going to step back and say, all right, we have got to put rules in place here. And what's interesting is, you know, Facebook, 66 percent of Americans use Facebook. And that's just Facebook. We have to remember they also own Instagram."

    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LARSON",
      "utterance": "And WhatsApp, the messaging service."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LARSON",
      "utterance": "So, there is -- they've got a lot of access to a lot of eyeballs at this point."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Well put. And I think -- I don't see how you break up companies from the crime of being successful."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LARSON",
      "utterance": "Exactly."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "But these folks have made a lot of mistakes, a lot of this is self- inflicted wounds. But as you say, we all like the free services. Brett Larson, good to see you this Sunday."

      "utterance": "Howie, thanks for having me."

    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Still to come, how some of the media cooperated maybe even conspired to keep Jeopardy a secret when James Holzhauer was finally knocked off."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "It was high drama this past Sunday when seemingly unstoppable Jeopardy champion James Holzhauer finally lost just shy of making two and half million dollars, unseated by a librarian named Emma Boettcher. But that episode was actually taped back on March 12, which means plenty of media people had to keep the secret as America watched the remarkable run."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ALEX TREBEK, JEOPARDY HOST",
      "utterance": "Over to James now, he had 23,400. And his response was correct. His wager -- a modest one for the first time. If you came up with the correct response, you're going to be the new Jeopardy champion. Did you? You did. What is your wager? Oh, gosh, $20,000. What a pay day."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TREBEK",
      "utterance": "Forty six thousand eight hundred one."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "High-five. Holzhauer told the Action Network why he played such a modest bet on Final Jeopardy. There was tragedy involved. And the website had to keep it a secret. Jeopardy told the New York Times before the show that aired Monday that Holzhauer will lose. And interviews with both him and Boettcher, Holzhauer said she played a perfect game. The Times agreed to embargo the story. But then, at 10:30 Eastern Time, that morning, Monday morning, a CBS station in Montgomery, Alabama, aired that Jeopardy episode. So it was sort of out. The Times decided to publish its exclusive half hour later, but to hide behind spoiler alerts, so as not to ruin the event for the millions of people who are waiting to watch that night. Still, I was amazed that this didn't leak. No one gave the press the Mueller report, since public interest -- well, was almost as high. And that's it for this edition of Media Buzz. I'm Howard Kurtz.
