Congresswoman, senator, do you believe that we should tear down the existing wall since they're immoral, and since they obviously don't work? You would have the government reopened right now if we had a fair media in this country, because they would be asking these logical questions to Democrats and not protecting the Democratic position, and the intensity would be so strong on Nancy, she would have to come to the negotiating table. So far, I believe she's lost this argument. If you look at her getting grounded on the flight, if you look at the Puerto Rican P.R. disaster.  Trump is moderating his position. These logical arguments, they just can't argue with. All they say is, \"Oh, it's mean.\" So if you look at what he's offering, he's offering humanitarian assistance.

They peddle it out there. And we've gone from collusion to obstruction to subornation.  Next, it's going to be Trump fed, you know, some dog cat-food. I mean, nothing is off the table here.

Now, the question is we don't know that Trump did this. We don't know if it was Trump's aides. But according to Cohen, that's what's on the record.  And as you pointed out, BuzzFeed says they're standing by the story. I'm very curious about this because it's interesting to me that BuzzFeed gave Peter Carr, I think is Mueller's spokesman, word that they were going to publish this story. No response from Mueller's office. And then Mueller's office does something unusual, which is to repudiate the story.  I mean, to me, what they said was the story is wrong."

Everybody is calling all day long. And Mueller has told you you're saying nothing at all, ever. So BuzzFeed, in a way, I can imagine you get that phone call and you're like those guys again? Like, forget it. I'm not answering this. I've already told you we're not commenting on this. But then the story gets out ahead, and then you see that all the other reporters are saying, well, if that's true, and I think that the pressure from -- of that made them have to come out and say like, I don't know what they're talking about. It does not have to do with the special counsel's office. The question is does it have to do with the southern district of New York?"

But the -- now they're saying, well, now the real estate deal with Russia probably went all the way up to the election. It's like that's your bombshell now? So you're blaming Trump for precisely what you, the critics did too, which is not take him seriously and not expect to win. So he was just doing his job until he lost, but then he won."

And then by the time the corrections come out or the rest of the story comes out, they count on people being like, oh, I didn't trust that guy anyway. You still can't trust him. That's all you have to do.

I saw the story unfold, and trusting my own eyes, I saw obnoxious teens. My chaperone instinct kicked in. Meaning, if I'm critiquing libs all day, I should also police my own side as well. By the way, isn't that the big question here? Where were the chaperones? I always had them when I was in high school. I deserve them. Anyway, I said the kid should apologize but maybe it should be me for jumping the gun. However, I do know this, this story has changed once and it's going to change again which is why it's up to us and to me not to take the bait when we're bored or possibly drinking on a Saturday afternoon. I've said it before, always be skeptical, nobody knows where a story goes. That's great advice I gave. Next time I'll take it. All right, I have a question for you, Dana."

Don't stand there. Don't stare somebody down. You could say that. But what if the kids so far from what we know, what did they actually do?  There's no assault here.

But I was surprised to see how many people and I actually -- I have to commence some reporters.  There were some reports on other networks that jump to conclusions and walked it back and said, listen, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have done that. Because when you watch the whole video, it's so clear that these kids were being antagonized. How they responded, you could say, wasn't mature.

For example, my -- I'm pro-immigration. And I'm pro-refugee with extreme vetting. I don't see -- I think, you know, refugees make great citizens because they're grateful.

Greg brings up the point if you say you're for the wall, the Democrats have to say we're against the wall. Thus, every reporter should be asking that very question. Congresswoman, senator, do you believe that we should tear down the existing wall since they're immoral, and since they obviously don't work? You would have the government reopened right now if we had a fair media in this country, because they would be asking these logical questions to Democrats and not protecting the Democratic position, and the intensity would be so strong on Nancy, she would have to come to the negotiating table. So far, I believe she's lost this argument. If you look at her getting grounded on the flight, if you look at the Puerto Rican P.R. disaster.  Trump is moderating his position. These logical arguments, they just can't argue with. All they say is, \"Oh, it's mean.\" So if you look at what he's offering, he's offering humanitarian assistance. He's offering changes to the asylum. He says only 280 additional walls to be needed and to be built. And what are they saying? No? And millions of people are still not getting paid?

I thought Mitch McConnell, the Republicans in the Senate joined in saying let's keep the government open.  Let's keep people getting paid. Let's keep our economy growing, and then let's negotiate.\" Initially, what the president say? \"Hmm.\" And then he said no because the pressure from the right-wing talk show hosts. Or maybe the media, if they were fair would say, \"Mr. President, you had a Republican majority for two years in the House and the Senate. Didn't seem to be a priority, did it?\" But here's the thing. He now goes after Nancy Pelosi's as radical.  Radical? What's radical here is the president has a weak negotiating hand, and I think it's starting to show. I think people were disappointed with what came Saturday.

Is everybody in the Democratic field going to be very hard left? Is there going to be no moderate? Because all these people were moderates, including Cory Booker.
