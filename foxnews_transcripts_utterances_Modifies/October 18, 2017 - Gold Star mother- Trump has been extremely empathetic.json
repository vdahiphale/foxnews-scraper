      "sentences": "And welcome to \"Hannity.\" And this is a Fox News alert. And we are covering three major breaking news stories tonight. We have breaking news that we will share throughout the hour. Democrats, the media are proving they will attack this president over anything. They are now racing to politicize the death of an American servicemen that was killed in action. And also tonight, the massive real Russia collusion story, it is expanding minute by minute. The Hill's John Solomon out with an explosive report today.  A lawyer for the FBI informant who says, Russian officials funneled money to the Clinton Foundation, is saying her client was silenced by the Obama Justice Department. They knew all along. The lawyer along with John Solomon, Sara Carter will all join us tonight.  Also, finally tonight, the Senate Judiciary Committee, they are opening an investigation into the kickbacks, the racketeering, the bribery, the money laundering, the extortion that we told you about last night, all to secure the Uranium One deal. We will cover all the details in tonight's breaking news opening monologue.  Now tonight, for the hour, we will give you news and information no one else in this media -- the liberal media -- dares to cover, and it involves your national security. The evidence is now becoming more clear every single day. Now, we are going to get to all of this in just a minute. But first, in one of the most despicable, disgusting displays of politicizing a tragedy that we have ever seen, is now happening. Now, we recently have watched these Democrats -- they politicize every tragedy, whether it's the biggest shooting or the hurricane damage in Florida, Texas, Puerto Rico. Democrats, their allies in the left-wing liberal mainstream media, they have now sunk to a disturbing new low proving that in their eyes, our president, President Trump, can do nothing right.  Now the Left in this country are now using the death of Sergeant La David Johnson, who was killed earlier this month in Niger, to attack the president. And to do so, the media is using like the number one Trump hater in the country, Congresswoman Frederica Wilson, you know, after President Trump called Sergeant Johnson's widow yesterday to do the right thing, offer his condolences. Well, Congresswoman Wilson, who claims to have heard the conversation said that President Trump told the widow that her husband, quote, \"knew what he signed up for.\" And apparently there was more to this sentence. The president reportedly also said, he knew what he signed up for but when it happens, it really hurts. It still hurts. The media is leaving that part out in most instances.  Now Congresswoman Wilson also went to CNN, of course, fake news, to continue to trash the president -- they gave everybody that wants to trash the president a form over there -- for calling the widow and the president offering his condolences. Watch this.",

      "sentences": "Now, Congresswoman Wilson's attacks against the president are not a surprise. She's been vicious from day one against President Trump, going after him for months. We will have more on that in a minute -- which the media won't tell you. But first, let's assume for a second, let's assume that may be the president was slightly inarticulate and his offering of condolences to the sergeant's widow. Let's assume for just a second. Isn't what the president saying here, that anybody who signs up for the military, they know the danger, they are courageous, they are heroes. Every brave American who signs up to defend their country does so knowing those dangers, knowing they may end up making the ultimate sacrifice?  Isn't that why we honor military members? Because they put their lives on the line for us every single day in America? And they don't ask for a whole lot in return? Isn't that part of the equation?  Sergeant Johnson, to his family, our thoughts and prayers are with you. He's a hero. Everybody in this country should honor him for his service. And by the way, you have to be a really sick, twisted, ugly person that puts politics first -- which most of the media today -- to think that the president got up out of bed, purposely got on the phone and wanted to hurt this family after what happened to them. That's what you would have to believe to believe this story.  Look, I don't really think the president got on the phone to hurt this slain soldier's family. He was being thoughtful, he was trying to comfort them. And by the way, the White House has witnesses, they say the context to the phone call is what is important. By the way -- and the congresswoman, what she said? Well, it is only part of what the president said.   Now, there's also a big question that we all need answered in all of this. Is Congresswoman Wilson trying to exploit a tragedy here and by the way, use the tragedy as an opportunity to attack the president? Because it appears she is. She has hated the president from day one. No one else is telling you that in the media. This is not the first time the Congresswoman has attacked the president personally. Back in May, she was already predicting President Trump's impeachment saying, quote, \"He doesn't realize that he is on the brink of impeachment and people will begin to call for him to be impeached and the Republicans will have to join in because they need to be on the right side of history.\" And in August, Wilson proved she was no fan of President Trump. She tweeted, quote, well, \"If you support racist, you are racist, @realDonaldTrump supports racist because he is a racist.\" That is what she says about our president.  In June, she tweeted. \"If @realDonaldTrump was a student at a school I served as a principal and behave so cruelly, he would be expelled.\"  Back in March, she was pushing the rush of collusion conspiracy theories. And finally in June, a reaction to James Comey's testimony, she put out a statement saying, quote, \"Well, Comey described is impeachment of justice 101. If all I heard is true and corroborated by his former colleagues in the investigation, I believe there is no question President Trump will be impeached.\" This is the woman that is leading this cause against the president who called a widow, in one of worst moments in her life, her sad -- the sad loss of her child. And of course, following right behind the congresswoman, we have all the sheep in the lapdog media, piling on the president, assuming the worst in President Trump, assuming that the Trump hating congresswoman is correct. They run of course only one side of the story. Watch this, as usual.",

Now, President Trump's chief-of- staff General Kelly -- when his own son was killed in Afghanistan in 2010, did you hear anything from any of those people in the media back then? I tend to doubt it. And there is also a 2010 report from a local Washington paper that says when a Gold Star parent called the White House to talk to President Obama, he was told Obama didn't typically make those kinds of calls. No wonder.  According to a new Politico poll, 46 percent of the American people think you in the media make up stories about the president. Do you know why they think it? Because it's true, you do. And of course, it's selective moral outrage once again.  Now, in a few minutes tonight, you're going to meet a Gold Star mom, Karen Vaughn. She begged President Obama to not bring cameras when her son was being brought home in a coffin. And President Obama did it anyway. So, I'm sick of everyone in the media, all their feigned outrage, all these lawmakers that hate President Trump and making their living off hating President Trump like Congresswoman Wilson.  I have a challenge for all of you overpaid spoiled brats in the media. OK, you care about the family? We should focus on the family. And guess what? I heard that this wife is pregnant. I'm going to personally donate -- I've already done it -- $14,000. You can donate $14,000 tax free. So, fake Jake Tapper, are you going to donate $14,000 and match it? Anderson Cooper, what about you? You make enough money. What about all of you liberals over at conspiracy TV? What about Rachel Maddow, Lawrence O'Donnell, are you going to pony up? How about Humpty Dumpty Stelter? So, I'm so sick and tired of all of you people exploiting tragedies, believing the worst and doing nothing to help these people. Put up the money.   Also tonight, our second breaking news story. The Hill's John Solomon has uncovered another massive Democratic scandal that is raising serious legal questions about the Obama administration and the Clintons. Now, here is a quick overview of what we now know as this is developing every hour.  According to John Solomon and Circa News' Sara Carter, in 2009, the FBI uncovered evidence showing that the Russia, Russia -- do you remember? Russia, Russia, Russia, Vladimir Putin? -- that their nuclear industry officials were engaging in bribery and kickbacks and money laundering and other criminal activities -- we knew about it -- in an effort to move and advance Vladimir Putin's influence on America's uranium market. Then inexplicably, knowing all of this, in 2010 while the bribery scheme was still going on, the Obama administration, they went on and approved the Uranium One deal. That gave Vladimir Putin, Russia, 20 percent of control of America's uranium, the foundational material to make nuclear weapons. There's also another major aspect of this story. The Hill and Circa are reporting that the FBI has evidence including an eyewitness account that Russia nuclear officials, quote, \"Routed millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation,\" while Hillary was serving as secretary of state and while she signed off on the Uranium One deal that gave 20 percent of our uranium to Vladimir.   Now tonight, the lawyer for the FBI informant, Victoria Toensing, she says the Obama administration blocked her client from informing Congress and the American people about what he saw happening. Victoria will join us in a few minutes with an exclusive interview. But first, here's what we don't know and why you should be outraged. This is what the media won't tell you. According to both reports, the Obama administration, they kept evidence of this Russian bribery plot secret from Congress, and by the way, it's unclear if members of the government committee, the people that approved the Uranium One deal from Vladimir, knew what Russia was doing when they actually signed off on the agreement. There is evidence that shows that may in fact be true. And the Senate Judiciary Committee has now announced that they are launching an investigation into what key Obama administration officials knew and what they knew when. And for good reason. There are several high-profile officials that were involved in all of this. Here they are.   Former Attorney General Eric Holder, he was a member of the committee that approved Uranium One. He had to know all of this. And he also headed to the Department of Justice, they oversee the FBI. Now to me, there's no way he did not know about this Russian nuclear plot and he needs to testify under oath, what he knew, when he knew it. Did he withhold vital national security information?  Then there is this now Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, and he is now deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe. Two other people, watch their names. They were the only ones who oversaw the FBI's investigation into this Russian bribery, so there's no way that they weren't aware of what was happening. So tonight, the burning question is, why were they silent? Why didn't they sound the alarm about Russia while uranium was being approved, this deal, to give to Putin?  And by the way, next on the list, Special Counsel Robert Mueller, he was the FBI director back in 2009 when all of those probe was going on, the bribery probe. You know, given what we now know, Mueller should not be in charge of any investigation as it relates to Russia or Russian collusion or election interference because he has yet another massive conflict of interest. But since it appears that Mueller will be sticking around, maybe he should focus on the actual evidence of real Russian collusion. Everything is here, all the evidence. All that Mueller and his team needs to do is corroborate the facts. Now today, in an effort to be fair, to get the answers, we reached out to Eric Holder, to Robert Mueller, Andrew McCabe, Rod Rosenstein, Bill and Hillary Clinton, the Clinton Foundation. We asked all of them to comment about these explosive reports. The Department of Justice did respond about McCabe and Rosenstein, they stated, quote, \"Per long-standing department policy, we do not comment on the existence or course of investigations.\"  The Clinton Foundation, they get back to us. They are denying the story. And big surprise, we did not hear back from any others that we reached out to. Shocker.  Now, the Attorney General Jeff Sessions is also being asked about investigating this scandal. He was on Capitol Hill earlier today. He was pressed by Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa about the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. Watch this.",

      "utterance": "And welcome to \"Hannity.\" And this is a Fox News alert. And we are covering three major breaking news stories tonight. We have breaking news that we will share throughout the hour. Democrats, the media are proving they will attack this president over anything. They are now racing to politicize the death of an American servicemen that was killed in action. And also tonight, the massive real Russia collusion story, it is expanding minute by minute. The Hill's John Solomon out with an explosive report today. A lawyer for the FBI informant who says, Russian officials funneled money to the Clinton Foundation, is saying her client was silenced by the Obama Justice Department. They knew all along. The lawyer along with John Solomon, Sara Carter will all join us tonight. Also, finally tonight, the Senate Judiciary Committee, they are opening an investigation into the kickbacks, the racketeering, the bribery, the money laundering, the extortion that we told you about last night, all to secure the Uranium One deal. We will cover all the details in tonight's breaking news opening monologue. Now tonight, for the hour, we will give you news and information no one else in this media -- the liberal media -- dares to cover, and it involves your national security. The evidence is now becoming more clear every single day. Now, we are going to get to all of this in just a minute. But first, in one of the most despicable, disgusting displays of politicizing a tragedy that we have ever seen, is now happening. Now, we recently have watched these Democrats -- they politicize every tragedy, whether it's the biggest shooting or the hurricane damage in Florida, Texas, Puerto Rico. Democrats, their allies in the left-wing liberal mainstream media, they have now sunk to a disturbing new low proving that in their eyes, our president, President Trump, can do nothing right. Now the Left in this country are now using the death of Sergeant La David Johnson, who was killed earlier this month in Niger, to attack the president. And to do so, the media is using like the number one Trump hater in the country, Congresswoman Frederica Wilson, you know, after President Trump called Sergeant Johnson's widow yesterday to do the right thing, offer his condolences. Well, Congresswoman Wilson, who claims to have heard the conversation said that President Trump told the widow that her husband, quote, \"knew what he signed up for.\" And apparently there was more to this sentence. The president reportedly also said, he knew what he signed up for but when it happens, it really hurts. It still hurts. The media is leaving that part out in most instances. Now Congresswoman Wilson also went to CNN, of course, fake news, to continue to trash the president -- they gave everybody that wants to trash the president a form over there -- for calling the widow and the president offering his condolences. Watch this."

      "utterance": "I didn't hear the whole phone call but I did hear him say, \"I'm sure he knew what he was signing up for but it still hurts.\" I was livid when I heard that. To say that this young man stayed in school, did all the right things, went into the service -- became a sergeant so quickly that he signed up for his own death? That is so insensitive."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Now, Congresswoman Wilson's attacks against the president are not a surprise. She's been vicious from day one against President Trump, going after him for months. We will have more on that in a minute -- which the media won't tell you. But first, let's assume for a second, let's assume that may be the president was slightly inarticulate and his offering of condolences to the sergeant's widow. Let's assume for just a second. Isn't what the president saying here, that anybody who signs up for the military, they know the danger, they are courageous, they are heroes. Every brave American who signs up to defend their country does so knowing those dangers, knowing they may end up making the ultimate sacrifice? Isn't that why we honor military members? Because they put their lives on the line for us every single day in America? And they don't ask for a whole lot in return? Isn't that part of the equation? Sergeant Johnson, to his family, our thoughts and prayers are with you. He's a hero. Everybody in this country should honor him for his service. And by the way, you have to be a really sick, twisted, ugly person that puts politics first -- which most of the media today -- to think that the president got up out of bed, purposely got on the phone and wanted to hurt this family after what happened to them. That's what you would have to believe to believe this story. Look, I don't really think the president got on the phone to hurt this slain soldier's family. He was being thoughtful, he was trying to comfort them. And by the way, the White House has witnesses, they say the context to the phone call is what is important. By the way -- and the congresswoman, what she said? Well, it is only part of what the president said. Now, there's also a big question that we all need answered in all of this. Is Congresswoman Wilson trying to exploit a tragedy here and by the way, use the tragedy as an opportunity to attack the president? Because it appears she is. She has hated the president from day one. No one else is telling you that in the media. This is not the first time the Congresswoman has attacked the president personally. Back in May, she was already predicting President Trump's impeachment saying, quote, \"He doesn't realize that he is on the brink of impeachment and people will begin to call for him to be impeached and the Republicans will have to join in because they need to be on the right side of history.\" And in August, Wilson proved she was no fan of President Trump. She tweeted, quote, well, \"If you support racist, you are racist, @realDonaldTrump supports racist because he is a racist.\" That is what she says about our president. In June, she tweeted. \"If @realDonaldTrump was a student at a school I served as a principal and behave so cruelly, he would be expelled.\" Back in March, she was pushing the rush of collusion conspiracy theories. And finally in June, a reaction to James Comey's testimony, she put out a statement saying, quote, \"Well, Comey described is impeachment of justice 101. If all I heard is true and corroborated by his former colleagues in the investigation, I believe there is no question President Trump will be impeached.\" This is the woman that is leading this cause against the president who called a widow, in one of worst moments in her life, her sad -- the sad loss of her child. And of course, following right behind the congresswoman, we have all the sheep in the lapdog media, piling on the president, assuming the worst in President Trump, assuming that the Trump hating congresswoman is correct. They run of course only one side of the story. Watch this, as usual."

      "utterance": "Every one of them are phony hypocrites. Do you know why? Where was the media outrage when it was revealed that then-President Obama, he didn't even call one of his own generals. Now, President Trump's chief-of- staff General Kelly -- when his own son was killed in Afghanistan in 2010, did you hear anything from any of those people in the media back then? I tend to doubt it. And there is also a 2010 report from a local Washington paper that says when a Gold Star parent called the White House to talk to President Obama, he was told Obama didn't typically make those kinds of calls. No wonder. According to a new Politico poll, 46 percent of the American people think you in the media make up stories about the president. Do you know why they think it? Because it's true, you do. And of course, it's selective moral outrage once again. Now, in a few minutes tonight, you're going to meet a Gold Star mom, Karen Vaughn. She begged President Obama to not bring cameras when her son was being brought home in a coffin. And President Obama did it anyway. So, I'm sick of everyone in the media, all their feigned outrage, all these lawmakers that hate President Trump and making their living off hating President Trump like Congresswoman Wilson. I have a challenge for all of you overpaid spoiled brats in the media. OK, you care about the family? We should focus on the family. And guess what? I heard that this wife is pregnant. I'm going to personally donate -- I've already done it -- $14,000. You can donate $14,000 tax free. So, fake Jake Tapper, are you going to donate $14,000 and match it? Anderson Cooper, what about you? You make enough money. What about all of you liberals over at conspiracy TV? What about Rachel Maddow, Lawrence O'Donnell, are you going to pony up? How about Humpty Dumpty Stelter? So, I'm so sick and tired of all of you people exploiting tragedies, believing the worst and doing nothing to help these people. Put up the money. Also tonight, our second breaking news story. The Hill's John Solomon has uncovered another massive Democratic scandal that is raising serious legal questions about the Obama administration and the Clintons. Now, here is a quick overview of what we now know as this is developing every hour. According to John Solomon and Circa News' Sara Carter, in 2009, the FBI uncovered evidence showing that the Russia, Russia -- do you remember? Russia, Russia, Russia, Vladimir Putin? -- that their nuclear industry officials were engaging in bribery and kickbacks and money laundering and other criminal activities -- we knew about it -- in an effort to move and advance Vladimir Putin's influence on America's uranium market. Then inexplicably, knowing all of this, in 2010 while the bribery scheme was still going on, the Obama administration, they went on and approved the Uranium One deal. That gave Vladimir Putin, Russia, 20 percent of control of America's uranium, the foundational material to make nuclear weapons. There's also another major aspect of this story. The Hill and Circa are reporting that the FBI has evidence including an eyewitness account that Russia nuclear officials, quote, \"Routed millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation,\" while Hillary was serving as secretary of state and while she signed off on the Uranium One deal that gave 20 percent of our uranium to Vladimir. Now tonight, the lawyer for the FBI informant, Victoria Toensing, she says the Obama administration blocked her client from informing Congress and the American people about what he saw happening. Victoria will join us in a few minutes with an exclusive interview. But first, here's what we don't know and why you should be outraged. This is what the media won't tell you. According to both reports, the Obama administration, they kept evidence of this Russian bribery plot secret from Congress, and by the way, it's unclear if members of the government committee, the people that approved the Uranium One deal from Vladimir, knew what Russia was doing when they actually signed off on the agreement. There is evidence that shows that may in fact be true. And the Senate Judiciary Committee has now announced that they are launching an investigation into what key Obama administration officials knew and what they knew when. And for good reason. There are several high-profile officials that were involved in all of this. Here they are. Former Attorney General Eric Holder, he was a member of the committee that approved Uranium One. He had to know all of this. And he also headed to the Department of Justice, they oversee the FBI. Now to me, there's no way he did not know about this Russian nuclear plot and he needs to testify under oath, what he knew, when he knew it. Did he withhold vital national security information? Then there is this now Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, and he is now deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe. Two other people, watch their names. They were the only ones who oversaw the FBI's investigation into this Russian bribery, so there's no way that they weren't aware of what was happening. So tonight, the burning question is, why were they silent? Why didn't they sound the alarm about Russia while uranium was being approved, this deal, to give to Putin? And by the way, next on the list, Special Counsel Robert Mueller, he was the FBI director back in 2009 when all of those probe was going on, the bribery probe. You know, given what we now know, Mueller should not be in charge of any investigation as it relates to Russia or Russian collusion or election interference because he has yet another massive conflict of interest. But since it appears that Mueller will be sticking around, maybe he should focus on the actual evidence of real Russian collusion. Everything is here, all the evidence. All that Mueller and his team needs to do is corroborate the facts. Now today, in an effort to be fair, to get the answers, we reached out to Eric Holder, to Robert Mueller, Andrew McCabe, Rod Rosenstein, Bill and Hillary Clinton, the Clinton Foundation. We asked all of them to comment about these explosive reports. The Department of Justice did respond about McCabe and Rosenstein, they stated, quote, \"Per long-standing department policy, we do not comment on the existence or course of investigations.\" The Clinton Foundation, they get back to us. They are denying the story. And big surprise, we did not hear back from any others that we reached out to. Shocker. Now, the Attorney General Jeff Sessions is also being asked about investigating this scandal. He was on Capitol Hill earlier today. He was pressed by Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa about the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. Watch this."

    {
      "speaker": "SEN. CHUCK GRASSLEY, R-IOWA",
      "utterance": "I would like to remind you that Deputy Attorney Rosenstein directly supervised a criminal case when he was U.S. attorney in Maryland. I don't think it would be proper for him to supervise a review of his own conduct, do you?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JEFF SESSIONS, ATTORNEY GENERAL",
      "utterance": "It would be his decision. He is a man of integrity and ability. If he feels he has an inability to proceed with any of this investigation, it would be his responsibility to make that determination and should consult -- as I told you I would and as I have done -- with the senior ethics people at the department."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "I am sorry, this is shocking that the attorney general is refusing to flat out say Rod Rosenstein needs to recuse himself if the DOJ opens an investigation into this Russia bribery scandal. Sessions was also asked about having the FBI, having evidence that Russians kicked back money to the Clinton Foundation. He refused to comment on that publicly. Now, we've been saying this for months. If the attorney general believes in equal justice under the law, he needs to investigate the Clintons because there's overwhelming, incontrovertible criminal evidence against them. They should not get a free pass just because they have money, name, power, and influence. That's not how our system of justice is supposed to work. Joining us now, Gold Star mom Karen Vaughn. I've known you for many, many years. You're the mother of Aaron Vaughn. He was one of 30 servicemen. He died, he was part of Extortion 17. You met President Trump. You also, when your son's body was being brought back, you have a story to tell. Was President Trump empathetic to you? Did he show empathy for you?"

He sat with him as Gold Star families before the election and then he also invited our family to the White House, for a Gold Star family's dinner and ceremony. A ceremony that he plans to continue I understand, until he brings in a tremendous number of Gold Star families across this country. He is extraordinarily empathetic to the Gold Star family."

You and the families then asked President Obama -- he said he was welcome to come when the bodies were being received but you did have a request. The families had a request. What was it?"

And then unfortunately what happened was the next morning, we found out that he did have a photographer there with him that night and we didn't think too much about it. But the next morning, the picture of him saluting our son's caskets was plastered all over the media. The White House staff had released that photograph and had dishonored our, you know, our very simple request to just let this moment be private. Our sons died at 7,000 miles away from us and we just wanted to welcome their bodies home."

And then we learned in the case even his own general, when General Kelly lost his son -- I don't want to drag into the politics of this but you did meet President Trump. And then you hear that General Kelly wasn't called. And then you see one of the biggest Trump haters attacking the President on this very issue that touches your family so deeply. My question to you is, do you sense this is being politicized and your reaction to it?"

This is utter nonsense. When a person calls a family member whose loved one has just died overseas, it's an active honor. I did not agree with President Obama, his policies or anything else but I did respect the fact that he came to Dover to meet our families. So, you know, you just have to respect the extension of grace and mercy and love and respect that's given and to turn this into a political stamp for this congresswoman who seems to me to be desperate for attention, it's a gross undermining of the loss that has been suffered by this incredible family.

They never gave him a copy of it and when he went public in 2016, way after all of this case stuff was done, the Justice Department under Loretta Lynch called him and threatened him with his freedom if he violated the NDA. Now, I had never heard of an NDA that had a criminal penalty for violation but they will not show the copy of it. So, we decided to go to the members of Congress and the Senate, and I have breaking news for you, Sean. While I was in makeup, I got a letter from Chairman Grassley asking my client to give them information. Now, what this does is set up a constitutional issue because the executive branch cannot say to someone, \"Don't you give information to the legislature.\" So, it will be a very interesting thing to see how the Justice Department response."

This started out as a counterintelligence investigation and what happened was, you know, the United States had known that the Russians wanted to get by the disarmament process, they wanted to penetrate the American market so then they could have Russian dependency. So, people would be dependent on Russia and that's what they were doing all along. And this is how they did it. They reached out to people that they knew would help them move legislation through. Move the process through quickly. And apparently they found it. Especially here in the United States. And, you know, we don't want to jump the gun and we know this is ongoing and there's -- now investigating this.

So, the Russian company would pay a contract in the United States and the contract then would kick that money back to enrich Vladimir Putin's buddies back in Russia. That is been what is established in the court case. Where the money came from for the Clinton Foundation, we don't know except for what is in the public records. We know a bank interested in the deal gave Bill Clinton $500,000. We know other people interested of the deal donated millions of dollars over the years."

Jerry Jones got $300 million from taxpayers to build the stadium that he later sold for profit. They are taking a baseball bat to a very successful business model. The bottom line is this, Colin Kaepernick and his perception of police brutality. In 2015 according to The Washington Post, there were 250 black people that were killed by the police. 500 whites.

Without question, these athletes, these NFL players have the right to protest the issue addressed. To deal with the issues that the athletes have brought to the league. Now that we are dealing with the issues, I think you will see less athletes protesting because the NFL has taken the issues very seriously and brought the players to the table and started to address the issues. That is all they want. It was never about the flag or the anthem. It was bringing issues to the forefront of America and dealing with the issue.

But we did not cross the finish line. We crossed the starting line. Today some say we've become more divided as a country than ever. Divided over race, politics, and religion. Even our families are divided and they say it's only getting worse. But you and I know something that they don't. An awakening has begun."

I'm a bigger center than you and I don't go to church regularly. But I believe at all. There seems to be in this country a revival of faith. I won't mention all the crap I've been discussing about Hollywood, you don't need to be dragged into that, but you are creating an alternative. I think Americans that are conservative and Christian don't want to be a part of people that have contempt for them anymore."

      "speaker": "CAMERON",
      "utterance": "I think you are exactly right. That is what I find. The mix of the negative narrative that produces so much anxiety, division and hostility, I travel around teaching marriage and family conferences. At 250 cities over the last seven years. There's been a shift in the mentality of much of the culture. There is building that want to build into their faith, their god, and their family."
