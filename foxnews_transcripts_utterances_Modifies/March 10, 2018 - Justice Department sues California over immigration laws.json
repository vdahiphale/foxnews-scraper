So, it's like, okay, you are not really concerned about North Korea, you just want to be against whatever Donald Trump is doing, but I think if it happens, I would commend him for it.",

Because they felt that Murray's image would be traumatizing for the students. A picture of him. What a bunch of ass hats. For more on this, we go to one of the student's parents. You should be lucky to have him as a parent. Kat, you've been writing about this stuff for like 30 years. It's amazing.",

Meaning, appear ready to do the unthinkable to get enemies to think twice. It's my theory, sometimes it pays to be the psycho on the block, screaming at clouds and rubbing dog poo in your hair. Forever, we sat back and watched streets filled with bearded psychos, burning our flag and countries run by extremist nut bags, who go to them into a froth of fearful rage. But enough about Berkeley.

But this stormy story is not sticking with the people, just the media. Why? Because we know Donald and Donald knows Donald. Even he said he's no role model. Finding out Donald Trump slept with an adult film star is like finding out Mike Pence didn't. It's not going to blow your mind. And besides, a grown man that's attracted to porn stars?

I think he always takes these extreme scary points of view, lets people react, so it creates a lot of chaos, then thrives on it, and then he is driving back towards some place he actually wants to go using game theory.

The victims were Pathway Home Executive Director, Christine Loeber; Clinical Director, Jennifer Golick, and Jennifer Gonzales, a Clinical Psychologist. Gonzalez was seven months pregnant. She was married a year ago and was planning to celebrate her anniversary this weekend. The suspected gunman, Albert Wong was found dead along with the three hostages. It's unclear whether the former soldier targeted his victims or how he died. Friends say Wong had a hard time adjusting to life after returning from Afghanistan in 2013. There are reports that he was asked to leave the Pathway program which helps veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder. A woman who had been as legal guardian says he was calm and soft-spoken.

Here with me now is former Trump Campaign Advisor, Carter Page. Hey, Carter. My first question, every time I see you interviewed, you are always smiling. Why are you always smiling?"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAGE",
      "utterance": "It works."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "Do get a lot of fiber? You seem kind of relaxed all the time?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAGE",
      "utterance": "Absolutely, yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "Yes, because it doesn't seem -- like I always think, when I look at you, you don't seem like a spy to me, which means you could be an amazing spy, right? You're just so happy."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAGE",
      "utterance": "Well, actually Laura Ingraham picked up on a bit of it because she figured out where I was. Our campaign committee met with then candidate Trump one time. I was very, very far away. She figured out where."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "Where were you?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAGE",
      "utterance": "I can't say exactly, but I'll give you the hint that let's just say it's closer to North Korea than Washington where that meeting happened."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "Interesting."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAGE",
      "utterance": "And you can ask Laura about that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "I will. We are having lunch tomorrow."

      "utterance": "Okay, yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "Not really. Anyway, are you a spy?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAGE",
      "utterance": "Well, actually, so I'm the North Korea (inaudible)."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "That is not a no. Are you a spy?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAGE",
      "utterance": "Well, the North Koreans, they offered a much better deal. It was only $11 billion from the Russians. They had jacked up a little bit, so that's -- heading in that direction, actually."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "So, why are they after you?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAGE",
      "utterance": "I think it's because, just."
    },

      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "You're very James Bond."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAGE",
      "utterance": "Well, I think you know, I knew some of the people in the Clinton orbit and they -- I think they figured out I'd be a pretty easy-going guy in terms of throwing out all these crazy stories with some of their collaborators in and outside of government, so."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "You know what is interesting about this whole Trump phenomenon is that there are people like you, it was like two years ago, you were an obscure guy, you know, eating Cheerios in a bathtub, watching reruns of \"Friends\" until 6:00 in the morning."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAGE",
      "utterance": "How'd you know?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "Well, I have a camera. I have a camera in your -- I am actually the."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAGE",
      "utterance": "That's the FISA way."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "I am actually the Russian spy. But then, there's this political earthquake and everything has changed. And so, some basically, you were an obscure person who is now not a household name, but you're like somebody that shows up everywhere and probably, you probably have your own Wikipedia page now, so I haven't changed, has your life changed a lot?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAGE",
      "utterance": "Actually, that Wikipedia page showed up within hours of the fake news stories at the DNC and the Clinton campaign managed to plan, September 2016, so you're right, I was definitely a nobody before then, but."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "Now, you're a frightened somebody. Are you followed a lot -- like followed by mysterious people in overcoats? Perhaps Lou Dobbs? Lou Dobbs tends to follow people in overcoats. Very strange habit he has. But I mean, like you have to -- I am sure you have to move around a lot because."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAGE",
      "utterance": "Well, I think because of the domestic terror threats that I was offering from a long time. But that's the beauty of all these memos that are coming out. I think people are starting to realize what a complete joke this whole process has been. So, that's a perfect place to be discussing here on this show."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "Yes, I am very glad that you showed up here. And, as I ask the hard-hitting questions that nobody else does, like are you a spy? Nobody asked you that. By the way, where is your lawyer? Like your lawyer allows you just to go everywhere? He's having a nervous breakdown."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAGE",
      "utterance": "Actually, I have been studying the law. You know, I was never very interested in the law. I always followed it and was sort of."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "I don't know if that's a really good criteria for defending yourself."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAGE",
      "utterance": "Well, you know, with the Civil Rights abuses I suffered, they really became a great interest of mine. And actually, per that last panel -- or the last segment you had about First Amendment on college campuses, I actually -- I had been doing a bit of big research project on FISA abuse and the First Amendment and I was originally planning to do -- speak at a conference at Yale Law School. But you can imagine how that went over, so I ended up getting the axe."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAGE",
      "utterance": "Actually, it's the night of the White House Correspondents Dinner, and I had a couple of invites, so maybe you know."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "Are you going to go? I might see you there. I don't know. Who"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAGE",
      "utterance": "A few people."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "Interesting. Russians?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAGE",
      "utterance": "Definitely."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "Why do you spend so much time in Russia anyway? Those nesting dolls? Everybody loves those nesting dolls."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAGE",
      "utterance": "Yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "Are you selling like illegal nesting dolls? Is that what this is?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAGE",
      "utterance": "That's actually the only theory that hasn't been tried as of yet. They may need to look into that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "I think you've been trafficking illegal nesting dolls. I happen to collect nesting dolls. By the way, I have one more question. Inevitably, there is going to be a movie made about you. I had some ideas of who could play you in the movie. Samuel Jackson, I think would be good. I thought maybe Jennifer Lawrence because it's like why stick to gender, but of course I thought Paul Giamatti because he is everybody's character actor. Is there anybody you'd like to play you?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAGE",
      "utterance": "The only suggestion I had heard is Bruce Willis and I think it's just because of the haircut, which goes to your questions about the good looks."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "Yes, yes, I know. You're a natural. I was thinking more of the guy that plays James Bond. What's his name? Craig -- Daniel Craig. I almost said Roger Craig. The running back, from the 49'ers from 20 years ago. My mind is blown. Carter Page, always a pleasure to see you for the first time. I hope something bad does not happen to you. I hope that you safely get to your car and back to your hotel at 43rd Street and Fifth. I'm joking. That was to throw the sense of. That's it, it's the best western downtown. All right, I don't hold grudges, but if you leave now, I will never forgive you."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "All right, we don't have much time. Dr. Drew, pay attention, tell us about your new radio show with Lauren Sivan."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PINSKY",
      "utterance": "Lauren Sivan, nine to three, Monday through Friday, you can check it out over on KGO and KBC 790 in Los Angeles. You can get it at my website, doctor.com, listen to the podcast or at KBC.com."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "You take callers?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PINSKY",
      "utterance": "Yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "Excellent, because I have got some serious problems. All right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PINSKY",
      "utterance": "I was noticing."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "Yes, all right, thank you, doctor, Lauren Sivan, Carter Page, thanks to our studio audience. I'm Greg Gutfeld. I love you, America.
