It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is \"The Five.\" A big show for you tonight. More breaking news on the anthem controversy, the commissioner of the NFL facing the press today on his league position on how to settle the firestorm following a two day meeting with players and owners. You're going to hear from Roger Goodell ahead. But first, Attorney General Jeff Sessions back on the hot seat today in the senate, fielding questions on the firing of James Comey, the Trump campaign's contact with Russians, and more. He has the exchanges with Democrats on the judiciary committee, particularly Al Franken. You'll see that in a moment. But the attorney general started out defending President Trump's decision to oust his first FBI director, tying it to Comey's mishandling of Clinton email investigation.",

He said he thought he did the right thing and would do it again. We were concerned that he reaffirmed that he would do it again.

They're not going to be able to out-attorney general the attorney general. He was a member of the senate for a long time. He's -- attorney. So all of his answers were certainly practiced in a way, but also he was super careful. One of the things he kept doing when they were asking about Russia was he -- and also in that piece with Dianne Feinstein that we've just showed, is he was suggesting that there's executive privilege on conversations between him and the president. That is true. But executive privilege has not been invoked by the president on this. That's why you saw the senators getting frustrated and you didn't get a lot out of it.  The one thing I think that he does do in this hearing is he continues to do something that is actually quite brave for the executive branch to do, which is to say, for example on DACA, the dreamers, you know what, it was illegally done, so now we're asking congress to fix it. We're going to faithfully execute the law, but you guys have to pass the law. You can't just do this in the executive branch, it doesn't hold, so knock yourself out. And I thought that was useful.

For me, that was the highlight. The rest of the hearing it was Groundhog Day. This whole thing I think happen couple of months ago. I think they just did part two. The only other thing I came out of it basically was the Democrats still have no agenda. They're still obsessed with Russia. They're like 9/11 Truter's. Good luck running on that in 2018. It reaffirmed the fact that Comey hatched an escape plan for Hillary Clinton, and wrote an exonerating letter months before he even interviewed her. Then, when his boss, Lynch, had the secret meeting with slick Willie, he assert her authority, made the announcement, let Hillary escape. Then, said he'd do it all over again if you have the chance. Then when he got canned, he illegally leaked. So Comey didn't come out looking too good this time.  The only other thing that I think kind of leaked out of this hearing today, which was very, very interesting. The Obama-FBI knew that crooked Russians were funneling dirty money, and bribing American energy officials, and funneling money to the Clinton Foundation right before Hillary Clinton's state department approved this uranium deal. And she signed off on the deal. Holder signed off on the deal. Where the Justice Department under Obama had a smoking gun, sat on it, didn't do anything. You know who was leading the investigation of this crooked uranium deal? Comey and Mueller. So it all comes back full circle. And Senator Grassley asked about it, Sessions said, you know what, we're not going to comment on any ongoing investigation, which leads me to believe the Justice Department might actually be investigating dirty money flowing into the Clinton Foundation.",

He wants more action from Justice Department. To this day -- today, he's tweeting about it. But then you get a situation where Pat Leahy follows up on Franken. It's like, you know, tag team wrestling. And Leahy is like, have you met with Robert Mueller, the special counsel? And he says, well, maybe you should ask Mueller, not me. He says no, I'm asking you, buddy. I'm asking you.  To which point then, Senator Blumenthal of Connecticut gets involved, and finally we understand there's been no contact even with regard to setting up a meeting between Mueller and Sessions. So it's this kind of back-and- forth and fighting that then leads to a question from Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, who says is it possible that President Trump could issue preemptive pardons for people who are targeted by the special counsel? And he -- you know, Sessions is like, well, it's very broad authority under his pardon. But if that's where we're going, that's really curious.

I also think the Democrats missed a real opportunity to be able to put a different set of news with the attorney general on the front burner. One would have been marijuana laws and how he is deciding to prosecute those. And dealing with the states that have legalized marijuana and the federal government hasn't. There's a lot to be set there. And there's so much that could be asked about on criminal justice reform when there's bipartisan support in the house and senate.

Pharmaceutical companies, distribution companies, they met with the DEA over time to provide data on rogue doctors and pharmacies. The DEA, as far I've read up on it, didn't really want to work with them. People want to blame somebody for this because they're either running for office or they're running scared. What company wants their product to kill their consumers? Logically, they don't. It's the easiest bogeyman to go -- it absolves everybody from a practical solution. The practical solution with these drugs is the product is externally effective and it helps millions and millions of people just the way firearms help millions and millions of people. Just the way automobiles help millions and millions of people. Those three things incur a lot of debt, 60,000, 30,000, 40,000, that's a reality. So what you try to do is you try to figure out how do you solve that? You try to look at the people who are driving. You look at the people who are doing drugs. Which people are addicted to? Which people aren't? How they using it? You don't necessarily have to restrict the drug, but dilute it and then monitor it. That's what -- not been happen. The worst thing you can do is draconian measure, because the draconian measure -- I don't understand, the draconian measures are going to hurt people that need these drugs.

It's been only Trump who's got China attention on this. It's been only Trump who's drawn a red line that few doubt. And so as with ISIS, it's only Trump who has any hope of success here.

Imagine if Congress were involved in the fight against ISIS. They'd probably be in control of the entire Middle East. Well, I don't like the hypocrisy about the media. When Obama came out and said, \"You know what? We don't have a strategy, and they're JV.\" The media said, \"Oh, you know what? The rise of ISIS, that's Bush's fault.\" And then when he took a really weak approach to this air war and there was a stalemate, the media said, \"You know what? Great job, President Obama. We're not in a quagmire.\" Then he sends boots on the ground. The media is silent. So Trump come up, says he's going to wipe them off the face of the earth. The media calls him naive and a warmonger. Then Trump actually wipes them off the face of Iraq, and the media hasn't said anything.",

      "utterance": "Well, this was a general oversight hearing, so all the cabinet secretaries that served in the executive branch will eventually have to show up and go through the motions, really, because there's no answer really given. They're not going to be able to out-attorney general the attorney general. He was a member of the senate for a long time. He's -- attorney. So all of his answers were certainly practiced in a way, but also he was super careful. One of the things he kept doing when they were asking about Russia was he -- and also in that piece with Dianne Feinstein that we've just showed, is he was suggesting that there's executive privilege on conversations between him and the president. That is true. But executive privilege has not been invoked by the president on this. That's why you saw the senators getting frustrated and you didn't get a lot out of it. The one thing I think that he does do in this hearing is he continues to do something that is actually quite brave for the executive branch to do, which is to say, for example on DACA, the dreamers, you know what, it was illegally done, so now we're asking congress to fix it. We're going to faithfully execute the law, but you guys have to pass the law. You can't just do this in the executive branch, it doesn't hold, so knock yourself out. And I thought that was useful. And that happens over and over again, on health care as well."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Yes, I'm sure that President Trump is very pleased. I thought the best part of the hearing was when the senator accidentally spilled Dr. Pepper on Senator Ted Cruz. For me, that was the highlight. The rest of the hearing it was Groundhog Day. This whole thing I think happen couple of months ago. I think they just did part two. The only other thing I came out of it basically was the Democrats still have no agenda. They're still obsessed with Russia. They're like 9/11 Truter's. Good luck running on that in 2018. It reaffirmed the fact that Comey hatched an escape plan for Hillary Clinton, and wrote an exonerating letter months before he even interviewed her. Then, when his boss, Lynch, had the secret meeting with slick Willie, he assert her authority, made the announcement, let Hillary escape. Then, said he'd do it all over again if you have the chance. Then when he got canned, he illegally leaked. So Comey didn't come out looking too good this time. The only other thing that I think kind of leaked out of this hearing today, which was very, very interesting. The Obama-FBI knew that crooked Russians were funneling dirty money, and bribing American energy officials, and funneling money to the Clinton Foundation right before Hillary Clinton's state department approved this uranium deal. And she signed off on the deal. Holder signed off on the deal. Where the Justice Department under Obama had a smoking gun, sat on it, didn't do anything. You know who was leading the investigation of this crooked uranium deal? Comey and Mueller. So it all comes back full circle. And Senator Grassley asked about it, Sessions said, you know what, we're not going to comment on any ongoing investigation, which leads me to believe the Justice Department might actually be investigating dirty money flowing into the Clinton Foundation."

      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "So it was interesting because I think the heart and soul of it was that you have the senators treating the attorney general as if he is a target of interest in the Russia investigation. Of course, he's recused himself and angered President Trump who, by the way, continues to say where's the Justice Department in terms of looking into Comey, for example. He wants more action from Justice Department. To this day -- today, he's tweeting about it. But then you get a situation where Pat Leahy follows up on Franken. It's like, you know, tag team wrestling. And Leahy is like, have you met with Robert Mueller, the special counsel? And he says, well, maybe you should ask Mueller, not me. He says no, I'm asking you, buddy. I'm asking you. To which point then, Senator Blumenthal of Connecticut gets involved, and finally we understand there's been no contact even with regard to setting up a meeting between Mueller and Sessions. So it's this kind of back-and- forth and fighting that then leads to a question from Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, who says is it possible that President Trump could issue preemptive pardons for people who are targeted by the special counsel? And he -- you know, Sessions is like, well, it's very broad authority under his pardon. But if that's where we're going, that's really curious. I mean, Sessions is saying yes, possible, maybe he'll pardon everybody. I don't know."

And I don't think that will necessarily will happen today, but that is possible. I also think the Democrats missed a real opportunity to be able to put a different set of news with the attorney general on the front burner. One would have been marijuana laws and how he is deciding to prosecute those. And dealing with the states that have legalized marijuana and the federal government hasn't. There's a lot to be set there. And there's so much that could be asked about on criminal justice reform when there's bipartisan support in the house and senate. There isn't necessarily support by Attorney General Sessions, but there might be with President Trump, and they could have figured out a way to drive a wedge there.

He withdraws his name and now he wants to defend himself. There might be more to defend. I'm not exactly. I'm just commenting on the communications of it. The president is going to sign the national emergency for the opiate crisis next week. That's what he said. Or earlier this week. And I do think that there's something to be said for this question. Does the country need a drug czar in particular? A lot of people for a long time said actually that's a position that we don't need anymore because it can be handled by the Justice Department.

I'm always very suspicious of the whistle-blower aspect on \"60 Minutes\" because you always find out later that that whistle- blower isn't really a whistle-blower. Pharmaceutical companies, distribution companies, they met with the DEA over time to provide data on rogue doctors and pharmacies. The DEA, as far I've read up on it, didn't really want to work with them. People want to blame somebody for this because they're either running for office or they're running scared. What company wants their product to kill their consumers? Logically, they don't. It's the easiest bogeyman to go -- it absolves everybody from a practical solution. The practical solution with these drugs is the product is externally effective and it helps millions and millions of people just the way firearms help millions and millions of people. Just the way automobiles help millions and millions of people. Those three things incur a lot of debt, 60,000, 30,000, 40,000, that's a reality. So what you try to do is you try to figure out how do you solve that? You try to look at the people who are driving. You look at the people who are doing drugs. Which people are addicted to? Which people aren't? How they using it? You don't necessarily have to restrict the drug, but dilute it and then monitor it. That's what -- not been happen. The worst thing you can do is draconian measure, because the draconian measure -- I don't understand, the draconian measures are going to hurt people that need these drugs. And so we're going to sit there and have this stupid reaction. We lost the illegal drug war and now we're going to lose the legal drug war because we're freaking out about something that's going to help millions of people. I don't understand.

Now, let me just say, I am very curious about this story for a number of reasons. One is, if you're just looking at the surface, guess what? Marino got a $100,000 in donations from some of these PACS, or distributors, and the chain drugstores. His chief of staff becomes the chief lobbyist for the chain drugstores. Lot of complication. But today -- today, you'll listen to this. All of a sudden, you have Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, and Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, both sang this story is baloney. Baloney. They say that in fact what they're about is making sure that Americans -- and this fits in with what Greg was saying, have the ability to access drugs they need, especially experimental type drugs. But, I don't think there's any getting away from the damage being done by the opioid crisis at this moment, and I don't find it defensible to my mind."

But the bottom line is President Trump does deserve credit for his accomplishments in terms of really responding and listening to the military, listening to the people who are in the field, who are on the ground, and actually putting in play and in motion, giving them the ability to run their play, which is \"This is how we want to defeat them. This is what's needed. We need to return the rules of engagement to what they were before and we need be strategic in how we approach this.\" And not just use, you know, flowing rhetoric. Actually get it done. Do you recall, Greg, that people were criticizing President Trump and saying, \"Well, where's his plan? Where's the specifics? How's he going to get this done? He's saying he's going to crush them.\" But guess what? In fact, he has. So the actions, and instead of telegraphing exactly what you're going to do and putting it in place has proved to be much more beneficial and effective."

He ran on knocking the hell out of ISIS, so I don't mind if he thumps his chest a little bit. He can accomplish a lot when Congress is not involved. Imagine if Congress were involved in the fight against ISIS. They'd probably be in control of the entire Middle East. Well, I don't like the hypocrisy about the media. When Obama came out and said, \"You know what? We don't have a strategy, and they're JV.\" The media said, \"Oh, you know what? The rise of ISIS, that's Bush's fault.\" And then when he took a really weak approach to this air war and there was a stalemate, the media said, \"You know what? Great job, President Obama. We're not in a quagmire.\" Then he sends boots on the ground. The media is silent. So Trump come up, says he's going to wipe them off the face of the earth. The media calls him naive and a warmonger.

You know, he says you've got to focus on reality, not showboating. There's a great figure. Less than 13 percent of homicides in Chicago are cleared. That means those are the only ones that are solved. The other ones go unsolved. That's what you should be focusing on. That's what the players should be focusing on. Twenty-five percent of all homicides occur in Chicago, Detroit, Baltimore, Washington, D.C. Players should focus on that. That's predominantly minority. So you've got to think about this. This is all about symbolic gestures. It's not about anything in reality. It's not about head injuries. It's not about murder. It's not about corruption. It's not about steroids. It's about adults turning themselves into children and then worried about belonging or upsetting their peers. Identity politics, wherever it infects, it rots. And that's what you're seeing.

It's an Advair. I don't know if you can look at that. And I've been using it for, like, three days. You put -- press this thing like that, and then you put it to your mouth. But I've been doing it for three days and nothing's happening, and I realized that I've been not putting it over the mouth hole. I've been sucking in at the handle for the last three days. I was doing this, and I'm getting nothing. But I was supposed to do it over here. So for three days, I've been not taking my medicine, and I've been getting sicker and sicker because you can't do good instructions! You could have just pointed at this thing and said, \"Put your mouth there, you moron.\""
