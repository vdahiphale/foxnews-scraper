And it's very easy in the first couple of hours of these hurricanes after they pass a little bit to go oh well, you don't really see that much destruction. It's going to take days before people can get out and survey what's happening.  There's still a lot of areas that we can't get to. As we drove around just a little bit today, we saw entire marinas decimated. That means people's livelihoods taken away in addition to their homes, most likely, taken away.

The strongest winds were recorded about an hour away from here closer to Myrtle Beach near Conway, South Carolina.  Experts say wind gusts there hit about 63 miles per hour. But the story here, the story there across the state of South Carolina is not and has not been about the wind. Officials, federal and state officials, say their focus is in the rain - is the rainfall and potential flash flooding in South Carolina. There's a lot of concern about the development over the next couple days for river flooding. There's a basin, the Pee Dee River Basin. Water flows into that from North Carolina and South Carolina.   Officials here in South Carolina say across the state that that basin is one of their highest priorities over the next couple days. The Governor is telling everyone whether they're inland or in (ph) another part of the state to hunker down, stay put for the next two days because they say this storm is going to be slow and long.

Started there just off of Morehead City, which by the way is almost at 24 inches of rain, officially, which if it gets just over 24 that would be the wettest tropical system North Carolina has ever had. And I guarantee you they'll get far over that.  It has moved about a 145 miles is all in this time. We have some flooding going on. Obviously, you are seeing all of the flooding. But these are only river gauges where we are seeing either moderate or major flooding going on right now. Go to five days from now, Tucker, and take a look at this. We've got river gauges all over the place that are going to be probably at record levels and that's because of the rain that's about to come and the rain that is going to move it move off of the mountain areas and inland areas and just all piles up.  So, we have a very long event here. We probably have rain until Tuesday or Wednesday.

We don't know the year. He was in high school at the time. He's denied the allegations to the extent he's even heard them. Democrats passed this letter to the FBI for reasons they've never explained. The FBI said \"We're not investigating this.\"   And yet despite all of that the transparent attempt to wreck a man's life because he's in the way of their acquisition of power, some Democrats are saying this letter is enough that Kavanaugh ought to withdraw. Chris Hahn is an attorney, a radio host, a former aide to Senator Chuck Schumer and he joins us tonight. So let's get the facts of this first in line. Why would Senator Feinstein pass this on to the FBI, which is a federal law enforcement agency which would seem to have no jurisdiction in the State of Maryland 35 years ago? Why the FBI?",

The idea that if he calls Americans racist enough times they will obey, that's how he ran the country for eight years. This is not a policy argument he's making. It's a theological one. The question is, as a political matter, does it still work? What if people aren't intimidated by this anymore? What if Obama is no longer a credible moral voice? And by the way, why exactly would he be a credible moral voice? Democrats tried this very same approach in 2016. Vote for us or you're a bad person. How'd that work out for them? People resented it so much that they voted for a former casino owner so they wouldn't have to hear it anymore. Trump may have affairs with porn stars but at least he doesn't go on about how he's so much better than you. Democrats don't understand this. They'll never understand this because it will never occur to them that they're not better than you. Their belief in their own moral superiority is at the heart of why there are liberals in the first place.

A new report by the Center for Immigration Studies estimates that the current immigrant population in America, legal and illegal, now numbers about 44.5 million. That adds up to almost 14 percent of the entire country as the highest percentage since 1910. In other words, the highest percentage that any living American has ever seen. One in seven U.S. residents was born in a foreign country. Well polls show consistently that Americans are not for this. Most, when asked, want less immigration than we currently have. A century ago, the last time immigration levels were this high the public felt the same way. The public always feels that way in every country that has mass immigration at these levels. Since we had a strong democracy at the time the public got its wish. Immigration levels were slashed dramatically and they stayed low for about half a century. But America, unfortunately, isn't nearly the (ph) democracy it once was, so we can't count on the same thing happening this time. In fact, something very different is happening. Economic and cultural elites demand more and more immigration regardless of what the public says it wants. Just this week in Oregon, for one example, the CEO of Nike, Mark Parker, announced that his company is opposing a proposal to eliminate Oregon's sanctuary city law. If illegal immigrants don't have a right to settle in Oregon in total defiance of existing U.S. law, Parker says, the state will not be able to attract \"Diverse talent.\" Parker knows what's going on. He's a businessman. As long as you fight to drive down wages in the United States and sponsor athletes who protest the flag, the Left will give you a pass for running sweatshops overseas, which it does. The public wants its immigration laws enforced. It said so, clearly. They elected Donald Trump to do exactly that. But the stranglehold of our elites, a small percentage of our population, is so strong that the opposite has happened since Trump's election. America is closer to having open borders now than ever. Consider this. From October 2016 through September of 2017, more than 94,000 people were caught crossing the U.S.-Mexico border and claim to be part of a family unit coming from Guatemala, El Salvador or Honduras. Now, you'd think that illegally entering the United States would be an automatic ticket home and quickly but you'd be wrong. These people were not sent home. They were allowed to settle in the United States while their cases were resolved, which in practical terms means forever. Of those 94,000 illegal border crossers, only 1,500 have been sent back. In other words, 98 percent are still here. During the same period, 31,000 unaccompanied minors were detained at the border. And again, 98 percent of them are still here, which means that America effectively, no matter what they're telling you, has no borders. This is not a secret. Word has got out to the rest of the world and hundreds of thousands of people are taking advantage of this. This is a crisis. It's one created by years of deliberate neglect by those in power. Instead of acknowledging it though, the Left denies there is a crisis and then works to exacerbate the crisis. Virtually, everyone on the Left now opposes the Wall on the grounds that it would be too effective. Many oppose any sort of border enforcement too. The New York City Council just endorsed abolishing ICE on the grounds that too many people get deported when in fact, as you just heard, almost nobody gets deported. It's a lie. It makes you think maybe there's another agenda here, one has - that has nothing to do with what voters want. Enrique Acevedo is an anchor at Univision and a frequent guest on this show.

But we want to start with this storm. We've got a team of reporters spread across the Carolinas right in the middle of this storm. Deadly storm surge and flooding are major concerns right now.

Still now 24 hours since the really bad stuff started in Morehead City you can still at times lean against these gusts of winds, if nothing else just to demonstrate how long this storm is taking to move on. And it's really an expediential (ph) effect of damage between the amount of rain we are seeing, the amount of storm surge we're seeing and the duration of it that we are seeing. And it's very easy in the first couple of hours of these hurricanes after they pass a little bit to go oh well, you don't really see that much destruction. It's going to take days before people can get out and survey what's happening. There's still a lot of areas that we can't get to. As we drove around just a little bit today, we saw entire marinas decimated. That means people's livelihoods taken away in addition to their homes, most likely, taken away.

One - two of the four fatalities reported so far was a mother and her infant who were killed by a falling tree on their house. Well there are trees all over this town and this state that are coming down. You can probably see the - the branch right here. There's some next to us. It's very dark here. The power is still off, so it's difficult to show you but some of these trees that came down, not this one, but others that we've seen that are blocking the roads here, are at least 50 years old. There (ph). It's not safe to be out here. And we're not going to stay out here for very long because we fully expect more of these trees to come down. But this threat, Tucker, is true across the state. The grounds been saturated. They had record rainfall already this summer. And now, with all of this additional rain up to three inches an hour in some spots, it's going to create a lot of hazards for trees and powerlines to come down.

The man parked here, unfortunately, because he thought some of the trees were going to fall down and it fell right on his car. We're expecting at least a foot of rain in Charlotte over the next couple of days, which is something that many places - places in these areas have not seen before.

The wind, today, was strong enough to cause some serious damage to a lot of houses on the beach. We saw some roofs taken off and some other problems as well. The one thing that's been clear in this storm, the message has gotten out to the people of North Carolina. Almost all the homes we saw, even the damaged ones, boarded up no one inside and help is coming from around the country.

The strongest winds were recorded about an hour away from here closer to Myrtle Beach near Conway, South Carolina. Experts say wind gusts there hit about 63 miles per hour. But the story here, the story there across the state of South Carolina is not and has not been about the wind. Officials, federal and state officials, say their focus is in the rain - is the rainfall and potential flash flooding in South Carolina. There's a lot of concern about the development over the next couple days for river flooding. There's a basin, the Pee Dee River Basin. Water flows into that from North Carolina and South Carolina. Officials here in South Carolina say across the state that that basin is one of their highest priorities over the next couple days. The Governor is telling everyone whether they're inland or in (ph) another part of the state to hunker down, stay put for the next two days because they say this storm is going to be slow and long. They're saying it won't be like Hurricane Hugo. It won't come through here quickly.

Just want (ph) to show you this is the last 24 hours of the storm. Started there just off of Morehead City, which by the way is almost at 24 inches of rain, officially, which if it gets just over 24 that would be the wettest tropical system North Carolina has ever had. And I guarantee you they'll get far over that. It has moved about a 145 miles is all in this time. We have some flooding going on. Obviously, you are seeing all of the flooding. But these are only river gauges where we are seeing either moderate or major flooding going on right now. Go to five days from now, Tucker, and take a look at this. We've got river gauges all over the place that are going to be probably at record levels and that's because of the rain that's about to come and the rain that is going to move it move off of the mountain areas and inland areas and just all piles up. So, we have a very long event here. We probably have rain until Tuesday or Wednesday. And we are going to have those rivers at record levels, in some cases, maybe six to seven feet higher than records and that will stay at that level for probably five to six days."

They have produced or talked about the existence of a letter that no civilian has seen from a woman whose identity nobody knows that accuses Kavanaugh of unspecified sexual conduct apparently 35 years ago. We don't know the year. He was in high school at the time. He's denied the allegations to the extent he's even heard them. Democrats passed this letter to the FBI for reasons they've never explained. The FBI said \"We're not investigating this.\" And yet despite all of that the transparent attempt to wreck a man's life because he's in the way of their acquisition of power, some Democrats are saying this letter is enough that Kavanaugh ought to withdraw. Chris Hahn is an attorney, a radio host, a former aide to Senator Chuck Schumer and he joins us tonight. So let's get the facts of this first in line. Why would Senator Feinstein pass this on to the FBI, which is a federal law enforcement agency which would seem to have no jurisdiction in the State of Maryland 35 years ago? Why the FBI?"

Look, she got this letter a - a couple of weeks ago. The - the person who wrote the letter did not want to come forward, probably wanted to avoid the same fate Anita Hill faced when in 1991 during the Clarence Thomas hearings. And Dianne Feinstein decided not to make this an issue during the confirmation hearings. There have been many Democrats pushing on her since then to make this an issue and she has refused to do that. I think she's behaved responsibly. If the witness doesn't want to come forward it's hard for them to - to - to have this conversation. That said, I believe that all victims or - or people who claim to be victims of - of sexual abuse should be heard. And I know that Ronan Farrow has written about this in The New Yorker today and--"

The idea that if he calls Americans racist enough times they will obey, that's how he ran the country for eight years. This is not a policy argument he's making. It's a theological one. The question is, as a political matter, does it still work? What if people aren't intimidated by this anymore? What if Obama is no longer a credible moral voice? And by the way, why exactly would he be a credible moral voice? Democrats tried this very same approach in 2016. Vote for us or you're a bad person. How'd that work out for them? People resented it so much that they voted for a former casino owner so they wouldn't have to hear it anymore. Trump may have affairs with porn stars but at least he doesn't go on about how he's so much better than you. Democrats don't understand this. They'll never understand this because it will never occur to them that they're not better than you. Their belief in their own moral superiority is at the heart of why there are liberals in the first place.

A lot of structural damage here in North Carolina. And this is just the beginning as the storm continues to pummel the state and sit (ph) just above and moving at only three miles per hour. That death toll has now risen to five. And it's incredible the damage that such a small storm can create and you'll see throughout the state, no power here. Billboards just like this one as you drive along these major thoroughfares. Now, what's incredible is the infrastructure in counties like where we are here in Jacksonville, Onslow County, there's not a single building in this county that can withstand a Category 4 hurricane. And that is why they asked for those mandatory evacuations so early into the week so that people could get out because there was simply nowhere else to go and that was probably the best call because with that storm surge we saw water rise down by the beach up to 5 feet and a lot of those homes along the beach and the coastline they're taking a total beating.

    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Immigration levels of the United States continue to reach new highs. A new report by the Center for Immigration Studies estimates that the current immigrant population in America, legal and illegal, now numbers about 44.5 million. That adds up to almost 14 percent of the entire country as the highest percentage since 1910. In other words, the highest percentage that any living American has ever seen. One in seven U.S. residents was born in a foreign country. Well polls show consistently that Americans are not for this. Most, when asked, want less immigration than we currently have. A century ago, the last time immigration levels were this high the public felt the same way. The public always feels that way in every country that has mass immigration at these levels. Since we had a strong democracy at the time the public got its wish. Immigration levels were slashed dramatically and they stayed low for about half a century. But America, unfortunately, isn't nearly the (ph) democracy it once was, so we can't count on the same thing happening this time. In fact, something very different is happening. Economic and cultural elites demand more and more immigration regardless of what the public says it wants. Just this week in Oregon, for one example, the CEO of Nike, Mark Parker, announced that his company is opposing a proposal to eliminate Oregon's sanctuary city law. If illegal immigrants don't have a right to settle in Oregon in total defiance of existing U.S. law, Parker says, the state will not be able to attract \"Diverse talent.\" Parker knows what's going on. He's a businessman. As long as you fight to drive down wages in the United States and sponsor athletes who protest the flag, the Left will give you a pass for running sweatshops overseas, which it does. The public wants its immigration laws enforced. It said so, clearly. They elected Donald Trump to do exactly that. But the stranglehold of our elites, a small percentage of our population, is so strong that the opposite has happened since Trump's election. America is closer to having open borders now than ever. Consider this. From October 2016 through September of 2017, more than 94,000 people were caught crossing the U.S.-Mexico border and claim to be part of a family unit coming from Guatemala, El Salvador or Honduras. Now, you'd think that illegally entering the United States would be an automatic ticket home and quickly but you'd be wrong. These people were not sent home. They were allowed to settle in the United States while their cases were resolved, which in practical terms means forever. Of those 94,000 illegal border crossers, only 1,500 have been sent back. In other words, 98 percent are still here. During the same period, 31,000 unaccompanied minors were detained at the border. And again, 98 percent of them are still here, which means that America effectively, no matter what they're telling you, has no borders. This is not a secret. Word has got out to the rest of the world and hundreds of thousands of people are taking advantage of this. This is a crisis. It's one created by years of deliberate neglect by those in power. Instead of acknowledging it though, the Left denies there is a crisis and then works to exacerbate the crisis. Virtually, everyone on the Left now opposes the Wall on the grounds that it would be too effective. Many oppose any sort of border enforcement too. The New York City Council just endorsed abolishing ICE on the grounds that too many people get deported when in fact, as you just heard, almost nobody gets deported. It's a lie. It makes you think maybe there's another agenda here, one has - that has nothing to do with what voters want. Enrique Acevedo is an anchor at Univision and a frequent guest on this show. He joins us tonight. Enrique, thanks very much for coming on."

The big policies come from what people who live here want. And every poll of immigration shows Americans think the numbers are too high. But a small number of activists, like you, who apparently have all the power are saying \"We don't care what you want. This is what you're getting.\" That's not democracy, is it?

Certain elites may be insulated from some of the deleterious effects but those effects are profound. We've talked in the past about the increase in crime rates and they are increasing. At a time when the crime rates were falling the crime rates among illegal immigrants went up 44 percent. In addition to that, we've got the public FISC (ph). We've got the burden on the Treasury because of this. Infrastructure, educational institutions, hospitals and so on and so forth are burdened by it. But the most important aspect of it is the preservation of our sovereignty. If we don't have borders, if we don't have the ability to control who comes here, we're no longer a nation. And again, the rule of law is important. And we seem to take a Cavalier approach to the protection of the Constitutional order that we've - we've got constructed, which makes us unique in terms of history, in terms of our current statute within the - the world. And if we just let that go, simply don't care about our borders, don't care about the level of immigration so that it satisfies the needs and wants of elites and also of certain political imperatives so progressives can gather (ph) more people who eventually vote for them, we're going to suffer as a result."

The thing we're thinking about right now as it goes into the night is the power outages. Across the state, there are 780,000. And Duke Energy says there's a chance it might not come back on for weeks. We - this afternoon, one of the most extraordinary things we saw was when the Cape Fear River overflowed. It hit a new all-time record high of just over 8.2 feet and it's gone back down now. And as the winds pickup (ph) back up it's gone back down now. But there's still potential for flooding, Tucker."
