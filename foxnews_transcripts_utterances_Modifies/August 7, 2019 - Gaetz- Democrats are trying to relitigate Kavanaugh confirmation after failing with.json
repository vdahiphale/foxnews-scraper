Of course, this violence is appalling, it strikes at the very heart of our civilized society here. But America is not a white supremacist country. The left profoundly misunderstands this country.   White supremacy is a fringe movement condemned across the board. Americans are big-hearted compassionate people. People of color, the world over are beating down the doors to try to get into this country because they know they will be safer here than in most places on earth. The left knows this too. The left is the epitome of hypocrisy. It is encouraging mass migration from third world countries. People of color to come into this country. If the Left believed what it is pumping out in this poisonous propaganda, it would tell people of color the world over not to come to the United States.  Let's look at the numbers. The numbers back up this picture, Martha, that this is not a country riven by racism or white supremacy or white nationalism. Those numbers are all over the map, everybody has different counts. The official hate group monitors are very quick to label something as white supremacy.  Let's remember in 2009 when Army Major Nidal Hasan killed 13 people and wounded another 30 at Fort Hood. The government refused to characterize that incident as Islamic terrorism even though he had been radicalizing for years. But let's look at the numbers that we've got. The FBI reports in 2017 an 11 percent increase in hate crimes when you account for increase in reporting blacks are 50 percent over-represented among perpetrators of hate crimes. Whites are 26 percent underrepresented among perpetrators of hate crimes. The same goes for mass shootings. Blacks are 50 percent over-represented among perpetrators of mass shootings.   When it comes to identified white supremacist incidents according to one source, there were 17 white supremacist homicides last year. That's 0.01 percent of all homicides in this country.",

He is an opponent of open borders. He has a good-faith disagreement with how the left has been running this country when it comes to immigration.  He has never advocated for violence against minorities. This is absurd. You know, the one by one count by the ADL, they were over a -- little over 1,000 instances of white supremacist propaganda distribution incidents, 1,000 last year. That compares to the daily rhetoric coming out of universities that we are a white supremacist, white privilege toxic masculinity country.

But obviously, as a priest, as a bishop, I would look at it spiritually. Because the spiritual is not one compartment among many, but the spiritual undergirds the whole of life. And so, something like this is always a sign of some kind of a spiritual rupture, a loss of contact with the deepest source of meaning. What you said it earlier is right, about the loss of faith, the decreased in religious practice around the country. When I was a kid, about 3 percent of our country would have claimed no religion. Now it's up to 25 percent. I don't think that goes without some consequence. There is a coarsening of life when you lose a contact with God, who is the source of moral value, the source of meaning, and finally, the source of human dignity. I don't think it simply a trivial matter when people are in a very consistent way, staying away from God and the things of God. So, I would point to that is certainly an important cause in some of the social trial that we see.",

So, I think that's certainly the case. I'm not surprised at all that many of these shooters come out of that kind of environment. And then, I trace it back further.

Of course, this violence is appalling, it strikes at the very heart of our civilized society here. But America is not a white supremacist country. The left profoundly misunderstands this country. White supremacy is a fringe movement condemned across the board. Americans are big-hearted compassionate people. People of color, the world over are beating down the doors to try to get into this country because they know they will be safer here than in most places on earth. The left knows this too. The left is the epitome of hypocrisy. It is encouraging mass migration from third world countries. People of color to come into this country. If the Left believed what it is pumping out in this poisonous propaganda, it would tell people of color the world over not to come to the United States. Let's look at the numbers. The numbers back up this picture, Martha, that this is not a country riven by racism or white supremacy or white nationalism. Those numbers are all over the map, everybody has different counts. The official hate group monitors are very quick to label something as white supremacy. Let's remember in 2009 when Army Major Nidal Hasan killed 13 people and wounded another 30 at Fort Hood. The government refused to characterize that incident as Islamic terrorism even though he had been radicalizing for years. But let's look at the numbers that we've got. The FBI reports in 2017 an 11 percent increase in hate crimes when you account for increase in reporting blacks are 50 percent over-represented among perpetrators of hate crimes. Whites are 26 percent underrepresented among perpetrators of hate crimes. The same goes for mass shootings. Blacks are 50 percent over-represented among perpetrators of mass shootings. When it comes to identified white supremacist incidents according to one source, there were 17 white supremacist homicides last year. That's 0.01 percent of all homicides in this country."

      "speaker": "MAC DONALD",

You know that we were used to this strategy on the left from academia. It categorizes any policy that it disagrees with as hate speech and bigotry. Trump has not used racial terms. He is an opponent of open borders. He has a good-faith disagreement with how the left has been running this country when it comes to immigration. He has never advocated for violence against minorities. This is absurd. You know, the one by one count by the ADL, they were over a -- little over 1,000 instances of white supremacist propaganda distribution incidents, 1,000 last year. That compares to the daily rhetoric coming out of universities that we are a white supremacist, white privilege toxic masculinity country. That is the ideology that governs our society today in every mainstream institution. As you say, Martha, there is not one word of encouragement for this madman who was hate-filled but he does not represent the American people."

Their hearts are open. If you want to see a radical ideology, look at what's coming out of academia that is telling white males across the country that they are worthless. That is creating enemy, it is creating a sense of resentment, but it is not leading to violence. The violence problem in this country -- if you want to save lives, you go into the inner city and you work on policing and make sure that the people committing drive-by shootings are off the streets. There's 11,000 gun homicides a year overwhelmingly committed by drive,-by shooting, by street crime, the number of white supremacist killings as awful as they are, and every single killing in this country should not exist. It is irrelevant if you want to save lives, support the police and care about the inner city victims who are the overwhelming victims of gun violence in this country."

But she's been quite critical of him since then. When you look at some of the other candidates who are running for the Democratic nomination along with you, they were very outspoken today. Sort of -- one of the major themes was that they believe that the president is fanning the flames of white supremacy and that there's a direct link between the act that we saw in El Paso, at least. Because we know that in Dayton, that killer supported -- and you know, another candidate, Democratic candidate, they are drawing a direct link between the president and this white supremacy movement.

I think the only answer is to say to every undocumented person who is not committed a crime, whose committed some crime of transgression or felony against an American citizen, I think there should be a path to citizenship, there should be the kind of efforts that we need to make at the border from this point forward and let us move on to a new chapter of American life."

If I owe you money, I don't get to tell you how to spend it. So I believe that it's very important that this reparations council, 30 to 50 people is what I've recommended which obviously should be very carefully chosen, people from academia, culture, politics, etcetera, who are known for their connection to this issue, for their research on this issue, etcetera who make the kinds of decisions whether it has to do with historical black colleges, whether it has to do with housing, whether it has to do -- whatever it has to do whit, but I believe part of the power here is that it would be the black community deciding how they wish to spend that money."

The Second Amendment is a fundamental right in our Constitution and is just important as all of the other amendments and it absolutely has to be protected. Now, if we want to look at different ways, we should to keep firearms out of the hands of the mentally ill or the deranged or people that shouldn't have them, absolutely. But you know, a lot of these databases are flawed. If you look at the Texas shooter of the church a few years ago, the Air Force did not input his information properly. It didn't communicate with the FBI properly, and he bought a firearm. You look at the Parkland shooting where he was reported 39 times. So the systems have to be executed appropriately. And in Florida, we do have the Baker Act which is a red flag law that a lot of people do support. But Martha, you know, we have to get it the deeper ills here on why these young men are committing these heinous acts. We've had guns in our history, our entire history. But these shootings are new and it's this generation. I think we have to take a strategic look at how we get these young men off their couch, off their video games, and out serving identified with their communities again."

I'm proposing a bill that gives it -- that that will incentivize us to get back to national service. And if you look at the societal benefits that we moved away from when we moved away from the draft, you took kids from the inner city, from middle America farms, from L.A., you name it, and they were all forced together at 18 years old, taught how to lead, how to follow, how to work together as teams with people that they had, you know, inherent differences with, and then they went back into society after learning to serve a bigger cause for their country and for their community. I think if we get back to national service, that's not a draft, that would be inner-city tutoring, that can be elderly care, that can be national parks, or the military."

His daughter and her friend were across the street from the Dayton bar and he has now -- he's now calling for an assault weapons ban.

And there is a difference between keeping firearms out of the hands of people who absolutely should not have them and then just outright bans. And so I don't -- do not support going that route. I think it is much more nuanced to look at how we enforce the existing laws that keep firearms out of people that shouldn't have them but get at why these people are doing it in the first place.

He wanted the president to be spy for the Russians. He wanted the president to be guilty of treason. He wanted to chair that just like Peter Rodino did back in the day, he wanted to be famous finally, Jerry Nadler did, as chairman of the judiciary committee. So, they are focusing now on Brett Kavanaugh, a guy who was collateral damage in the total war the Democrats declared. They savaged his reputation. They put him through the ring.

Senator Ted Cruz from Castro's home state said, quote, \"Elected representatives should not be vilifying and doxing their own constituents.\" And the pressure isn't just coming from the right. New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman said, quote, \"This is dangerous by any campaign.\" Journalist Yashar Ali called it, quote, \"awful.\" Even MSNBC kind of challenged Castro. Watch."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "That was Governor Mike Huckabee earlier this week, who's also a pastor, suggesting that a decline in faith could be one of the contributing factors to the violence that we see in America today as the nation searches for answers in the wake of yet two more last over the weekend, mass shootings in our country. A recent Gallup recent poll has found that church membership is at an all- time low. Just 50 percent of Americans belong to a church or other religious institution. That's down 20 percent over the past two decades. My next guest is a very well-known person, Bishop Robert Barron, is known by some as the bishop of social media where he reaches millions of people every single day with his daily gospel reflections. I'm one of them on a good day. In his newest book, \"Letters to a Suffering Church,\" he encourages Catholics to stay and fight for their faith and their church. Bishop Barron, thank you very much. Good to have you with us tonight."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So, talk to us about your thoughts on the violence that we have seen. The horrific loss of life. The president went to El Paso and Dayton today to be with some of those who are wounded and who lost people. Where does this kind of evil come from?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARRON",
      "utterance": "Of course, it's never right to find simply one cause. We can analyze it politically, you can analyze it culturally, sociologically, anthropologically. But obviously, as a priest, as a bishop, I would look at it spiritually. Because the spiritual is not one compartment among many, but the spiritual undergirds the whole of life. And so, something like this is always a sign of some kind of a spiritual rupture, a loss of contact with the deepest source of meaning. What you said it earlier is right, about the loss of faith, the decreased in religious practice around the country. When I was a kid, about 3 percent of our country would have claimed no religion. Now it's up to 25 percent. I don't think that goes without some consequence. There is a coarsening of life when you lose a contact with God, who is the source of moral value, the source of meaning, and finally, the source of human dignity. I don't think it simply a trivial matter when people are in a very consistent way, staying away from God and the things of God. So, I would point to that is certainly an important cause in some of the social trial that we see."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yes. You know, I think when people look at these, they try to find some reason, right. People talk about video games and people talk about accessibility to guns and you know, the family. A lot of these young men, when you look over the course of these shootings, a huge number of them grew up in families where their father wasn't really present in their lives. How much of that do you see as what ails the country right now?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARRON",
      "utterance": "It plays a very important role. I mean, the family, which is the cornerstone of the society is part of Catholic social teaching. So, when the family is compromised, the society as a whole becomes compromised. When the family breaks down the larger sections of the economy and society tend to break down. So, I think that's certainly the case. I'm not surprised at all that many of these shooters come out of that kind of environment. And then, I trace it back further. Carl Young, a psychologist famously said, at bottom, all psychological problems are spiritual problems. So, yes, indeed, we have to keep attending to that deepest dimension of life."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yes. If you could leave everybody with one message tonight for why you think they shouldn't may be rediscover going back to church. Some people will not be interested at all. But what would be -- what would be your pitch to them, especially Catholics who you say need to stay in fight in the face of all the recent scandal."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARRON",
      "utterance": "Yes. Because the deepest longing of the heart is for God. There's nothing in this world, no wealth, pleasure, power, honor, any good in the world that can satisfy the deepest hunger of the heart. And so, when you absent yourself from God, you are frustrating the deepest longing of the deepest part of you. And so that's the reason why you should go back to church. That then has ramifications across the whole of your life, including, and especially the respect you show to other human beings, who have the same longing that you do. So that's my principal argument --"
