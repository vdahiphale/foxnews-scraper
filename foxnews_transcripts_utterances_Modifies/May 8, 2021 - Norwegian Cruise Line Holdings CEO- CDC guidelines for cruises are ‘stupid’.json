When we talk about economic numbers, there are the expectations, and then the reality, the expectations that, last month, we are going to see maybe a million or more jobs added to the economy. Turned out to be about 266,000, which certainly are not that bad.  We didn't expect the unemployment rate to inch up, but it did to 6.1 percent. It's still a lot lower than the nearly 15 percent it was at, at the height of the pandemic. But it's raised a whole lot of questions about whether those numbers are being held back by benefits that are keeping people at home, rather than looking for work.  We're going to be exploring that in great detail, but first to Blake Burman on how the White House is playing all of this -- Blake.",

Instead, we should be looking at the past three months, the first three months under the Biden administration, which they note have averaged 500,000 jobs, more than that, per month.  So that's one way that they are putting this. The second thing that they are pointing to is continued month-over-month job growth.

And we are climbing out of an economic hole, only for small businesses to confront this labor shortage, because they are having difficulty getting people to work when the unemployment benefits are so high. And restauranteurs in New York talked to The New York Post about this as well. They're having difficulty staffing up even at 50 percent capacity.  When it goes back to 100 percent capacity in restaurants, they are going to have an even harder time.

And so, when I think about what it is that we need to do as we step into this next chapter of the country, of the economy, as Janet Yellen said, it's going to be a bumpy road ahead.  But it's really important that we collectively start to create value by supporting each other. And I would ask, not just small businesses, but the Amazons of the world, what are we doing about minimum wage? Or what are we doing about minimum wage, plus a dollar?

      "sentences": "No, he won't compete with that. And if he or she does try to compete with that, what they will end up doing is cutting back their employees' hours. And I will address Jenna's point. I think it's not the role of the government to compensate American workers for their -- for their hard work. It's the government's job to stay out of the way of private enterprise, so that they can produce enough revenue to continue to hire workers.  In this case, just to put numbers on it -- as an economist, I like to do that, Neil -- we're back to pre-pandemic levels in terms of job openings. There are 7.4 million jobs available right now in the U.S. economy. Last month, only 266,000 of those jobs were filled. And that's not just because people are still concerned about the pandemic. And, eventually, that will go away. So, part of this, I think, is temporary. Especially these more attractive wages, because wages are going higher, will tantalize people back into the job force.  But it's unequivocally a fact that, when you have a top-off benefit -- and that's $300, in addition to unemployment benefits per week -- as you said, that adds up to about $22 per hour -- that's enormously incentivizing to not return to the labor force. And we have an economy, Neil, that's $25 trillion in debt. We have a fiscal deficit that is 20 percent -- is 20 percent of GDP, 20 percent of GDP, and $6 trillion in additional stimulus spending only over the past 12 months, with not even a discussion of retracing any of that additional $6 trillion of deficit and debt-financed spending. To the contrary, Neil, we're talking about more spending. This is egregious and it's very worrisome.",

Yet, this week, the CDC came out with one of their bizarre requirements that, while you are eating at a restaurant or drinking a beverage at a bar, you must wear -- you must take on your mask on and off, only take it off to put food in your mouth, then put your mask back on while you're chewing and swallowing. And then you can take it off again and put another piece of food or another sip of beverage. Is that not the craziest, most bizarre, onerous thing you ever heard, especially when everybody on the ship is vaccinated? If it was mixed company, maybe, maybe, but 100 percent vaccination? So these are the kinds of incredibly stupid, for lack of a better term, just stupid requirements that the CDC is throwing our way for what we now believe is just to prevent us from cruising. There is no good reason to prevent us from cruising. Every other transportation venue, entertainment venue, hospitality venue is open around the country, and we're still shut down after 15 months? It's unfair. It's un-American. My guess, it's even illegal. And, I mean, we have had it. And we're pushing back hard.

Now, people are worried about it right now. And there are some good reasons why. Things feel really expensive. Let's go ahead and start with that gallon of gas. In case you're filling up to go see mom on Sunday, the national average for a gallon of regular gasoline, $2.95. That's according to AAA. It's $1.14 more than this time last year, or an increase of 62 percent. And we are not even in the so-called summer driving season yet, so buckle up. What about food prices, as you mentioned? Well, the USDA's latest report on milk for April says the average price for a gallon of whole milk, $3.58. That's not the fancy lactose-free kind or the organic milk. It's the regular kind. And that price is up roughly 4 percent in about 18 months, so not so terrible there. What about chicken, another staple for the summer? Prices are skyrocketing, tight supply and not enough workers coming back to work. You are looking at wings that cost roughly 50 percent more. This has been a problem since the Super Bowl. It is still not resolved. So, what's the government doing about it? Well, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen not too worried.",

And today's job reports was -- job report was concerning to me, because we're starting -- some could interpret it as we're starting to see it slow down. And I think what we're having are these sort of counterbalanced forces at each other. We have increasing demand as we come out of the pandemic, and we have government, and well-meaning government policies to try to help people who suffered from the pandemic, that are actually causing some of the labor shortages now. And there are jobs everywhere. And I have been in three states in the last two days. And there are job openings everywhere. Restaurants are not able to open every -- seven days a week because they just can't staff them. So the jobs are out there, and yet our employment is going in the wrong direction. So, they're -- some of the policies that are in place are having -- are being sort of counterproductive to that growth.

When we talk about economic numbers, there are the expectations, and then the reality, the expectations that, last month, we are going to see maybe a million or more jobs added to the economy. Turned out to be about 266,000, which certainly are not that bad. We didn't expect the unemployment rate to inch up, but it did to 6.1 percent. It's still a lot lower than the nearly 15 percent it was at, at the height of the pandemic. But it's raised a whole lot of questions about whether those numbers are being held back by benefits that are keeping people at home, rather than looking for work.

And we are climbing out of an economic hole, only for small businesses to confront this labor shortage, because they are having difficulty getting people to work when the unemployment benefits are so high. And restauranteurs in New York talked to The New York Post about this as well. They're having difficulty staffing up even at 50 percent capacity. When it goes back to 100 percent capacity in restaurants, they are going to have an even harder time.

I think the bigger question we should be asking is exactly how we're compensating Americans for their hard-earned time. And so, when I think about what it is that we need to do as we step into this next chapter of the country, of the economy, as Janet Yellen said, it's going to be a bumpy road ahead. But it's really important that we collectively start to create value by supporting each other. And I would ask, not just small businesses, but the Amazons of the world, what are we doing about minimum wage? Or what are we doing about minimum wage, plus a dollar? God forbid that we actually talk about paying our hourly workers more money, when they barely are able to keep lights on."

      "utterance": "All right, well, in the case of Amazon, they are at $20, and north of that, as is Walmart, on average, now. But leaving that aside, Kathryn, one of the things I have noticed is that, with these benefits all combined, that is, stimulus payments and the state unemployment, then the added federal benefit of $300, it is the equivalent of around $21 to $22 an hour. You tell a restaurant owner or a small business owner to compete with that, he can't. And that's the problem."

    {
      "speaker": "KATHRYN ROONEY VERA, BULLTICK CAPITAL MARKETS HOLDINGS",
      "utterance": "No, he won't compete with that. And if he or she does try to compete with that, what they will end up doing is cutting back their employees' hours. And I will address Jenna's point. I think it's not the role of the government to compensate American workers for their -- for their hard work. It's the government's job to stay out of the way of private enterprise, so that they can produce enough revenue to continue to hire workers. In this case, just to put numbers on it -- as an economist, I like to do that, Neil -- we're back to pre-pandemic levels in terms of job openings. There are 7.4 million jobs available right now in the U.S. economy. Last month, only 266,000 of those jobs were filled. And that's not just because people are still concerned about the pandemic. And, eventually, that will go away. So, part of this, I think, is temporary. Especially these more attractive wages, because wages are going higher, will tantalize people back into the job force. But it's unequivocally a fact that, when you have a top-off benefit -- and that's $300, in addition to unemployment benefits per week -- as you said, that adds up to about $22 per hour -- that's enormously incentivizing to not return to the labor force. And we have an economy, Neil, that's $25 trillion in debt. We have a fiscal deficit that is 20 percent -- is 20 percent of GDP, 20 percent of GDP, and $6 trillion in additional stimulus spending only over the past 12 months, with not even a discussion of retracing any of that additional $6 trillion of deficit and debt-financed spending. To the contrary, Neil, we're talking about more spending. This is egregious and it's very worrisome."

And chances are, with the Earth 70 percent water, most statisticians say that means it would land somewhere on water, and you don't have to worry about it on land. But here's the problem with that theory. It's so big all bets are off. And its trajectory coming into the atmosphere could be so wild that guessing where it ends up, well, is anyone's guess. But to show you how big a deal this is, this is roughly 100 feet long. This rocket is 100 feet long, typical 18-wheeler, about 70 to 80 feet long. And it's a lot heavier than that, I mean, maybe up to 10 times heavier than that. And it's coming into the Earth here. Now, this is going to happen this weekend.

      "speaker": "DR. FRANCIS COLLINS, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH",
      "utterance": "Well, CDC is the place to go if you're confused about this. And I know the recommendations have been changing. And so people are understandably not quite clear. But if you go to CDC's site, if you're vaccinated, you still, in an inside gathering, are well-advised to keep the mask on. Why is that? Because even a vaccinated person like me might potentially still be able to carry the virus. And if you're inside with other unvaccinated people who might be vulnerable, you're protecting them by keeping your mask on. Not so outside. I mean, I worry that everybody thinks, oh, my God, we're going to have to wear these masks forever. Things have changed a lot. If you're vaccinated, you can gather with people in your own home who are also vaccinated and have dinner together. My wife and I have been doing that. It's great. You can go outside and do what you want to, take the mask off, unless you're in like a huge stadium with people packed in like two feet apart. Otherwise, masks off outside. Live it up. But you got to get vaccinated to enjoy that liberation."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "COLLINS",
      "utterance": "I tell them, everybody, keep calm. Civil discourse would be a good thing to model for your children. Having a screaming fight with a school board maybe not such a great model. Look at the evidence. Look at, what is the actual risk in your community by how much disease is there right now? It'll be different in different parts of the country. And what is actually the story about kids? Are they completely immune from this disease? No, they're not. They can get sick. In fact, in the last little bit, more than a quarter of the cases have been in children and young adults, I mean, up to 18. So, kids do get this. They usually handle it well. They can though, get this long COVID that goes on a long time. So, nobody should imagine kids are just completely off the list here as far as having any risk. And, of course, they can pass it on to others. But, again, I'm sorry that America has turned into a place where masks have become such a battleground. Think of a mask as a lifesaving medical device. If used in the right place, it can do a lot of good. I get it. If it's not necessary, let's take it off. But if there's a reason to wear it, even now in a school setting indoors, where kids are close together, let's look at the evidence and make a wise, rational decision."

That's what we got to do. And that means all of us, not just some of us. So, please, everybody, look at that evidence. If you're mad about masks, then roll up your sleeve and get vaccinated, and tell everybody else around you..."

    {

But if you have a mixing of vaccinated and unvaccinated people at close quarters, then there's a greater risk. So, I think they're trying something creative here. Obviously, it wouldn't be necessary if everybody had decided to get vaccinated. So, again, I come back to that. Come on, America."

They must be vaccinated, submits that, assumes that is more than enough, and still nothing, still changing guidelines coming from the CDC. And the Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings CEO -- this is the third largest cruise company on the planet. That includes Norwegian and Oceania and Regent Seven Seas -- he's at a loss what to do. And he's back with us right now. Frank Del Rio, I was thinking of you, and thinking, all right, what happened now? I mean, you did all of this. You prepared all of this. You were ready, went way beyond any guidelines or even requirements. And still you're -- you're at pause here. What happened?"

      "speaker": "FRANK DEL RIO, CEO, NORWEGIAN CRUISE LINE HOLDINGS",
      "utterance": "Well, Neil, as you know -- and, by the way, thanks for having me back. Good to see you again. On April 5, we submitted a -- what we believed to be an ironclad proposal to the CDC, where we said that we would mandate 100 percent vaccination for every single person on board the vessel, crew and guests, which would render all these, do you wear a mask, don't you wear a mask issues that your previous guest was talking about -- if everybody inside that venue, in this case, a ship, is vaccinated, there is no need for a mask. Yet, this week, the CDC came out with one of their bizarre requirements that, while you are eating at a restaurant or drinking a beverage at a bar, you must wear -- you must take on your mask on and off, only take it off to put food in your mouth, then put your mask back on while you're chewing and swallowing. And then you can take it off again and put another piece of food or another sip of beverage. Is that not the craziest, most bizarre, onerous thing you ever heard, especially when everybody on the ship is vaccinated? If it was mixed company, maybe, maybe, but 100 percent vaccination? So these are the kinds of incredibly stupid, for lack of a better term, just stupid requirements that the CDC is throwing our way for what we now believe is just to prevent us from cruising. There is no good reason to prevent us from cruising. Every other transportation venue, entertainment venue, hospitality venue is open around the country, and we're still shut down after 15 months? It's unfair. It's un-American. My guess, it's even illegal. And, I mean, we have had it. And we're pushing back hard. We will see how things develop, but since we spoke last a couple of weeks ago, one step forward, two steps back."

But you can't board a ship from a U.S. port. That's nuts. That's just nuts. And, by the way, we submitted this plan to the CDC, 100 percent vaccination for everyone. And they came back with 95 percent for passengers and 98 percent for crew. If you're a public health organization, why in the world would you leave a 2 percent loophole where COVID can be introduced in that venue? A hundred percent is foolproof; 98 percent is not."

But, remember, this is the same organization -- I'm not faulting them -- that pooh-poohed the issue of masks when all of this started, then said masks, pooh-poohed distancing provisions that they were a little silly, then enforced them. The same with what they're requiring now of cruise line operators such as yourself. It's not as if they have been consistent, so they leave you in a lurch."

Now, people are worried about it right now. And there are some good reasons why. Things feel really expensive. Let's go ahead and start with that gallon of gas. In case you're filling up to go see mom on Sunday, the national average for a gallon of regular gasoline, $2.95. That's according to AAA. It's $1.14 more than this time last year, or an increase of 62 percent. And we are not even in the so-called summer driving season yet, so buckle up. What about food prices, as you mentioned? Well, the USDA's latest report on milk for April says the average price for a gallon of whole milk, $3.58. That's not the fancy lactose-free kind or the organic milk. It's the regular kind. And that price is up roughly 4 percent in about 18 months, so not so terrible there. What about chicken, another staple for the summer? Prices are skyrocketing, tight supply and not enough workers coming back to work. You are looking at wings that cost roughly 50 percent more. This has been a problem since the Super Bowl. It is still not resolved. So, what's the government doing about it? Well, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen not too worried."

      "utterance": "Well, Neil, how are you doing? Yes, there's a lot of factors that are going on that are impacting it. Prices are going up. It's demand-driven. It's shortage-driven. As Jackie mentioned, the availability of workers and labor in general is causing shortages in all kinds of different industries. That's going to drive prices up. But demand-driven price increases, which is what we're seeing, I think, have the ability to be better absorbed by the economy than price increases that are raw material-generated. And so I'm hopeful, when things settle out, we won't be in a very, very steep inflationary cycle. And it's very hard to measure gas prices, for example, against this time last year."

And those increases do hit, for example, new homebuyers, who are oftentimes getting priced out of the market. But I'm not an age to remember when inflation was a lot worse, when it was hyperinflation, and things got out of control. But do you see any signs of that, because the backdrop for this is a strong economy, right? I mean, demand is building as people get back to work. That's the good rationale for this, and leave it at that. But will it be left at that? What do you think?"

We have -- there's really no record that I can -- that I can point to where we have had a full employment recession in this country. And jobs are really the most important thing to making sure that we keep growing. And today's job reports was -- job report was concerning to me, because we're starting -- some could interpret it as we're starting to see it slow down. And I think what we're having are these sort of counterbalanced forces at each other. We have increasing demand as we come out of the pandemic, and we have government, and well-meaning government policies to try to help people who suffered from the pandemic, that are actually causing some of the labor shortages now. And there are jobs everywhere. And I have been in three states in the last two days. And there are job openings everywhere. Restaurants are not able to open every -- seven days a week because they just can't staff them. So the jobs are out there, and yet our employment is going in the wrong direction. So, they're -- some of the policies that are in place are having -- are being sort of counterproductive to that growth. And if we don't get that under control, we could have our unemployment tick up at the same time that our prices are ticking up."

Bill Simon, the former Walmart U.S. CEO. Tomorrow -- and, remember, we are live at 10:00 a.m. -- we will be monitoring all of this, and really getting into the weeds here, because it'll be the same day a lot of you are going to go out grocery shopping for yourself and seeing it. Do this before my show, or, ideally, after my show. But the fact of the matter is, it is a very, very big worry. We will be chronicling that. But, again, I want to advise, things could be worse, because we're also monitoring something else, that rocket that is hurtling to Earth, which, if it obliterates a good chunk of Earth, all of this stuff passes, right? See you tomorrow."
