I'm also standing up for due process.\"  He claims that he is innocent of two accusations of sexual assault. He would like the FBI to investigate. His accusers now want to testify. And why does Governor Northam keep talking? Good question, right? So, he is now in hot water again for equating slavery with indentured servitude.",

Now, Ilhan Omar, she represents a district just outside of Minneapolis, came under fire last night after critics say her tweets were full of stereotypes about Jews and money. A follower asked Omar \"Who is paying American politicians to support Israel? She responded AIPAC, in reference to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee.  In another tweet criticizing members of Congress for taking a hard stance on Omar's comments, she tweeted \"it's all about the Benjamins baby,\" meaning, $100-bills. But after repeated condemnation from Republican and Democratic leaders, Martha, Omar took to Twitter again this time issuing an apology late this afternoon. She tweeted \"Anti-Semitism is real and I am grateful for Jewish allies and colleagues who are educating me on the painful history of anti-Semitic tropes. My intention is never to offend my constituents or Jewish Americans as a whole. We have to always be willing to step back and think through criticism just as I expect people to hear me when others attacked me for my identity.

Quoting, \"We fully understand and respect the complexity of questions and issues in signing a player with Kareem's history and do not condone his actions. Given what we know about Kareem through our extensive research, we believe he deserves a second chance.\" In video of the accident obtained by TMZ, Hunt and a 19-year-old woman trade words and are repeatedly separated by others in a hotel wall. Hunt then pushes the woman. She responds by hitting him. Hunt then collides with another man who knocks the woman over. And that is when Kareem Hunt kicks the 19-year-old while she's on the ground. The running back has issued his own statement along with another apology quoting again, \"That is the not the man I was raised to be, and I've learned a great deal from that experience and certainly should have been more truthful about it after the fact.\" Hunt goes on to say he plans to earn the Browns trust. Public reaction has been mixed with one woman posting on Twitter, quote, \"how does he deserve a second chance when he's barely had time to experience the repercussions of ruining the first one?\" Then there was this, quote, \"Chiefs fan here. Hunt is doing the work off field to show he is learning. He is seeking alcohol and anger management program mentoring with his pastor and meeting with women's groups. He deserves a second chance, and I wish him well.\" Remember, Kareem Hunt was never arrested or charged with a crime, and both the Kansas City Chiefs and the NFL knew about the incident when it happened one year ago, but neither took any action until that video went public.

Breaking tonight, the 2020 story live from the border tonight as Beto O'Rourke marches with protesters, and President Trump comes to rally El Paso as negotiations back in D.C. get a little bit rocky. Also tonight, the Virginia saga gets worst. Lieutenant Governor Justin Fairfax is now fighting back. Saying, \"Due process is at the heart of our constitutional democracy in order to get to the truth. Even when faced with those allegations, I am still standing up for everyone's right to be heard. I'm also standing up for due process.\" He claims that he is innocent of two accusations of sexual assault. He would like the FBI to investigate. His accusers now want to testify. And why does Governor Northam keep talking? Good question, right? So, he is now in hot water again for equating slavery with indentured servitude."

And he reached out to see how he could help African-American farmers in Virginia during the government shutdown. And after the issue of blackface came about, his administration reached out to me and asked me to come in to talk to them about it. And we had a very candid meeting about blackface. I prayed -- I prayed for Virginians, I pray for this country, I pray for his family, and I pray for a healing, healing here in the state of Virginia. So, we had a very, very candid conversation, and the governor admitted that he had a lot to learn about race and those type of things. And he asked for forgiveness. And I believe in the power of redemption and the power of forgiving somebody when they reach out to you and express that -- express that to you. So, I looked into his eyes, and we had a very, very deep conversation -- very candid conversation. And after that meeting, I agreed to give the governor a second chance so we could move forward in Virginia. You know, there's a lot of turmoil here in Virginia. And we really need healing. And right now, the country's watching, the world is watching everything that's transpiring here in Virginia.

They don't want to give that up. And that's what Elizabeth Warren is for. They want this green agenda on that is going to really cost the country trillions of dollars. I mean, when we start putting price tags in these things, they realize the freedom they're giving up. The president was right the other night in the State of the Union. They're moving us towards a socialist agenda.

Hi, David!"

      "utterance": "Hey, Martha! Good evening. Well, Congresswoman Omar just started walking the halls here on Capitol Hill just a little bit more than a month ago. She's already made some serious high- profile enemies. These latest comments came in the form of tweets. Both sides of the aisle are furious about these comments. Now, Ilhan Omar, she represents a district just outside of Minneapolis, came under fire last night after critics say her tweets were full of stereotypes about Jews and money. A follower asked Omar \"Who is paying American politicians to support Israel? She responded AIPAC, in reference to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. In another tweet criticizing members of Congress for taking a hard stance on Omar's comments, she tweeted \"it's all about the Benjamins baby,\" meaning, $100-bills. But after repeated condemnation from Republican and Democratic leaders, Martha, Omar took to Twitter again this time issuing an apology late this afternoon. She tweeted \"Anti-Semitism is real and I am grateful for Jewish allies and colleagues who are educating me on the painful history of anti-Semitic tropes. My intention is never to offend my constituents or Jewish Americans as a whole. We have to always be willing to step back and think through criticism just as I expect people to hear me when others attacked me for my identity. This is why I unequivocally apologize at the same time I reaffirm the problematic role of lobbyists in our politics whether it be AIPAC, the NRA, or the fossil fuel industry. It's gone on too long and we must be willing to address it.\" Now, we had a camera outside of Omar's office on Capitol Hill today. No sign of her on camera. However, people putting little sticky posted notes supporting representative Ilhan Omar, all different times -- all different types of message I should say across the spectrum, nothing from Omar on camera. You can bet though, when she does come back to Capitol Hill this week -- they're off tomorrow to honor Congressman Dingell, the late Congressman Diggle -- when she's back, Martha, you can bet she will get plenty of questions about these recent comments, Martha."

We all do things that were not proud of. And you come out and you say I'm sorry. I did wrong. Let's change the narrative. And it makes me sad to see that that's not where she went in. She went to end with another slap at what she thinks is the straw man of money and things in politics which it has nothing to do with anti-Semitism, it has nothing to do with attacking Israel as she is has a history of doing. So I think in the end is sort of saddens me that a member of Congress who has the platform to really change the world, to raise our gaze above the things that we're seeing has chosen to take a time to continue this but then when she even -- she apologized, she said but."

I think when you look at both of them, I think the problem is she takes her anti-Semitism which came across very blatantly in these tweets and with others and then she attaches it to saying that the members of Congress were bought by the thing that she disliked so much and obviously that is Israel. When you start doing that, that makes it even worse because the people in her position when she has the ability to change minds and to change attitude, she chooses to go to the lowest common denominator. That makes everybody believe again toward money or politics or whatever you want to think. And let's not take it off the eye of what's really there. Just in Congress this past month, we denounced again, white nationalism, black racism. That was something I did on the floor leading our side. We took a member who had made comments and took them off committees. These are kind of things that real I think apology shows. And she was only forced into this apology. That's another issue you have to look at."

But when you look at them, they work both Republican and Democrat. I can remember having disagreements with APAC when it came to the Iran deal. There were times that these are very good friends of mine and I said, I thought they ought to be more partisan. And they said, no, we're bipartisan because we believe that's the best way to work it, by the way, which you have no seemingly knowledge of how they operate. Again, just takes our civility and continues to knock it down. We've got to, again, raise ourselves up to where it be how we feel about and having racist or anti-Semitic thoughts, those are not tolerated in what should be the most deliberative body in the world. If we continue to go that then why do we expect anybody out in the country to think better of us?"

      "utterance": "Hi, Martha. Kareem Hunt just signed a one-year contract with the Cleveland Browns. At the end of one year, Hunt becomes a restricted free agent, meaning the Browns would still control his rights. Browns general manager John Dorsey who drafted Kareem Hunt when he was the G.M. for the Chiefs back in 2017 says he's confident because Hunt has taken full responsibility for his egregious behavior, shown remorse, and agreed to continue professional therapy. Quoting, \"We fully understand and respect the complexity of questions and issues in signing a player with Kareem's history and do not condone his actions. Given what we know about Kareem through our extensive research, we believe he deserves a second chance.\" In video of the accident obtained by TMZ, Hunt and a 19-year-old woman trade words and are repeatedly separated by others in a hotel wall. Hunt then pushes the woman. She responds by hitting him. Hunt then collides with another man who knocks the woman over. And that is when Kareem Hunt kicks the 19-year-old while she's on the ground. The running back has issued his own statement along with another apology quoting again, \"That is the not the man I was raised to be, and I've learned a great deal from that experience and certainly should have been more truthful about it after the fact.\" Hunt goes on to say he plans to earn the Browns trust. Public reaction has been mixed with one woman posting on Twitter, quote, \"how does he deserve a second chance when he's barely had time to experience the repercussions of ruining the first one?\" Then there was this, quote, \"Chiefs fan here. Hunt is doing the work off field to show he is learning. He is seeking alcohol and anger management program mentoring with his pastor and meeting with women's groups. He deserves a second chance, and I wish him well.\" Remember, Kareem Hunt was never arrested or charged with a crime, and both the Kansas City Chiefs and the NFL knew about the incident when it happened one year ago, but neither took any action until that video went public. We should note, as a rookie in 2017, Kareem Hunt led the league in rushing. Martha."

You know, I think that what has to happen here is a kind of a more reasoned approach. We need a strong border to have order to protect immigrants and to prevent crime from seeping over. Juarez is one of the 20 most dangerous cities on earth. In 2009, it was more dangerous than Baghdad, or Kabul, Afghanistan. I mean, these are realities.

And I would say that every member of Congress in every district, the borders -- the Mexican and United States border, they are opposed to Donald Trump's border wall. They are opposed to his rhetoric. So, the people that actually live on the border take a much more nuanced stance like Geraldo is talking about. They know barriers are needed in some places, particularly urban areas. But they know in much of the border, you can't take people's land through imminent domain or there are better ways to secure the border. It's those people that actually live on the border. The folks who live in El Paso who have come out since the president mentioned their city in the State of the Union, law enforcement officials there who said we don't need what President Trump is trying to sell us. We need smart security but do not bring him to bring that kind of rhetoric that's not based in reality down to our city. And Beto O'Rourke I will say --"

He also wanted the Secure Fence Act which was 2006. There were tons of agreements on it. So, what's the problem now other than what it appears to be, which is that it's President Trump?"

      "utterance": "Well, no, I don't think that's fair. President Trump, first of all, his rhetoric is incredibly much more heated and much more divisive. And I do think that on these issues, rhetoric matters. And also, his proposals for the border wall, for the fencing, the separation of families, that has gone way beyond anything that any previous administration has done. So politicly speaking here, Martha, I think this is the first 2020 rally for President Trump. That's what we're going to see --"

      "utterance": "I think you're right that that's going to continue to be a very contentious move on his part that will absolutely come up throughout the Democratic race. And it will used -- it will be used against him to be sure. But the issue of what people want at the border is so fairly consistent. I don't even think rhetoric matters. Because when you're talking about a wall and you know, that may be offensive to some people, and that's fine. That's their opinion. But they're all talking about the same thing essentially."

    {
      "speaker": "HARF",
      "utterance": "But Martha, a majority of people do not think we should build the wall. They do support some kind of fencing. And if you just talk Donald trump ran in the midterm election in 2018, he aggressively pushed a closing argument for the Republicans based on hard-line immigration policies and they lost a record number of seats in the House. The Democrats beat them on this issue. So politicly speaking, this may help with his base. This will not help him in 2020 if he doesn't find some moderation, which I just don't think he has in him on this issue."

If President Trump's name was not associated with the border barrier, was not extolling the virtue of the system that exists in places like El Paso and Juarez, it would be a whole different story. It is so hypocritical to hear the same people who were silent when Barack Obama brought the military in --"
