One hour after Christmas was officially over that Newman police officer Ronil \"Ron\" Singh, stopped 33-year-old Gustavo Perez Arriaga on suspicion of driving under the influence. Seconds later, Officer Singh called shot fired over the police radio. Minutes later, his colleagues found him mortally wounded. Arriaga, an illegal immigrant, and known gang member was on the run for two days before being captured as he tried to flee back to Mexico. Seven other suspects were arrested for helping him evade capture. Six of them were also in the U.S. illegally.  But Perez Arriaga had been arrested for drunk driving in 2011. And again, in 2014. But under California's sanctuary policies, immigration and customs enforcement were not notified of those arrests, and Arriaga stayed in the U.S.   Several California sheriffs blamed the state's sanctuary law for officer Singh's death. But former California Governor Jerry Brown is pushing back, saying the law did not take effect until 2018. What Brown fails to mention is that in 2013, he also signed the Trust Act, a precursor to the sanctuary law which also prevented local law enforcement from cooperating with immigration agents. And as far back as 2012, then-California Attorney General and potential 2020 presidential candidate Kamala Harris sent a letter to police agencies saying in part, \"Several local law enforcement agencies appear to treat immigration detainers, sometimes called, ICE holds, as mandatory orders. But immigration detainers are not compulsory. Instead, they are merely requests.\"  Bottom line, California Counties have been ignoring ICE detainers for years. Also, it's unclear if Perez Arriaga will face the death penalty. Martha.",

She also said that, and I think this is appropriate for a Congressman to say that we should be exercising oversight and in holding any federal agency to account. So, I'm not sure I would read her comments the way perhaps you have.

      "utterance": "Martha, it was 1:00 in the morning. One hour after Christmas was officially over that Newman police officer Ronil \"Ron\" Singh, stopped 33-year-old Gustavo Perez Arriaga on suspicion of driving under the influence. Seconds later, Officer Singh called shot fired over the police radio. Minutes later, his colleagues found him mortally wounded. Arriaga, an illegal immigrant, and known gang member was on the run for two days before being captured as he tried to flee back to Mexico. Seven other suspects were arrested for helping him evade capture. Six of them were also in the U.S. illegally. But Perez Arriaga had been arrested for drunk driving in 2011. And again, in 2014. But under California's sanctuary policies, immigration and customs enforcement were not notified of those arrests, and Arriaga stayed in the U.S. Several California sheriffs blamed the state's sanctuary law for officer Singh's death. But former California Governor Jerry Brown is pushing back, saying the law did not take effect until 2018. What Brown fails to mention is that in 2013, he also signed the Trust Act, a precursor to the sanctuary law which also prevented local law enforcement from cooperating with immigration agents. And as far back as 2012, then-California Attorney General and potential 2020 presidential candidate Kamala Harris sent a letter to police agencies saying in part, \"Several local law enforcement agencies appear to treat immigration detainers, sometimes called, ICE holds, as mandatory orders. But immigration detainers are not compulsory. Instead, they are merely requests.\" Bottom line, California Counties have been ignoring ICE detainers for years. Also, it's unclear if Perez Arriaga will face the death penalty. Martha."

And he got his citizenship and I was able to get my citizenship also. And we were -- we are now American -- a law-abiding American citizenship holders. And the day I found out that the suspect was illegal immigrant and had prior DUIs -- two DUIs, my question was that why we did not react the first time he had a DUI if he's an illegal immigrant? And I feel like that we shouldn't be giving people second chance. Illegal immigrants, we shouldn't be giving a second chance to them if he would have been deported, my brother would be alive right now. I would not be doing this interview.

The idea that border security, national security, human trafficking, and drugs flowing over our southern border are somehow now political football is wrong. These should be bipartisan issues. Frankly, it's -- it is political in the sense that in 19 -- excuse me, in 2013, all 54 Senate Democrats voted for $40-plus billion of border security including 700 miles of fencing. This -- the only reason that there's opposition is because it's Donald Trump that's proposing this. You know, one of my predecessors and one of the Fox Contributors Ari Fleischer had a great idea which is Nancy Pelosi and Trump and Schumer should just do this. Give all the money to the Border Patrol and say they get to decide what goes on. Because the reality is that anybody with a brain will recognize that we need a combination of border wall and fencing along the southern border that we have. That's always been a bipartisan issue. But if we take Trump's name out of it, somehow if we called it the Schumer border security bill, they'd probably pass it. The only reason they're against it is because it's Trump."

You know, you're not really even -- you're not hearing that the way that you used to because I think they're getting a lot of pressure from folks who are further left on the spectrum than they are. They can't talk like that anymore."

She used to be the one that we as Republicans cited as the far left you know, candidate, the far left policymaker. She's now the mainstream of the Democratic Party. And I think that she is continuing to make sure that she keeps her left wing in check. But the reality is that this shouldn't be a political issue.

The contention that the border crossings have fallen, you know, these are tricky numbers. Because when you look at the number of unaccompanied alien children, that and that number was up 21 percent last year, up 50,000. Family crossings are up 42 percent.

But when you see folks like that who've been very outspoken and critical of the president recognize how important this issue is to the security of our country to preventing human trafficking, to stopping the flow of illegal drugs, it shouldn't be a question of whether there's 4,000 crossings or 2,000 crossings or ten. The fact of the matter is we should be doing everything we can to protect our people, to protect them whether it's people coming over illegally, protecting them from the flow of drugs, protecting women and children who are being trafficked. One is too many. We should have to have a discussion about whether it's X thousand or Y thousand. The bottom line is this. This is -- the President has made it very clear that he's going to protect the country and our people. We should be coming together on this. Let's fight it out over tax rates.

Ed Buck is the one to thank. He gave me my first injection of crystal meth. It was very painful but after all the troubles, I became addicted.

I mean, if a prosecutor read that journal entry and didn't want to bring him in for some serious questioning, and perhaps try to figure out how does a person turn a young 20-something year old into a drug addict and not have some responsibility when the person dies of an overdose. I mean, I just don't understand that. We asked early on was this about race, I think that's part of it. But I think part of it is this guy is so connected. And let's be clear, I don't blame any of the Democrat politicians for what Ed Buck did. And I think you know, the tendency that maybe guy on my side of the aisle might have is to say oh look at these Democrats. They took money from this sleazebag.

She's had treatment for that. So, the fact that she takes time off I don't think anybody ought to get all excited about that. People a third of her age would be taken off given all the health issues she has. I think the one thing that I would point out is that this is not a time for people to start speculating should she retire, does she have to retire. She shouldn't retire until she decides she wants to retire. And I'm going to be the first and I don't agree with hardly anything she ever opines, but I do respect that she was legally appointed and then confirmed almost unanimously by the Senate back in the 90s when there was a sense of respecting presidents' appointments. And I think Republicans would do well to say let's hope she gets well. Let's hope she goes out under her own terms and when she's ready to do it, not when someone else is.

It's just a matter of whether or not the governor can find a suitable replacement at the earliest time and then go ahead and remove Sheriff Israel. He is incompetent to lead an agency of this size and he is incapable of understanding the severity of the mistakes that he's been making within the sheriff's office called to lead an agency this size. His number one picks in the surrounding command staff have torn down this agency to a level that we have never seen before and he is on the verge of being the second sheriff removed from office in the last 12 years at the Broward Sheriff's office. FITA should never be seen within a police department and he's going to the second one soon."

      "speaker": "BELL",

He started with the intentional rewording of the active shooter policy to make it more appeasing to the public. And then he started going into our police department. And instead of having what we used to train under the warrior mindset, meaning to not be the victim first, take the fight to the bad guys first when justified is that he started implementing policies saying that we have to be polite and fair to everybody and ask dozens of time to please put your hands behind your back and risk our own officer's safety whose lives are out there in the street. But this man and his policies and the individuals that he has personally handpicked to be the upper level of the command staff of the sheriff's office has done more damage to this agency than I can ever recall in the 24 years that I've been here."

These fans were ordered in December of last year and they just arrived in the Chief of Staff Lisa Castille's office where she just handed them out to the community leaders in Pompano, in Deerfield, in Oakland Park. And that's absolutely disgusting that on the same month that the sheriff is expecting the report and the release of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas commission that he authorizes and approves the expenditure of taxpayer money to buy fans like this to give out to community members throughout the churches. But what the community should do instead of taking these fans and cooling themselves off they should take the fans and fuel the flames to keep the heat against Sheriff Israel and make sure that Governor DeSantis removes Scott Israel from office.

So, I watched her remarks in their entirety last night and what I heard her saying was that she wanted us to be focusing on ICE and on the role of - that ICE had in the death of the child who was in custody on Christmas Day. And she was expressing a moral outrage that anyone in U.S. custody at the border would be in jeopardy of dying. She also said that, and I think this is appropriate for a Congressman to say that we should be exercising oversight and in holding any federal agency to account. So, I'm not sure I would read her comments the way perhaps you have. But there's a broader point here too, which is, again, we find ourselves -- it's a bit of a broken record, we find ourselves as a country debating immigration. There's a right way to do that. There's a wrong way to do that. The right way to do that is to open the government and allow for Democrats and Republicans come to the table and actually create a space where we can have a real debate and allow for a compromise and find a way forward. The wrong way to do that is unfortunately where are right now and that is at this impasse with the president holding federal employees and the families hostage."

And you know, the whole reason that Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer went out last night to deliver her remarks is because they're desperate to not only counter President Trump but to give a sort of reasonable response for their party. And of course, that gets completely undermine when you have somebody far more exciting and far more youthful and says quite frankly, crazy things like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez out there talking about how un-American ICE agents are. This is the kind of -- this is like really super fringe stuff that even Democrats still don't agree with. But honestly, the biggest problem I think remains that not necessarily Cortez's statements although all of that about ICE and about sanctuary cities really does undercut any reasonable argument that Democrats might make. But you know, if you just listen to what Nancy Pelosi she said the idea that she says that the wall is immoral and that the entire things are manufactured crisis by the president. Those are pretty outlandish things too. And so, I don't know which is harder to -- which of those Democratic talking points is the hardest for them to defend against --"

And look, the reality is this for these people and their families. This is not a game. There's a real cost to folks. It's about whether they can make their mortgage, whether they can for cash their food. I mean, I was reading stories this weekend. Most Americans don't have savings.
