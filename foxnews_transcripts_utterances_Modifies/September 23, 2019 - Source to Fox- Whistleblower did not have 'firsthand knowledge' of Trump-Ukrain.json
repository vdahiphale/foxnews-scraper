The president addressing that continuing controversy over the phone call with the president of Ukraine, whom he is supposed to sit down with, by the way, right in the middle of all this on Wednesday. This comes after that whistle-blower apparently had claimed that the president pressured Ukraine to investigate Vice President Joe Biden after his son Hunter's energy deal. Well, the Ukraine government is pushing back. They're saying that there was no such pressure at all. Democrats, though, pressing forward. And in response to that, the president was quite blunt.",

They have F-15s bought from us in the 1970s, before their current regime came to power in '79. So this could be a punch in the face like we delivered to Gadhafi in 1986.

Of course, this is an extension of a protest that began around the world last week, focused in Australia, first and foremost, but also in a lot of major cities in the United States, featuring young people, high schoolers allowed to leave school in certain cities with the permission, by the way, of school systems and their parents.

I mean, we're looking at -- we just had a conversation about how half of Saudi Arabia's oil was put offline, and our economy didn't suffer. That only can happen because of things that have happened in this country since then, the fracking miracle, which, by the way, allows these presidential candidates to crisscross the entire country. The other things that are going on in this world. So it's one thing to see these protesters. It's another thing to understand and even perhaps empathize with them.

According to the memo, McCabe took Rosenstein's offer to record the president so seriously that he ran the idea by his FBI investigative team - - quote -- \"As our conversation continued, the deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, or DAG, proposed that he could potentially wear a recording device into the Oval Office to collect additional evidence on the president's true intentions. \"He said he thought this might be possible because he wasn't searched when he entered the White House.

And, unfortunately, they have gotten away with a lot of it. If you look back over their history, not just the sort of three dozen-plus attacks they have done in this year, but starting with 1979, taking American diplomats hostage, killing 241 Marines in Beirut, kidnapping, torturing and killing U.S. officials, then blowing up the Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia, and killing hundreds, maybe thousands of Americans in Iraq in the last decade or so, they have gotten away with an awful lot. That's why I do think this is heading and needs to head to a military confrontation, but not one that we do by ourselves, which is what I think the president is working on in New York and beyond."

    {
      "speaker": "WHITON",

The Saudis have a decent air force, nearly 200 F-15s, about 100 other European-made fighters, the Emiratis close to 100 really decent fighter aircraft. The Iranians have junk. They have F-15s bought from us in the 1970s, before their current regime came to power in '79. So this could be a punch in the face like we delivered to Gadhafi in 1986.

Will the trade issues, like the tariffs and everything, which is going to be negative for our economy, no doubt, but does the stimulus from the tax cuts and the deregulation outweigh that, and how much? And that's what markets are sorting through right now. We just don't know.

However, because of fracking and ingenuity, American ingenuity, we don't have to worry about that so much. Yes, trade is an issue, but because Donald Trump cut taxes so much on corporations and some on individuals, because he's deregulated so much, that kind of balances that out.

It says, when there is a whistle-blower in the -- who has filed with the intelligence community, and the inspector general and Trump appointee has said it's urgent and credible, it shall be surrendered to the Gang of Eight.

But we do know that the military aid was held up to Iran (sic). And we do know, when the military aid was delivered, $140 million was also -- in cash -- was added to it, which was more than they even asked for or expected in the form of foreign aid.

And I got to tell you, the videos have been pretty impressive, except you have to wonder, exactly what are they going to get accomplished, other than stopping traffic, maybe some videos like this, a few very intriguing ones from earlier in the day? Of course, this is an extension of a protest that began around the world last week, focused in Australia, first and foremost, but also in a lot of major cities in the United States, featuring young people, high schoolers allowed to leave school in certain cities with the permission, by the way, of school systems and their parents. So it's taking on the sort of feel, right, that sort of '60s feel, where maybe peace, love and a good, happy climate. But, again, there are serious issues when it comes to this. I mean, we're looking at -- we just had a conversation about how half of Saudi Arabia's oil was put offline, and our economy didn't suffer. That only can happen because of things that have happened in this country since then, the fracking miracle, which, by the way, allows these presidential candidates to crisscross the entire country. The other things that are going on in this world. So it's one thing to see these protesters. It's another thing to understand and even perhaps empathize with them. But you wonder, who's articulating the other side of this message? Who's saying perhaps there won't be mass extinction in the next 12 years? We have lived through these sort of fear things before in the past, whether it was Malthusian, the world was going to run out of food and other things like that.

There's only one person who was getting over $50,000 a month on this billion-dollar bill. And that was Hunter Biden, not Donald Trump Jr. And there's only one person on Trump doing the bidding of the Ukrainian clients by Hunter -- that Hunter Biden was getting the money from. And that is Joe Biden. It's comical to me. But I just want to add one more thing. The Trump family has never enriched themselves off of their service to this country. Ivanka lost a shoe deal with Nordstrom. Trump lost -- Donald Trump lost Macy's. He doesn't even draw a salary as the president. He donates it back to the government. You can contrast that very well with the Bidens, who have gotten rich off of their service to the United States government."

I think one of the reasons that a lot of people are going to be skeptical about any of these deals, whether you believe it's a witch-hunt or not, is because the media has lost a lot of credibility reporting these and maybe even fanning the flames of some that have not really proven anything."

I think the most that we can say is that it looks bad that Hunter Biden was on the board of this company. But Joe -- there were reasons. Joe Biden supported the ouster of this Ukrainian prosecutor because he was -- because of the corruption allegations against this prosecutor. Now, the problem is that, of course, we don't know what we don't know. That's always the case, right? But the problem is that, yes, we live in this world where people tend to believe what they want to believe, based on their political party. So I think that this will come down to, the president -- if you're a president -- a supporter of President Trump, you will believe him."

There's no credible evidence that the vice president acted with any kind of impropriety. And it's not going to hurt Biden one bit. The thing that's going to hurt Biden is the senator from Massachusetts. And that's the only thing he should really be worried about right now. I think, if anything, because his base is anti-Trump, this may actually help him. This may actually bolster him amongst people who really want to see this president gone in 2020."

Judicial Watch has obtained this lightly redacted two-page memo from former FBI acting and Deputy Director Andrew McCabe that memorialized a May 2017 conversation with then Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. The timing here matters, because the special counsel, Robert Mueller, was appointed the following day. Written on May 16, 2017, McCabe describes his decision to open a obstruction of justice and conspiracy investigation into President Trump for firing FBI Director James Comey and related matters. According to the memo, McCabe took Rosenstein's offer to record the president so seriously that he ran the idea by his FBI investigative team - - quote -- \"As our conversation continued, the deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, or DAG, proposed that he could potentially wear a recording device into the Oval Office to collect additional evidence on the president's true intentions. \"He said he thought this might be possible because he wasn't searched when he entered the White House.
