And the reality is, Bret, if you don't have an answer, you say you don't have an answer and you say you will get an answer as soon as you can and return with that when you do.

We had a decade of that assault weapons ban from the mid-1990s, it lasted for a decade, and if you look at the studies had no appreciable influence on gun violence or the lethality of individual attacks. And there are three elements here. Again, it's the shooter, it's the weapon, it's the environment. And all that liberals and mainstream media want to look at, of course, is the weapon. But there are other ways of looking at this. If you look at the shooter himself and the mental health issue, the fact that you cannot get a commitment on these kinds of people, I'm thinking most of Jared Loughner, the shooter in Tucson, Arizona. Everybody knew he was a grenade about to go off. Anybody who knew him, was in class with him, said that. But you could only stop him after he killed. And we have moved so radically the last 50 years to making it difficult to commit people who are dangerous that there has to be a shift in the other direction. So that has to be on the table.",

But, again, to my point with Morgan, is this a different dynamic now that you are seeing develop in Washington? JEFF MASON, WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, \"REUTERS\": Well, Bret, you asked, or mentioned Sandy Hook. It certainly felt like there was a different dynamic then, and that was roughly 10 years ago. I remember President Obama's emotional speech at the service or the tribute to those children. And the Democrats really coalescing around effective, for what they viewed as effective gun control measures. And then they didn't get what they wanted. And this has been another awful, awful school shooting. It leads to conversations, it's leading to, as we were just discussing, conversations between Republicans and Democrats. So, yes, there is a sense that maybe something different or new will happen this time.
