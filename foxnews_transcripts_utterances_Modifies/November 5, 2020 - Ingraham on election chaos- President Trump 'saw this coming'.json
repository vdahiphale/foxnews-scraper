Well, one GOP leader has been out and front in defending the president as the election still hangs in the balance Florida Governor Ron DeSantis is here and he is going to tell us why?  Also, \"The Angle\" is going to speak to two folks who experienced suspicious activity from poll workers in two swing states their stories in moments.  The unexpectedly strong result for House Republicans has the Dems pointing fingers tonight. Minority leader Kevin McCarthy is here on Nancy Pelosi's diminished standing. But first, why we fight? That's the focus of tonight \"Angle.\"  We are the United States of America the country that has developed the most advanced technology in the world. Like from a laboratory in Texas, we can control the mars rover. That's 145 million miles away driving around you can drive it around mars. But you're telling me that we can't count votes in a timely fashion? Now some of you are wondering whether it is worth it for the Trump Campaign to launch legal battles in states like Pennsylvania, Michigan, Georgia and Nevada.  After all courts are generally, they're reluctant to interview in state vote counts and then Democrat run states always seem to be able to find new batches of votes to swamp any Republican advantage anyway. So what is it going to achieve? Won't law suits just delay the inevitable? Is it not time to just move on, lick our wounds and regroup? Well, that's exactly what the Democrats are hoping for, oh, and Mitt Romney. That we just move on and have the same process repeated itself every election but my friends that would be a huge disservice not only to Trump supporters but to our entire system of government. Mail-in ballots have been a concern from day one. I raise this issue with Vice President Pence months ago.",

In other words we should ensure that every legal vote counts to be specific and correct. Every improper vote cancels out illegal votes on the other side. That must never be allowed to happen.

The fact is, right now, almost all of us who voted for President Trump, around what it is 70 million Americans or so, we have real concerns about this mail-in voting. How this vote is being conducted? We don't trust the people counting the votes, I'm sorry, there's good reason not to trust them.

So spare me, Mr. Vice President, conservatives don't rush into the streets to fight, we are simply asking for impartial review of what's happening.  Frankly, that's our right; frankly it is our duty when we have hundreds of thousands of ballots dumped in key states in batches after election night. President Trump received more votes than any Republican Presidential Candidate in history. He attracted the highest turnout among nonwhite voters in 60 years. He was able to do this not because he gave in and gave up when the going got tough, but because he knew how to fight for first principle? It is about time we had a Republican who knew how to fight. He stood up for working-class Americans instead of selling them out to multi-national interests. Now it's our turn to stand up for him. Conservative and GOP leaders need to rally to his side it's beginning to happen and I'm glad to see.   The American people need to make their voices heard as well. It's not just the future of one party that is at stake, but the future of a republic.

So, the Election Integrity Fund offered training and I said I really need to see this firsthand. So after voting in my local precinct, I drove a little less than two hours to downtown Detroit, parked my car, got my certification, went in and registered and got on the electoral - polling processing floor. What I saw there at first looked very orderly and conventional. Then as I look more closely I saw all the anomalies I saw the problems. I saw in a room that the size of maybe two or three football fields it might be as large as 100,000 square feet, an adequate number of people to witness what was going on in the adjudication of questionable ballots in which there were many thousands.  And there weren't enough people which is required by Michigan election law, one from each major party to be there for witnessing and signing off on the duplication process.

So that comes from their own website. So when we showed up to polling stations, they only gave us sharpie markers. I specifically said I do not want to use a sharpie marker do you have a regular pen? She said no I only have a sharpie marker, use it you're going to be fine.  I said what if it bleeds through to the other side, she said don't worry about it we've been doing it all day it's not a big deal. So we went ahead and used sharpie markers, you run it through the machine at the end when you get done voting you run it through the machine at the end.  And then what happens in Arizona is you can go to this website to track your ballot. From what I have seen and it's not just me, it's like - I have groups of neighbors and friends as well, this has happen to but what happens is now when you go to check our ballots, it says that it is - like for me personally it says I'm not even a registered voter now.

Now those ballots have since been returned but it just shows you how vulnerable mail-in voting is to be tampered with? If that doesn't convince you, check out what's happening in Nevada.

In other words we should ensure that every legal vote counts to be specific and correct. Every improper vote cancels out illegal votes on the other side. That must never be allowed to happen. We need to make certain that most Americans, at least most of them, believe elections are won or lost in this country fair and square. The fact is, right now, almost all of us who voted for President Trump, around what it is 70 million Americans or so, we have real concerns about this mail-in voting. How this vote is being conducted? We don't trust the people counting the votes, I'm sorry, there's good reason not to trust them. And a lot of Americans don't trust the local officials overseeing the process. They certainly don't trust the media reporting on it, my goodness, given what we have seen.

So spare me, Mr. Vice President, conservatives don't rush into the streets to fight, we are simply asking for impartial review of what's happening. Frankly, that's our right; frankly it is our duty when we have hundreds of thousands of ballots dumped in key states in batches after election night. President Trump received more votes than any Republican Presidential Candidate in history. He attracted the highest turnout among nonwhite voters in 60 years. He was able to do this not because he gave in and gave up when the going got tough, but because he knew how to fight for first principle? It is about time we had a Republican who knew how to fight. He stood up for working-class Americans instead of selling them out to multi-national interests. Now it's our turn to stand up for him. Conservative and GOP leaders need to rally to his side it's beginning to happen and I'm glad to see. The American people need to make their voices heard as well. It's not just the future of one party that is at stake, but the future of a republic. And that's the \"Angle.\" My next guest both claims of witnessed some pretty sketchy behavior at polling locations in their stats. Joining me now is Gordon Pennington, poll watcher in Michigan and Angela Tahiliani, voter and resident in Maricopa County.

So, the Election Integrity Fund offered training and I said I really need to see this firsthand. So after voting in my local precinct, I drove a little less than two hours to downtown Detroit, parked my car, got my certification, went in and registered and got on the electoral - polling processing floor. What I saw there at first looked very orderly and conventional. Then as I look more closely I saw all the anomalies I saw the problems. I saw in a room that the size of maybe two or three football fields it might be as large as 100,000 square feet, an adequate number of people to witness what was going on in the adjudication of questionable ballots in which there were many thousands. And there weren't enough people which is required by Michigan election law, one from each major party to be there for witnessing and signing off on the duplication process. Well, there were many times where this process went on, the duplication process, went on without anybody being there to witness this.

There should be done in a way that's not permanent and cannot be fraudulently applied. But think of the thousands and thousands and thousands.

On the Democrats own website here in Arizona, they actually say do not use red ink or permanent marker because this may result in a false read by the ballot machines. So that comes from their own website. So when we showed up to polling stations, they only gave us sharpie markers. I specifically said I do not want to use a sharpie marker do you have a regular pen? She said no I only have a sharpie marker, use it you're going to be fine. I said what if it bleeds through to the other side, she said don't worry about it we've been doing it all day it's not a big deal. So we went ahead and used sharpie markers, you run it through the machine at the end when you get done voting you run it through the machine at the end. And then what happens in Arizona is you can go to this website to track your ballot. From what I have seen and it's not just me, it's like - I have groups of neighbors and friends as well, this has happen to but what happens is now when you go to check our ballots, it says that it is - like for me personally it says I'm not even a registered voter now.

And we understand that Democrats were given actual pens. The other writing instruments that are allowed under the state law that just seems really bizarre, I mean, is it a coincidence? I guess it can be all. All of this could be a coincidence, but I'm glad - I mean, I'm glad rather Gordon, on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being most corrupt, how would you rate your polling stations?"

It was the rule of law and equality before the law that helped us achieve that success. I've never seen such open defiance of court orders in the law since George Wallace stood in the schoolhouse door. We have to look closely at Philadelphia right now. The Trump Campaign obtained a court order allowing people as the law allows watching the counting process. The counting process should be transparent. It should be open to all Americans to see how their ballots are counted in tally. They have defied that court order. They are still refusing to allow Republicans to gain access to see how the count is going? We have a prosecutor in Philadelphia who has threatened the president with jail if he shows up there. We have in the county next door; we have a prosecutor who threatened to arrest the person who was hired to put the video cameras above the drop boxes, which is required by law by the way, so that we make sure people aren't shuffling multiple ballots into the drop boxes."

I know you've talked about a number of suits and I think some of those have promised. But I would also tell them, especially if you're in the states that have Republican legislatures like Pennsylvania and Michigan and all these places call your state representatives and your state Senators. Under article two of the constitution, presidential electors are done by legislatures and the schemes they create and the framework.

Places like Pennsylvania, they can accept ballots after the election and it doesn't even have to have a postmark on it and they can still accept them. So a lot of these places don't know how many ballots are out there? And as you mentioned, you will get like a 4:00 am dump of massive votes for one candidate and almost none for the other. And people look at that and they just scratch their head. So people need to have confidence in the process. And I think the way it's been done in a lot of these states has been incredibly chaotic.

That's a very dynamic concept, and it's just starting to pay dividends, because people see that race is really incidental to who we are. It's not essential. Trump, of all people, taught America that, and that's why they hate him so much. And this idea that all these Republican people are going to come back on the ashes -- there's no ashes of the Republican Party. It did very well. Trump was not an anchor. He was a buoy to all the down ballot candidates. And the idea they're going to come back and reconstruct it like a phoenix rising, it's not going to happen.

Nobody should be talking about socialism,\" adding that if Democrats kept up their tactics in 2022, \"We will get f-ing torn apart.\" Joining me now is House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. Congressman, that's all well and good for Ms. Spanberger to be saying on a conference call, but how many of them are willing to take on the squad in public, in the media, like on this show?"

      "utterance": "None of them. They're all afraid because they will be primaried and they'll lose. But what's very interesting here, it shows more of the fraud. Not one Republican incumbent loss. We've won eight seats and we're ahead in 10 more. How would President Trump lose in an atmosphere like that? How is it possible that someone could claim that Joe Biden would win, and not one Republican member of Congress lost reelection, but almost 15 Democrats did? And you know what's interesting happening, we're watching this go before our very eyes. Why is it in these major states that the big cities stopped counting until all the rural votes come in, until they know how many more they need? On my way here tonight, we're ahead in a seat in Iowa two by a little less than 300 votes. I don't have all the facts, but I was just reported that they allowed a little over 300 people to revote, and now we're behind."

      "utterance": "Why would all those people vote -- yes, I don't have all the facts. Our attorneys are rushing there. But this is what is transforming out across America. And what's interesting to me, I just spent four years listening to the Democrats making false claims about voter infusion into the last election. It's happening before our very eyes, and they are staying silent. Even down to the city council rates, they allow people to observe the vote. They allow people inside."

      "utterance": "We have huge amounts of money from Mark Zuckerberg and George Soros and others flooding into everything to local D.A. races to even school board in in some cases. And then canvassing states like Pennsylvania and these other efforts, and I think that had a huge effect on this. But Congressman, the Republicans are watching. I mean, the voters, they're watching how Republican leadership handle this. And I didn't like the silence I was hearing from the people until tonight, basically, when I heard more people starting to speak out. I know you've been speaking out, but Republicans better remember who helped expand this party. It wasn't some of the moderates. It was Donald Trump, and they better stand and fight for him and our process."

      "utterance": "This is Donald Trump, and I'll make you this promise. The House Republicans are not standing back. They are out across the countries in these facilities making sure. And I will tell you, listen to this little fact. Every Democrat that lost right now, lost to a woman, a minority, or a veteran Republican. This president has expanded this party large and then we have ever. We'll have more women in the Republican House than in the history of America. We'll have more minorities. And it was President Trump who expanded it. This is what's moving forward. And I will tell you this. Republicans will not back down. We will not wait to four years from now to change this. We are going to fight this now, and we're going to change it. For them to claim that Arizona won -- at the end of the day, the president will carry Arizona. He will win Pennsylvania, and that will be more than 270 electoral votes. And every American should stand up. Whatever they see, go to Team Trump on Twitter and tell us if they see something that's incorrect out there."

Unless a court steps in, I don't see Pennsylvania going in the right direction at all. This thing is getting sliced and diced. Congressman Jim Clyburn, by the way, Congressman McCarthy, is in total denial about his party. Watch."

We cannot allow this to happen before our very eyes. We need to unite together. And you don't need to be a Republican. If you believe every legal vote needs to count, you believe in the American process, join together and let's stop this."

And still ahead, what's the real reason the polling didn't get any better between 2016 and 2020? Was it because pollsters wanted to effect rather than reflect the election results? One of the few accurate pollsters this year will explain next."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "It's obvious by now the pollsters learned nothing between 2016 and 2020, but then again, maybe they're just not interested in projecting elections, but affecting them. Joining me now is Robert Cahaly, he's the chief pollster for Trafalgar. Robert, you say the pollsters have basically just given up on their true mission. Why is that?"

      "speaker": "ROBERT CAHALY, CHIEF POLLSTER, TRAFALGAR GROUP",

      "speaker": "CAHALY",
      "utterance": "The new mission seems to be to try to affect the entire election, from the beginning of the summer when so many of these crazy Senate race polls show them all tight and enabled all this corporate money to flow in the doors. There were so many undecideds or would have naturally been at that point in the election, these were unreasonable polls. But they were literally designed to drive donations so that these war chests would be very big. The people who ought to be most upset ought to be the donors who gave all this money to races that were unwinnable."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",

Robert, and if you were told over the summer that Trump's party way to gain House seats and hold the Senate, what would you have projected the election results to have been on the presidential level?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAHALY",
      "utterance": "I would have told you that means he's going to win big. And if I would have told people that that's what's going to happen, I would have been ridiculed just as much as when I said there were shy Trump voters and corruption in Philadelphia."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "How did he lose when the House races and the Senate races came out as they did? It's a question that was just raised by Kevin McCarthy. Monmouth University pollster Patrick Murray found a really pathetic excuse for shoddy polling. He told the times it's possible \"that Republicans' efforts to prevent certain populations from voting easily had a sizable impact, a factor the pollsters knew would be immeasurable in their surveys. We will never know how many ballots were not delivered by the post office.\" Robert, what about that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAHALY",
      "utterance": "So wait a minute, QAnon is mainstream, but this isn't a bridge too far? Come on. First of all, I cannot even conceive a conspiracy with the post office, and if there was one, do you think it would to help the Republicans?"

      "speaker": "CAHALY",
      "utterance": "Because if you won't tell the truth on the phone, you're never going to tell the truth to some kid with an iPad or a notepad. It's not reasonable. Shy voters are shy for the reason. They're certainly not going to face the ridicule for saying it to a person standing in front of them."
