In the last few weeks, notwithstanding some ill-advised tweets about Adam Schiff's name and retired Navy Admiral William McRaven, President Trump seems to be projecting a different dimension of himself. Understanding now that he has the Democrat house and he has to contend with that, might President Trump be trying a new approach to governance? Should he?   Will this change minds grow support for his economic agenda? It's clearly working. But beyond all of that, wouldn't it be good for the country? I get the sense may be you do to that Americans have undoubtedly grown weary of how politics has infected so much of our daily lives. Not that it's not important, it obviously is or I wouldn't be doing this every night. But it's not everything. And it shouldn't be a blood sport every single day. The president doesn't need to swing at every pitch. Nor does he need to respond to every unfair criticism no matter how vile it is. Not even when it comes from self-absorbed media figures.  Now this Thursday is supposed to be a time when we all gather around the table to give thanks. Not to get stuffing thrown at us by cousin Helen or Uncle Joe who is in a white rage about the president's views on climate change or something.  And may be, just may be, the president has decided to modestly recalibrate his approach to his job and find places where both parties can agree even as the critics persist. Now, believe me, I am not saying he should change his goals on core issues like trade or immigration. He is doing great on both. But he could be changing how he pursues them. I think the president needs more happy, not more anxious, voters going into 2020. A recent Morning Consult poll showed that 64 percent of voters believe the media have divided the country while 56 percent, not an insignificant number, blame the president. Now, it's not surprising that nearly two-thirds of Americans blame the press given how biased and how completely unbalanced most of them are, and they have been towards this president since the beginning.",

Democrats can engage with the White House and show independence at the same time.\" Apparently not. The left's new strategy is to completely deny that Trump has accomplished anything positive and to deny him any cooperation even on issues where they agree. Now, how sick is that?

By the way, for all you looking like to the Obama presidency through these rose-colored glasses today, this is what the country felt about the state of America six years into Obama's presidency.

And just because haters on the left are going to ridicule him or belittle the president's efforts, it's no reason for the president to back off. His trip to California, prison reform, his work to lift the standard of living of minority communities, it's all positive signs.  There are those who will work overtime to deflect and demean any efforts by this president to broaden his appeal. And most importantly, to broaden the appeal of his policies that, again, are working. I say let the critics do what the critics are going to do. This will make them look petty and just pure partisan. Reagan appealed to women and minorities by smiling through the storm, always keeping the focus on the lives of everyday Americans. Trump calls them the forgotten people, their families, their jobs, their neighborhoods, their faith. By taking the focus off himself and keeping it on the horizon of possibility, the president will unmask the real dividers and give voters more of what they are hungering for: unity through strength. And that's the \"Angle.\"  Here now, Matt Schlapp, chairman of the American Conservative Union, Candace Owens, communications director for Turning Points USA and Chris Hahn, former aide to Senator Chuck Schumer. Matt Schlapp, let's start with you. I think the president has shown frankly often times enormous restraint, given how radical the left has become and how much they resist giving any credit or any pretense even of wanting to work with him on issues, even an issue as powerful as criminal justice reform.",

And I think you're righ. I think he's got to take it all and understand that the American people love his agenda. They want him to push hard. And I think he would do the country a lot of good if his leadership could also include the fact, look, Nancy Pelosi or another Democrat most likely will be leading the Democrats in the House.  They are going to be the majority party. Let's work on infrastructure. Let's work on China as a national security foe and let's get criminal justice reform passed.

There are two things that are ludicrous on its face in her remarks about, well, if you voted for Donald Trump, particularly if you are a white woman, that somehow makes you a racist. The first, Laura, is that it's the presumption Donald Trump himself is a racist, which clearly he is not.  That it's all part of this massive defamation effort launched against this president from day one, and only fools believe that. The second part of this is, if you voted for him, you are a racist. By that logic, Laura, if you voted for Mrs. Clinton, you are a liar and law breaker.

In the last few weeks, notwithstanding some ill-advised tweets about Adam Schiff's name and retired Navy Admiral William McRaven, President Trump seems to be projecting a different dimension of himself. Understanding now that he has the Democrat house and he has to contend with that, might President Trump be trying a new approach to governance? Should he? Will this change minds grow support for his economic agenda? It's clearly working. But beyond all of that, wouldn't it be good for the country? I get the sense may be you do to that Americans have undoubtedly grown weary of how politics has infected so much of our daily lives. Not that it's not important, it obviously is or I wouldn't be doing this every night. But it's not everything. And it shouldn't be a blood sport every single day. The president doesn't need to swing at every pitch. Nor does he need to respond to every unfair criticism no matter how vile it is. Not even when it comes from self-absorbed media figures. Now this Thursday is supposed to be a time when we all gather around the table to give thanks. Not to get stuffing thrown at us by cousin Helen or Uncle Joe who is in a white rage about the president's views on climate change or something. And may be, just may be, the president has decided to modestly recalibrate his approach to his job and find places where both parties can agree even as the critics persist. Now, believe me, I am not saying he should change his goals on core issues like trade or immigration. He is doing great on both. But he could be changing how he pursues them. I think the president needs more happy, not more anxious, voters going into 2020. A recent Morning Consult poll showed that 64 percent of voters believe the media have divided the country while 56 percent, not an insignificant number, blame the president. Now, it's not surprising that nearly two-thirds of Americans blame the press given how biased and how completely unbalanced most of them are, and they have been towards this president since the beginning."

You know, others might have responded to the political stonewalling by the Democrats with a \"to hell with the whole bipartisan thing.\" But not Trump.

Today, the Star-Ledger wrote the following, \"Booker, who has made a huge issue about justice reform, should have gone to the White House and showed bipartisanship. Democrats can engage with the White House and show independence at the same time.\" Apparently not. The left's new strategy is to completely deny that Trump has accomplished anything positive and to deny him any cooperation even on issues where they agree. Now, how sick is that? Only a few fair-minded liberals like CNN's Van Jones who worked with the White House, including Jared Kushner, on this bill, actually celebrated the accomplishment."

Michael Harriet at \"The Root\" saying no, Van Jones, I do not have to give the racist-in-chief his due. So much for common cause. By the way, for all you looking like to the Obama presidency through these rose-colored glasses today, this is what the country felt about the state of America six years into Obama's presidency. Fifty-five percent said Obama had done more to divide than unite the country. Well? Now, this is something the president at the time said he had to admit when he gave his final state of the union address."

And we should celebrate though the president because he is trying to reach across the aisle. Criminal justice reform is just one of the examples. And just because haters on the left are going to ridicule him or belittle the president's efforts, it's no reason for the president to back off. His trip to California, prison reform, his work to lift the standard of living of minority communities, it's all positive signs. There are those who will work overtime to deflect and demean any efforts by this president to broaden his appeal. And most importantly, to broaden the appeal of his policies that, again, are working. I say let the critics do what the critics are going to do. This will make them look petty and just pure partisan."

And I think you're righ. I think he's got to take it all and understand that the American people love his agenda. They want him to push hard. And I think he would do the country a lot of good if his leadership could also include the fact, look, Nancy Pelosi or another Democrat most likely will be leading the Democrats in the House. They are going to be the majority party. Let's work on infrastructure. Let's work on China as a national security foe and let's get criminal justice reform passed.

I think that the president should do more to reach across the aisle. I met the president before he was president. I found him very engaging and very charming. And I think that if he engaged more and didn't like, you say, swing at every pitch thrown at him, I think he could do better and I think he would do better as president. I think he'd get more accomplished. I think this criminal justice reform measure that he passed, I will be one of the progressives that say that's a great thing. I think it's great for our country.

But he should because he's exposing the people that have in fact been at the helm of all of this divisive rhetoric in this country. In many ways, I think that history will favor the president. They will show the reason that he won, is because he was serving a united message. This is a message that the politicians perhaps don't understand, that the swamp does not understand, that perhaps the Hollywood elite does not understand. But the American people do. We understand exactly what he's doing and that's why we support him and that's why he is in the White House today."

There's no reason enough to do that. I'm not going to harp on it, but that's the kind of -- it detracts from all the progress, economic progress and the stuff he's doing that is good stuff. There's no reason for it. I know it's tempting and we all get in that mode, I mean, I have done it too, but I don't think there's any -- he's not advancing his own cause into the areas of the country, among women, among minorities, in my view, on that, but you know, maybe people have a different view."

I think what you're saying here, opening in your anger is look, when the president is the commander-in-chief, when the president is our leader and he goes to California and consoles people who are having devastation, everyone in America is rooting him on.

An illuminating piece in \"Politico\" today points out how identity politics have come to dominate the party's new power structure, writing \"White and nonwhite Democratic hopefuls are shrugging off warnings that embracing so-called identity politics could distract from the party's economic message and push white voters further into Donald Trump's arms.\" Joining us now, Dr. Carol Swain, is a former professor of political science at Vanderbilt University Law School and civil rights attorney Leo Terrell.

The Democrats welcome his identity politics and they are intersecting race, identity and social issues such as criminal justice. They are challenging whites to join up because Trump has alienated every base in this country. I've been watching your show. You see it, Laura. You have been trying to send Trump a message. He plays identity politics and the Democrats are seizing on it. Final point, Orange County, also known as Reagan country, is now all blue, Laura Ingraham. Orange County, California. All blue.

You know that as well as I do, but Carol, you have been very vocal especially on social media discussing why you think African-Americans need to maybe in some cases look a second time at Donald Trump because of what he's done just on the issue of the economy, with black people and helping minorities have a better standard of living."

Kirsten isn't the only pundit making this claim, but she might be the most surprising given some of her past work. Your thoughts? MONICA CROWLEY, COLUMNIST, \"THE WASHINGTON TIMES\": I have known Kirsten for years and I like and respect her very much. But I'm incredibly disappointed in her remarks here. She seems to have dutifully submitted to CNN and its insane, dishonest agenda. There are two things that are ludicrous on its face in her remarks about, well, if you voted for Donald Trump, particularly if you are a white woman, that somehow makes you a racist. The first, Laura, is that it's the presumption Donald Trump himself is a racist, which clearly he is not.  That it's all part of this massive defamation effort launched against this president from day one, and only fools believe that. The second part of this is, if you voted for him, you are a racist. By that logic, Laura, if you voted for Mrs. Clinton, you are a liar and law breaker. If you voted for Donald Trump, you are a racist, or a rapist. It is patently absurd. And it doesn't follow any logic whatsoever. I'm just very disappointed."

To say that women who voted for Trump are racist, she also said they are oppressed because they are part of a patriarchy. Then she said they benefit from the patriarchy.

What I will say is that I think those women who voted for Trump where he's been accused of racism, I think they don't care if he is because it does not impact their everyday lives. Taking race out of this, not talking about white women but talking about women in general that voted for Trump, it surprises me not because of their race. It surprises me because of the misogynistic comments that have come from Trump, and yet he has still been able to have some sort of support from white women or women in general. So that's the big thing to me. I'm not really sure why Kirsten made these comments because, quite frankly, this is a system she has benefited from as a white woman."

      "utterance": "Liberals didn't care about any of this after Bill Clinton, right? He became a global brand after being impeached. I just watched that A&E special on the Clintons. It was like a flashback for all of us who were covering it at the time. That wasn't really a concern back then that women can't support Bill Clinton because look what he did. Women disagree, and they disagree on these issues. Monica, close it out."

      "utterance": "Feminism was supposed to be about women having the ability to do what they wanted and think the way they wanted. And I voted for Donald Trump. I am not a racist. I voted for Trump because of economic issues, trade, exiting the Iran deal, renegotiating NAFTA, and so on, and a pro- Israel stance. That's why I voted for him."

      "utterance": "It's time for the last bite. This might have been the craziest high school football game of all time in Washington, D.C. Last night, Catholic rivals Gonzaga and DeMatha were facing off for the league crown. Gonzaga found itself down 20 to zero early on. It fought all the way back to take the lead with 30 seconds left. So it was over, right? DeMatha took the ensuing kickoff all the way back for a touchdown with 15 seconds left. Was it over again? Watch what happens."

The Our Father then you see -- they needed to do the Hail Mary, full of grace then -- all right. Congrats to the Purple Eagles. That's all the time we have tonight.
