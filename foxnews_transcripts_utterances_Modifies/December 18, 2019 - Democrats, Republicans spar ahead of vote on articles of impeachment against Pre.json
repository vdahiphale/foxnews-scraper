      "utterance": "Hello, I'm Dana Perino, along with Katie Pavlich, Juan Williams, Jesse Watters, and Greg Gutfeld. Bet you're glad to see us. It's 5 o'clock in New York City and this is \"The Five.\" A historic day in American history. You're looking live at the White, at the House floor -- excuse me -- as lawmakers get ready to vote on the impeachment of President Donald Trump. The debate raging for hours over the articles against the president, and it's all leading to an eventual vote later tonight. Speaker Nancy Pelosi trying to make the case for Democrats earlier."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Speaker Nancy Pelosi",
      "utterance": "Very sadly now, our founders’ vision of a republic is under threat from actions from the White House. That is why today, as speaker of the House, I solemnly and sadly open the debate on the impeachment of the President of the United States. It is tragic that the president's reckless actions make impeachment necessary. He gave us no choice. The president is an ongoing threat to our national security and the integrity of our elections, the basis of our democracy."

      "speaker": "Rep. Doug Collins",
      "utterance": "From the very moment that the majority party in this House won, the inevitability that we would be here today was only a matter of what date they would schedule it, nothing else. In fact, how it even began to even look even further was on September 24th, the speaker announced an impeachment inquiry before even seeing the call transcript that we're going to hear so much about today. The clock and the calendar are terrible masters. They do not care about anything except getting the time done and the calendar fixed. They do not care about facts, they do not care about time, and one day the clock and the calendar will hang along this body in a very detrimental way."
    },

      "utterance": "This is all happening while President Trump is gearing up for a rally tonight in Michigan, and the president ripping into Democrats on Twitter, saying, \"Such and the rest of lies by the radical left, do nothing Democrats. This is an assault on America and an assault on the Republican Party,\" with four exclamation points, Jesse. Four of them, that is a lot. What do you think about the Democrats all saying they're very sad and solemn?"

      "speaker": "Jesse Watters, co-host",
      "utterance": "They're not sad. The \"Squad\" was saying impeach the M.F.er [sic] and everyone was cheering about a year ago. And this isn't a solemn day, they love it. The saddest part is they're mad because the polls turned against them. We'll get to that in a second, Juan."

And the Democrats talking about they're doing this for the flag? They burn flags. They kneel when the flags go up. And they're talking about the Constitution? When have we ever heard Democrats strictly adhering to the Constitution? Never. The whole thing is fake, we knew it a long time ago. And that's why, as the Q poll, the CNN poll, the USA Today poll, the NPR poll, the IBD, Monmouth, and Gallup all have impeachment underwater, Juan."

The country -- when this began back in September, is when we saw the Democrats in specific, and much of the country suddenly vaulted to close to half of the country saying, based on what they know, the evidence that had been presented, this man should be removed from office, he has abused the power. And in terms of his approval numbers that you said were up like six points [unintelligible] again, he's not, he's in the mid-40's. Mid-40's. He has never hit 50 percent. And even in terms of impeachment, remember -- I keep saying this -- Bill Clinton, when he was impeached, he was popular. He was like 60 percent approval rating and the demand for his impeachment was like at 29 percent. To the contrary with Donald Trump, it's half the country and his approval numbers are under 50 percent."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Dana Perino",
      "utterance": "Okay. But the number that President Trump is at now is the same, it's the same level that President Obama had at this point in his reelection effort. Would you like to hear from Al Green?"

      "utterance": "Okay."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Greg Gutfeld",
      "utterance": "Trump is not going anywhere. That is why Pelosi is so somber, because she knows she handed Schumer an FBOS, a flaming bag of Schiff. And the more somber the tones are in the media and the Dems -- which, by the way, matches perfectly. Did you notice how CNN and the Dems are exactly the same somber tones. They match, they're exactly the same. They're on the same team. But the more somber they are, the bigger the joke they play on themselves. I don't want to criticize you, Dana, because I know you didn't write that word \"historic,\" but it's -- what they want you to believe is that this is historic, right? They keep saying, \"Oh, this is historic. This is historic.\" Yes, maybe it's historic, but not for the reasons that you think. It's historic because it's the first, the first impeachment that is based on future actions. They couldn't find the crime, so now they're saying, \"You've got to get him out of office in case Trump commits a crime.\" Okay, so now it's \"Minority Report,\" the Tom Cruise movie. Second, the media's never going to be the same. This is historical, and that's awesome, because this whole process in the last three years has pulled back the curtain. And we see the media's arrogance, their elitism, their bias altogether, all the lies that they portray as fact. And so, when Trump when correctly diagnosed fake news as enemy of the people, now you're seeing it unfold. And this is what's driving them crazy because it's not going to happen. Trump's going to remain president. He's going to probably be reelected using the very tools that these people thought they could use against him."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "Rep. Chris Stewart",
      "utterance": "If this impeachment is successful, the next president, I promise you, is going to be impeached, and the next president after that. If you set this bar as being impeachable, every president in our future will be impeached. It erodes our republic in ways that our founding fathers recognized. They got it right: High crimes and misdemeanors; other than that, settle it at the ballot box. I look forward to that day."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "Katie Pavlich, guest co-host",
      "utterance": "Yeah. I mean, Democrats always claim that they are doing this for the country, that they're doing this to protect democracy, as Pelosi said, to uphold the republic. But they're actually thinking very short term, and this entire process has shown that they are complete hypocrites when it comes to that line, that narrative that they take. This is about protecting the vote of the American people. Democrats only care about democracy when they win. But when there is a Republican who wins, they protest. There are lots of protestors out all across the country today. They want to impeach the president, now they're doing it. This is like the fourth time they've tried to do this, so let's go back and remember what they tried to impeach him for earlier. Al Green, for example. They tried to impeach him for criticizing people in the NFL who kneeled for the flag. Okay. Nancy Pelosi, today, seems like, you know, that the national anthem is like a good thing to now be revering as she's trying to win this fight. They tried to impeach him for going after the \"Squad.\" They tried to impeach him for saying bad things about third-world countries. So, we've been through this before. They've lost all credibility, especially in light of the Russia case, putting all of their sticks in Robert Mueller, and now trying to put all of this in front of the American people with no clear, compelling evidence, as Will Hurd has said all along. And again, you know, you can look at this say, \"Maybe the call wasn't perfect,\" as the president's arguing, but we shouldn't be impeaching him. And I find it interesting that Tulsi Gabbard, as we look ahead -- there's a debate tomorrow. She's supposed to be voting today. She didn't show up for the vote. And she said that she's going to introduce a censure instead of voting for impeachment, and that's okay."

      "speaker": "Rep. Al Green",
      "utterance": "If this president is allowed to thwart the efforts of Congress with a legitimate impeachment inquiry, the president will not only be above the law, he will be beyond justice. We cannot allow any person to be beyond justice in this country. In the name of democracy, on behalf of the Republic, and for the sake of the many who are suffering, I will vote to impeach, and I encourage my colleagues to do so as well."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Greg Gutfeld",
      "utterance": "If he had a legitimate case, why would he need to show up with a giant photo of a little girl that had nothing to do with impeachment and was also part of a debunked story about separation? If he was purely confident that he had a case, he wouldn't have needed to lie to America, which he has been for quite a while."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Jesse Watters",
      "utterance": "I think the rage just got the best of the Democrats. If we remember, there were Democrats who refused to certify the election results. There were Democrats who boycotted the inauguration. This campaign of the president was spied on. They hatched a partisan witch hunt, accused him of being a traitor to the country, of working with the Russians. That was all a hoax and the day that hoax evaporated with Mueller's testimony bombing, they concoct this other fake whistleblower story and Juan said something very interesting about the polls where they were when this whole thing started in September. I agree the polls were against the president then but as more people read the transcript and as more people heard what the Democrats case was, those polls turned right upside down."

But I think that when the president talks about due process and fairness from Republicans, talk about it every day, Americans can relate directly to that. They don't want to be falsely accused of a crime of doing something that they did not do or being removed from a position simply because people don't like them or have a disagreement with their policies. And that is where I think Democrats are severely underestimating the blowback of this next year. And also, you know, if Democrats really had a solid argument on this, there wouldn't be Democrats changing their party to Republican and there wouldn't be more defections today after all of the evidence for that has been presented for Democrats to vote against impeachment."

What seems to be an injury actually turns into like a badge of honor. It's like this is going to help galvanize his base. He's probably going to win reelection because it is such a fraud that now he's like yeah. I'm not only am I going to be impeached, but I'm going to be the first reelected.

And they're going to win -- they're going to lose again in 2020. They're protecting their own base from going crazy because they need to send it poison to keep it calm, because right now it's crazy and that's why we got impeachment in the first place. None of these clowns can beat the president, and that's why they're trying to pre impeach him. This is just a short circuit of democracy."

Hillary Clinton literally paid for foreign involvement in the 2016 election by paying a company, a firm that was using a foreign spy to get information from Russian sources to be used by the FBI to go after presidential candidate so if she were to win which she didn't, she would have had to be impeached over that, because that is far worse than anything the president said in his phone call. But back to Adam Schiff real quickly. That is what he said is a perfect example of claiming to protect democracy while completely undermining it and accusing the president falsely of things that he did not do. You have Jerry Nadler saying we can't trust the next election to decide or fix the problem. So if this was happening in a foreign country, in a democracy where power is supposed to be peacefully transferred, the State Department would be issuing condemnations of the behavior of the opposing party and yet here we are with the continuing this narrative when they're attacking the president."

Mike Pence was there today, stopped in at a local restaurant.

The media pretends that Trump’s reaction is the story, but that’s the reaction one would expect from somebody if he believes he is innocent and believes that there is no crime. It’s the same thing when people are saying like Juan says, “You know, why is Giuliani doing this? Why is he doing that?” Because he assumes what he is doing is the right thing and that he’s not breaking the law. If he thought he was doing something that was illegal, he probably would be doing it behind closed doors or not doing it at all. And it reminds me of all the ridicule that was heaped on Carter Page. Remember, everybody was making fun of Carter Page for acting befuddled and overwhelmed and kind of goofy? It’s because he was acting like an innocent man who was accused by a bunch of people and kind of overwhelmed by all of it."

This isn’t interesting. These are bad characters. Adam Schiff, Nadler. No one wants to watch these people. This whole time, Trump is just dancing on the grave. He’s tweeting; he’ rallying in Michigan. Do you know in Michigan at 4:00 a.m. this morning they had people lined up, 17 degrees, waiting for this rally? The bond between the president’s supporters and him is strong. It’s unbreakable, and the more they insult this man, the stronger this bond gets. Also, it’s the economy, stupid. Since President Trump’s election, S&P has been up 45 percent. China’s market has gone down 7 percent. We’re winning, everybody knows it. This is peace, prosperity, and that’s the bottom line."
