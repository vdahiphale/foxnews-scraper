There is nothing he can say. He might have made unforced error. But there is nothing that he can do to please the people. We saw how angry people, were more angry about his response than they were about the actual act.   I saw it. I read it. I saw the rage. Does his statement, any statement effect the outcome from Saturday? Not to those people. What I find interesting is, we spent so much time on North Korea, obsessing on North Korea. Wondering what was going to happen this weekend. And I finally realized the solution to North Korea is to just ignore it and forget about it. Because that's exactly what we did. We took an event in Charlottesville and just completely erased this international threat. This existential threat that we have been talking about nonstop for weeks. That just went away. And it's still there but we don't talk about it. We are not going to talk about it tonight. Every side has bad people. Some people have more bad people, some places have more bad people than other.  On the right, it is usually skin heads, white power freaks. On the left, you got the anarchists who burn stuff down. You're an anti-fa that bet up demonstrators. You have black militants who will shoot a cop. You have earth festers who hammered nails into trees so loggers get crippled. These people are all the same. And even more, you have Westboro and you have the Nazis in Skokie, and you have skin heads in England. This stuff has been around.  The racist right is learning from the fascist left who have eliminated debate. That's why this happened. They are all dirt bags. The right wing Nazis, the violent anarchists. There was an article in the \"The Washington Post\" two days before this happened. And I hope we have it here. It was written by somebody named Perry Stein. I don't know if you have a picture of this anywhere. But this is an interesting. Do you have it? Check out the headline. What draws Americans to anarchy. It is more than smashing windows. They do anarchy with a lifestyle choice with a guy holding a baseball bat. So, what the media is telling you right there, right now is that some violence is more acceptable than others.

But even if you stop to think about it, some of the anger that you saw after the Brown decision in 1954. You think, what is going on? Where is this massive resistance coming from? What is this about?  I don't think it's fair to say that this represents most people of any stripe. But I think that it is important to say that from the President's presidential point of view picking up on something Dana was talking about, which is moral authority. I think back to people like President Eisenhower making it very clear that we are not going to have people stand in the way of children going to school, I think of President Kennedy who had many supporters in the Democratic ranks were in the South at that time.  Being very clear that we stand against people being denied equal rights in this country, I think of President George H.W. Bush saying much the same thing. I think of John McCain. John McCain in the midst of his contest with Barack Obama saying to a woman who stood up and said some nasty things about Obama. I'm sorry, ma'am, that's not what we are doing here.

What happened? Donald Trump didn't have to wait this time. He shot right back and started attacking the guy and Merck for high drug prices. Again, it just seems to me even with the statement today which was fine that it struck me as if someone had told him to give up McDonald's. You know, he said oh, gosh, do I have to? Okay. And he makes a statement. He reads from the prompter which he is always saying is a silly thing to do and then he runs out of the room before he can answer any questions, it's really upsetting to me.

If Trump had named names, would the media still have linked him to the violence? Yes. Because they were linking him to the violence before he even said anything. Just because he didn't name names doesn't make him a racist. It just opened up the door for people to unfairly smear him as a racist. Let's look at the facts about the whole many sides debate. You had both sides coming into the town armed to the teeth with clubs, with shields, with mace. The anti-fa people. The Black Lives Matter people, the white supremacists and the neo-Nazis, they wanted to rumble. And it's true. The whites were the ones that started this racist rally and it was a white racist that committed this murder, allegedly. The \"New York Times\" said and she was on the ground, the reporter, the hard left seemed as hate- filled as the alt-right. I saw a club wielding, anti-fa beating white nationalists.   The ACLU of Virginia not sure who provoked first, both sides were hitting at each other. And then one of the four people who were arrested was a left wing radical who punched a reporter in the face, female reporter. So, we can armchair President Trump's response all we want, but there is a lot of hypocrisy going on here. Hillary Clinton waited two weeks after Benghazi to call that terrorism. If Trump had blamed Charlottesville on a video, maybe he would have gotten a free pass.  President Obama waited four days during Ferguson while that city burned. And he was in Martha's Vineyard, having dinner to come out. And when he come out, he came out, he blamed both sides, the looters and the police. When Black Lives Matter activists executed NYPD people, and shot cops cold dead in the streets in Dallas, what did the President do? He didn't condemn Black Lives Matter. Black Lives Matter got invited to the White House. And when he did speak about it, he goes, it's hard to untangle the motivations of the shooter. We don't want to assign blame from one kook to a larger national movement. Obama called terrorism workplace violence. So, it's hard to be lectured about word games from the left. And Scalise shooter, this guy a Bernie Sanders volunteer targeted Republican congressman with the weapon.  No one blamed Bernie Sanders for that but they want to lay this death at the doorstep of Donald Trump? It's disgraceful. This same people who are mad at President Trump for saying radical Islam now all of a sudden went on to say, white supremacy? It's totally ridiculous.",

Because where there is a lens, there is always a show. This melee over a statue, it wasn't a life or death battle but one for attention. A death sport fought in the coliseum of modern media. Two sides egged on for team sport purposes. It's the circus part of bread and circuses. And so many make their daily bread off the circus. Had we all ignored this the march would have been forgotten fast. The left used to say, what if they had war, nobody came. Imagine that. No cameras, no commentary, no Antifa, the rally would have been a bunch of badly dressed guys handing out leaflets over by noon. The camera is Miracle Grow for mayhem. These Nazis are repugnant slugs who need shunning as well as their violent counterparts. But they won't be as long as the media races to capture the action, then virtue signals themselves to death afterwards. It's the newest reality show: A gruesome \"American Gladiators\"; political bum fights. But we must state clearly this event isn't emblematic of something bigger. That melee isn't who we are today or microcosm of America. It's a diseased symptom of the larger body politic, one in which words are censored and violence excused. And if we don't recognize that is a sick aberration fertilized by attention, the temperature would drop and we could be rid of it. But sadly the media loves to say this represents a greater whole, which stews more rage. Meanwhile Americans just hope North Korea doesn't bomb us. It's true. Nothing good ever comes from an angry mob. And that includes the media.

I was there and brought concerns directly to the secretary of public safety and the head of the Virginia state police. They did not respond. In fact, law enforcement was standing passively by, seeming to be waiting for violence to take place so that they would have grounds to declare an emergency. Of course, Dana by declaring an emergency they could have cleared that park out which is precisely what they did cleared out of protesters and the alt right movement.

He answered yes, sir when asked if he understood the proceedings.

There is nothing he can say. He might have made unforced error. But there is nothing that he can do to please the people. We saw how angry people, were more angry about his response than they were about the actual act. I saw it. I read it. I saw the rage. Does his statement, any statement effect the outcome from Saturday? Not to those people. What I find interesting is, we spent so much time on North Korea, obsessing on North Korea. Wondering what was going to happen this weekend. And I finally realized the solution to North Korea is to just ignore it and forget about it. Because that's exactly what we did. We took an event in Charlottesville and just completely erased this international threat. This existential threat that we have been talking about nonstop for weeks. That just went away. And it's still there but we don't talk about it. We are not going to talk about it tonight. Every side has bad people. Some people have more bad people, some places have more bad people than other. On the right, it is usually skin heads, white power freaks. On the left, you got the anarchists who burn stuff down. You're an anti-fa that bet up demonstrators. You have black militants who will shoot a cop. You have earth festers who hammered nails into trees so loggers get crippled. These people are all the same. And even more, you have Westboro and you have the Nazis in Skokie, and you have skin heads in England. This stuff has been around. The racist right is learning from the fascist left who have eliminated debate. That's why this happened. They are all dirt bags. The right wing Nazis, the violent anarchists. There was an article in the \"The Washington Post\" two days before this happened. And I hope we have it here. It was written by somebody named Perry Stein. I don't know if you have a picture of this anywhere. But this is an interesting. Do you have it? Check out the headline. What draws Americans to anarchy. It is more than smashing windows. They do anarchy with a lifestyle choice with a guy holding a baseball bat. So, what the media is telling you right there, right now is that some violence is more acceptable than others. So, if you are going to call out the thugs, call out the thugs everywhere."

But even if you stop to think about it, some of the anger that you saw after the Brown decision in 1954. You think, what is going on? Where is this massive resistance coming from? What is this about? I don't think it's fair to say that this represents most people of any stripe. But I think that it is important to say that from the President's presidential point of view picking up on something Dana was talking about, which is moral authority. I think back to people like President Eisenhower making it very clear that we are not going to have people stand in the way of children going to school, I think of President Kennedy who had many supporters in the Democratic ranks were in the South at that time. Being very clear that we stand against people being denied equal rights in this country, I think of President George H.W. Bush saying much the same thing. I think of John McCain. John McCain in the midst of his contest with Barack Obama saying to a woman who stood up and said some nasty things about Obama. I'm sorry, ma'am, that's not what we are doing here. We have policy differences but he is a good family man."

And today, you had a black member of his business council, a man who is the president of Merck withdraw from the council because he said, he could not abide by the President's failure to speak clearly on a moral issue. What happened? Donald Trump didn't have to wait this time. He shot right back and started attacking the guy and Merck for high drug prices. Again, it just seems to me even with the statement today which was fine that it struck me as if someone had told him to give up McDonald's. You know, he said oh, gosh, do I have to? Okay. And he makes a statement. He reads from the prompter which he is always saying is a silly thing to do and then he runs out of the room before he can answer any questions, it's really upsetting to me.

If Trump had named names, would the media still have linked him to the violence? Yes. Because they were linking him to the violence before he even said anything. Just because he didn't name names doesn't make him a racist. It just opened up the door for people to unfairly smear him as a racist. Let's look at the facts about the whole many sides debate. You had both sides coming into the town armed to the teeth with clubs, with shields, with mace. The anti-fa people. The Black Lives Matter people, the white supremacists and the neo-Nazis, they wanted to rumble. And it's true. The whites were the ones that started this racist rally and it was a white racist that committed this murder, allegedly. The \"New York Times\" said and she was on the ground, the reporter, the hard left seemed as hate- filled as the alt-right. I saw a club wielding, anti-fa beating white nationalists. The ACLU of Virginia not sure who provoked first, both sides were hitting at each other. And then one of the four people who were arrested was a left wing radical who punched a reporter in the face, female reporter. So, we can armchair President Trump's response all we want, but there is a lot of hypocrisy going on here. Hillary Clinton waited two weeks after Benghazi to call that terrorism. If Trump had blamed Charlottesville on a video, maybe he would have gotten a free pass. President Obama waited four days during Ferguson while that city burned. And he was in Martha's Vineyard, having dinner to come out. And when he come out, he came out, he blamed both sides, the looters and the police. When Black Lives Matter activists executed NYPD people, and shot cops cold dead in the streets in Dallas, what did the President do? He didn't condemn Black Lives Matter. Black Lives Matter got invited to the White House. And when he did speak about it, he goes, it's hard to untangle the motivations of the shooter. We don't want to assign blame from one kook to a larger national movement. Obama called terrorism workplace violence. So, it's hard to be lectured about word games from the left. And Scalise shooter, this guy a Bernie Sanders volunteer targeted Republican congressman with the weapon. No one blamed Bernie Sanders for that but they want to lay this death at the doorstep of Donald Trump? It's disgraceful. This same people who are mad at President Trump for saying radical Islam now all of a sudden went on to say, white supremacy? It's totally ridiculous."

If they knew they were going to have this protest, they should have made sure there is reports from reporters on the field that they didn't shut it down. It should have been shut down. It's unacceptable and there has been loss of life here. Number two, the criticism is about the communications of the President. Because we sit here at this table and we criticize President Obama and past presidents if they weren't on message and if they did not denounce or come out and make a statement in time. And that's the criticism here is that where was the President's messaging? The communications and that there was a delay in it. Not that he is personally responsible for it. Because people look to a president for guidance and for that kind of moral leadership to hear what the President has to say because the words do matter.

There were violent events, something like 30 or 35 violent events in 2009 which were radical anti-fa protesters at standing rock. Except that happened in Ferguson and Baltimore. But this is different. Because it was -- this horrible act that makes it seem that it was entirely worse when, in fact, if you kept score of this, which is what people are doing, it's bad all around.

It's just like a moral thing and a human thing and you can judge each president on its own. I also think that the President needs to understand he would not pay a political price at all for calling out the alt-right. These are people who are unfairly seeking safe harbor under his wing. And if the President didn't want to do it to protect himself, what about the party that he says that he wants to grow? Because now every Republican has to say, well, I'm not alt-right. The alt-right doesn't even believe in the constitution of the United States. These are people who have through sites like Breitbart for the last two years come after people. If you have not been the target of some of the vile things that these people did with all their cocking and the pay frog. I remember I had to email Greg like, what are they even talking about? I didn't even know what it was. I thought that Nazis were something that we dealt with in the past. Of course, I knew little groups here and there but that America had a handle on it. And I think the President needs to understand, these people are trying to unfairly find safe harbor under his wing and he should absolutely come out and say, I disavow it completely. You can call them out by name Richard Spencer, David Duke, whoever it is, he would actually benefit. And I do think he would have gotten credit for that if he would have done it on Saturday.

But the media relishes I think a little bit in this racist right wing rallies because it's the only visual proof they can say they can point to and say this is racism. And then they use the racism to hurt the Republican Party. And they use it as a weapon against Republicans because so many Black people vote for Democrats and they want to make the other party look inhospitable. But meanwhile, over the weekend in Chicago, there were 39 shootings. There were nine deaths in Chicago. Did the media care? No. I think a month ago in Minnesota, Black Lives rally march, 21 police officers were injured and one had a fractured spinal cord. Didn't hear a lot about that. Kate Steinle was murdered by an illegal alien felon who was deported five times, the media yawned. Neo-Nazi mows down an innocent woman and the media goes wall-to-wall.

So basically this just comes down to communication and making sure that when something like this happens, and you are the President of the United States, that you and your team immediately get out there and do the right thing.

The media tries to make Trump the accessory for the murder. It's just not fair. Also, if you have hundreds of thousands of radical Islamic terrorists, that apparently have nothing to do with this Islam, according to the left, then how does one kook racists have anything to do with Donald Trump? The media begged Donald Trump to name names. He did. And then they said oh, he read it off a teleprompter. Oh, he didn't take questions. Oh, he bragged about the economy. In way he can't win. He will be blamed for everything. He gets blamed for transsexual suicide. He gets blamed for people getting divorced and he gets blamed for global warming. I do fear - I hear people in the media talk about Donald Trump like is he subhuman, like he is trying to wipe off people from the face of the earth, like he is Hitler.

I also think this goes back to a little bit like when this Scalise shooting happened, President Trump didn't say ok, Bernie Sanders, or the left like you are responsible for that. That is inappropriate. Personal responsibility is something conservatives believe in. So that is personal responsibility for what you do and for what you say or you don't say. The President benefits from something no other President has had except for President Obama. And that is the ability to speak unfiltered, to Americans. And so he can do that. He didn't have to take questions today. Although I think he would have benefited from doing so. He said he is going to have a press conference on Friday. Should have done it, but he has that ability to speak unfiltered. If he wants to show his true heart, I mean that is one of the ways to do that."

Look, if all you see is racism, when you think of Donald Trump.

As we know they are normally aligned with leftist causes, but in this case they took the side of the alt right movement. They filed suit against the city's decision to try to move this protest out to a suburban park. They won that case and so the case, rather the rally was held at Emancipation Park downtown. This morning, on \"National Public Radio,\" Virginia Governor McAuliffe blasted the ACLU for in effect contributing to the violence by winning that court case and today the ACLU fired back at McAuliffe and the police in a written statement which read, quote: the policing on Saturday was not effective in preventing violence. I was there and brought concerns directly to the secretary of public safety and the head of the Virginia state police. They did not respond. In fact, law enforcement was standing passively by, seeming to be waiting for violence to take place so that they would have grounds to declare an emergency. Of course, Dana by declaring an emergency they could have cleared that park out which is precisely what they did cleared out of protesters and the alt right movement. In other developments today the suspect in this case James Alex Fields made his first court appearance via video from a jail. He was dressed in a black and white striped uniform. He answered yes, sir when asked if he understood the proceedings. The public defender's office was expected to represent him, because a relative of one of the public defenders was at the wreckage seen on Saturday, they recused himself that he will be represented by another attorney, a second hearing coming up on August 25th, back to you in New York."

I want to hear from the governor there McAuliffe and say what did you know? Why did you allow this to continue and stand-down? I mean, shocking myself right now, that the ACLU I think has a very good point, because there was violence expected and they could have shut it down. Why is it that the police were told to, I guess, it looks like told or backed off and then look what happened in the aftermath. It's very upsetting to me."

He is being unfairly maligned, but you would have to expect that and I understand that. Then, third, I think the police and mayor of Charlottesville do have blood on their hands. There is dereliction of duty with what happened. There should have been a massive amount of law enforcement there on the scene and the minute blows were exchanged they should have come in and separated the groups instantaneously and they have a lot of explaining to do.
