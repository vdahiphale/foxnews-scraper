Having watched this president over the past nine months I feel like I'll only believe a change or pivot when I see it and I think the media coverage tends like to swing overreactions one way or another.

In terms of his base getting upset about the wall issue, they're absolutely correct. This is something that was promised repeatedly. This was something that was chanted at rallies over and over again. And their issue is we have seen this movie before. We have been promised for 30 years to have border security in return for some kind of amnesty. It has never worked because amnesty has come first and they see this DACA deal that isn't set yet, but they see any kind of negotiation on that is amnesty first before the wall and that is unacceptable."

That's god for them too. It's not too much to lose at this point, but (INAUDIBLE) Joe can speak thing continue going in this path, they may have a difficult path going --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Well, it only looks fact (ph) here is that Chuck is from Brooklyn and Donald is from Queens and they speak the same language but so, leaving aside the anti-Trump (INAUDIBLE) people who were never for Donald Trump and the conservative media, are some of his conservative media supporters now justifying this because they want still want to support the president by going after McConnell, by going after Ryan --"

      "speaker": "PAVLICH",
      "utterance": "It is certainly fair to criticize Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell for their failures f Obamacare and other things this year as such of giving the promises of the last eight years. Totally fair. Fine. But it's not Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan who've been calling for the impeachment of Donald Trump. And although Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi has stopped short of that, I guarantee you, if they had a majority in the House and Senate, they wouldn't stop their members from voting for impeachment of the president. So moving forward, I think this is a warning shot from the president to Republicans to try and get them to get some things done. I don't think necessarily it will be a long standing issue. He has to decide whether Chuck and Nancy are negotiating in good faith. Based on their background and their history, they probably are not."

It's their fault that he had to go to the Democrats. I mean --"

    {
      "speaker": "TRIPPI",

I'm not sure -- it's interesting that Bannon and some of the others are pushing against this right now, but I'm not sure his base --"

There is the damage from Hurricane Irma when he talked to the press five different times including - - we're going to put that up -- along (INAUDIBLE) to a mini press conference on Air Force One where he came back and talked t reporters and he thanked the media in Florida.

That is what he sees as his role. Now, I will point out that the RNC has gone full Donald Trump. I mean, they've hired people who were surrogate for him during the campaign to be their spokes people. S the RNC is on board. So the only establishment that I think Steve Bannon thinks is left is on Capitol Hill. So, his goal is to kind of push them into this corner and I think will probably be talking to the White House a little bit about how to get this Democrat-Republican cat and mouse game going and to get some things done."

I think he is a force to be reckoned with and I think the White House is going to realize that Steve Bannon's loyalties is to his ideologies and his movement and not necessarily to a president or one person. He's not someone who has been loyal to Trump for 20 years. He is someone who knew him preferably (ph) and then worked on the campaign and then the White House.

No reprimand, no apology, nothing, for calling the president of the United States among other things a white supremacist. JARED MAX, FOX NEWS HEADLINES 24/7: Howie, good morning. Right off the bat, I'm a big believer. DO you know that saying action speak louder than words? I'm a big believer that actions speak and words don't. So in a week where we have seen ESPN come out and issue a statement that separated itself from Jemele Hill's personal stance and Jemele Hill that are coming out and saying this is not ESPN beliefs, these are my beliefs. The actions still show that ESPN condones her behavior because to our knowledge she has not been suspended and certainly not terminated so it is an interesting story."

If you do anything stupid, you go out late at night, you get in any kind of trouble you wound up on page six of the \"New York Post.\" You are ESPN's Jared Max. Jemele Hill, knows the score.

And now everything is kind of intertwined. And ESPN finds itself in a real mess. What I find so interesting here is that -- and I'm going to talk about science. I was a C and D student in science but I did remember this one. For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. Colin Kaepernick kneels for the national anthem. That's his action, protesting. Reaction, 32 NFL owners decide this guy is not good for our business. He has done a lot to do everything to alienate our fans, the majority of our fans offending them. He's not good for business. Then what happens? There's a rally outside the NFL offices not long ago.

When it comes down to it, yes, this was a very much personal attack. She still has the tweets that are there on twitter and has not removed them. Again, action speak, words don't.

So the media at NBC, I found all kinds of stories, yes. Nobody has come back and said, you know what, the president did pretty good and I think that's one of the media's -- nature media's big credibility problems right now.

And that would have been a perfect time for Anderson to come back and say, well, what about your insecure server that was accessible. Do you think that that played into the results of what happened in the election? But he didn't. He pivoted to what Republicans would say about that."

I think it's something like, there's (Inaudible) and other something like that. But look, this is her account of the election. It's a historic election on many counts namely and including the fact that it was the first time a major party nominated a woman."

    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "But what we are trying to focus on here, Emily, is the extent to which (Inaudible), what she put in the book with the way in which anchors dealt with her. And I thought to Today Show interview was the toughest. And that a lot have mentioned that he's been criticized in the book. But come on, didn't she get a pretty easy ride?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SUSSMAN",
      "utterance": "Well, I think for that reason, look, you can't go five minutes in the media. You can't turn one page without seeing somebody's account of what happened in this election -- someone's analysis. I think it's perfectly fair for her to go on a tour giving her analysis. She was actually the candidate. I mean, grilling her for what, like for what purpose. She is never going to be -- she is never going to run for office again. Her husband is never going to run for office again. Like this is her account, that is -- this is her moment in the media to have that account. And I do think they went in. She was so honest in her book about so many things that were played over and over in the media through the course of the election. What would it add in the media to go in and rehash those, and she -- and she answer."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Let me get by, Gayle. So you say we hash -- I mean if she says in the book, yes, I take responsibility, but it's also, shouldn't Jim Comey's fault, the Russian's fault, Bernie Sander's fault, as the media's fault, then why wouldn't an anchor say what about that, or press her on her argument?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TROTTER",
      "utterance": "Right. Howie, I would disagree with, Emily, because there was nothing news worthy in her book. And this would have been the perfect opportunity for objected journalists to drill down and get something news worthy. And truly, a part for partisanship, they are not doing the Democratic Party a service, because I think this is equivalent to the RNC 2012 autopsy that the RNC tried to understand how they lost the election to Obama. This would be an opportunity for Judy Woodruff of PBS, I watched her interview to really drill down on that and try to understand to get something beyond the talking points that Hillary Clinton just repeat ad nauseam. The amount of coverage devoted to the emails Putin, Comey, everybody knows what they -- how they weigh these things."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Emily, you seem to feel like Hillary Clinton was candid in her book fine, that's part of the reason we conclude on your part but you seem to feel that anchors don't have any responsibility to press her about these things. I mean if, you know, Mitt Romney have written a book, it was in the 2012 election, do you think he would have gotten that kind of K Club treatment?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SUSSMAN",
      "utterance": "Look, everybody has written a book about every piece of every election, particularly, this election. I do think that she has a right to be candid and I think for every interview I have seen with her, she comes across as incredibly genuine. She is just speaking what she feels happened in this election. And I think the anchors are responding to that. I don't think that it's not that don't have a responsibility to press her, they are journalists. And on to, Gayle's point would this helps to Democratic Party or not, again, they are journalists, they are not invested in what happens in the Democratic Party."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "All right, jump in because I want to get to won this question, Gayle Trotter, Hillary says in the book that Fox leads a right-wing war on truth but she is mad at Matt Lauer over her debate that he not related (Inaudible) the New York Times were playing up her emails which the paper broke. So she doesn't much like the liberal media either."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TROTTER",
      "utterance": "She doesn't. I think she plays the victim instead of being like Margaret Thatcher who was Iron Lady. She has this feminist ideology that puts out there but she is playing the victim. And so when these journalists ask her these tough questions that benefits not only the Democratic Party but the American political system. And Glamour Magazine when they wrote an article about whether or not Hillary was correct in saying that white women voted for Trump because their husbands pushed them on that. Anderson Cooper should have asked her about that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "All right, Emily, we just have half a minute. So she is entitled to take her chance to talk but again, she seems to still be ticked off at much of the media."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SUSSMAN",
      "utterance": "She was quite specific in what she alleges -- said she was talking about but specifically she have said, there was one rumor in particular that was repeated again and again on the network and so -- I think that's fair for her to actually set the record straight. And if we are talking about what happened in this election, the media played a huge piece in it. So I think it's very fair for her to critic that and talk about what impact it had over all."

He kept repeating it over and over, and over again but it kind if work because he wanted to grab attention. And Brooke Baldwin was right to dump him. It seemed like a nice idea for a feature segment when \"The View\" agreed to host both Sarah Huckabee Sanders and her dad, Mike Huckabee -- a veteran politician and the rising star at the White House. And everyone knows the day-time show is predominantly liberal. But I wasn't expecting what happened. After the obligatory, what kind of advice did your dad the give you stuff.

These weren't independent experts. They all had ties to the board they were defending. CBS decline a comment by after my inquiry posted this editor's note to an online write up of the story, some members of the panel of college professors and consumer advocates featured in this report also have previous work experience with or have serve on advisory board for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. A good step but there was no indication it has been left out in the first place. That's it for Media Buzz, I'm Howard Kurtz, thanks for watching.
