We are now less a week away from the crucial midterm elections and in moments, I'll lay out why it's so vital to choose treats over tricks at the ballot box. And after Don Lemon said white men represent the country biggest terror threat, CNN is all mum, no comment. We are going to explain why. Plus, what happens when the former head of ICE and the current asking Mexican ambassador to the U.S. share a set with me tonight? A blunt conversation about the caravan is ahead. And Raymond arroyo is here with a Halloween treat. Who did the voters think is the scariest politician in Washington? A special \"Seen and Unseen\" ahead. And what happened to all that money? Justice Kavanaugh accuser Christine Blasey Ford raised through her GoFund me efforts about a million bucks. And \"The Ingraham Angle\" deep dive, and I hate that phrase, tonight. But first, Democrat tricks versus Trump treats, that's the focus of tonight's \"Angle.\" Democrats are putting all their candy in a new basket of candidates this Halloween and the result for Americans can be downright nauseating. Here is Democratic gubernatorial hopeful Andrew Gillum on the trick he has in store for Florida voters.",

And here's the quotation, \"For anti-slavery delegates like Hamilton and Franklin, abolition of slavery would be a moot point if a failure to erect a functioning government snuffed out the ideals of the American Revolution in their infancy; then the future of all Americans, the free as well as the slave, would eventually be as serfs to a despotic government.\" The recitation of historical fact is not racist, nor is it justifying slavery. And either Andrew Gillum is just really not all that smart, or he's purposefully lying about something this awful and horrible. It's defamatory and it should not be tolerated or rewarded by the voters of Florida.

Now, under this president, this news came out today, wages and salaries rose 3.1 percent in the third quarter, the biggest increase in a decade. The GDP expanded by 3.5 percent annual rate ahead of the 3.4 percent expectation. African-American and Hispanic unemployment are at historic lows. And the president is taking real steps like sending 5,000 troops to the border to protect our sovereignty. And your bottom line, your wallet. You will know the Democrats don't really offer any cogent argument or response, alternative to the Trump record because they expect to win via a sustained campaign of anti-Trump anger and race baiting.

And after Don Lemon said white men represent the country biggest terror threat, CNN is all mum, no comment. We are going to explain why. Plus, what happens when the former head of ICE and the current asking Mexican ambassador to the U.S. share a set with me tonight? A blunt conversation about the caravan is ahead. And Raymond arroyo is here with a Halloween treat. Who did the voters think is the scariest politician in Washington? A special \"Seen and Unseen\" ahead. And what happened to all that money?

Oprah is coming into town and she's hoping to be the queen maker in Georgia, and comedian Will Ferrell is going door to door to canvas for Abrams hoping that you think he's a real anchorman who knows something about politics. Former President Barack Obama and Senator Bernie Sanders are also expected in Georgia next week. And meanwhile, President Barack Obama heads down to Florida on Friday -- totally unfazed by the new revelations that his guy Andrew Gillum was again shown to be corrupt. Of course, what he did?

Well, we pulled to the book, it's called \"Dreams from our Founding Fathers\" and in it, DeSantis recounts how Alexander Hamilton and Benjamin Franklin lamented the \"notorious compromises\" that were made to tolerate slavery so the constitution could actually pass, they could form a government. And here's the quotation, \"For anti-slavery delegates like Hamilton and Franklin, abolition of slavery would be a moot point if a failure to erect a functioning government snuffed out the ideals of the American Revolution in their infancy; then the future of all Americans, the free as well as the slave, would eventually be as serfs to a despotic government.\" The recitation of historical fact is not racist, nor is it justifying slavery. And either Andrew Gillum is just really not all that smart, or he's purposefully lying about something this awful and horrible. It's defamatory and it should not be tolerated or rewarded by the voters of Florida. But of course racism seems to be one of the most potent forces that the Democrats have in their trick bag this midterm season. Everywhere you turn, the refrain is the same."

But now compare all of those Democratic tricks, the tax hikes, the empty racism charges, the vision of an open border, abolishing ICE, all that stuff, to Trump's treats. Now, under this president, this news came out today, wages and salaries rose 3.1 percent in the third quarter, the biggest increase in a decade. The GDP expanded by 3.5 percent annual rate ahead of the 3.4 percent expectation. African-American and Hispanic unemployment are at historic lows. And the president is taking real steps like sending 5,000 troops to the border to protect our sovereignty. And your bottom line, your wallet. You will know the Democrats don't really offer any cogent argument or response, alternative to the Trump record because they expect to win via a sustained campaign of anti-Trump anger and race baiting. But like old Halloween candy, none of that is going to satisfy or sustain the country and it'll just give you a really bad aftertaste in your mouth. It's kind of bitter. And that's \"The Angle.\" All right, joining me now to discuss on this Halloween, Dan Bongino, a former Secret Service agent, Scott Bolden, Democratic attorney and Matt Schlapp, chairman of the American Conservative Union. Matt, let's start with you. What will happen to the Democratic Party if they can't win this midterm cycle?

And I can tell you, listen, it was not a scientific sample. I'm not a pollster. I'm not claiming as such. But I make my way around the county, I get out a lot. I give a lot of speeches and I have not seen Republicans as fired up about defeating a candidate as I have for them about defeating Gillum. It has everything to do with his policies. Now, the left, of course as you point in your opening, wants to make this about race, that's absurd. It's outrageous. People in Florida move here, Laura, for a very distinct reason. I know you're familiar with Florida. People move here from the northeast to escape the taxes and big government, not to re-elect big taxes and big government in the form of big government Andrew Gillum down here in Florida.

It has to be persecution based on race, religion, or political preference. But these human traffickers don't care about -- these are commodity. They're making money by moving these people north. The criminal cartels are involved. The drug cartels are involved so you got to pay a tax working through the plazas. Mexico has been a good partner.

I don't know where that's at, you know. Now they got a change in leadership in Mexico but I think if Mexico agreed to a safe third country, that would be a great alternative for the United States. It would be great. I also think Mexico could expand the biometrics. When they come across people from other countries, we have a bitmap program, they are a part of it. We can expand it so they can take biometrics from these people so we know in advance who's coming and if there are terrorists and bad people, not only do we know, the Mexican government will know."

This is an organized effort, and we had the Honduran leftwing politician who was pulled out of the migrant caravan in the first few days of the caravan, he was pulled out and arrested along with two others. There's a sense that Venezuela has its hand in all of this as well.

Joining me to discuss all this, former U.S. attorney Joe diGenova, attorney Harmeet Dhillon. Harmeet, I want to start with you. Justice Kavanaugh has declined the money raised on his behalf and it's going to charity. Is it incumbent on Ford to do the same?"

And so I think in terms of the premise on which she raised the money, certainly she has raised a heck of a lot more money than what was needed for these causes. So it would be the right thing to do. But what is weird about it is she is actually continuing to raise the money weeks after the hearing. She's put out statements on GoFundMe that she still has expenses, she still needs more money. So it is getting a taint of pure commercialism here and not for the purposes that it was originally intended. So I think it's inappropriate."

We got a statement tonight from her counsel saying the following, \"These funds have been used exclusively for necessary costs of physical security and housing occasioned by coming forward about her sexual assault by Brett Kavanaugh,\" which I don't believe. \"Justice Kavanaugh ascended to the Supreme Court but threats to Dr. Ford continue. All unused funds will be donated to organizations that support trauma survivors.\" Your reaction, Joe. Do you buy any of that?"

She has monetized this outrageous, phony performance that she did before the Senate Judiciary Committee into money. She didn't want to come forward, everyone says. By golly, isn't it amazing how everything about her just became public so she had to come forward? Whatever her lawyer says is irrelevant at this point. This is no longer the silly nonsense that lawyers like that like to pretend when something is over. This was an ugly abuse of power by the Democrats with the assistance of Ford and her lawyers, Debra Katz and Michael Bromwich. The money that is being made now is dirty money, it's filthy money, it's just like drug money, it's awful. What they did to the senatorial confirmation process is inexcusable. Shame on her, shame on her lawyers, and, by the way, I didn't believe a single word of her testimony."

And Harmeet, when you think about other people who raise these outrageous claims that were unsubstantiated, no corroboration contemporaneous or really otherwise, Avenatti is having to now endure a Congressional to federal investigation on what he did. But I still say that Feinstein and her whole office should be investigated for that initial leak that put this whole country and Kavanaugh through all this. The idea that they can skate on that, I just think that's not the kind of senatorial courtesy I think the American public deserves of this process deserves. Harmett?"

The senators in question have absolutely made a mockery of this process and casually drive by destroying of people's lives without any consequences. And it has been going on for a while. And when you couple this particular episode with the fact that around the election, major Democratic donors were offering $750,000 and up to people to accuse Donald Trump of gross crimes, you had to completely disregard. There is no barriers for these people, there's no boundaries, there's no decorum, and it's a complete abuse of the process. And so I think Joe is right on point. It's drug money, it's dirty money, it's a perversion of our process."
