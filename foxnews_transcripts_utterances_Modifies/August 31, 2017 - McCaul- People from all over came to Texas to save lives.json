But I'm sure capacity at shelters and where a lot of these evacuees have gone, you must be running at wits' end here. Red Cross directors have been telling me much the same. Every new facility they open is a facility that is quickly filled.

And they come -- not just Texans saving Texans, but it's also people from California, Nebraska, Ohio, just all over the nation coming to Texas to save lives.
