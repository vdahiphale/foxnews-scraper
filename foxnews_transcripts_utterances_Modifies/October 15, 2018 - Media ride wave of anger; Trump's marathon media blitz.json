I'm Howard Kurtz and this is \"Media Buzz.\"   The major newspapers have been filled with stories about President Trump using the brutal Brett Kavanaugh confirmation to make his conservative supporters angry, but their op-ed pages are preaching a rather different message. Take a look. Charles Blow, New York Times: Liberals, this is war. David Leonhardt, New York Times: Get angry and get involved. His lead, if you are not angry yet, you should be. E.J. Dionne, Washington Post: We need to stay angry on Kavanaugh.  So, aren't there two sides on the use of anger and fear in the midterms? Joining us now to analyze the coverage: Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at The Federalist and a Fox News contributor; Gillian Turner, a Fox News correspondent and former White House national security official; and Richard Fowler, talk radio host and also a Fox News contributor. Mollie, it's been a major media theme, president whipping up his base over Kavanaugh to get Republican voters turnout, while these liberal columnists are openly -- these are not dog whistles -- openly doing the same thing on the left.",

I think what we saw with the Kavanaugh coverage was a lot of coverage of these people screaming at senators trying to tear down the walls of the Supreme Court, you know, Antifa protesters in various coasts, and that was all shown as a way that the media thought was conveying that people were really upset about Kavanaugh. What it actually showed people was -- what in their mind was a lot of scary mobs and that made them very concerned. They like to see rule of law order. They felt like rule of law had been overthrown in the Kavanaugh discussion anyway and so it really confirmed to them a lot of their fears.  So it is weird that the media showed all of these things when they thought it was sort of helping the anti-Kavanaugh case. And then when it turned out that people actually hated what they were saying, they said, oh, it's crazy to call these people mobs or it's crazy to say that you need to fight against that.

What I disagree with Mollie is, in 2010, some of those protests are pretty ugly.

That was like the gold standard for Republicans going into the final days of this.   And that does -- the president going out in the other direction and then saying basically she lied, that did really undercut that message. I think the media was very quick to pick up on that. Any disagreement between President Trump and the rest of the Republicans on the Hill or wherever they are, it is something that instantly grabs everybody's attention.  I have to just say because I spent two days embedded with Kavanaugh protesters on both sides of this on the Hill and at the Supreme Court, a lot of those people felt undercut by that message.

Fellow rapper T.I. has come out and said that he's embarrassed to know him because of what he's doing in terms of setting back the black community by going in there and sort of playing nice as it were with a president who they feel does not advocate with the African-Americans in this country or do anything to benefit them. To Jedediah's point about if he had gone into the White House with President Obama, President Obama famously called him a jack expletive. So I don't think that really would have been going on there.

Now, IBT's cofounder denied the charges, and said this is a political retaliation by Vance. Sadly, it turns out the ousted Newsweek journalists were on to something big. Heads up, the following about a senior White House official is not an onion headline. Stephen Miller's third grade teacher, he was a loaner and ate glue. That was in the Hollywood Reporter, the teacher said Miller was a strange dude who would pour glue on his arm. Wait a minute, hold on. He was eight years old. Why was this published? Does journalistic scrutiny now extend to everything we ever did in elementary school? The L.A. school district has now put teacher Nikki Fiske on paid leave.

Dionne, Washington Post: We need to stay angry on Kavanaugh. So, aren't there two sides on the use of anger and fear in the midterms? Joining us now to analyze the coverage: Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at The Federalist and a Fox News contributor; Gillian Turner, a Fox News correspondent and former White House national security official; and Richard Fowler, talk radio host and also a Fox News contributor. Mollie, it's been a major media theme, president whipping up his base over Kavanaugh to get Republican voters turnout, while these liberal columnists are openly -- these are not dog whistles -- openly doing the same thing on the left."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, THE FEDERALIST",
      "utterance": "Right, and we may wish that people weren't motivated to vote by anger, but anger is a very -- is a very common way for people to decide who to vote for. I think what we saw with the Kavanaugh coverage was a lot of coverage of these people screaming at senators trying to tear down the walls of the Supreme Court, you know, Antifa protesters in various coasts, and that was all shown as a way that the media thought was conveying that people were really upset about Kavanaugh. What it actually showed people was -- what in their mind was a lot of scary mobs and that made them very concerned. They like to see rule of law order. They felt like rule of law had been overthrown in the Kavanaugh discussion anyway and so it really confirmed to them a lot of their fears. So it is weird that the media showed all of these things when they thought it was sort of helping the anti-Kavanaugh case. And then when it turned out that people actually hated what they were saying, they said, oh, it's crazy to call these people mobs or it's crazy to say that you need to fight against that. Well, that doesn't make sense."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "I'll come back to the question. Let me ask you first, Gillian. The politics of anger and fear in campaigns basically been around forever in the history of the country.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "GILLIAN TURNER, FOX NEWS",
      "utterance": "Yeah, of course they should. That's part of the responsibility. I would actually go one step further than Mollie on this and I would say that riling up people is actually the only way to get Americans to vote, particularly in midterms. And so for most of the part --"
    },

      "utterance": "A lot of people stay home."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TURNER",
      "utterance": "Yeah. I mean, the turnout is horrendous, right? So this is the moment to, you know, get people angry. This is the moment -- I think this is the mainstream media most of which is left leaning doing their part to get out the vote in the midterms. It's almost like they've got their own electoral strategy going."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Richard, what do you think, for example, of E.J. Dionne, an old colleague of mine, wildly respected political columnist, saying this was a judicial coup, putting Kavanaugh on the high court and saying that we should pack the Supreme Court when the Democrats win, and Charles Blow saying it's a way and the other side is trying to preserve white male power?"

      "speaker": "RICHARD FOWLER, FOX NEWS",
      "utterance": "This media coverage is very reminiscent to the media coverage we saw around \"mobs\" in 2010, where you saw during the health care town halls, where you would see the media -- they go to these health care town halls and like, look at them, look at the conservatives, they are so angry, right, and sort of stoking this health care town hall and sometimes they were angry, sometimes they weren't. But as soon as the cameras show up, people tend to get a little bit angrier. I think -- and what we saw from history there is that it ended up flipping the House in the opposite direction. So maybe Gillian is right and maybe the --"

      "speaker": "FOWLER",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "So that's why we're hearing words like coup and white male power and all that. Now, so, I happen to think that the protesters' screaming and disrupting of Kavanaugh committee hearings, even things like chasing Ted Cruz and other Republicans out of restaurants has hurt the liberal cause. I agree with you on that. But the media really, really don't like President Trump and his allies calling them a mob."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "Yeah, there was a lot of push back against calling this group, this unruly protest group a mob, but that's basically what the definition is. And I would point out that in --"

      "speaker": "KURTZ",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "I think when you are trying to tear down the walls of the Supreme Court, tear down the doors, that would qualify as that. When you're redirecting traffic, taking over city of Portland at Antifa, that qualifies. I would also point out that people do remember that in 2010, quite ruly large group of people were called mobs and it really frustrated them. You never saw Tea Party going to people's houses and places where they were eating and getting them kicked out of restaurants. This type of behavior does alarm people and reasonably so."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Now, look, everyone has the right to protest, but you rarely see liberal commentators or Democrats for that matter calling out after disruptive tactics or tactics that maybe go too far which kind of -- does that leave an opening for the president and his allies to say, mob, and you should be scared and all of that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FOWLER",
      "utterance": "Here's the thing. I think the First Amendment in our country which is -- the First Amendment which is interesting that the pundits made it the first one is that it allows people to lead the protest. And sometimes protesting is ugly whether you like it or not. And in history, even in the ugliness of protests, that made our country so great as it move legislation forward. What I disagree with Mollie is, in 2010, some of those protests are pretty ugly. I remember being at a town hall in Fairfax, Virginia where the Congressman James Moran have to be escorted out by Fairfax County police because they were afraid that he was going to be harmed. So, in either case, what we realize is that our politics does get us angry. These issues get us angry. And we have to have real conversations."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "This is what we are talking about, is there a media double standard?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. It seems every time a group of conservative get together, they are called like violent right-wing mobs, and you get. Then you get these defensive people on the right or on the left. I would point also that in the last couple of years, we had a large scale assassination attempt against Republican members of Congress which many in the media act like it's was not a big deal. I think a lot of Americans are worried about that type of violence and inciting that type of violence."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Right. There was a CNN commentator who tried to conflate that attempt on Steve Scalise and the others at that baseball game with the protests. I think it is clearly in different category. But the angry narrative, Gillian, got kicked up when President Trump only this past Monday, seems like three months ago, after Brett Kavanaugh was sworn in a ceremony at the White House, he apologized to his family and then he called the sexual assault allegations fabrications that were part of the Democratic hoax. That is very different in the way the president had talked about it while Christine Blasey Ford was testify and while the Senate was still debating. I think that threw a lot of media flack as well."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TURNER",
      "utterance": "It did and it also directly contradicted the line that Republicans had crafted so carefully over the proceeding week which as far as I can tell seemed to be -- we believe the victim in this case, Christine Blasey Ford -- we believe she was sexually assaulted but we don't necessarily know that it was by Brett Kavanaugh. That was like the gold standard for Republicans going into the final days of this. And that does -- the president going out in the other direction and then saying basically she lied, that did really undercut that message. I think the media was very quick to pick up on that. Any disagreement between President Trump and the rest of the Republicans on the Hill or wherever they are, it is something that instantly grabs everybody's attention. I have to just say because I spent two days embedded with Kavanaugh protesters on both sides of this on the Hill and at the Supreme Court, a lot of those people felt undercut by that message. A lot of people, a lot of women who I spoke to on both sides, conservatives who supported Brett Kavanaugh and liberal women who, you know, were there to protest against him --"

      "utterance": "Fabrications and hoax."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",
      "utterance": "I think it is worth remembering that there was never any evidence supplied to support any of the allegations. The allegations included the claim that Brett Kavanaugh was the ringleader of a secret gang rape cartel when he was in high school. I think it is OK to call these types of things fabrications or hoax --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Right. That was the so called third accuser (INAUDIBLE). I didn't think that should have been publicized at all because there is less than zero evidence."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HEMINGWAY",

This is something weird and I think that it would be better to have more coverage of how weird it was, what was going on, and how these allegations were whipped up rather than parsing his language."

      "speaker": "FOWLER",

      "utterance": "So you think the media criticism of words like hoax and fabrication was justified?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FOWLER",
      "utterance": "Absolutely because on Capitol Hill, they are saying something completely different as Gillian just said, and so you have the supporters, you have members of Congress in the ballot saying she is credible, she is credible but we don't necessarily think that was Brett Kavanaugh, and the president saying, oh, she made it all up. That means the party and him are on the line."

You know, maybe -- there is so much Trump in our lives. We lose sight of the fact that this is very unusual for president, many questions in so many forums.

These are part of the folks that he feels are sort of conspiring against him. So that is notable. But I will say as a reporter, it's wonderful when he does this. I spent Friday reporting live from the White House. It has this wonderful trickle-down effect. When the president gets chatty and talkative and opens up to reporters, everybody else does too at the White House. So you get senior down to junior officials more willing to kind of grab your ear and tell you, you know, juicy news nugget. You get Larry Kudlow willing to gaggle impromptu for 20 minutes on the North Lawn of the White House. I think these are things that kind of come from the top. I don't know -- I don't think the president is giving people direction to open up and talk to the media more but they are sort of following his example."

The fact that while yes, the House and the Senate are a little more complicated, when it comes to governors' mansions, Republicans could take major losses this November and the president gets that. And these interviews could help sharp his base and make sure he protects these governors' mansions."

I guess I outed myself as a lifelong Spider-Man fan. When I was a kid, I had a letter published in earlier issue. Look, while President Trump says he knew in advance, despite all the chatter, there were legitimate journalists that questions about the timing even after the president and his ambassador were all smiles in the Oval Office. Why (INAUDIBLE) announce this taking most White House and State Department officials by surprise the morning after the Kavanaugh swearing in and a month before the midterms? But Haley is staying until the end of the year, anyway. But the instant speculation about Haley's political future has various conspiracy theories. Well, let's just say there was a lot of air time to fill. Hope Hicks, the Donald Trump loyalist who resigned last spring as White House communications director, has found a new job. It's with Fox. Murdoch family has hired her as the chief communications officer for the company that will emerge after Disney buys the entertainment assets of 21st Century Fox in the 71-billion deal. While there was some predictable criticism about the ties between the president and his favorite network, Hope Hicks will be working on the corporate side based in L.A., not directly for Fox News. Coming up, some pundits attacking Kanye West for his X-rated rant in the Oval Office, but is the real problem that he likes this president?

This is a guy -- if he had done the same exact thing in the Oval Office when President Obama had been sitting there, they would have been talking how he was bringing front and center some great issues like stop and frisk, Kelly was talking about prison reform. It's really been fascinating to watch, whether you like Kanye or not, this man has -- there has been a character assassination against this guy. I mean, they have called him everything from a traitor to an idiot to someone who is deeply, deeply disturbed who needs help. They've instantialized him. And you don't have to agree with everything he says, but you do have to defend his right to say it. And he, just like every other celebrity, who has walked into that White House from a former administration has a right to -- if he has a platform to make his voice heard.

As for what the African-American community feels about this, as a white person, I certainly can't comment on that, but I do understand and sympathize their frustration when Kanye West used this important platform to advocate for things like abolishing the 13th Amendment when he has shown total lack of understanding about the Jim Crow South, for instance, that something John Legend has spoken out about. Fellow rapper T.I. has come out and said that he's embarrassed to know him because of what he's doing in terms of setting back the black community by going in there and sort of playing nice as it were with a president who they feel does not advocate with the African-Americans in this country or do anything to benefit them. To Jedediah's point about if he had gone into the White House with President Obama, President Obama famously called him a jack expletive. So I don't think that really would have been going on there. And I think there is also a great deal of hypocrisy to all of this because conservatives never get celebrities that support them, but they rail on liberals when a celebrity gets involved. We all remember shut up and dribble, for instance, the mocking of Jay-Z and Beyonce. So I don't think it is really fair for them to be coming after the coverage of..."

I don't even know if we can count that high. She had to sit in a debate and face an audience with Juanita Broaddrick and Paula Jones sitting there, right in front of her face. So I think it's totally fair game, especially since there was an accusation that President Trump used campaign funds to pay off a woman that he allegedly had an affair with.

I mean, I think they really wanted -- not on just that issue, but on several policy issues. I saw that they would kind of parallel, Trump's policy on something, whether it was immigration or what not, and some activism or some opinion that Melania has expressed to try to really get her to say what my husband is doing was wrong.

      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "The apparent murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a Washington Post opinion contributor, is a tragedy that sent shock waves through the world, journals and community. The Post reports that when Khashoggi entered the Saudi consulate in Turkey, a 15-member squad from Saudi Arabia, which had arrived on two private planes was lying in wait for him. And that the plan which might have been was to kidnap Khashoggi and bring him home was approved by the Crown pince -- Prince, excuse me, Mohammad Bin Salman. The government denies this. But Turkish officials have said that they have video and audio evidence that he was killed inside the consulate in Istanbul. We're back with Gillian Turner. Now, CNN contributor Marc Lamont Hill of the Huffington Post, the Trump administration is complicit in Khashoggi's death. Others have said it in less inflammatory terms. But this is an autocratic government, perhaps in an apparent assassination, not people inflamed by Donald Trump's rhetoric."

      "speaker": "TURNER",
      "utterance": "No, but I will -- this is a horrific event. If he has in fact been murdered, no matter who is responsible for it ultimately. What I will say though is that criticizing the American president for being too cozy with Saudi Arabia early on during an administration is practically a national pastime for Americans. I mean, President Obama..."

      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Not just or this president, yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TURNER",
      "utterance": "That's what I'm saying. President Obama suffered the same criticism and then moved in sort of a 180 direction where he was barely on speaking terms with Saudi Arabia by the end of his tenure. President W. Bush was you know subjected to this criticism during the entirety of his administration. This is not anything new."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "And so, when President Trump tells 60 Minutes that will be airing tonight, that there will be severe punishment if Khashoggi was in fact killed, is he toughening his stance after several days, perhaps in response to media pressure?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TURNER",
      "utterance": "The problem with the CBS interview and we have seen clips of it, is that it appears he hedges, right. He seems to say they may very be responsible for this. But they insist to me so far and they insisted they're not. And it runs a little bit too close to the narrative he spun about President Putin. Well, look, I spoke to President Putin and he promised me that he didn't interfere in our elections. When you're the American president, you're not supposed to take autocrats for their word."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "Well, I take your point about previous U.S. administrations being overly cozy with Saudi Arabia, despite their horrible records on human rights for example. But you have that more than $100 million in arms sales, and so, it seems like this is not unique to this president that the financial benefits and not to mention, some geopolitical benefits of being tight with Saudi Arabia, many presidents have chosen kind of looked the other way when it comes to the way Saudis treat women. But still, an incident like this where somebody may well be dead seems to me to cross a new threshold."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TURNER",
      "utterance": "It does and it doesn't. I mean, people have died at hands of murderous regimes for years."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "But it doesn't get as much publicity because it is not somebody from the media world."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TURNER",
      "utterance": "Perhaps. And perhaps, the Saudis, if they are indeed complicit or guilty here perhaps, they misjudged that. Perhaps they thought that they could do this and like many other journalists, it would never make -- it would never see the light of day. They misjudged."

    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "You know, the Times had a front page story after this blew up, saying that Jared Kushner had championed Mohammad Bin Salman, known as MBS. So this is a personal reckoning from Jared. But many mainstream foreign policy writers also embraced him as a reformer. New York Times magazine piece from just a few months ago, the Prince That Will Remake The World."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TURNER",
      "utterance": "You can't sit something like this on the head of Jared Kushner. The reality is that Saudi Arabia is a complicated country. The U.S. relationship with Saudi Arabia is vastly complicated. And to be honest, the media is not so good writ large at accepting the idea that there is a gray area, that two things can be true at once, two conflicting things. It is not an easy tightrope to watch for any administration, how to deal with a regime that promises to make reforms and starts taking steps in that direction, you know, but still has some dirty bath water to deal with."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "KURTZ",
      "utterance": "You might recall Newsweek's top editors and reports were fired and others quit while they were bravely digging into allegations involving their parent company. Now, Manhattan DA Cyrus Vance, Jr., has charged parent company, IBT media and Christian Media and their bosses with creating a fake output to defraud lenders into providing millions of dollars supposedly for computer services that were allegedly used to keep the magazine afloat. Now, IBT's cofounder denied the charges, and said this is a political retaliation by Vance. Sadly, it turns out the ousted Newsweek journalists were on to something big. Heads up, the following about a senior White House official is not an onion headline. Stephen Miller's third grade teacher, he was a loaner and ate glue. That was in the Hollywood Reporter, the teacher said Miller was a strange dude who would pour glue on his arm. Wait a minute, hold on. He was eight years old. Why was this published? Does journalistic scrutiny now extend to everything we ever did in elementary school? The L.A. school district has now put teacher Nikki Fiske on paid leave. Finally, Axios reporter Jonathan Swan was on MSNBC's \"Hardball\" with liberal host, Chris Matthews, who going off on Mitch McConnell's strong arm tactics on judicial nominees, and didn't like it when Swan offered some nonpartisan balance."
