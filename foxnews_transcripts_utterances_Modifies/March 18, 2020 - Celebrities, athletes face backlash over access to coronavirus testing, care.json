We're fighting in Iraq, ISIS, Afghanistan. But this is different. Some of the tools that the federal government is going to deploy right now have not been used. And one of them has to do with the fact that you would be able to do some of this because of a pandemic, specifically. These were -- one of those was a law that was put in place in the 1950. We've never had to use it. So a lot of this is different. And the federal government, I think, what you hear Jerome Powell, the surgeon general doing, is basically trying to set people's expectations.  Because this is all very new to us, we're only in day two or three of feeling, like, wow. This is -- I'm not saying that people didn't think it was serious before, but when you realize that it starts to sink in a little bit more that your way of life is different. You know, when I walked home last night, I didn't even have to look both ways before I crossed the street.   Mom, don't worry. I was being safe. But really at 6:15 at night in New York City, you start realize how stark the changes are. On day three of children being home from school and parents trying to work from home. Everybody, I think, is being super patient with each other. Everyone's trying to be kind. Everyone's trying to be good. And we look to the federal government to do the things that they are doing, like passing the bill today, getting the checks to people. It might not be enough. And that is one of the things that I think that you're hearing them saying. And while it might not be the most reassuring thing, it is more realistic. And it gets people to set their expectations accordingly. Save, plan, take care of neighbors, get charities in place, do whatever they can so that we can all work together to beat this.",

Invoke his many acts and provisions and laws as humanly possible, and just beat the hell out of this thing. Call for a nationwide shutdown, two weeks, three weeks, however long it takes. The whole country self quarantines. Only essential workers go out. You only have to go out if you go to the grocery store or to pick up something at the pharmacy. That's the only way you're going to beat this thing, because right now we're looking at a recession, could be a depression, because it's getting a lot worse. You have to mobilize the military. Maybe they build MASH units outside of cities. You have to rally the country around make in America. Do that instead of relying on China. Doctors and hospitals, they need to be doing as much as possible. And the FED needs to step up even more. At this point, we heard Dr. Birx say that this is now infecting young people in Europe.   That means all these young people at spring break are putting everyone's life at risk. And to say that this is something we just need to focus on the elderly, that gives everybody that's young in this country the feeling, like, hey, I can do whatever I want. We are seeing now they are doing investigations into the lungs of young people that get this virus. And they are destroying their lungs.  Some young people that get the virus are going to need to be on oxygen tanks if they don't get it. So I think president just needs to say forget about the markets.

We are talking about ultimately my back of the envelope calculation, trillions of dollars to rescue this country, individuals, and corporations. And I will break it down. So the total stimulus that they are talking about in phase three is north of $1 trillion. You've essentially shutdown a modern economy or large parts of it overnight. And you need to quickly make individuals who have no income solvent and liquid. So they have money to pay their bills, pay their utilities, pay their rent, buy food. And then you need to have corporations that are solvent and liquid. And you're going to have bailouts that make 2008 and 2009 look like picking strawberries on a Saturday.  That's what we are talking about. Because Jesse brought this up, if you don't act with speed and scale, to borrow words from the Wall Street Journal. You're going to turn a deep recession into something -- a long- lasting financial crisis that will look like the Great Depression. So for Steve Mnuchin to throw out 20 percent unemployment -- there's a forecast from JPMorgan out, saying that the second quarter economy in this country is going to contract 14 percent.  So that is Great Depression levels. If you don't start literally sending checks to people, we are not talking about $1,000. We're talking about $2,000. Send it to the people who need it who are out of work. Don't send it to me. I've got a job. I am sitting here in front of a TV camera. And they are going to have to rescue industry after industry.  That's where the political fight is going to get ugly, because they're going to require restrictions on how these companies operate.

Everybody's mad because you're bailing out Wall Street, understood. Nobody wants to bail out Wall Street, but the banks were insolvent. Right now, the banks are OK. It's actually people who need help. This is actually the man on the street, the man on the farm, the man in the small town. All of these people are going to need help.

Another example, a scientific paper predicted that the presence of SARS-like viruses in bats, together with the practice of eating them, is a time bomb. That warning was from 2007, now a warning from me, 2014, six years in my book, Not Cool, on page 136, I warned readers that reusable shopping bags that one study linked them to a 46 percent increase in deaths from food- borne illnesses. They raise the risk by harboring viruses that could go from your bag to the food you share with your family. Reusable feed bags might have also killed millions of piglets seven years ago by spreading a novel swine virus. Other research among humans shows how viruses spread with similar bags, making people sick. So why is this important? As states ban plastic bags, you're supposed to rely on reusables, which in a time like this ain't good. We're told to steer clear of contaminated surfaces, yet we carry one to stores, schools, workplaces, and put our food in it. Right now, it makes sense to postpone these bans. Hell, we are postponing everything else. It's a vector we can easily control. So here's the good news. We aren't running out of food, and we probably won't.  The bad news, those bags you put that food in aren't helping. Some viruses spread through good intentions gone bad. The best intention now is to ask for single-use bags, plastic, or paper.

They're just really good right now. When I'm home alone on the bike, I know all the trainers. But bike, if you can get a used indoor cycle or any kind of equipment, it's going to get you through these long, hard periods. My second person I love, of course, Scott Adams. You got to wake up every morning at 10:00 a.m. -- at 10:00 a.m. Go to his Twitter feed. He does a live Periscope and he has the most optimistic research and information on the coronavirus. It's a good way to start your day. And finally, all the workers at Fox News who are walking around cleaning the door handles, and the desks, and the keyboard, they are nonstop cleaning everything.

We're fighting in Iraq, ISIS, Afghanistan. But this is different. Some of the tools that the federal government is going to deploy right now have not been used. And one of them has to do with the fact that you would be able to do some of this because of a pandemic, specifically. These were -- one of those was a law that was put in place in the 1950. We've never had to use it. So a lot of this is different. And the federal government, I think, what you hear Jerome Powell, the surgeon general doing, is basically trying to set people's expectations. Because this is all very new to us, we're only in day two or three of feeling, like, wow. This is -- I'm not saying that people didn't think it was serious before, but when you realize that it starts to sink in a little bit more that your way of life is different. You know, when I walked home last night, I didn't even have to look both ways before I crossed the street. Mom, don't worry. I was being safe. But really at 6:15 at night in New York City, you start realize how stark the changes are. On day three of children being home from school and parents trying to work from home. Everybody, I think, is being super patient with each other. Everyone's trying to be kind. Everyone's trying to be good. And we look to the federal government to do the things that they are doing, like passing the bill today, getting the checks to people. It might not be enough. And that is one of the things that I think that you're hearing them saying. And while it might not be the most reassuring thing, it is more realistic. And it gets people to set their expectations accordingly. Save, plan, take care of neighbors, get charities in place, do whatever they can so that we can all work together to beat this."

      "utterance": "And that's why we have to just get this thing over with as soon as possible. The president cannot do this step-by- step approach. He needs to just declare war on Coronavirus. Invoke his many acts and provisions and laws as humanly possible, and just beat the hell out of this thing. Call for a nationwide shutdown, two weeks, three weeks, however long it takes. The whole country self quarantines. Only essential workers go out. You only have to go out if you go to the grocery store or to pick up something at the pharmacy. That's the only way you're going to beat this thing, because right now we're looking at a recession, could be a depression, because it's getting a lot worse. You have to mobilize the military. Maybe they build MASH units outside of cities. You have to rally the country around make in America. Do that instead of relying on China. Doctors and hospitals, they need to be doing as much as possible. And the FED needs to step up even more. At this point, we heard Dr. Birx say that this is now infecting young people in Europe. That means all these young people at spring break are putting everyone's life at risk. And to say that this is something we just need to focus on the elderly, that gives everybody that's young in this country the feeling, like, hey, I can do whatever I want. We are seeing now they are doing investigations into the lungs of young people that get this virus. And they are destroying their lungs. Some young people that get the virus are going to need to be on oxygen tanks if they don't get it. So I think president just needs to say forget about the markets. We're going to have to go all in on this thing if we are going to come out on the other side, and the country will rally around that."

We are talking about ultimately my back of the envelope calculation, trillions of dollars to rescue this country, individuals, and corporations. And I will break it down. So the total stimulus that they are talking about in phase three is north of $1 trillion. You've essentially shutdown a modern economy or large parts of it overnight. And you need to quickly make individuals who have no income solvent and liquid. So they have money to pay their bills, pay their utilities, pay their rent, buy food. And then you need to have corporations that are solvent and liquid. And you're going to have bailouts that make 2008 and 2009 look like picking strawberries on a Saturday. That's what we are talking about. Because Jesse brought this up, if you don't act with speed and scale, to borrow words from the Wall Street Journal. You're going to turn a deep recession into something -- a long- lasting financial crisis that will look like the Great Depression. So for Steve Mnuchin to throw out 20 percent unemployment -- there's a forecast from JPMorgan out, saying that the second quarter economy in this country is going to contract 14 percent. So that is Great Depression levels. If you don't start literally sending checks to people, we are not talking about $1,000. We're talking about $2,000. Send it to the people who need it who are out of work. Don't send it to me. I've got a job. I am sitting here in front of a TV camera. And they are going to have to rescue industry after industry. That's where the political fight is going to get ugly, because they're going to require restrictions on how these companies operate. Airlines, we're talking about $50 billion in loans for the airlines. You're going to talk about leisure and hospitality, retailers, you name it. It is going to be bailouts from coast-to-coast.

Like, if you think back to 2008 -- and to Dagen's point, I mean that fight was horrendous. I was at there at the White House at the time and you everybody fighting. Everybody's mad because you're bailing out Wall Street, understood. Nobody wants to bail out Wall Street, but the banks were insolvent. Right now, the banks are OK. It's actually people who need help. This is actually the man on the street, the man on the farm, the man in the small town. All of these people are going to need help. And I would just for doing something really big and also really fast, and showing that the federal government is going to be the backstop, because we will get through. And we will be stronger on the other side about -- but in the meantime, when you have to help people. I don't think it will be a problem getting these bills through. It's going to hurt to look at the deficit numbers. That's going to be something we will have to commit to and figure out. But saving people's day-to-day lives -- if we're going to do all of this for the health of people, then of course we have to do everything to help for their economic health on the other side."

Another example, a scientific paper predicted that the presence of SARS-like viruses in bats, together with the practice of eating them, is a time bomb. That warning was from 2007, now a warning from me, 2014, six years in my book, Not Cool, on page 136, I warned readers that reusable shopping bags that one study linked them to a 46 percent increase in deaths from food- borne illnesses. They raise the risk by harboring viruses that could go from your bag to the food you share with your family. Reusable feed bags might have also killed millions of piglets seven years ago by spreading a novel swine virus. Other research among humans shows how viruses spread with similar bags, making people sick. So why is this important? As states ban plastic bags, you're supposed to rely on reusables, which in a time like this ain't good. We're told to steer clear of contaminated surfaces, yet we carry one to stores, schools, workplaces, and put our food in it. Right now, it makes sense to postpone these bans. Hell, we are postponing everything else. It's a vector we can easily control. So here's the good news. We aren't running out of food, and we probably won't. The bad news, those bags you put that food in aren't helping. Some viruses spread through good intentions gone bad. The best intention now is to ask for single-use bags, plastic, or paper.

I don't like -- I get plastic anxiety as well. It's like with water bottles and things like that. But this point about the bags and carrying things around and everything, it -- we know that it causes more problems. And so rethinking some of these things, it's not too late. Its -- you can do this. You can turn back things right away. The president has already shown this.

Or they say, you know, raise the minimum wage in New York City, and then they fire half the waitresses. So sometimes these things go the wrong way. I used to make fun of people, like germaphobes. Jerry Seinfeld, how many episodes on Seinfeld did they make fun of his fear of germs? I mean, Kramer installing the garbage disposal in the shower and makes Jerry a salad, or Elaine sneezes on the pasta primavera and gets the NBC executive sick.

We just need to re- evaluate everything that we've been doing. And after we beat this thing, we are going to look back and say. Do we need to start having more people work remotely? Why are we living on top of each other in these cities? The handshake, is the handshake an outmoded concept in this country? We are overly reliant on China. The borders are wide open. All of these things are going to have to be re- evaluated one at a time."

You know it's some guy in a room going let's stick it to the oil and the chemical companies. It's not based on any research. As you pointed out, it goes back more than a decade knowing that these bags aren't sanitary. I banned the handshake a while ago, just to tell you, because about 1 out of every 20 dudes who shake your hand want to do that weird little tickle thing, which is just creepy.

So I think that's very real. Now, I do think it's not a reason to say let's give up on this idea, because, you know -- look, I think you can look up in the trees in Central Park or any part in this country and you see plastic bags, and you know about the oceans. So I think coming up with biodegradable substances that could make that bag is a good idea. I just don't want us to use this as an opportunity to go back on lots of our efforts in terms of making sure that the environment, the fact that we see, you know, climates rising. You know, we just can't give up. I think we got to stay focused on what we are already doing, make it better. Don't allow that to somehow communicate this terrible disease. Today, I was shocked. I'm telling you the truth. I was shocked that said 475 people died in one day today in Italy. I just -- it's hard to believe. This is what we are going through as a world right now."

And we learn from Florida where Joe Biden won every single county that older folks have really good memories about communist Cuba. And they actually go out and vote their heart and their head, because that's exactly what happened. Bernie Sanders' team, this is according to Biden's camp, ran more than 4600 ads on TV in Florida attacking Joe Biden on social security.

But I think from the Biden perspective, it's doing what we saw earlier. He stands up and he gives a speech and says here's what I think we should be doing, how we should be coming together as an American people to address this problem. And at the same time, he's reaching out to Bernie Sanders' supporters I think the literal quote, Dana, is \"I hear you.\" I hear what you've been saying in terms of your support for Senate for Senator Sanders and making the case that he wants them and he wants their votes and he's willing to work for their votes. So I think you're going to see much more of that, much more people coming from their living rooms if necessary. We've got a little bit of a hiatus here, three weeks before the next set of primaries. But after yesterday, with Biden sweeping so clearly, sweeping in Illinois, Arizona, and Florida, I just don't think that there's much have a realistic chance, realistic chance that Sanders catches up, absent some catastrophic event.

At this point in the game, I don't understand the never Biden movement. If you're a Bernie supporter, and Biden gets the nomination and it's Election Day, you have a choice. It's between Donald Trump and Joe Biden. How do you not as a Bernie supporter, just vote for Joe Biden? Like if Joe Biden becomes president, you can pull Joe to the left. If Donald Trump is reelected, you can't pull Donald Trump to the left. So the only thing I can think of is one of two reasons. One, they want Joe Biden to lose because they want to say I told you so. You can't run an establishment candidate. You got to run a socialist. Or they honestly think that they could never bring themselves to vote for anybody other than a socialist because they're just too pure ideologically.

If it's what you said, boy, that is just, you know, to me all about money craving in the worst. And, you know, it's ironic.

Like, I would do that because I want to do something for my family. And I can't say that that's fair or unfair. I wouldn't want to knock somebody else out, but everybody is trying to do the best for their people, whether it's what you're saying in terms of the owners wanting to make sure. I don't really get -- I don't think what -- Juan, I don't think what you're saying is accurate. If you're doing the Thunder, like -- I mean, I love the Oklahoma thunder, believe me, but I don't know if that's going to tell you exactly where to focus in Oklahoma. There's going to be bigger problems. But I also just think that it's reality. The good news, there are improvements in testing. There are tests now coming in all over, plus there could be an innovation where there is a test where you can do it yourself. And that would alert you to whether you have the virus and you would know whether to self-quarantine or to stay away from others that were vulnerable.

Anyway, OK, I'm going to defend Vanessa Hudgens because I'm going to defend every single person who is getting slammed for saying silly, or light, or mistaken comments in this fog of war, right? Because there's a lot of -- there's this -- there's this little sport going on among the press, slamming people for being human, for not assessing the situation when they should have assessed it. Because everybody is looking at this differently and trying to figure out a way to deal with it in their own heads. You know, we slammed Generation Z at spring break, even though I know that if I was 20, I probably would have been there too. I got to explain to again, my niece after the show why she can't go outside because he's driving her parents crazy.

It's called March Meowdness, as part of the Cats Versus Cancer Charity. Every day, there's a head to head matchup where you vote for your favorite cat until one is called the winner. Cats Versus Cancer is a nonprofit. And volunteers, they organize the whole thing. It's very fun and interactive. Now, this is Sahar. This is my assistant's cat. Hamdah Salhut, this is her cat, Sahar. She's in this year's first bracket. So if you check out the site, be sure to give this perfect kitty that was written for me. Your vote on Instagram, it's Sahar the Cat. And she's very beautiful, very, very beautiful. I also just wanted to mention that Fox is doing something really cool. Fox News is offering free access to national and local news to all viewers. So you can stay informed with the latest updates on everything at foxnews.com, the Fox News app, and fox.com. All of that is going to be free for viewers if you want to check it out. And don't forget to vote for Sahar."

Take a look at this. That's the winner of the Iditarod in Alaska. The winner of the race was Thomas Werner of Norway. Now, I didn't get to watch the race. That's not how I know about it. I know about it because New York Post sportswriter Mike Vaccaro wrote that with basketball, baseball, and even the NASCAR races off of T.V. due to the coronavirus. The only thing left for him to watch was the dog race, so he streamed it. And Mike Vaccaro said he had a great time doing it. But even with that, he had to say that the post-race celebration in Nome, Alaska had to be called off because of the virus. It's still time to give a big hug. And a big, big round of applause to the winning dogs in this year's dog race. All right, Greg, you're up."

Number one, I'm going to mention Peloton because exercise is the most important thing you can do right now, in my mind, to keep yourself sane. You don't have to do peloton. They're just really good right now. When I'm home alone on the bike, I know all the trainers. But bike, if you can get a used indoor cycle or any kind of equipment, it's going to get you through these long, hard periods. My second person I love, of course, Scott Adams. You got to wake up every morning at 10:00 a.m. -- at 10:00 a.m. Go to his Twitter feed. He does a live Periscope and he has the most optimistic research and information on the coronavirus. It's a good way to start your day. And finally, all the workers at Fox News who are walking around cleaning the door handles, and the desks, and the keyboard, they are nonstop cleaning everything. And that's an important thing because every time they're doing it, they're killing vectors. So I love these people."

Carly Boyd stood outside the window of his nursing home and held up her hand after she got engaged. The nursing home was in on the surprise, raise the blinds. Boyd said her granddad was so happy, he kept asking when is the wedding. My granddad, may he rest in peace, would have gone, he's a bomb."
