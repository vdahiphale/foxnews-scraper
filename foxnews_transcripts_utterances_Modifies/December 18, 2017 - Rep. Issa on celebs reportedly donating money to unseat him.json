That is the 70th time this year we have seen the Dow notch a record. We have never seen that in history. Remember, we had already tied the record going back in 1995. Well, we broke it today.  And we also saw better than 5,000 points added to the Dow. And that is just so far this year. And we have never seen that.  Now, a lot of that has to do with tax cuts that are coming sooner rather than later.  Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto, and this is \"Your World.\" And what in the world to make of, well, a process that is now going in rapid-fire fashion, where tomorrow, at this time, we are told it is distinctly possible that the House and the Senate will have voted on a tax cut package they each hope to bring up to the president of the United States for his little old John Hancock, or signature, whatever you to call it, before Christmas.  To Chad Pergram on what happens now -- Chad.",

      "sentences": "The House of Representatives is going to consider this bill midday tomorrow.  They shouldn't have a problem passing that. And then it goes over to the Senate, where they will probably start the debate late tomorrow afternoon. There are 10 hours total of debate. We do not expect them to use that all, five hours for the Democrats, five hours for the Republicans.   We expect the Republicans it to yield that back. And there's a possibility that the Senate could pass the bill late tomorrow night. If not, it would probably be on Wednesday. They just got a boost here in the past half-hour or so. Mike Lee, Republican senator from Utah, has indicated he is going to support the bill. He wanted to go through all 500-plus pages, make sure he understood everything that was in it. He's going to be a yes. Now they turn to the other two wild cards, Susan Collins of Maine and also Jeff Flake of Arizona. I should point out that they were yeas on the bill back in late November. There was only one Republican nay, Bob Corker of Tennessee, but he signaled on Friday that he is going to be a yes.   Republican sources indicate to me that they should be able to pass this bill no matter what. Again, they just need a simple majority. There is going to be a maximum of 99 senators voting on this bill when it moves through the Senate. John McCain, the Republican senator from Arizona, has gone back home. He is going to be there over Christmas. He indicates he hopes that his cancer treatments are going well, that he should be able to return to Washington. But even if they just -- say they lose Susan Collins or say they lose Flake or something else. They would still have, at a minimum, 50 yeas on the Republican side of the aisle. So, 50 out of 99, that passes the bill.  They would only need Mike Pence, the vice president, to break a tie if there was in fact an even number of senators voting, say, 98 senators. Say Thad Cochran, the Republican from Mississippi, did not show up. But we're told that he is supposed to be here.   So, Republicans are hoping that they can move this bill tomorrow, Neil.",

And we have seen very little movement as this transitioned from a frantic search-and-rescue effort to try to get to people who are still in those cars had derailed, and then it transitioned into -- sadly, into a recovery operation. All of the people who were killed, we are told, were passengers on the train. There were five cars, five vehicles, including a semi, that were hits on the freeway going southbound on Interstate 5. Nobody in those vehicles were killed. At least 77 people were transported to local hospitals. But we understand now that the NTSB is on its way with a go team from Washington, D.C. They will preserve the scene as it is right now until that team gets here and can look at this.  And only then will they begin to take those bodies off of those train cars and then remove those trains from the trestle and off of the freeway. It was a harrowing scene out here this morning and right after it happened. There was lots of vehicles. This happened at the height of rush hour this morning, again, about an hour south of Seattle. This is a stretch of highway that goes all the way from Canada down to Mexico. It was loaded with cars. And when that train jumped the track, there were lots of people who were trying to rush to the rescue of those who are on those tracks. This is a stretch of track that goes straight and parallels straight down Interstate 5, and then takes a sharp turn, a left-hand turn, over the freeway. And that is exactly where the derailment happened this morning. And, of course, speed will be looked at. A lot of things will be looked at. But we understand that the top speed here is supposed be 79 miles per hour. This was the maiden voyage of this new route going from Seattle down to Portland. The whole purpose of this $181 million route was to speed up the travel between those two major cities by about 10 or 15 minutes. And this is the first time. Today was the initial run of that route from Seattle down to Portland. Just a terrible tragedy we have. This is a route that is 60,000 cars per day use. This is an interstate that has been shut down since this morning, and will be until the NTSB can get out here and assess the situation. And only then will they begin to start to clear up the mess of concrete and steel that you see behind me. And a long investigation to come. Of the 12 cars and two engines that were part of that train, 13 units jumped the tracks. Several of them are now on Interstate 5 -- Neil.",

And that was the case here, were you had a 30- mile-an-hour speed restriction. If you look at the wreckage and the way it is distributed, this train had no locomotives on either end. The lead locomotive is the white locomotive laying in the dirt off alongside the interstate. The rear locomotive is that dark blue more conventional Amtrak-looking locomotive that is still on the track. Now, the things that strike me is the track is relatively undisturbed. If you look at the aerial shots, the track does not look like it has been broken up at all. The lead locomotive unit, however, is straight off that curve, almost like it drew a tangent, like it derailed and went straight on, like -- because of high speed.

And that is on top of the 1,000 flights that Delta had to cancel yesterday during the height of this power outage. Now, Georgia Power believes the cause of this outage was a massive fire that broke out due to faulty equipment in an underground electrical facility. Now, ordinarily, there are multiple redundant systems that would kick in, supplying electricity to this airport, but we're told that the flames were so intense, that they actually knocked out those backup systems. Now, airport officials say that this is really a freak event that they have never had to deal with in the past. Even so, they say there are lessons learned moving forward. Now, Georgia Power says it continues to investigate the cause of this fire, company officials pledging to improve the reliability of the system providing power to this airport and hopefully preventing something like this from ever happening again in the future -- Neil.",

Remember the attack on the Jewish center in Argentina, Buenos Aires, Argentina. They actually arrested Hezbollah operatives in the United States. They were operating in Latin America. They were friendly certainly with Chavez and may still be friendly with the Venezuelan government down there. There have been attacks in Bulgaria that they have been implicated in, Cyprus, Egypt, Azerbaijan. They're supporting the Taliban in Afghanistan against U.S. forces. I would have liked to have us put pressure both on Iran and Hezbollah. That is looking at something in the rear-view mirror.",

Our first priority is to take care of those passengers and those people who have been impacted and their families and our crew members of this terrible incident. We will be setting up a family assistance center. And more information will come out on that. We did give the 800 number out earlier. And we are going to do everything we can over the next few days and weeks to support these passengers and their families. But I can share with you the facts that we know at this time. Amtrak Cascades train 501 derailed at 7:33 a.m. Pacific time, with some cars leaving the overpass to Highway I-5. Train 501 consisted of 14 cars, including two locomotives. The consist was being led by a Siemens Charger locomotive, and a P-52 was trailing the consist and was not under power. There were also 12 Talgo passenger cars, including business class and coach cars, and a bistro food service car. Talgo coach car has 36 seats. We had 77 customers traveling with, us as well as seven Amtrak crew members. Immediately following the derailment, our emergency services management team was initiated. We have many people on site now. And we have more people coming in from the East Coast to be able to support this endeavor. This is Sound Transit tracks and it's dispatched by the BNSF. Amtrak is a vendor for the Washington State Department of Transportation for the Amtrak Cascades trains. Once again, Amtrak is going to do everything possible to take care of the passengers, employees, and their families affected by today's event. Thank you.",

Amtrak has been testing this stretch of track for several weeks, but today was the first time passengers have used it. The track themselves are now new, but they have been modified to handle Amtrak traffic. Before today, if you got from Seattle to Portland, you had to go along the Puget Sound, the waterway. But the winding turns, the single-lane tunnels and the freight traffic tended to slow the trip down. So this new route was meant to shave off between 10 and 15 minutes.

And there's a possibility that the Senate could pass the bill late tomorrow night. If not, it would probably be on Wednesday. They just got a boost here in the past half-hour or so. Mike Lee, Republican senator from Utah, has indicated he is going to support the bill. He wanted to go through all 500-plus pages, make sure he understood everything that was in it. He's going to be a yes. Now they turn to the other two wild cards, Susan Collins of Maine and also Jeff Flake of Arizona. I should point out that they were yeas on the bill back in late November. There was only one Republican nay, Bob Corker of Tennessee, but he signaled on Friday that he is going to be a yes. Republican sources indicate to me that they should be able to pass this bill no matter what. Again, they just need a simple majority. There is going to be a maximum of 99 senators voting on this bill when it moves through the Senate. John McCain, the Republican senator from Arizona, has gone back home. He is going to be there over Christmas. He indicates he hopes that his cancer treatments are going well, that he should be able to return to Washington. But even if they just -- say they lose Susan Collins or say they lose Flake or something else. They would still have, at a minimum, 50 yeas on the Republican side of the aisle. So, 50 out of 99, that passes the bill. They would only need Mike Pence, the vice president, to break a tie if there was in fact an even number of senators voting, say, 98 senators. Say Thad Cochran, the Republican from Mississippi, did not show up. But we're told that he is supposed to be here. So, Republicans are hoping that they can move this bill tomorrow, Neil."

So, once you get a win, and things are still looking good, I think they're going to hit each one as we move forward. And I think that's great news, because I got news for you. The deficit are still ridiculously too high. Spending and government spending is just ridiculously too high.

And I think it's going to be the main issue for 2018. Of course there's always going to be pullback. It could be precipitated by something totally unrelated. And, in fact, I think that would be the case. But the fact is that global markets like this. It means that there's more demand for their goods. Europe, for example, exports quite a bit to the U.S. So, if the U.S. does in fact growth at a 4 percent clip or above, as Dr. Laffer alluded, then there's more demand for goods globally.

      "utterance": "Yes, Neil, we have been out here for about three hours. We have seen very little change in the scene behind me about 500 yards down the freeway. You can still see all of those train cars over the top of that trestle. And we have seen very little movement as this transitioned from a frantic search-and-rescue effort to try to get to people who are still in those cars had derailed, and then it transitioned into -- sadly, into a recovery operation. All of the people who were killed, we are told, were passengers on the train. There were five cars, five vehicles, including a semi, that were hits on the freeway going southbound on Interstate 5. Nobody in those vehicles were killed. At least 77 people were transported to local hospitals. But we understand now that the NTSB is on its way with a go team from Washington, D.C. They will preserve the scene as it is right now until that team gets here and can look at this. And only then will they begin to take those bodies off of those train cars and then remove those trains from the trestle and off of the freeway. It was a harrowing scene out here this morning and right after it happened. There was lots of vehicles. This happened at the height of rush hour this morning, again, about an hour south of Seattle. This is a stretch of highway that goes all the way from Canada down to Mexico. It was loaded with cars. And when that train jumped the track, there were lots of people who were trying to rush to the rescue of those who are on those tracks. This is a stretch of track that goes straight and parallels straight down Interstate 5, and then takes a sharp turn, a left-hand turn, over the freeway. And that is exactly where the derailment happened this morning. And, of course, speed will be looked at. A lot of things will be looked at. But we understand that the top speed here is supposed be 79 miles per hour. This was the maiden voyage of this new route going from Seattle down to Portland. The whole purpose of this $181 million route was to speed up the travel between those two major cities by about 10 or 15 minutes. And this is the first time. Today was the initial run of that route from Seattle down to Portland. Just a terrible tragedy we have. This is a route that is 60,000 cars per day use. This is an interstate that has been shut down since this morning, and will be until the NTSB can get out here and assess the situation. And only then will they begin to start to clear up the mess of concrete and steel that you see behind me. And a long investigation to come. Of the 12 cars and two engines that were part of that train, 13 units jumped the tracks. Several of them are now on Interstate 5 -- Neil."

You're going to have a signals guy. You are going to have a single performance guy. You are going to have an emergency response guy. All those groups will break up. They will assisted by parties, including the regional rail authority, Amtrak, the Federal Railroad Administration. Those groups are going to break up in little parties and they will do individual investigations of their particular areas of expertise."

    {
      "speaker": "QUIMBY",
      "utterance": "Well, I know it was said earlier it's a 79-mile-an-hour railroad, but this particular curve I believe was about a 30-mile-an-hour curve. You have to slow down for this curve, just like on a regular interstate. It may be an 80-mile-an-hour interstate, but you have to slow down and certain curves and areas. And that was the case here, were you had a 30- mile-an-hour speed restriction. If you look at the wreckage and the way it is distributed, this train had no locomotives on either end. The lead locomotive is the white locomotive laying in the dirt off alongside the interstate. The rear locomotive is that dark blue more conventional Amtrak-looking locomotive that is still on the track. Now, the things that strike me is the track is relatively undisturbed. If you look at the aerial shots, the track does not look like it has been broken up at all. The lead locomotive unit, however, is straight off that curve, almost like it drew a tangent, like it derailed and went straight on, like -- because of high speed. So, that looks like may be an indicator of high speed that they're going to look at."

Atlanta's Hartsfield-International Airport, one of the busiest, some say the busiest, airport on the airport on the planet, the lights are back on, but let's just say the flights are not -- after this."

You might recall she was a little concerned that by getting rid of the individual mandate, a lot of Americans would suffer with higher premiums and the like. Guarantees or at least assurances were made to her that, in the spending measure, there would be provisions put in that to make sure that the pain is not that widespread, and that premiums do not shoot up. Whatever the case and whatever allowances were allowed, she is a yes vote on this. So, it is looking more and more like a sure thing once it gets to the Senate after their debate and after the House votes on its measure right now, the conferee measure, which will be the measure the Senate will vote on as well, this is looking increasingly like a done deal. Meanwhile, Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport is trying to get back to normal, but not before the lights went out, and 1,600 flights just went nowhere.

Really, all of the carriers were affected, but the biggest one we look at, of course, is Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines. Today alone, they had to cancel 400 flights. And that is on top of the 1,000 flights that Delta had to cancel yesterday during the height of this power outage. Now, Georgia Power believes the cause of this outage was a massive fire that broke out due to faulty equipment in an underground electrical facility. Now, ordinarily, there are multiple redundant systems that would kick in, supplying electricity to this airport, but we're told that the flames were so intense, that they actually knocked out those backup systems. Now, airport officials say that this is really a freak event that they have never had to deal with in the past. Even so, they say there are lessons learned moving forward. Now, Georgia Power says it continues to investigate the cause of this fire, company officials pledging to improve the reliability of the system providing power to this airport and hopefully preventing something like this from ever happening again in the future -- Neil."

And pandemonium and chaos. Imagine being in an airport for hours in pitch black,what goes through your mind.

But what it did was, it reinforced the emergency operation plans, the SOPs and the functionalities of the Port Authority and NYPD to restore order. You did not see that here, because it wasn't a gunshot. It did not sound like a gunshot. It was lights out, but still terrifying nonetheless. And I would say, I would posit that anything that has to do with the airport, in the light of 9/11, it has a sinister overtone subliminally to the American conscience. I really do."

Now, a lot of people, in retrospect, say, boy, that is an immediate rush, like sort of an unnecessary rush, over life-and-death issues like the safety of humankind, yet a lot of criticism from the left over a rush to get tax cuts done, which, come to think about it, are just with -- about a little bit more money in your wallet. So, what you think of that? Let's ask national security expert Peter Brookes. It is a little inconsistent, Peter. What do you think?"

    {
      "speaker": "PETER BROOKES, FORMER CIA OFFICER",
      "utterance": "I would've hoped that we would have kept pressure on Hezbollah as well. There's a number of reasons, Neil, because not only were they trafficking drugs to the United States and Europe, but they also used the profits for that for do other nefarious things, including supporting terrorism, supporting the Syrian regime, Iraqi -- Shia militias in Iraq. So, this is very troubling. And in the end, it appears, if the article is correct, right, of course -- you know, this is reporting."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BROOKES",
      "utterance": "And we should hear from the other side, and maybe others want to look into this, including Congress. But it would have been -- in the end, what we got was a bad nuclear deal. And Hezbollah -- we missed opportunities to take apart Hezbollah and its international global enterprise of terror and drug trafficking. So, I do not think we did very well in the end if these reports are correct."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Yes, without characterizing the intent here, I talk to the fellow who wrote the article, and he was telling me on Fox Business that it was about getting everybody on board, that if Hezbollah was not on board with this, if some of these nefarious elements in the region were not on board with this, there would be no Iran deal. And so the administration, at the time, the way it was explained, pushed to ignore certain things so they could at least get a commitment on this deal and come back and revisit this other stuff. But, of course, that other stuff was never revisited."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BROOKES",
      "utterance": "Yes, that's the way it appears. And that is troubling, and we cannot go back and replay this, can we? We cannot examine what they call the hypothetical counterfactual, if they had done something differently. I believe that we really had Iran in a situation there with the international sanctions that we could have continued to put pressure on them, and I think they would've come to the table. But you cannot go back and examine that either. So, really, my concern, besides the drug trafficking, is this international enterprise of Hezbollah. I mean, Neil, we are talking about ISIS, Al Qaeda, and Hezbollah. I mean, this is a very powerful organization that has American blood on its hands. Remember the 1980s and Beirut. Remember the attack on the Jewish center in Argentina, Buenos Aires, Argentina. They actually arrested Hezbollah operatives in the United States. They were operating in Latin America. They were friendly certainly with Chavez and may still be friendly with the Venezuelan government down there. There have been attacks in Bulgaria that they have been implicated in, Cyprus, Egypt, Azerbaijan. They're supporting the Taliban in Afghanistan against U.S. forces. I would have liked to have us put pressure both on Iran and Hezbollah. That is looking at something in the rear-view mirror."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Well, clearly, you get a sense that time was a wasting. And I think of the pallets of cash that were put on private jets to close the deal. We are told that that had nothing to do with the deal being signed off. Then we got word of this. And what other allowances might have been made? I just think that, in Washington, we are kind of used to a double standard here. If you're going to rush a life-and-death deal and make no note of it, then why make a big deal about a rushed transaction on taxes and make a big deal of that? Much could be said about the way the whole health care thing was. I'm getting outside your field here, I understand."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BROOKES",
      "utterance": "Yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "But my point is, my point is That this is something rushing that would be a far more concern, to me, at least, because this involves bad guys with bad weapons doing bad things with them."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BROOKES",
      "utterance": "Yes, of course. And, of course, I'm not sure we got a -- I don't think we got a good deal on the nuclear deal either. It has sunset provisions. In other words, they're going to be held up potentially if we know what they are really doing for 10 years. We can't visit military sites where they could be doing covert nuclear research. They are allowed to do research on -- continuing research on their centrifuges. There's all sorts of problems here. So, I think we did not do well in any case. I understand the intent of the Obama administration. And they were focused on that. And I think it would be fair to ask some of their senior policy makers to defend what has been laid out in this Politico article. And it also shows people how difficult international affairs can be."

That is virtually icing this for passage and a signature by the president of the United States. Then the question becomes is if they go into an effect January 1, that you could possibly start seeing it in your paycheck as early as February. Then what? Will are you going to be seeing? Certified public accountant -- this guy's a genius with this stuff -- Dan Geltrude. Dan, what are we likely to see, you think? DANIEL GELTRUDE, GELTRUDE & COMPANY: I think we are going to see changes taking effect in our paychecks, let's say, starting in February. But let's also keep in mind that not everybody is going to be getting a tax benefit here. So, you could have some people that are going to owe more money, so now they are going to have make those adjustments accordingly. Remember, if you are underpaid, you're subject to underpayment penalties. This is not all good news for everybody, Neil."

I think there is more good. I think most people are going to benefit. And, as you and I have talked about before, the real issue is, is with the blue states, high income earners. That is where the problem is. Those people are really going to feel it."

On behalf of everybody at Amtrak, we are deeply saddened about what has happened here this morning. Our first priority is to take care of those passengers and those people who have been impacted and their families and our crew members of this terrible incident. We will be setting up a family assistance center. And more information will come out on that. We did give the 800 number out earlier. And we are going to do everything we can over the next few days and weeks to support these passengers and their families. But I can share with you the facts that we know at this time. Amtrak Cascades train 501 derailed at 7:33 a.m. Pacific time, with some cars leaving the overpass to Highway I-5. Train 501 consisted of 14 cars, including two locomotives. The consist was being led by a Siemens Charger locomotive, and a P-52 was trailing the consist and was not under power. There were also 12 Talgo passenger cars, including business class and coach cars, and a bistro food service car. Talgo coach car has 36 seats. We had 77 customers traveling with, us as well as seven Amtrak crew members. Immediately following the derailment, our emergency services management team was initiated. We have many people on site now. And we have more people coming in from the East Coast to be able to support this endeavor. This is Sound Transit tracks and it's dispatched by the BNSF. Amtrak is a vendor for the Washington State Department of Transportation for the Amtrak Cascades trains. Once again, Amtrak is going to do everything possible to take care of the passengers, employees, and their families affected by today's event. Thank you."

Five vehicles were hit on the southbound side of Interstate 5, along with two semitrucks, and the southbound lanes are shut down. The death poll is still being reported as six, with numerous injuries ranging from bumps and bruises to severe back and neck injuries. Amtrak has been testing this stretch of track for several weeks, but today was the first time passengers have used it. The track themselves are now new, but they have been modified to handle Amtrak traffic. Before today, if you got from Seattle to Portland, you had to go along the Puget Sound, the waterway. But the winding turns, the single-lane tunnels and the freight traffic tended to slow the trip down. So this new route was meant to shave off between 10 and 15 minutes. But the mayor of Lakewood, about eight miles from where the accident happened, warned just last week that high speeds along the new stretch could have tragic consequences. And, sadly, he was correct -- Neil."

Speed could be a factor. We will keep you posted on that. Also keep you updated on the impending tax vote that is due tomorrow on Capitol Hill and the Senate, maybe sometime tomorrow night, and so the president's signature possibly by the next day. \"The Five\" is now.
