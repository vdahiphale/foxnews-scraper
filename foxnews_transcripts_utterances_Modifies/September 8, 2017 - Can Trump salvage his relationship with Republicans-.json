And I think that that was a big part of what sort of launched his inevitability towards winning the White House. And for people to be surprised by that now, he's not a conservative, he's never run as a conservative ideologue. He has gained strength off of the deep frustration among Republican voters towards Republican leadership.

You can't beat Mother Nature. Mother Nature is just all encompassing. And we've seen a lot of people who have been victims who have been showing compassion, they've been showing competence. And the administration has been doing a pretty good job, but every time you think you're going to get it handled, Mother Nature comes back. So she's winning this week. The other thing, the loser is Paul Ryan, and that seems like a pretty easy one. But just look at all the things he carried the water this week. Nancy Pelosi didn't lift a finger.

      "utterance": "Yes, but I would assume that this is a decision made by lower-level attorneys in DOJ. But it does set up the point that tax reform is a very, very big issue. People hate the IRS. They hate the tax code. And this is a good opportunity. And if this administration fails to win on tax reform, they are going to be in really big trouble."

      "utterance": "The winner of the week is Mother Nature. You can't beat Mother Nature. Mother Nature is just all encompassing. And we've seen a lot of people who have been victims who have been showing compassion, they've been showing competence. And the administration has been doing a pretty good job, but every time you think you're going to get it handled, Mother Nature comes back. So she's winning this week. The other thing, the loser is Paul Ryan, and that seems like a pretty easy one. But just look at all the things he carried the water this week. Nancy Pelosi didn't lift a finger. She's smiling more than when she was the speaker. She got the goldmine, he got the shaft, if I can quote Jerry Reed for a moment."
