We are supposed to have prosecutors -- now, I was a prosecutor for 27 years. We were supposed to be judicious when we got started, to figure out, where does the evidence lead, follow the rule of law. And instead, we have people announcing, if you elect me, I'll indict Donald Trump. So, it's no real surprise that when you have people breaking the ethics of prosecution for political persecution, that they're going to have suspect indictments. Their motivations are suspect. Their willingness to listen to a witness like Michael Cohen makes them suspect. And in this case, it seems like what we're guessing the indictment will look like is it will have legal frailties that will be subjected to a very legitimate motion to dismiss early on.",

So, it's hard to creep into their minds and figure it out.

He goes on to say: That's the same person who railroaded my 75-year-old former CFO Allen Weisselberg to take a plea deal. He strong armed Allen, which a judge is not allowed to do and treated my companies, which didn't plead, viciously. Appealing! So, a couple of things to break down there.

But, look, I've never had a case in front of this judge. I certainly reserve judgment. I think we're in a position where a fair-minded judge -- never mind getting to a jury and changes the venue and some of the issues there -- I think a fair minded judge is likely to recognize there's something fundamentally wrong that we're crossing the Rubicon with this political persecution. And thankfully, I suspect the indictment is going to be legally frail, and there'll be an opportunity for a judge to do the right thing. You know, we wish prosecutors would do the right thing. But the judges are kind of the backstop on that. So my hope is that despite some of the hysterics at the moment, despite some emotionality and frustration, the president certainly deserves to feel that this judge will do the right thing when he's faced with significant legal motions.",

You know, the grand jury in this case probably should have issued one indictment and that would be for Cohen perjuring himself once again in front of the grand jury, if you track what Bob Costello had to say as a lawyer afterwards. So, you know, I think the opportunity to expose the underpinnings of this prosecution and the frailty of their witnesses is a golden opportunity for anybody in terms of cross examination and showing the case really letting the truth come out.

I mean, if I were him, I would have retreated to golf a long time ago. But, you know, at the end of the day, he's frustrated for the country, and I think that's starting to kind of creep out and resonate. He's worried that he is literally the first person subjected to this new model of upside-down justice, of political persecution. And you know, it -- if you let the genie out of the bottle with this new mode of prosecution, it's not going to go back by itself.

So, Bragg's office fired back, the latest volley in these letters. His general counsel on Friday saying this: President Trump has directed harsh invective against District Attorney Bragg and threatened on social media that his arrest of indictment in New York may unleash death and destruction. You and many of your colleagues have chosen to collaborate with Mr. Trump's effort to vilify and denigrate the integrity of elected state prosecutors and trial judges. Basically, the Bragg office is saying, we're not cooperating with any of this stuff from the House committees.

I think it's really important that the Biden administration use that same type of pressure.

In a moment, we're going to speak with Jim Trusty, who is one of the former president's lawyers in yet another investigation.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "TRUSTY",
      "utterance": "It's conceivable. I mean, look, think about the grand perspective we have here. We're talking about what could be a sealed indictment which is completely consistent with how Donald Trump is treated differently than any citizen in this country. And before we get too procedural, Shannon, you know, the starting point is, we should never have prosecutors acting out on political promises to target people. We are supposed to have prosecutors -- now, I was a prosecutor for 27 years. We were supposed to be judicious when we got started, to figure out, where does the evidence lead, follow the rule of law. And instead, we have people announcing, if you elect me, I'll indict Donald Trump. So, it's no real surprise that when you have people breaking the ethics of prosecution for political persecution, that they're going to have suspect indictments. Their motivations are suspect. Their willingness to listen to a witness like Michael Cohen makes them suspect. And in this case, it seems like what we're guessing the indictment will look like is it will have legal frailties that will be subjected to a very legitimate motion to dismiss early on."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BREAM",
      "utterance": "So, this is not the only one out there. There is the impending potential special grand jury Georgia situation, the federal investigation with the special counsel. You're working on that. Now that there has been this historic change, do you feel like other prosecutors will be more willing to come forward and indict, you know, the president, the former president? Because they won't be first ones. I mean, that seal has been broken."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TRUSY",
      "utterance": "Yeah. It's hard to know. I mean, look, I think most of the American public, whether you're a lawyer, whether you're a Donald Trump fan or not, a lot of people are recognizing the blatant persecution angle that's being pursued here. So, you know, I'm not going to crawl inside the heads of D.A.s in Georgia who have similarly announced that they want to indict President Trump, or a DOJ led by an attorney general who had unprecedented press conferences to celebrate his raid on Mar-a-Lago, something I have never seen from any prosecutor, state, federal or local in 35 years. So, it's hard to creep into their minds and figure it out. There is a commonalty here which is they are pushing the envelope legally because they decided to target a man and try to put charges on him rather than actually follow evidence and begin judiciously as prosecutors like your ethics tell you to do."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BREAM",
      "utterance": "The president has quite a bit to say, including this post from Friday. I'll read in part, talking about the judge overseeing this case. He says: The judge assigned to my witch hunt case, a case that has never been charged before, hates me. Well, that's in all caps."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "He goes on to say",
      "utterance": "That's the same person who railroaded my 75-year-old former CFO Allen Weisselberg to take a plea deal. He strong armed Allen, which a judge is not allowed to do and treated my companies, which didn't plead, viciously. Appealing! So, a couple of things to break down there. First of all, I'm an attorney. If I client posted that, and was facing that judge, it wouldn't make my job any easier. Does it worry you?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TRUSTY",
      "utterance": "Well, look, the president is a big believer in free speech, as you know. He's got strong opinions. I think he's very frustrated for some of his very loyal employees being caught up in the machinery of a prosecution. And so he feels strongly about. But, look, I've never had a case in front of this judge. I certainly reserve judgment. I think we're in a position where a fair-minded judge -- never mind getting to a jury and changes the venue and some of the issues there -- I think a fair minded judge is likely to recognize there's something fundamentally wrong that we're crossing the Rubicon with this political persecution. And thankfully, I suspect the indictment is going to be legally frail, and there'll be an opportunity for a judge to do the right thing. You know, we wish prosecutors would do the right thing. But the judges are kind of the backstop on that. So my hope is that despite some of the hysterics at the moment, despite some emotionality and frustration, the president certainly deserves to feel that this judge will do the right thing when he's faced with significant legal motions."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BREAM",
      "utterance": "Okay. So you are going -- you're talking about things like motions to dismiss. There are other ways. This thing maybe never gets to trial. If you do get to trial, would you ask for a bench trial? For folks at home, that is essentially letting the judge decide this case instead of going to a jury. What do you think is the better route for the president?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TRUSTY",
      "utterance": "Yeah. I mean, way too early for that. There's certainly some legal obstacles that we expect that there will be a problem for this prosecution if it gets that far. But, you know, I think it's early to figure that out. I mean, God knows anybody that's ever even watched the legal show would like the opportunity to cross examine Michael Cohen. You know, the grand jury in this case probably should have issued one indictment and that would be for Cohen perjuring himself once again in front of the grand jury, if you track what Bob Costello had to say as a lawyer afterwards. So, you know, I think the opportunity to expose the underpinnings of this prosecution and the frailty of their witnesses is a golden opportunity for anybody in terms of cross examination and showing the case really letting the truth come out. And right now, the truth is not anywhere close to coming out in terms of how this thing came together, or why."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BREAM",
      "utterance": "Yeah, Michael Cohen has told several different versions of the story, but in this case, it was enough. If we think we know what we know about this indictment, that it convinced enough grand jurors to vote yes, to make this case proceed forward. If you do get to trial in any of these cases, if there's an indictment in Georgia or on the federal cases, would you put President Trump on the stand? I've got to imagine he's going to want to get up there and defend himself."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TRUSY",
      "utterance": "Well, yeah, we're light years away from that, and hopefully, it's an academic question, frankly. But let me just say this, you know, we always talk about the president's strong personality, his resilience which is amazing to me. I mean, if I were him, I would have retreated to golf a long time ago. But, you know, at the end of the day, he's frustrated for the country, and I think that's starting to kind of creep out and resonate. He's worried that he is literally the first person subjected to this new model of upside-down justice, of political persecution. And you know, it -- if you let the genie out of the bottle with this new mode of prosecution, it's not going to go back by itself. It's going to be a problem for generations, and I think he's very aware of that very concerned and certainly has a strong voice opposing it. But, you know, we're a long way off before we start talking about legal tactics at trial."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BREAM",
      "utterance": "Well, given that he is a big proponent of the First Amendment and enjoys expressing himself if there were a gag order in any of these cases, do you think he'd comply?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TRUSTY",
      "utterance": "I think he'd comply, but I also don't think it's going to happen. I mean, you're talking about, you know, one of the reasons he's being politically persecuted as he's running for president against somebody who unleashes DOJ against him during the election season. So I think it would be very difficult for a judge to impose a gag order on a person running for president. You talk about having a profound effect on this country, a gag order would do just that."

And as the news of the indictment shows, they do. Okay. Piece in \"The Atlantic\" back in 2021 talked about your time at DOJ and said that you were widely seen as a Trump lackey who politicized the Justice Department. So, did you ever feel pressure to bend the law or to ignore it? And what do you make of, you know, the president's critics saying this is all just catching up with him now?"

And he was calling for people's scalps and, you know, from what he said after I left, he was mad at me for not delivering scalps. But the idea that I was a toady, it was something fostered by the -- you know, the mainstream media. And (INAUDIBLE) -- which of his enemies were prosecuted? Who did I, you know, use the criminal justice process against? And there's usually crickets because there's not a case of that. But the other thing about this is I think the case, based again on what's being reported, the case lacks any legal basis. It's pursuing somebody on the -- there's nothing inherently wrong or illegal about making a hush payment. They're saying he falsified the corporate record. But for that to even be a misdemeanor you have to be trying to defraud somebody. And it's unclear exactly who was defrauded. This is his own company. And then, finally, and most importantly from the federal standpoint, the idea that this was a campaign finance violation is simply wrong. It's wrong on the law."

It's what he did after the government sought them and subpoenaed them, and whether there was any obstruction. And I think that's the most serious one out there. And the other one, I think the January 6th one, is a difficult case to make. It also runs into First Amendment issues. You know, where are you going to draw the line between legitimate First Amendment activity, protesting an election and actually conspiring to undo an election? So, that's a difficult case to make.

You and many of your colleagues have chosen to collaborate with Mr. Trump's effort to vilify and denigrate the integrity of elected state prosecutors and trial judges. Basically, the Bragg office is saying, we're not cooperating with any of this stuff from the House committees. Would they have jurisdiction or any authority to call him in to answer these questions?"

      "speaker": "BARR",

He's interfering in a federal election process. And his case is built on an alleged violation of federal law. He wouldn't be able to survive the statute of limitations and not be able to juice what is a misdemeanor into a felony without claiming that there's a violation of federal law. So, he's the one that has essentially weighed into the federal arena. And the real danger of this thing over the long term isn't so much narrowed to Trump. It's now we have thousands of D.A.s around the country, now that the Rubicon has been crossed, any one of them can find federal candidates or federal office holders and so forth, can find some state law they want to pursue the person on and get themselves into the national political arena."

Part of the problem, of course, is the corruption of the media which has essentially contributed to the creation of a mob mentality in our country, instead of being the restraint on mob thinking.

An opinion piece in \"The Washington Post\" says this: It's perfectly plausible that the charges against Trump prove damning, the process is handled with integrity and Trump is found guilty. And a large swath of voters cannot accept that as legitimate reckoning precisely because one of our major political parties refused to acknowledge it as such. So, what do you feel as a Republican to communicate out there to folks that we got to let this play out and it may be legit? We don't even know what's in the indictment. As of Tuesday, we may."

So, it has to play out. This is kind of set in motion. But on the other hand, where I think this particular problem is it's going to lead to all kind of political theater. Theater that is going to distract from addressing the issues that are incredibly important to our country right now, that are not about just one person or somebody running for reelection as a D.A. in New York, but rather about the future of our country, whether it's Social Security, inflation, crime on the streets.

I'll put it this way -- no one should be a target of the law. This seems to be more about the person than about the crime. Well, on the other hand, I think they'd probably also agree, we've got major issues that are affecting family gathered around the kitchen table and this distracts from that discussion from the urgency of addressing those issues."

The White House also says the president's budget is about protecting and strengthening Medicare and Social Security.

Number two, the president has a plan for Social Security and his plan is to have no plan. He and, frankly, President Trump, former President Trump, are both telling the American people that there is no issue with Social Security and you don't have to do anything about it -- because I think they think it's a political third rail. The third rail of Social Security should be allowing it to get a 24 percent cut. That's what's going to happen. And we've learned yesterday or Friday that it's going to happen a year earlier than it originally was going to. That should be the third rail. We should be working to prevent that 24 percent cut.

If 71 percent of Americans don't want Social Security touched, per the poll you just quoted, under current law, if we do nothing, those benefits will be touched. They will be mashed down by 24 percent because this president and the leading Republican candidate refuse to take the issue on. Oh, they're going to be cut. People need their benefit, not just that they want them. For many, that's how they pay their bills. But under current law, it will be cut by 24 percent because neither of two leading candidates will take the issue on.

So, I'm hoping he intervenes and basically says, listen, we're -- we need energy security. We have to produce. Fossil energy, cleaner and better than ever before, but we need an amount of it that we can energy independent and secured as a nation. We can also invest in the technologies that will have energy for the future. We did both. And they're trying to now implement a bill, Shannon, that we didn't like and it's a bill they didn't pass.

We laid out the bill and wrote the bill in a way that told you that was sourcing and processing and what was manufacturing. The whole purpose was, is to bring basically reliable supply chains to America, be able to manufacture the batteries and cars here to get the tax credits. That's what it's about -- energy security, bringing down the cost of health care, pharmaceuticals. And we've done that. But if they don't implement it in a way that was written and implement it the way they desire, they just want to throw caution to the wind and put more money out and throw money from the Treasury in credits that are basically not going to accelerate how quickly that we can be totally self- reliant in America. There's nothing wrong with us bringing manufacturing. We should not be dependent and relying on China's supply chain. You know, I said I'm old enough to remember standing in line in 1974 to buy gasoline to go to work. I don't want to stand in line to buy a battery to run a vehicle and waiting on it from China. That's what we're doing. And that's what the intent of the bill was."

It says, Manchin wants to distance himself from the administration he enabled with the Inflation Reduction Act and really wants to distance itself from its results, but that's impossible. The vote on the IRA came down to Manchin. Manchin negotiated its terms and Manchin endorsed its policies and the lack of control the legislation had on Biden's use of the bill. If Manchin wants to talk about political malpractice, maybe he should look in the mirror. Your response?"

      "speaker": "MANCHIN",

Read the law. So, anybody who has that opinion has not read the bill. What we have to do now, we have a process, so we can hold their feet accountable. I can tell you, we brought down inflation. We can do an awful lot more. We've got more drilling going on. We're producing more oil and gas than we did before. And we're more reliant on ourselves than we were on foreign supply chains. We can do all of this. This bill was written for one purpose, energy security, bringing down the cost of drugs, be able to have -- pay down debt, which we hadn't done in 20 years. But now when they want to blow the cap off of it, I'm going to fight and fight back hard.

Come on, you're going to take the sanctions off of a country that promotes the most horrific terrorist support around the world and give them more revenue to do harm to humankind? And we know that we have to have our own reliable resources. And we can do it right here in America. And we weren't doing it. You're going to sit back and say, well, I'm afraid politically it might not be popular. I've got to do what I think that is the best thing I can for my country. And I think that we did a piece of legislation that will do exactly what it was intended to do. We've got to make sure the administration now administers the way it's supposed to. The bottom line is, we have brought down - we have put more product into the market. We have just done more leasing and permitting that we've done. We need a permitting bill that changes how fast we're able to get it this done, and we have Democrats and Republicans agreeing that it needs to be done, we've just got to put a piece of legislation that works.

The reality that this D.A. campaigned on a promise and pledge to prosecute Donald Trump. I think there's a lot of concerns. I think also, Shannon, there's a real concern about what this precedent sets. Are you going to have now Republican district attorneys decide, I'm going to go ahead and charge a Democrat for political gain? And so I think it's a real abuse of the justice system. And I think it's right for Republicans to denounce it."

Susan, there was no extradition request, but does he get some points on the board with his full-throated defense of the man he may soon run against?

And so this is, I think, of all the candidates you could think of, the worst for him because it does not reshape - re-shake up the field.

But there's other polling we have to take into account here, Shannon, and that is the impact of voters across the country in terms of their feeling about the presidency and their feelings about key institutions, whether it's the justice system, presidency. It was down in the low, you know, 16 percent, 15 percent when we looked at it at the Reagan Institute. And this whole circus that's going to play out now is just going to bring those numbers further down. And that's a loss for the country."

Like, you're always going to have a better approval rating than Congress around here. But somebody who was also struggling a little bit in our Fox News poll, President Biden. A majority of folks -- these are Democratic primary voters -- said they would rather see someone else than him. And for comparison you can see President Obama at this same point back in his presidency where 81 percent were like, yes, we love him, we'll keep him. Richard, what does this president do? What is the plan B? RICHARD FOWLER, \"FORBES\" CONTRIBUTING WRITER AND FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Look, I think that President Biden is in an interesting situation right now. I think what was working in Obama's favor is he had some youth on his side. And I think what we've seen the media do over the past two years under Biden's - in Biden's presidency is talk about the president's age over and over again."

If you take a look at the entire political field at this moment, what you're going to have going into 2024 is a president that will likely - a presidential candidate likely on trial in New York and at the same time what you're going to have is President Biden governing. The question is, is what do the American voters like more? Do they like somebody who's governing and keeping the country afloat, or do they like the bombastics of a trial with a porn star and a former lawyer?"

I mean President Biden has got a lot of ground to make up on all of those issues and he would be running against those headwinds too. We know when people can't pay their bills and they're worried about their kids and crime and everything else, they tend to vote against whoever's in charge, whatever the party is. This is another poll I thought was very interesting in our polling this week. What's more important to your presidential primary vote, your views matching up with the candidate's, 73 percent, or whether they can actually win in November, only 18 percent. Marc, what does that say to you? I mean a lot of people are going to be purist about the person that they want and not so much about how they shape up in the general."

I think so far in the conversation we've struggled from the media perspective actually to put issues first and it's much more of a debate around personality. So, if we can actually get to the point that the American people are having honest conversations about what's your plan for inflation, what do you think we should be doing in the Russian invasion of Ukraine, what should we be doing to combat China, what we should be doing on the border, I think that's going to be healthy for Republican primary voters."

That should not be a crime. It should not land you in a Russian gulag. Putin trying to get, I guess, leverage with the United States. We'll see how President Biden reacts to that. Tough thing, you know, these situations are horrifically tough for - for leaders, but this is outrageous and it's a return to the kind of Cold War politics that we haven't seen since then, a seizing of journalists by Russia."

It could also involve their ambassador being sent back to Moscow. But those are the sorts of things that have to happen to escalate, to respond in kind and the condemnation is not sufficient. We have to recognize what's going on here. Vladimir Putin is feeling the pressure with respect to his war in Ukraine. Gershkovich - the last article that he wrote was speaking about how the Russian economy was tanking. This is the sort of thing that, you know, Putin does not want to see written about. He is censoring all media in Russia, now including foreign press."

I mean we know that the merchant was almost to the end of his term, but it's worth pointing out here that in Biden's getting Brittney Greiner back, what you have is a president that's willing to use all back channels to make sure that Americans come home safely. And I think, in this case, where you have a journalist over there, because we can all agree that journalism isn't a crime. It's actually part of chronicling history. I think it's really important that the Biden administration use that same type of pressure. But if you're questioning whether the Biden administration is going to use pressure to bring him back, all you have to look to is how they brought Britney Greiner back and also the outrage from folks in American to insure the Biden administration did it."

But the reality is, the Biden administration has been weak from day one. They've emboldened Russia. The started - the very first issue they did was to approve Nord Stream 2. I think that Vladimir Putin saw the surrender and withdrawal in Afghanistan. It emboldened them. And as you said, glad we got Brittney Greiner back, but to exchange for a known terrorist I think has only encouraged Putin to do this more. And this is not something that's unique to - to him. It's what despites do across the globe is to jail journalists. We need to have a much stronger reaction. We should be taking out all diplomats from Russia today. We should be sending their ambassador back today. It shouldn't be waiting."

And, you're right, I think everybody's expecting, after the meeting between president Tsai of Taiwan, and Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy this week, we'll see additional aggression and intimidation from the Chinese against Taiwan this week. But the United States has to be clear here. And this is what the polling needs - you know, indicates, is that we have to demonstrate to the Chinese that it won't be tolerated, they can't intimidate us and that when China threatens Taiwan, the United States policy, since President Reagan was in office, was to support Taiwan and to give them security in the forms of security assistance. That has to be ratcheted up. Can't be the sort of thing we're seeing in Ukraine where it's a slow drip."

Senator John Cornyn, one of the key Republicans who negotiated the package that actually passed last summer, rejected the call to ban assault-style weapons, saying some people like to use them for hunting or self-defense.
