With that, let's bring in our panel, Hugo Gurdon, editor in chief of the \"Washington Examiner,\" Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at \"The Federalist,\" and Josh Kraushaar, political editor for \"National Journal.\" Panel, let's get your thoughts before we hear from the president going into this. Josh?  JOSH KRAUSHAAR, POLITICAL EDITOR, \"NATIONAL JOURNAL\": The president likes a spectacle, and he's going to be getting one tonight. The big issue, though, has been the weather. And the president looks like he'll be on time, even though there's been rain, and there's some more rain in the forecast. But the big challenge is whether the president can make his speech beyond politics, whether he can unite the country, whether he's going to talk about American principles or whether he will be trapped into talking about himself. And it's a big moment for the president. It's a unifying moment, but this has been suffused with partisan politics. It's a big opportunity for the president to make it above just partisan politics.",

I tend to be someone who loves Independence Day. It's a holiday that we celebrate all over the country. There's no reason that you can't celebrate it here. Political leaders throughout the state mark it with speeches. I would actually like to see this be something that all presidents do every year, not just on special anniversaries, but every Independence Day. It's really good to her member those principles of our founding and the Declaration, and I hope that happens today.",

I'm sure there are lots of children there who want to take selfies with the tanks and the thundering aircraft going overhead. There will probably be a different opinion amongst those people who are at home.  But I think one of the points that needs to be made about the political division here is the context of this thing. Laurence Tribe, a Harvard professor, compared the tanks in the streets of Washington to the tanks in the streets in Tiananmen Square. It's absolute stuff and nonsense. It all depends on the context. Where I'm from in Britain, every morning a squadron of cavalry rides with sabers drawn down the mall towards Buckingham Palace. It doesn't mean there's a coup. It's just a way that the leftwing are trying to make President Trump seem like he's authoritarian. And it's rubbish.",

Just a reminder of the coordination that you need for this kind of event. Not only where those seven flyovers taking place, each one has to be designed to go over the mall at precisely the same time and a lot of coordination on the ground and it's also a reminder to America's adversaries that this is what the U.S. military can do. In fact, it was just one day before President Trump took office that a pair of B-2 Bombers launched from Missouri and struck an ISIS target in Libya flying around the world, refueling 15 times in midair, flying around the world and back to land. Just some other notes, there were no sign of the tanks. There's a lot of criticisms about tanks on the mall. As Mollie said, all of the two tanks that were coming up from the third infantry division from Fort Stewart, Georgia. There was no sign of them. We just saw the two Bradley fighting vehicles in front of the podiums. Apparently, the camouflage works very well on the tanks. Also, it's a reminder that flyovers happen routinely. The B-2 flyover over the Rose Bowl on New Year's Day, there are also flyovers, of course sporting events across America. There were other flyovers taking place on July 4th outside the nation's capital.  B-1 Bombers from Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota flew over six different cities in South Dakota including Deadwood, Deadwood and Custer.

One of the things that foreigners coming to the United States really see is the flags, the sort of pride in the military, but not just in the military, in the founding principles, and that's actually where the politics -- the political debate right now is. You know, I think that a lot of people, conservatives, believe that the Democratic Party and the left are really heading towards a kind of post- constitutional form of government and that the issue today is not only about this policy or that policy.

Josh? JOSH KRAUSHAAR, POLITICAL EDITOR, \"NATIONAL JOURNAL\": The president likes a spectacle, and he's going to be getting one tonight. The big issue, though, has been the weather. And the president looks like he'll be on time, even though there's been rain, and there's some more rain in the forecast. But the big challenge is whether the president can make his speech beyond politics, whether he can unite the country, whether he's going to talk about American principles or whether he will be trapped into talking about himself. And it's a big moment for the president. It's a unifying moment, but this has been suffused with partisan politics. It's a big opportunity for the president to make it above just partisan politics."

I tend to be someone who loves Independence Day. It's a holiday that we celebrate all over the country. There's no reason that you can't celebrate it here. Political leaders throughout the state mark it with speeches.

I'm sure there are lots of children there who want to take selfies with the tanks and the thundering aircraft going overhead. There will probably be a different opinion amongst those people who are at home. But I think one of the points that needs to be made about the political division here is the context of this thing. Laurence Tribe, a Harvard professor, compared the tanks in the streets of Washington to the tanks in the streets in Tiananmen Square. It's absolute stuff and nonsense. It all depends on the context. Where I'm from in Britain, every morning a squadron of cavalry rides with sabers drawn down the mall towards Buckingham Palace. It doesn't mean there's a coup. It's just a way that the leftwing are trying to make President Trump seem like he's authoritarian. And it's rubbish."

There were some reports that it was sort of cordoned off to the VIPs, the people who are tickets. One of the great things about July 4th and about the ceremonies on the mall is it's for everyone.

Talking about these great Americans who have lived, whether they are artists or inventors, our warriors, all of these people. It reminds me actually of Calvin Coolidge, our great former president who was born in Independence Day. The theme that he would talk about is be lovers of freedom and anxious for the fray. And that's what I took from this speech. Be lovers of freedom and anxious for the fray.

And this is a noted contrast of people who were talking about the flag is being a symbol of hate where the founding as being this irredeemable situation. America is a great country and it's great and it is one of these things were great Americans throughout time have known that it is great that when we have problems, we seek to improve them.

He wants -- he said -- you know, he wants to deal with the border crisis. He wants people to respect the -- to ICE and the border patrol and the people who do the hard work down there. These references to current politics and indeed the one to Betsy Ross flag, they were all legitimate, they were all nicely brought into the speech, but they will, I think, and this is where I disagree with Mollie, I think that the people who knew -- who didn't want to like this event are not going to like this event. They -- there were enough political references in it, there were enough -- there was a lot of the military stuff that was laid on very thick.

I don't think it's an accident he mentioned ICE specifically because he knows Democrats, especially the more progressive Democrats are going to overreact and they'll end up making that -- turning political lemonade into lemons and by their overreaction. So, I think the president knows what he's doing in many ways. He uses issues that are very polarizing, tries to stir up the opposition and watches things as they go as they turn out to be."

You had Air Force jets, F-22 Raptors flanking a B-2 Stealth Bomber. And that B-2 Stealth Bomber, Mike, flew round-trip from its base, Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri. Just a reminder of the coordination that you need for this kind of event. Not only where those seven flyovers taking place, each one has to be designed to go over the mall at precisely the same time and a lot of coordination on the ground and it's also a reminder to America's adversaries that this is what the U.S. military can do. In fact, it was just one day before President Trump took office that a pair of B-2 Bombers launched from Missouri and struck an ISIS target in Libya flying around the world, refueling 15 times in midair, flying around the world and back to land. Just some other notes, there were no sign of the tanks. There's a lot of criticisms about tanks on the mall. As Mollie said, all of the two tanks that were coming up from the third infantry division from Fort Stewart, Georgia. There was no sign of them. We just saw the two Bradley fighting vehicles in front of the podiums. Apparently, the camouflage works very well on the tanks. Also, it's a reminder that flyovers happen routinely. The B-2 flyover over the Rose Bowl on New Year's Day, there are also flyovers, of course sporting events across America. There were other flyovers taking place on July 4th outside the nation's capital. B-1 Bombers from Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota flew over six different cities in South Dakota including Deadwood, Deadwood and Custer.

We are Americans, nothing is impossible."

Mollie was talking earlier he invoked the Civil Rights movement, the suffragette movement. He definitely was seeking inclusiveness in the speech and anyone who appreciates American history will find a lot to like in what he had to say."

      "utterance": "Right. It was a very optimistic speech and he did talk a lot about looking beyond where we are now. I do think it is true though that we are at a point in time where the very notion of being American is sort of under internal attack. There are people where really resisting the ideas of the American founding and this is an important time for people to remember what makes us special, what makes us unique, and you might have different expressions of that, but it was almost too optimistic given what we are dealing with in our current situation with some people being very opposed to the founding of the -- the ideas of the American founding."

      "utterance": "What stood out to me is a lot of British people are getting biffed in this throughout American history. Which is -- but aside from that, which I -- someone objected -- look, what stands out actually to me is the strength of American patriotism. You know, even setting aside this speech where it was designed to stir those sorts of fires of patriotism. One of the things that foreigners coming to the United States really see is the flags, the sort of pride in the military, but not just in the military, in the founding principles, and that's actually where the politics -- the political debate right now is. You know, I think that a lot of people, conservatives, believe that the Democratic Party and the left are really heading towards a kind of post- constitutional form of government and that the issue today is not only about this policy or that policy. When President Trump says make America great again and invokes the American history, he is really drawing the lines between those who want to preserve what America really is and those who want to change it, they think, obviously, for the better."

That is somewhat political speech given what we are talking about. He was speaking against Wilsonian progressivism, this idea that we've evolved past the Constitution. So even these debates we're having right now have a precedent going back decades that might be cause for some optimism from people who despair over the current debates."

Trump was talking about the politics of hope in his speech tonight. He's often been kind of focused on the politics of grievance. Democrats are divided. There are candidates that are talking about hope and there are candidates that are focused on grievance. If Trump can channel this type of speech through his reelection campaign it'll be a very, very powerful tool for him to win reelection."

Our late great colleague Charlie Krauthammer, every year had a party on this day, and he would have the people gather at the party, go ahead and read the declaration in round and it's a great tradition that I would encourage all of our listeners to follow."

Thousands in California showed up this morning to celebrate Huntington Beach 115th annual Fourth of July parade, this year's team theme was \"Sweet Land of Liberty.\" The Huntington Beach celebration is considered the largest Fourth of July parade west of the Mississippi. And right here in D.C., Vice President Mike Pence welcome new citizens to the United States. This morning has a guest speaker at the naturalization ceremony.
