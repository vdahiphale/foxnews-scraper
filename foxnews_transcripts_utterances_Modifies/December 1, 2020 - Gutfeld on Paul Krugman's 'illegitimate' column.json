Bear with me because this requires explanation. Paul Krugman, you may not know him but he is the biggest joke on the New York Times' comic page except The Times called them op-eds. In his latest spook, he claims that Biden will be, quote, \"the first modern president trying to govern in the face of an opposition that refuses to accept his legitimacy.\" Good one, except first, Biden is about as moderate as a poodle's skirt. And second, the current president has had to fight for four years against an opposition of elites, often using a very familiar word. Krugman apparently doesn't recall any of this, right, Hillary?",

He believes that he was always blocked, the obstructionist Republicans, they were terrible. And then after the recount in 2000, that was pretty hard. He had some people, some -- you know, especially judges saying that he wasn't a legitimate president either. So there is some precedents for this. But in this case, it's so well- documented that everyone said do not help -- do not help the president. Do not work with him. Don't even help him with the COVID relief bill that Americans really need right now. The other thing I would mention is there is this push to say that Republicans should just get behind Joe Biden an confirm all of his nominees. Let me give you this example. President Trump had 128 nominees of his. The Democrats asked for a cloture vote. Basically that meant we are just going to sit on this. We're going to delay it, and delay it, and delay it. That basically -- all of them ended up with 90 votes or more. Under Obama, only 12. So think about that, the scale of it, 128 nominees held back. Under Obama, it was 12. So when it is said that there was obstructionism in the Obama years, I get it. They think that. But the scale of it, the data, proves it was much worse for Trump.",

He was getting more money from Wall Street than President Trump ever has. Unions, of course, have been notoriously liberal and left, and they like big government programs because they reap the benefits of taxpayer money to benefit those programs. So it's no surprise that they're somewhat happy about this. But when you look at, you know, the picks that Joe Biden is putting up and who President Trump hired for these same positions, it's just a fundamentally different way of looking at what the role of government is. Republicans generally think that government should be there to listen and to partner in ways that are appropriate but to take regulations off of business to allow them to thrive. And you have today, Joe Biden saying help is on the way. The government is here to save you. I think on the Neera Tanden thing, look, I mean, the Center for American Progress is a very far left organization.

They got married at Chicago City Hall in October. They've been engaged since 2019. And that's when they began to planning a big wedding. But of course, due to the virus, they had to first make some changes. They tried to have a smaller wedding, they changed the date, and they cancel it all together. And that's when they ended up at City Hall. So, what to do though with the $5,000 deposit for catering? They decided to put on a Thanksgiving feast for people at a mental health facility called Thresholds. Now, you know holidays can be very difficult for people with bipolar illness, schizophrenia. The new couple both healthy, both employed, decided, you know what, we're going to give meals to 200 people. Talk about making lemonade out of lemons. What a joyous, wonderful way to start married life by giving a gift to others. That's a true Merry Christmas.",

Bear with me because this requires explanation. Paul Krugman, you may not know him but he is the biggest joke on the New York Times' comic page except The Times called them op-eds. In his latest spook, he claims that Biden will be, quote, \"the first modern president trying to govern in the face of an opposition that refuses to accept his legitimacy.\" Good one, except first, Biden is about as moderate as a poodle's skirt. And second, the current president has had to fight for four years against an opposition of elites, often using a very familiar word. Krugman apparently doesn't recall any of this, right, Hillary?"

He believes that he was always blocked, the obstructionist Republicans, they were terrible. And then after the recount in 2000, that was pretty hard. He had some people, some -- you know, especially judges saying that he wasn't a legitimate president either. So there is some precedents for this. But in this case, it's so well- documented that everyone said do not help -- do not help the president. Do not work with him. Don't even help him with the COVID relief bill that Americans really need right now. The other thing I would mention is there is this push to say that Republicans should just get behind Joe Biden an confirm all of his nominees. Let me give you this example. President Trump had 128 nominees of his. The Democrats asked for a cloture vote. Basically that meant we are just going to sit on this. We're going to delay it, and delay it, and delay it. That basically -- all of them ended up with 90 votes or more. Under Obama, only 12. So think about that, the scale of it, 128 nominees held back. Under Obama, it was 12. So when it is said that there was obstructionism in the Obama years, I get it. They think that. But the scale of it, the data, proves it was much worse for Trump."

How will Biden deal Republican sabotage, OK, Juan. Let's make a deal. You want to make a deal? OK, all of the things that Democrats did to Donald Trump, you defended.

We saw that under President Obama with the Tea Party. We saw that immediately when President Trump took office with the women's march, etcetera. But the other problem that we see, which we did not see in previous administrations, is the weaponization of government against a political campaign. And that is what this resistance was all about.

The last time he was in charge, it was the slowest recovery since the great depression. Barack put him in charge of the stimulus. Where were those shovel-ready jobs? They never appeared.

They are all from the Obama administration, and I understand that. Like, he knows these people. And in fact, with Neera Tanden, he has done it well for a long time. I don't think the problem for her is going to be tweets at all. I think it's going to be qualifications. She ran American Progress, that is a really -- far left advocacy organization. But OMB, Office of Management and Budget, it's really technical. And I just don't think that when the senators start to question her about those skills, that she will be able to say that she matches that. Now, maybe I'm wrong. Who knows?. I could be wrong. But I will say this. I think Senator Lindsey Graham made a really good decision to not take her on in terms of tweets, but to turn her nomination into something to rally people to turn out to vote in the Georgia Senate runoffs. Because you said this is why it is so important that Republicans are able to keep the Senate, so that we can make sure that we have a say when it comes to who is going to be in charge of things like the Office of Management and Budget."

He was getting more money from Wall Street than President Trump ever has. Unions, of course, have been notoriously liberal and left, and they like big government programs because they reap the benefits of taxpayer money to benefit those programs. So it's no surprise that they're somewhat happy about this. But when you look at, you know, the picks that Joe Biden is putting up and who President Trump hired for these same positions, it's just a fundamentally different way of looking at what the role of government is. Republicans generally think that government should be there to listen and to partner in ways that are appropriate but to take regulations off of business to allow them to thrive. And you have today, Joe Biden saying help is on the way. The government is here to save you. I think on the Neera Tanden thing, look, I mean, the Center for American Progress is a very far left organization. And when you have Bernie Sanders attacking her as not being far left enough, that's a pretty big divide there when it comes to Democrats. I mean, they are all pretty far left."

There is no such thing as settled science. We were sold that line with climate change. But everything changes. Everything changes. That's the whole point of scientific method, right, to test things. So Americans are justified in being pissed off at experts, because they fulfill their part of this massive undertaking. They didn't go to weddings.

So, the mask is a perfect example. At the beginning, when Americans were saying, should we be buying masks or wearing masks and they got screamed at saying no, stop wearing masks, stop buying them because they don't work. And instead of explaining that we need PPE for the frontline workers, they lied to everybody and said that they don't work. And then now we are here, you know, nine months later, and you have all these governors mandating mass citing the experts, right. But I think it really comes back down to the media, because if you ever questioned anything, any of the science or what you were supposed to do, you were hounded as a science denier or someone who wasn't taking this seriously.

They got married at Chicago City Hall in October. They've been engaged since 2019. And that's when they began to planning a big wedding. But of course, due to the virus, they had to first make some changes. They tried to have a smaller wedding, they changed the date, and they cancel it all together. And that's when they ended up at City Hall. So, what to do though with the $5,000 deposit for catering? They decided to put on a Thanksgiving feast for people at a mental health facility called Thresholds. Now, you know holidays can be very difficult for people with bipolar illness, schizophrenia. The new couple both healthy, both employed, decided, you know what, we're going to give meals to 200 people. Talk about making lemonade out of lemons. What a joyous, wonderful way to start married life by giving a gift to others. That's a true Merry Christmas."
