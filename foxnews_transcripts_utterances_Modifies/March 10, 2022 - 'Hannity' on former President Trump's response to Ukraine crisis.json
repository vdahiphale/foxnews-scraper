Welcome to HANNITY. And we begin tonight with a FOX News alert. In just moments, the 45th president of the United States, Donald J. Trump, he will join us live for an exclusive interview. We'll obviously talk about Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Vladimir Putin, Joe Biden, Kamala Harris. She was a disaster, by the way. And so much more. But, first, breaking just moments ago, convicted hate crime hoaxster Jussie Smollett is now in a Chicago jail after a judge, wow, gave a blistering beat down and sentenced him to yet only 150 days behind bars.

We're going to play him screaming again and again \"I'm not suicidal\". But tonight, back to our top story and we begin with this important warning from President Trump. Less than two years ago he predicted accurately that Joe Biden's economic policies would, quote, unleash an economic disaster of epic proportions. Well, here we are -- record high gas prices, meaning the highest ever. Anemic growth, historic levels of inflation, a 40-year high. In October, inflation was 6 percent. When Joe became president, by the way, he inherited 1.4 percent. Anyway, in November, it was even higher. In December, even higher at 7 percent for the first time in decades. And in January, a 40-year high at 7.5 percent. Now, the February numbers came out just today and now we're at a whopping 7.9 percent. And it actually would be a lot worse if you calculate inflation like the federal government did under Jimmy Carter before 1980. Well, if you calculated using the old method, it would be over 16 percent. Either way, all of this inflation was recorded well before Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine before February 24th. But according to Joe Biden and Jen Psaki, they now have -- they're -- one thing that they can blame on everything, oh, it's Vladimir Putin. It's all Vladimir Putin's fault. High gas prices, Vladimir Putin. Today's inflation report, Vladimir Putin. Now, this report today is a reminder that Americans' budgets are being stretched by price increases and families are starting to feel the real impact of Putin's price hike. Now, today, Psaki doubled down on Biden's big lie and added an additional culprit -- greedy oil companies, let's blame them. Take a look.",

But part of this is on the oil companies. Right now, there are 9,000 approved, unused permits that oil and gas companies could tap into now to ramp up production. The only way to protect the United States over the long term is to become energy independent. That's why the president has been so focused on investing in clean energy technologies, so that we can rely on that and not President Putin to set the price of gas.",

This idea that Putin caused last year's oil and gas spike is a lie. They need to stop lying that Putin caused Joe's 40-year high end inflation. We had that 40-year high before Ukraine was invaded by Russia. The most recent numbers from last month, Russia invaded Ukraine February 24th. As former Obama adviser Stephen Rattner points out, quote, these are February's numbers and only include a small Russia effect four days worth. This is Biden's inflation, he needs to own it. But that's never going to happen. The New Green Deal socialist in his own, you know, party's climate alarmist cult as I call it, they want more spending. They want zero domestic production of fossil fuels. They own Joe Biden. They own Jen Psaki, the propagandist. They own Kamala Harris, the embarrassment.

Jennifer Granholm thinks it's funny, didn't care, did nothing to increase domestic production because that goes against their stated policy. Look at this new Trafalgar poll by our friend Robert Cahaly, with Russian oil ban from our country. A vast majority of Americans, nearly 80 percent, they want this country to increase our own oil and energy production. But again, the Biden administration doesn't care. They're full of excuses and the American people are left holding the bag. You're paying more at the gas pump. You're paying more to heat and cool your home, you're paying more for every product you buy at every store that you go to, and that's okay with them. They care more about their New Green Deal socialist friends that obviously have more influence in the American people. So let's face it. They are not up to the job economically, and this is hurting our national security on top of everything else because now they're willing to go, what, beg Madura in Venezuela? And go to the Iranian mullahs and do import oil from Iran? And beg OPEC that keeps rejecting Joe Biden every time he asks them to increase production? Everyone knows Joe Biden is weak. He is a cognitive mess and they know that they can do pretty much anything they want. Now, Joe is either unwilling or unable to travel abroad. So he always sends Kamala Harris in his place, and it just never goes well. She's obviously in way, way, way over her head. For example, this week, the vice president in Poland earlier today, she doesn't really seem to have any grasp on much of anything, it's pretty humiliating for the country. Take a look. You decide.",

There's no time simply to bury the dead. These lifeless bodies just simply thrown into the ground, a gut-wrenching reminder of the brutality being inflicted on the civilian population here.

You know, saying I'm -- I'm not suicidal and something happens to me behind bars, I didn't do it to myself I'm not suicidal, an obvious reference to Jeffrey Epstein who was found hung in his cell. It was ludicrous melodrama. I think he's angling for a made-for-TV series that nobody will watch. But the judge as you point out really ripped into him. In addition to what you just showed, the judge said: You are profoundly arrogant, selfish, narcissistic, a guy who craved attention and wanted to make yourself more famous. You threw a national pity party for yourself. You are a charlatan pretending to be a victim of a hate crime and that is shameful.

A lot of these truckers hadn't been political until suddenly, these petty tyrants decided to say either you take this vaccine or you're fired. And they stood up and said that's not right.

So the White House talking point that you're going to hear from every Democrat in the country, you're going to hear from the corporate media, is the increase in gas prices is all Putin's fault, and it's just a flat out lie. Listen, gas prices that increased nearly 50 percent under Joe Biden before Putin invaded Ukraine. They increased because as you played at the top of the show, Biden declared war on U.S. energy production. He shut down the Keystone pipeline. He shut down leases on federal lands. He shut down ANWR. And the result is rig counts plummeted, and when you reduce supply, when you reduce U.S. production, price goes up. And the bizarre thing now is the White House realizes they got a political problem. People don't like 8 percent inflation rates. People don't like gasoline rising over 50 percent. And so, what Biden is doing now is trying to go to enemies of America, trying to go to Iran, trying to go to Venezuela, and say, you guys -- we're going to give you billions of dollars. The ayatollah in Iran literally chants \"death to America and death to Israel\", and Biden would rather give him billions to use to murder Americans than to unleash American energy. We were energy independent under President Trump. We can be again, but Joe Biden did that. And if we want to beat Putin, there are two things we need to do. Number one, provide the Ukrainians with offensive military equipment, not put U.S. soldiers in harm's way, but give them the tools, including the fighter jets, to beat the Russians. And number two, use energy. Use energy and cut off the Russian oil and gas, get the Europeans to sign contracts with American producers. It produces jobs and it starves Putin of the revenue that he's using to wage war in Europe.",

Again, if the Trump administration continued on in place, we would have already had a really good deal with Iran. Everybody would have been happy; it would have been done, and they would have never had a nuclear weapon. They were ready to do it, but now China is buying, you know, as you know, millions of barrels of oil. When I was there, I said to China, \"If you buy any oil, any oil whatsoever, from Iran, making them therefore rich, you're not going to do any business with the United States.

Welcome to HANNITY. And we begin tonight with a FOX News alert. In just moments, the 45th president of the United States, Donald J. Trump, he will join us live for an exclusive interview. We'll obviously talk about Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Vladimir Putin, Joe Biden, Kamala Harris. She was a disaster, by the way. And so much more. But, first, breaking just moments ago, convicted hate crime hoaxster Jussie Smollett is now in a Chicago jail after a judge, wow, gave a blistering beat down and sentenced him to yet only 150 days behind bars.

We're going to play him screaming again and again \"I'm not suicidal\". But tonight, back to our top story and we begin with this important warning from President Trump. Less than two years ago he predicted accurately that Joe Biden's economic policies would, quote, unleash an economic disaster of epic proportions. Well, here we are -- record high gas prices, meaning the highest ever. Anemic growth, historic levels of inflation, a 40-year high. In October, inflation was 6 percent. When Joe became president, by the way, he inherited 1.4 percent. Anyway, in November, it was even higher. In December, even higher at 7 percent for the first time in decades. And in January, a 40-year high at 7.5 percent. Now, the February numbers came out just today and now we're at a whopping 7.9 percent. And it actually would be a lot worse if you calculate inflation like the federal government did under Jimmy Carter before 1980. Well, if you calculated using the old method, it would be over 16 percent. Either way, all of this inflation was recorded well before Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine before February 24th. But according to Joe Biden and Jen Psaki, they now have -- they're -- one thing that they can blame on everything, oh, it's Vladimir Putin. It's all Vladimir Putin's fault. High gas prices, Vladimir Putin. Today's inflation report, Vladimir Putin. Now, this report today is a reminder that Americans' budgets are being stretched by price increases and families are starting to feel the real impact of Putin's price hike. Now, today, Psaki doubled down on Biden's big lie and added an additional culprit -- greedy oil companies, let's blame them. Take a look."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JEN PSAKI, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY",
      "utterance": "You may have noticed this week that your gas prices have gone up. I want to talk to you a little bit about why. A lot of it has to do with Vladimir Putin. But part of this is on the oil companies. Right now, there are 9,000 approved, unused permits that oil and gas companies could tap into now to ramp up production. The only way to protect the United States over the long term is to become energy independent. That's why the president has been so focused on investing in clean energy technologies, so that we can rely on that and not President Putin to set the price of gas."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Well, obviously, Jen Psaki is now auditioning for fake news CNN or MSDNC. She'll fit in perfectly if she keeps telling lies like that. You need to stop lying. This idea that Putin caused last year's oil and gas spike is a lie. They need to stop lying that Putin caused Joe's 40-year high end inflation. We had that 40-year high before Ukraine was invaded by Russia. The most recent numbers from last month, Russia invaded Ukraine February 24th. As former Obama adviser Stephen Rattner points out, quote, these are February's numbers and only include a small Russia effect four days worth. This is Biden's inflation, he needs to own it. But that's never going to happen. The New Green Deal socialist in his own, you know, party's climate alarmist cult as I call it, they want more spending. They want zero domestic production of fossil fuels. They own Joe Biden. They own Jen Psaki, the propagandist. They own Kamala Harris, the embarrassment. And Joey campaigned on all of these insane policies. You might remember he told you he would do every bit of this."

They know that the average American family is hurting because of these policies, but they don't care. They care more about their radical New Green Deals socialist agenda. Now, listen to this clip from Biden's energy secretary. She made these comments in November, as gas prices were rising then. Take a listen."

As you know, of course, oil is a global market. It is controlled by a cartel. That cartel is called OPEC, and they made a decision yesterday that they were not going to increase beyond what they were already planning."

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "Now that was in November, at the time gas prices, they were rising dramatically. Jennifer Granholm thinks it's funny, didn't care, did nothing to increase domestic production because that goes against their stated policy. Look at this new Trafalgar poll by our friend Robert Cahaly, with Russian oil ban from our country. A vast majority of Americans, nearly 80 percent, they want this country to increase our own oil and energy production. But again, the Biden administration doesn't care. They're full of excuses and the American people are left holding the bag. You're paying more at the gas pump. You're paying more to heat and cool your home, you're paying more for every product you buy at every store that you go to, and that's okay with them. They care more about their New Green Deal socialist friends that obviously have more influence in the American people. So let's face it. They are not up to the job economically, and this is hurting our national security on top of everything else because now they're willing to go, what, beg Madura in Venezuela? And go to the Iranian mullahs and do import oil from Iran? And beg OPEC that keeps rejecting Joe Biden every time he asks them to increase production? Everyone knows Joe Biden is weak. He is a cognitive mess and they know that they can do pretty much anything they want. Now, Joe is either unwilling or unable to travel abroad. So he always sends Kamala Harris in his place, and it just never goes well. She's obviously in way, way, way over her head. For example, this week, the vice president in Poland earlier today, she doesn't really seem to have any grasp on much of anything, it's pretty humiliating for the country. Take a look. You decide."

We know today, the mayor of Kyiv says, Vitali Klitschko, that half the city's residents have actually left since the war began.

Now, the deputy mayor of Mariupol detailed other disturbing actions by the Russians in this city since the invasion began, saying more than 1,200 people have been killed with dozens buried in mass graves. There's no time simply to bury the dead. These lifeless bodies just simply thrown into the ground, a gut-wrenching reminder of the brutality being inflicted on the civilian population here. Sean, the Ukrainian people today don't need unity. They need anti-tank missiles.

Homophobia, racism have no place in our streets or in our hearts and we're with you, Jussie. That's called the rush to judgment.

Here with more very latest, our own Gregg Jarrett. Gregg, your take? Well, we knew that Jussie Smollett is an actor and this evening when he was sentenced, he proved he's a bad actor.

We have this person who is just a heartbeat away from the presidency. We look back -- we know she was anointed by the mainstream media. She was appointed by the Clinton machine for two very simple reasons. Number one is identity politics. She was the right -- she had the right skin color and the right gender. And number two, she had proven herself to the power elite in Washington, the war mongers, the Clinton machine. And as a result, we are seeing -- now, they send her to Poland, revealing the fact that they're not actually serious about solving this tragedy, this problem. We've seen how they are not serious about solving illegal immigration at our border because they put her in charge of solving that problem. It just proves this is all about -- it's all about politics, Sean. It's about the Kamala Harris show, getting her out there, giving her the opportunity to get some photo-ops with our troops, with refugees, things that can bolster her eventual run for the presidency, which is -- which is so sad because really this shows that the suffering of the Ukrainian people really are just they're -- they're actors in her -- in the Kamala Harris show. And this is why we're facing the problems we're facing. But it's all about them. They don't care about the people. If they did, they would be taking action to address this skyrocketing inflation that started before the Russian assault on Ukraine. They'd be taking action to address the fact that the American people are struggling to figure out how do I pay for filling up a gas tank as well as groceries or things for my kids? They'd be addressing the real problems the American people are facing. But instead, they're driven by their own political interests, their own political ambition, how they look in the in the media and how they can get themselves ahead. This is the most heartbreaking about what we're seeing play out before us."

We have former President Donald Trump joining us in a minute. First, we are joined by Texas Senator Ted Cruz. Senator, good to see you. I see that you joined the freedom convoy for a little while and you rode shotgun, and I'm thinking how all of this relates to where we are as in Ukraine, what to do with Ukraine, and more importantly, this reluctance -- mysterious reluctance and resistance Democrats have, their adherence to New Green Deal radical socialism. And they would rather kiss the ass of the head of Venezuela, Maduro, the mullahs in Iran and beg OPEC, when we have enough energy in this country that would supply our own needs for at least a hundred years, maybe 200."

I went and joined them this morning, spoke with them and then joined the convoy, rode in the lead rig. They're circling the beltway around Washington, D.C., and then the lead rig. We broke off from the convoy. We headed straight to the Capitol in Washington, D.C. And I got to tell you, it was inspirational. Seeing truckers from all over the country, they started in California. They came all across the country. Their numbers grew and grew and grew, so that you had thousands of truckers, you had thousands of RVs and cars and people supporting them standing up for freedom, standing up against these illegal and unconstitutional vaccine mandates. And the thing that was so powerful is as we would drive along lining the streets there would be people with signs, people with American flags waving. Sean, just about every overpass that we went under, there were people lined up there waving flags, saying thank you, giving you the thumbs up. And I do think the disaster that is Washington, that is Biden and Schumer and Pelosi, the abuse that we're seeing from Washington -- the one good thing is, it is waking people up. A lot of these truckers hadn't been political until suddenly, these petty tyrants decided to say either you take this vaccine or you're fired. And they stood up and said that's not right. It's your choice, if you want to take the vaccine, I've taken the vaccine, if you want to take the vaccine, great, that's your choice. But if you chose not to, that's your choice also. And these politicians that want to fire truckers and cops and firefighters and soldiers and sailors and airmen and marines and teachers and doctors and nurses, it is wrong.

So the White House talking point that you're going to hear from every Democrat in the country, you're going to hear from the corporate media, is the increase in gas prices is all Putin's fault, and it's just a flat out lie. Listen, gas prices that increased nearly 50 percent under Joe Biden before Putin invaded Ukraine. They increased because as you played at the top of the show, Biden declared war on U.S. energy production. He shut down the Keystone pipeline. He shut down leases on federal lands. He shut down ANWR. And the result is rig counts plummeted, and when you reduce supply, when you reduce U.S. production, price goes up. And the bizarre thing now is the White House realizes they got a political problem. People don't like 8 percent inflation rates. People don't like gasoline rising over 50 percent. And so, what Biden is doing now is trying to go to enemies of America, trying to go to Iran, trying to go to Venezuela, and say, you guys -- we're going to give you billions of dollars. The ayatollah in Iran literally chants \"death to America and death to Israel\", and Biden would rather give him billions to use to murder Americans than to unleash American energy. We were energy independent under President Trump. We can be again, but Joe Biden did that. And if we want to beat Putin, there are two things we need to do. Number one, provide the Ukrainians with offensive military equipment, not put U.S. soldiers in harm's way, but give them the tools, including the fighter jets, to beat the Russians. And number two, use energy. Use energy and cut off the Russian oil and gas, get the Europeans to sign contracts with American producers. It produces jobs and it starves Putin of the revenue that he's using to wage war in Europe."

That didn't take place there. Nobody discussed it. And I also had a conversation with President Xi of China, but I had a very strong conversation with President Putin, and he understood. And I won't go into the great details of the conversation. Because nobody has to know that, but I will tell you, it never ever would have happened. If we were -- if I was president, if we have the Trump administration in there like we had tremendous years, tremendous success, economy, energy independence, all of the things that we -- largest tax cuts in the history of our country which helped bring about the greatest economy we have ever had, this would have never ever happened. So, when I look at it and I look at the horrible things taking place, you wouldn't even believe what's taking place. I mean, to have -- have everything on video, because people have cell phones today. So, every -- you see all of this, you see most of it in one form or another on video. It's a horrible thing to watch. It would have never happened and it never should have happened. I just watched -- on your show, I just watched the vice president laughing about the immigration, this horrible situation with the immigration. And I just watched the laugh, and it was almost like the laugh of a madwoman. To be laughing about that, it's a sad situation.

But you were pulling out and you're going to leave X number of troops in place and the military would leave last. You confirmed all of that to me. But people told me, before you ever began the negotiations, that you said to the head of the Taliban, let me make sure you fully understand me, or something to that effect, I'm paraphrasing, that if you don't follow -- if we make an agreement and you don't follow every dotted line -- every dotted I, crossed T, every period, every comma, I will blow you to smithereens and I know where you are right now, and you gave the head of the Taliban his exact location. I'm asking that, number one, is that true, would you confirm that?

He's leading it right now. And they $85 billion worth of the best military equipment in the world, 70,000 trucks, 700,000 rifles, machine guns, guns, night goggles, planes, tanks. They have one of the most powerful militaries in the world. They can't use it because it's -- for certain reasons they can't use it, but it was not busted up like they say, some of these things were brand-new, never used before. $85 billion and they're selling a lot of it. You know, they're one of the largest arms merchants right now anywhere in the world. Yeah. Abdul knew that he would be hit so hard, like they'd never been hit before, if they kill any American soldiers, because they killed a lot of soldiers under the previous administration, as you know. And 18 months we went, and there was no reason -- I'm the one who got it down to 2,000, and we were going to pull out, but we were going to keep Bagram, and not because of Afghanistan but because of China. One hour away from where China makes its nuclear weapons. We're going to keep it. Billions of dollars spent, massive air force base, we're going to keep Bagram. And we were going to be the last out. They took the military out first. So, I don't know, you play it every night, and you talk about the hostages that are left in Afghanistan, it's a very sad thing. We have American hostages right now, people, American citizens -- and others -- that shouldn't be there, that should have come out. They're right now in Afghanistan, and it's a terrible thing. But, but, they knew that they can't play games, they can't play around. And he understood. And we didn't have one soldier killed, not one military person was killed in 18 months. And actually, Biden was the one that admitted that. He said whether you like it or not, there's been no soldier killed in 18 months. Now, his people were not happy when he said it, but he said it --"

And, interestingly, we're not going to buy from Russia, but Europe is. Much of Europe is. They said, I'm sorry, but we're not, because that's the way it's been. Europe on trade treated us very badly. But it's Europe. And we will work to protect them also. But we're really protecting them. But they're not doing what we're doing. As far as the pipeline is concerned, I told Angela Merkel loud and clear. And everybody knew it. And there was a lot of reporting on it. And they sort of laughed at me when I said it. But I said, you are going to be a hostage of Russia if you don't do something with this pipeline. You should never, ever make this deal. And, by the way, the previous chancellor of Germany heads up the company, the pipeline company. But Nord Stream 2, I said, if you make that deal, you are literally at the mercy of Russia. And Germany shouldn't make the deal. I had an argument. There are those people that say I sent her a white flag of surrender, which I did, because I said, as soon as you have a problem..."

Could you -- I never thought I'd see this country that I love with all my heart and soul be begging a murdering thug dictator like Maduro in Venezuela, begging OPEC, who's continually been rejecting Joe's pleas and begging for more production. And I never thought in my lifetime that we would be begging or doing another deal with Iran that would include importing oil and making the mullahs of Iran rich again. And yet that's where we find ourselves today. Your reaction?"

They were ready to just concede. They couldn't have gone on any longer. Now it looks like they've got some valuable assets. They have a lot of oil, and they have a lot of it. It's rough oil, frankly, that's expensive, but at this price, they have a lot, almost more than anybody. He's going to be a rich person. It's going to be a rich country. You could say a rich dictatorship. And when you look at NATO, what we did with NATO, they were not paid up. They were delinquent. You have 28 countries, there were only eight of them that were paid, including the United States, which was far more than paid up. We paid for all of the people that weren't paying. And I said, \"You have to pay your bills, and if you don't pay your bills, we're not going to protect you.\" They asked me that question. \"We're not going to protect you. If you're delinquent, we're not going to protect you.\" And as soon as I said that, they paid hundreds of billions of dollars right into the till. The secretary general, the -- who is a wonderful guy, Stoltenberg, he's my biggest fan, because he never thought it would happen. Obama would go there. He'd make a nice speech. Everybody went there, Bush, they all went there and made a speech. Nobody said, \"Hey, wait a minute, you guys aren't paying your bills; we're protecting you.\" So they took advantage of us on trade. And on top of that, we took care of their military protection, and that's stopped. So NATO now has at least the money, but it's a little bit of -- it has been a little bit of a paper tiger. Now we'll see whether or not they hold together. But something has to be done about this killing. This is a savage situation. Nobody has ever seen anything like this."

And now that President Biden has made the decision to ban Russian oil imports, which of the following places would you most support replacement oil coming from? Seventy-six-point-five percent say Alaska, Texas, Pennsylvania, in other words, the U.S.; 14.9 percent say Canada; 4.5 percent say Venezuela; 2.2 percent say Iran; and 1.9 percent say Saudi Arabia. Well, it seems overwhelming to me that Americans prefer to go back to your policies. You did leave office with the country being energy independent and a net exporter of energy, something we hadn't achieved in a long time. But if you listen to Biden, it's a little sleight of hand, \"We out- produced, in our first year, more oil than Donald Trump did in his first year.\" But you -- you were handed off their horrible energy policies in the first place, so you had to reverse it, and you ended up with energy independence. So, it's a -- another dishonest moment from Biden."

And by the time we finished -- we would have been bigger than Saudi Arabia and Russia combined. And we had another thing called ANWR. Ronald Reagan tried to get it approved. Everybody tried to get it approved. That's the biggest -- perhaps as big as Saudi Arabia or bigger, in Alaska, and we had it done. I got it done. It was totally done. It was approved. We got it in our big tax cut bill. It was all approved by the House, by the Senate. I signed it; it was done. And they came in and they ended it immediately, almost on the first day. And Lisa Murkowski should have never -- from Alaska -- should have never approved that person that came in because the person, one of the first acts was to end ANWR. This was as big, perhaps, or bigger than Saudi Arabia, in Alaska, would have been jobs forever, would have been energy forever. And now we have to start it all over again, so it's just a sad thing. But we would have been bigger than Saudi Arabia and Russia combined, by far. And we became number one -- and also, totally energy independent. We didn't have to go to the Middle East anymore. We didn't have to go to OPEC anymore. And we were at $30 a barrel. We were at less than that during certain points of my administration, as you know very well. But we had inexpensive energy, under $2 per gasoline. And now you're going to be -- I mean, I see today that even normal, beautiful, Midwestern states are paying $4 and $5. In California, it's almost $8. But it's going to go much higher than that. It's going to be a shock like this country hasn't had in a long time."

If we used the old standard of measuring CPI and inflation, it would be 16 percent. If we did it -- used the method in the Carter years. Every single American, Wharton School of Business estimates, is paying anywhere between $3,500 to $5,000 a household. Now we're looking at, with these new record high gas prices, it's going to cost maybe the average family another two grand a year. Americans simply can't afford this. We have three more years of this. What are the American people to do? Rick Santelli had a pretty good line. He said, \"You know, first it was transitory inflation; now it's corporate greed; now we're blaming Putin.\" They blame everybody but themselves because these numbers represent the pre-invasion of Ukraine."

And the numbers that you're seeing right now are peanuts unless we do something fast. And it starts with energy. If you don't bring down energy costs, because it's a shock, energy is so all-invasive, it's so powerful on every business, whether it's the trucks or the ovens that cook the bread or anything, everything is about energy. And if you don't get those costs down -- you could really reduce inflation fairly rapidly if you solve the energy problem, but with energy doubling and tripling, as you're going to see it's already started, but it's going to get a lot worse before it gets better, with the attitudes of these people -- you know, this Green New Deal is going to destroy the country. These people don't know what they're doing."

Again, if the Trump administration continued on in place, we would have already had a really good deal with Iran. Everybody would have been happy; it would have been done, and they would have never had a nuclear weapon. They were ready to do it, but now China is buying, you know, as you know, millions of barrels of oil. When I was there, I said to China, \"If you buy any oil, any oil whatsoever, from Iran, making them therefore rich, you're not going to do any business with the United States.
