And we tried to be, as I said, to hit the terrorists and not to see innocent people caught up in the crossfire. And while our goal was to avoid civilian casualties, Hamas had actually the exact opposite goal. They were aiming their rockets at our people, trying  to kill them, and, of course, they were brutally abusing Gaza civilians as a human shield for their war machine. We know for a fact that many of the casualties in this operation were caused by Hamas munitions. Almost 20 percent of their rockets fell short, landing in Gaza, killing Gaza civilians. It didn't bother them at all, they kept doing that. Part of the death and destruction was because of their ordnance, their  explosives going off.

It wasn't the case. In that building that the senator was concerned about, Hamas had its elite scientific research unit that was working on ways to try to counteract the guiding systems on our rockets. If they would have succeeded, not only couldn't we have shut down incoming rockets coming into Israel to kill our people, but we wouldn't have been able to be surgical in our strikes against Hamas' military machine, so that definitely was a legitimate military target. That Hamas was using journalists as a human shield shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone but we notify the journalists in advance and I'm happy to tell you that there was not a single civilian casualty from that operation.

The thing they put forward there at the forefront was, we support Israel's right to defend itself. They felt like it was critical to have that statement out there.

GUY BENSON, \"THE GUY BENSON SHOW\":  Yeah, Chris, I listen to your interview in the last segment very carefully and I hope that the ambassador is right about America remaining steadfastly pro-Israel across-the-board and he said he looked at some polling. There's a new poll out in the last few days of YouGov that shows when they asked Democrats which side of this conflict they sympathize more with, more Democrats say Palestinians than Israelis. I think it that is an extraordinary sea change that we're seeing in the Democratic Party. I think some of the old guard remains pro-Israel but the younger, very vocal sort of up-and-coming element of the progressive left, they have cast in their lot with the Palestinians and I think in some cases amplify what amount to Hamas talking points.

They paid a heavy price militarily, but in public opinion around the world on the progressive left, the Palestinian cause is now seeing, ironically, almost as sympathetically as the Jewish and Israeli cause was seen 60 years ago. I think it's been a long time coming. There are a lot of reasons for that. Certainly in the United States, one reason is that Prime Minister Netanyahu made a very overt pro-Donald Trump, pro-Republican kind of lunge over the last four years and that alienated a lot of Democrats.

That is an important dynamic that has shifted here, but the Biden demonstration has a choice now to make about what their own approaches going to be and how active and central this will be to the president's foreign policy.",

In terms of the argument, I heard what Senator McConnell just said there. And one person who would disagree is the Republican ranking member on the Homeland Security Committee in the House who helped hammer out a bipartisan deal on this commission. And it's absolutely true that one way or another there's going to be an investigation by Congress into this attack on Congress, which was an extremely disgraceful moment in our history. The question is will it be bipartisan with each side having similar powers, not exactly the same, but the exact same number of people that they're responsible for appointing to it, or will it be a partisan, Democratic- involved situation on enterprise that Nancy Pelosi will run? And that's the point that Congressman Kinzinger made. So I really do think that this is an appropriate purview for Congress to look into. It's not ancient history. The hands of Congress are not tied to go do other things while a commission looks into everything that led up to and happened on that horrific day.

JULIE PACE, WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF, \"THE ASSOCIATED PRESS\": Absolutely. I think the commission would be the perfect venue to try to answer some of the unanswered questions. And most of those questions do focus on President Trump, focus on what he was doing on the 6th, what private conversations he was having with aides. We have snippets of details about conversations that he was having with some members of Congress and others but I do think that there's a real gap in the history of this seminal moment in our country's history that has gone unanswered. And so this commission would likely be the only real venue for being able to have a fair accounting of what transpired inside the White House and around President Trump on the 6th.",

So they're more than a trillion dollars apart. Guy, what do you think of the chances they're able to -- to resolve that difference and also the difference of how they pay for it.

The Republicans want to focus on traditional infrastructure, which I think makes sense. Maybe they'll get a little bit closer. I'm currently, based on what I'm seeing, what I'm reading, what I'm hearing, I'm more inclined to believe this is going to end up being a partisan exercise by the Democrats to sort of ram it through because the parties are so far apart. The one potential opportunity though, four senators, two from each party, put together a bipartisan bill on service infrastructure, roads and bridges and that sort of thing for $303 billion. If they go at this on a piecemeal basis, then perhaps there's more room, more wiggle room for bipartisanship. But I think the White House wants something big.",

They were firing out of built up areas. They were firing out of homes, out of mosques, even out of playgrounds. And we tried to be, as I said, to hit the terrorists and not to see innocent people caught up in the crossfire. And while our goal was to avoid civilian casualties, Hamas had actually the exact opposite goal. They were aiming their rockets at our people, trying to kill them, and, of course, they were brutally abusing Gaza civilians as a human shield for their war machine. We know for a fact that many of the casualties in this operation were caused by Hamas munitions. Almost 20 percent of their rockets fell short, landing in Gaza, killing Gaza civilians.

It wasn't the case. In that building that the senator was concerned about, Hamas had its elite scientific research unit that was working on ways to try to counteract the guiding systems on our rockets. If they would have succeeded, not only couldn't we have shut down incoming rockets coming into Israel to kill our people, but we wouldn't have been able to be surgical in our strikes against Hamas' military machine, so that definitely was a legitimate military target. That Hamas was using journalists as a human shield shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone but we notify the journalists in advance and I'm happy to tell you that there was not a single civilian casualty from that operation. In fact, from my point of view, it was an Israeli tactical success because we took out a legitimate Hamas target, a dangerous Hamas target and at the same time, not a single innocent civilian was killed.

Hamas says that every Israeli man, woman, and child is a legitimate target in their terror war. Hamas says Israel, my country, should be destroyed, wiped off the map. Hamas says any Arab or Palestinian leader who makes peace with Israel should be murdered. I think in overcoming Hamas and defeating Hamas now, maybe we've created some room for more Palestinian moderate voices to move center stage because as long as Hamas is powerful, they can almost put a veto."

I do think Biden, though, was trying to walk this very careful line. You saw this over and over again in statements that he was making in readouts of the conversations that he was having with Prime Minister Netanyahu, with the conversations that Tony Blinken, Lloyd Austin, and others were having. The thing they put forward there at the forefront was, we support Israel's right to defend itself. They felt like it was critical to have that statement out there. But you did see then over the course of this conflict a move, privately at first, and then publicly to urge Israel to stop.

What do you make of that? GUY BENSON, \"THE GUY BENSON SHOW\":  Yeah, Chris, I listen to your interview in the last segment very carefully and I hope that the ambassador is right about America remaining steadfastly pro-Israel across-the-board and he said he looked at some polling. There's a new poll out in the last few days of YouGov that shows when they asked Democrats which side of this conflict they sympathize more with, more Democrats say Palestinians than Israelis. I think it that is an extraordinary sea change that we're seeing in the Democratic Party. I think some of the old guard remains pro-Israel but the younger, very vocal sort of up-and-coming element of the progressive left, they have cast in their lot with the Palestinians and I think in some cases amplify what amount to Hamas talking points. I think it's frightening to see. I think Republicans are much more united on this front, independents remain heavily pro-Israel.

I don't think they are wrong to see it that way. They paid a heavy price militarily, but in public opinion around the world on the progressive left, the Palestinian cause is now seeing, ironically, almost as sympathetically as the Jewish and Israeli cause was seen 60 years ago. I think it's been a long time coming. There are a lot of reasons for that. Certainly in the United States, one reason is that Prime Minister Netanyahu made a very overt pro-Donald Trump, pro-Republican kind of lunge over the last four years and that alienated a lot of Democrats. He became more partisan. And I think now we are going to see in our country, Israel, the Middle East, become a much more partisan issue with Democrats on one side of it relatively speaking and Republicans on the other."

He wanted to focus on rebuilding global alliances, he wanted to focus on Asia more, trying to counter China. And I think with these last 11 days have shown is that a U.S. administration, whether it wants to or not has to deal with this situation. I think what we're going to be watching for in the coming weeks and months is what the Biden position is going to be here. How actively involved is his administration going to get in trying to potentially restart peace talks here that the region has changed, you do have these peace accords now between Israel and some Arab countries. That is an important dynamic that has shifted here, but the Biden demonstration has a choice now to make about what their own approaches going to be and how active and central this will be to the president's foreign policy."

I get it, it may have a political impact, but I'm going to tell you what had a political impact on 2022, if anything does, it's going to be the attack on January 6th and then the subsequent denial to look in the mirror, tell the truth, take ownership for what we've done and recommit to tell the American people and Republican voters the truth.

But I do think Kevin has failed to tell the truth to the Republicans and to the American people and it pains me to say. It's not like I enjoy standing up and saying this, but people, the 74 million voters that voted for Donald Trump, the belief -- a number of them that believe the election was stolen believe it because their leaders have not told them otherwise. The people they trust have either been silent or not told them the truth. That's where Kevin has failed, because he told the truth on January 13th, something around then, and then he went to Mar-a-Lago and said Donald Trump is the leader of the party. He's right. Donald Trump is the leader of the party, but we need to tell people the truth."

My very first video on there, I just say, look, the Republican Party has lost its way. This party that built the interstate system, that freed the slaves, you know, fought for the environment, is now the party that is engaged heavily in mass battles, anti-vaccination and whatever the outrage of the day is, including Dr. Seuss. All that may be important but there are much more important things for this country. And that's what we want to get back to, is putting the country before the party.

You know, commissions often don't work at all. And when they do work, like the Simpson-Bowles Commission produced a good result, nothing happened as a -- as part of that result. The one commission that we generally think did work was the 9/11 Commission, Chris. I think that was -- I was part of putting that commission together. I think it was 14 months after 9/11, after all kinds of other information was out there for that commission to look at, before that commission got started. And, believe me, it would be months before this commission could get started. I just was part of the Senate Intel Committee looking into the last election, the Russian involvement in the last election. We thought that would take a year. It took three years. And we already had a full staff that was fully cleared to look at everything. It would take months, as Chairman Burr said the other day, former Chairman Burr of -- of our committee, would take months just to get a staff ready to look at things and you've got 400 plus legal efforts going on against individuals. That's going to produce a lot of information eventually. But, believe me, the Justice Department will not let a commission have any of that information. We just went through that with the -- with the 9 -- with the effort we looked at after the last election. We got no sharing from the Justice Department about a much smaller number of cases than they're dealing with now. This information is all going to get out there. I've actually opposed the idea of a commission from -- immediately from the very first because I think we'll start waiting for a commission rather than moving forward with what we know we need to do now. There's a bipartisan effort in the Senate with two committees to produce not only a report, but also a number of recommendations, and we should be able to do that in the first full week of June and we haven't even waited for that to decide what a commission should do."

I want to put those up on the -- on the screen. What was President Trump doing during the riot? Did he refuse to approve sending in the National Guard? Did White House staff and the military work around Mr. Trump with Vice President Pence? Will your report, with those two committees, will they answer those questions, and have you talked, have you subpoenaed, or have you heard from top officials in the Trump White House?"

I think that ultimately will be out there. All kinds of books being written, all kinds of efforts to look at that. Even a commission like the 9/11 Commission started at the right time with the information they need, won't get in the way of us doing what we need to do.

The question is whether the -- a -- a commission, an independent commission, no members of Congress, could serve -- could serve a useful function.

And it's absolutely true that one way or another there's going to be an investigation by Congress into this attack on Congress, which was an extremely disgraceful moment in our history. The question is will it be bipartisan with each side having similar powers, not exactly the same, but the exact same number of people that they're responsible for appointing to it, or will it be a partisan, Democratic- involved situation on enterprise that Nancy Pelosi will run? And that's the point that Congressman Kinzinger made. So I really do think that this is an appropriate purview for Congress to look into. It's not ancient history. The hands of Congress are not tied to go do other things while a commission looks into everything that led up to and happened on that horrific day.

CHARLES LANE, \"THE WASHINGTON POST\" AND FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: The independent commissions' political downside to the Republicans is that it has more credibility and, of course, this is a very bad story for the Republican Party. I think a lot of Republicans are afraid of what it will find out about their desperate but futile effort to get the president to do something about this mob that was coming for them. But, more importantly, I think they feel -- the Republicans feel that they have to move -- just like they had to squash Liz Cheney to change the subject, they have to squash this to change the subject so they have a clearer field in 2022.

Are there some questions that -- about President Trump's role before the -- the riot or -- or during the day, January 6th, that it commission might be able to answer and that these congressional committees, and Senator Blunt made it clear they're not calling top officials from the Trump White House, that congressional committees are never going to be able to answer? JULIE PACE, WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF, \"THE ASSOCIATED PRESS\": Absolutely. I think the commission would be the perfect venue to try to answer some of the unanswered questions. And most of those questions do focus on President Trump, focus on what he was doing on the 6th, what private conversations he was having with aides. We have snippets of details about conversations that he was having with some members of Congress and others but I do think that there's a real gap in the history of this seminal moment in our country's history that has gone unanswered. And so this commission would likely be the only real venue for being able to have a fair accounting of what transpired inside the White House and around President Trump on the 6th."

      "utterance": "Let's turn to another big issue that I touched on at the end of my interview with Senator Blunt, and -- and that's the question of a big infrastructure bill. President Biden keeps saying he wants a compromise. But at the end of this week, as I mentioned to -- to Senator Blunt, the White House is at $1.7 trillion and Democrats are about $600 billion. So they're more than a trillion dollars apart. Guy, what do you think of the chances they're able to -- to resolve that difference and also the difference of how they pay for it. Democrats want to raise taxes on corporations. Republicans don't. Or do you think in the end that the president and Democrats will end up going the straight party line reconciliation route in the Senate?"

      "speaker": "BENSON",
      "utterance": "A trillion dollars plus apart. And a huge disagreement on taxes. A huge disagreement on scope, which I think was a key word from Senator Blunt in that interview. I think that there is some openness to bipartisanship on this on the Republican side. The White House has come down in their number a little bit. It's still astronomically high. The Republicans want to focus on traditional infrastructure, which I think makes sense. Maybe they'll get a little bit closer. I'm currently, based on what I'm seeing, what I'm reading, what I'm hearing, I'm more inclined to believe this is going to end up being a partisan exercise by the Democrats to sort of ram it through because the parties are so far apart. The one potential opportunity though, four senators, two from each party, put together a bipartisan bill on service infrastructure, roads and bridges and that sort of thing for $303 billion. If they go at this on a piecemeal basis, then perhaps there's more room, more wiggle room for bipartisanship. But I think the White House wants something big."

      "utterance": "I think unless there's a significant shift in the dynamics this week, we're either going to go down a -- a purely partisan route where a big package gets passed only on Democratic votes or there is this potential opportunity to explore what Guy just outlined there, where you break up the bill into some smaller pieces. But the White House officials that I've talked to are very concerned that taking that route would actually cause a split within their own party where a lot of Democrats want to use this opportunity to do something big and so there's some weariness among White House officials about doing that, doing that second step."
