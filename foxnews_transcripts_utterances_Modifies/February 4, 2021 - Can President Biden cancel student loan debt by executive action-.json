But the outsized impact on the economy, particularly in a pandemic, amidst this pandemic, where you're talking about a generation of people who had to go through the Great Recession who are, in some cases, still paying off their student loan debt, and now this.

At least, there was a recent report for the Committee for Responsible Budget said that, yes, it would add $90 billion, but it would cost nearly $1.7 trillion. So, no, it would not. And I completely agree. I'm someone who decided where to go to college based on the amount of scholarships that I got, rather than going to get my graduate degree. I got into Columbia, so excited to go, and then I said, I could never afford to pay this back. So I didn't go, did unpaid internships, and then also worked jobs waiting tables, sometimes 20-hour work days, OK, to be able to do this without having to take on that loan. And I'm not the only one who's gone through something like that or made those sort of decisions.

We have talked about it on my podcast, \"Outloud with Gianno Caldwell.\" Anyway, there's $1.7 trillion in student loan debt currently, $27 trillion in debt to the United States is in. And the average student loan is between $20,000 and $25,000 in the year 2019. So I recognize that the debt is a real issue, but we got millions of people out of work. We got COVID that has hit the country in a way that we never expected. I do think that there's something that should be done when it comes to student loans. Perhaps you suspend the interest rate during the period of COVID and beyond, and perhaps you enhance the forgiveness programs beyond teachers and federal employees. Something needs to be done, because there's going to be a load that comes on to people that they can't necessarily afford. No one expected COVID. We don't understand how it got here, but something has to be done. And the federal government needs to act. Forgiving in totality isn't something that I necessarily support, because we did sign up for that. Everyone on the screen went to college in some form. So we're responsible for the loan in which we incurred. Therefore, we have to pay something. But the federal government can step in at this particular time. And I'm a conservative saying this. So, that's a question for Congress, which is Democratically-controlled, and a lot of people voted for Biden thinking that their loans would be completely forgiven, which clearly isn't going to happen.",

Solid point. What I'm worried about here is that student debt loads are significantly greater in many cases than $50,000. What's to say and who's to say a kid or his parents come forward and say, I need more, I'm swimming in $250,000 in debt, you have got to pick up the tab for the rest? Then what?",

And I think, as the conversation here just today illustrates, there should be and I hope there will be some room for bipartisan compromise here, because I think there are some conservatives who see some common sense in this idea. And who knows if it'll actually end up at $50,000. That's obviously where it's starting. But I think, to Gianno's point, there is something that has to be done here. And I do think it needs to be paired with some thinking about the long-term implications, right, these questions about, oh, are colleges now just going to go and raise their prices? Are -- there should be something done about that issue as well. This -- in an ideal world, this would not just be a one-off, saying everyone who's got loans right now, we will give you up to $50,000, and you all go home and get to -- get to do whatever you want. It should be an opportunity for us to look at the broader issue, which we all know is hugely impactful to our economy overall, which is the rising cost of college and how critical a college degree is to be able to succeed in today's economy. So, I hope that that will be looked at as part of it, along with the kind of the question you're raising. There should be some kind of limits on it for people. Maybe -- just to throw something out here, maybe people only have a certain amount left, a very small amount are less eligible. Maybe it's on a percentage basis.",

And, as a result, American Airlines is warning as many as 13,000 of its employees they could be laid off, many of them for the second time in six months. In a letter to the company, American's president and CEO explained: \"We're nearly five weeks into 2021, and, unfortunately, we find ourselves in a situation similar to much of 2020.\" They note that, with the extension of federal aid in December, \"We fully believed that we would be looking at a summer schedule where we'd fly all of our planes and need the full strength of our team. Regrettably, that is no longer the case.\" They point to the slower-than-expected distribution of the vaccine and new restrictions on international travel as the major factors in folks not flying to the extent they normally would. American estimates it will fly 45 percent less in the first quarter compared to the same time period in 2019. This comes a week after American posted its biggest ever annual loss at $8.9 billion and a week after United Airlines issued furlough warnings to 14,000 of its employees. The industry is pushing for another $15 billion in aid from Washington to help prevent these layoffs. But, today, the White House cast doubt on that being included in the next package.",

We started with a high number. They started with a low number. We ended up at 900. It wasn't perfect, but we got there. I think -- I still would love to see a bipartisan package on this next relief effort. I think there was agreement on the COVID component. There is less agreement on the need for a large stimulus. I think the administration could do a better job showing the macro needs, not just in the first quarter, but, frankly, this next bill will be all we will spend in the second and third quarter. And I think the economists I have heard have said we need that kind of additional stimulus. And, candidly, again, Neil, you pointed out the airline industry coming back and saying, hey, we thought things were going to get better by now. They have not gotten better. We need additional help. And I think this economy is still on a precipice. It has not fallen off as badly as we'd anticipated, I think oftentimes due to the bipartisan prior relief packages. I do think there needs to be another relief package. The exact component parts, I have got -- I have got some issues with some of the things the president's talked about. I think it can be improved. I think there ought to be potentially some additional small business support. I think there ought to be broadband in a major way in this package. Broadband is both an economic stimulus and related to COVID. And my hope is, we're going through a little bit of the silly business today with what's called vote-a-rama, which is an exercise in futility, where we will vote on potentially 600 amendments.

The federal government is more than hinting at a role in what happened with the GameStop and those other stocks, the frenzy surrounding it. I mean, let's be real clear. GameStop, amid this wild trading frenzy, traded -- was a penny stock, meaning traded a couple months ago, several months ago, below $5 a share, is then traded as high as $500 a share. And if you look at a chart today, it was getting crushed today. I think it's about $50 a share right now or below $50 and heading lower. So, in order to make sense of that, regulators hate that type of volatility. It scares the average long-term investor out of the market. They're going to have to -- they would like to get their hands around it, and they will probably try to pass some legislation. But it won't be easy. This is a -- you know, this is a complicated story. I mean, it takes probably more time to fully unpack what happened here, a short squeeze, small investors being involved in the market like never before, bidding up this stock, squeezing the shorts that were betting that it would fall, a hedge fund that almost goes under being bailed out by major players. The Robinhood app, which we have been worrying about for years -- for most of the year -- I mean, I did a column in The New York Post about this in the summer about how that was adding fuel to a speculative fire, because you could trade at no cost. And now everybody pointed fingers at everybody about how there's a lot of evil here, including short selling, which, again, bets that prices will go down. The short sellers lost a lot of money, but, somehow, they're getting the short end of the stick here, so to speak, because there's legislation that say, we may not need this speculative behavior in the market. So, I think we're going to know more in the next hour, Neil. It's a complicated situation. It's so besides the point, too, because if you just put your money in an index fund, you will probably do OK, if you know what I mean. This speculation never, never ends well for the average investor, never. It's just -- listen, I'm all for everybody buying stocks. That's a good thing. You want to go out there, do it long-term, if you can do it cheaply. If you want to trade, there's always a -- there is always a time and place for Vegas, not every day, but maybe once a year on vacation. But you see what I'm saying.",

What we're learning, both from studies in the United States and studies from around the globe, is that you can get children back to school safely, safely for the children, safely for the staff and safely for the teachers, if you're able to do those things, distance between children, so decompress some of the classrooms, improve ventilation, make sure you have staff available to do screening. These things work. And what the studies have shown -- there was a great paper that came out just this past week -- is that -- this was in Wisconsin, it was in Mississippi, it was in North Carolina -- that they were not seeing schools as a risk for transmission in communities. They were not seeing -- in these settings, in other settings, they have seen less transmission in schools than they're seeing in the ongoing community.

School districts that closed early, they saw a decrease in spread within the community. But what we're seeing here -- and New York showed this very clearly -- is that the rate of positive tests in kids in school was much lower than what they were seeing in the surrounding community.

We have paid for many, many things, both Republicans and Democrats, without getting a good answer to that question. So, I do think Congress has to find an answer to that question and find some offsets. I think there's plenty of places to potentially do those offsets. But the outsized impact on the economy, particularly in a pandemic, amidst this pandemic, where you're talking about a generation of people who had to go through the Great Recession who are, in some cases, still paying off their student loan debt, and now this. And so it's really, ultimately, about what's going to help the overall economy. And the benefit of that, I think, is much larger than the amount that we're talking about here in the near term."

I also wanted to say that, sure, it would add to the economy, but not more than it would take away. At least, there was a recent report for the Committee for Responsible Budget said that, yes, it would add $90 billion, but it would cost nearly $1.7 trillion. So, no, it would not. And I completely agree. I'm someone who decided where to go to college based on the amount of scholarships that I got, rather than going to get my graduate degree. I got into Columbia, so excited to go, and then I said, I could never afford to pay this back. So I didn't go, did unpaid internships, and then also worked jobs waiting tables, sometimes 20-hour work days, OK, to be able to do this without having to take on that loan. And I'm not the only one who's gone through something like that or made those sort of decisions. And to just now have to pay for other people who didn't, I don't see why that's other people's responsibility. It just isn't."

    {
      "speaker": "CALDWELL",
      "utterance": "I recognize the fact that there's 1.7 -- super wealthy. Listen, I'm not confused, Kat. I know. We have talked about it on my podcast, \"Outloud with Gianno Caldwell.\" Anyway, there's $1.7 trillion in student loan debt currently, $27 trillion in debt to the United States is in. And the average student loan is between $20,000 and $25,000 in the year 2019. So I recognize that the debt is a real issue, but we got millions of people out of work. We got COVID that has hit the country in a way that we never expected. I do think that there's something that should be done when it comes to student loans. Perhaps you suspend the interest rate during the period of COVID and beyond, and perhaps you enhance the forgiveness programs beyond teachers and federal employees. Something needs to be done, because there's going to be a load that comes on to people that they can't necessarily afford. No one expected COVID. We don't understand how it got here, but something has to be done. And the federal government needs to act. Forgiving in totality isn't something that I necessarily support, because we did sign up for that. Everyone on the screen went to college in some form. So we're responsible for the loan in which we incurred. Therefore, we have to pay something. But the federal government can step in at this particular time. And I'm a conservative saying this. So, that's a question for Congress, which is Democratically-controlled, and a lot of people voted for Biden thinking that their loans would be completely forgiven, which clearly isn't going to happen."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Well, it does set up some expectations, right, David? And I bear out at the point that you mentioned at the outset that we do have a record of forgiving debt and bailing out large institutions. We did that right after the financial meltdown. Solid point. What I'm worried about here is that student debt loads are significantly greater in many cases than $50,000. What's to say and who's to say a kid or his parents come forward and say, I need more, I'm swimming in $250,000 in debt, you have got to pick up the tab for the rest? Then what?"

And I think, as the conversation here just today illustrates, there should be and I hope there will be some room for bipartisan compromise here, because I think there are some conservatives who see some common sense in this idea. And who knows if it'll actually end up at $50,000. That's obviously where it's starting. But I think, to Gianno's point, there is something that has to be done here. And I do think it needs to be paired with some thinking about the long-term implications, right, these questions about, oh, are colleges now just going to go and raise their prices? Are -- there should be something done about that issue as well. This -- in an ideal world, this would not just be a one-off, saying everyone who's got loans right now, we will give you up to $50,000, and you all go home and get to -- get to do whatever you want. It should be an opportunity for us to look at the broader issue, which we all know is hugely impactful to our economy overall, which is the rising cost of college and how critical a college degree is to be able to succeed in today's economy. So, I hope that that will be looked at as part of it, along with the kind of the question you're raising. There should be some kind of limits on it for people. Maybe -- just to throw something out here, maybe people only have a certain amount left, a very small amount are less eligible. Maybe it's on a percentage basis."

Regrettably, that is no longer the case.\" They point to the slower-than-expected distribution of the vaccine and new restrictions on international travel as the major factors in folks not flying to the extent they normally would. American estimates it will fly 45 percent less in the first quarter compared to the same time period in 2019. This comes a week after American posted its biggest ever annual loss at $8.9 billion and a week after United Airlines issued furlough warnings to 14,000 of its employees.

I honestly wish that Leader McCarthy had dealt with this within the Republican Conference. But when he didn't take actions, I understand why the majority is going ahead taking the action, because, again, this is not about partisanship. This is about just plain wacky theories, not only what Bill mentioned in terms of laser beams by Jewish families, but denying the Parkland massacres, outrageous, being a firm adherent of this QAnon theory, which, increasingly, law enforcement and intelligence community believes is a threat to our country. You know, if you're a member of Congress, you take an oath to stand up for the rules and laws of our Constitution. This individual seems to be rebuking that oath on a fairly regular basis."

      "utterance": "Well, and, listen, my friend Bill Cassidy was on earlier. He and I are great friends. I was very proud of the fact that he was part of the bipartisan group where we came together in the $900 billion package that President Trump signed in December. That took a lot of give-and-take. We started with a high number. They started with a low number. We ended up at 900. It wasn't perfect, but we got there. I think -- I still would love to see a bipartisan package on this next relief effort. I think there was agreement on the COVID component. There is less agreement on the need for a large stimulus. I think the administration could do a better job showing the macro needs, not just in the first quarter, but, frankly, this next bill will be all we will spend in the second and third quarter. And I think the economists I have heard have said we need that kind of additional stimulus. And, candidly, again, Neil, you pointed out the airline industry coming back and saying, hey, we thought things were going to get better by now. They have not gotten better. We need additional help. And I think this economy is still on a precipice. It has not fallen off as badly as we'd anticipated, I think oftentimes due to the bipartisan prior relief packages. I do think there needs to be another relief package. The exact component parts, I have got -- I have got some issues with some of the things the president's talked about. I think it can be improved. I think there ought to be potentially some additional small business support. I think there ought to be broadband in a major way in this package. Broadband is both an economic stimulus and related to COVID. And my hope is, we're going through a little bit of the silly business today with what's called vote-a-rama, which is an exercise in futility, where we will vote on potentially 600 amendments. Not all of those get voted on. They don't mean a single thing."

Janet Yellen, the Treasury secretary, speaking with the heads of the Federal Reserve, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, among a lot of other key players, in what to make of this mania, some would just say a lot worse than that, in some of these stocks that has launched a war between those betting stocks will die, then those countering that by buying the stocks they thought would die. It is a mess. But now is the federal government hinting at a role here, and is Treasury Secretary Yellen crafting that role? Charlie Gasparino on all of that. Charlie, what's going on?"

    {
      "speaker": "CHARLIE GASPARINO, FOX NEWS SENIOR CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Yes, I mean, I think we don't know exactly what was said in this meeting. We will find out probably in the next hour or so. But the bottom line is this. The federal government is more than hinting at a role in what happened with the GameStop and those other stocks, the frenzy surrounding it. I mean, let's be real clear. GameStop, amid this wild trading frenzy, traded -- was a penny stock, meaning traded a couple months ago, several months ago, below $5 a share, is then traded as high as $500 a share. And if you look at a chart today, it was getting crushed today. I think it's about $50 a share right now or below $50 and heading lower. So, in order to make sense of that, regulators hate that type of volatility. It scares the average long-term investor out of the market. They're going to have to -- they would like to get their hands around it, and they will probably try to pass some legislation. But it won't be easy. This is a -- you know, this is a complicated story. I mean, it takes probably more time to fully unpack what happened here, a short squeeze, small investors being involved in the market like never before, bidding up this stock, squeezing the shorts that were betting that it would fall, a hedge fund that almost goes under being bailed out by major players. The Robinhood app, which we have been worrying about for years -- for most of the year -- I mean, I did a column in The New York Post about this in the summer about how that was adding fuel to a speculative fire, because you could trade at no cost. And now everybody pointed fingers at everybody about how there's a lot of evil here, including short selling, which, again, bets that prices will go down. The short sellers lost a lot of money, but, somehow, they're getting the short end of the stick here, so to speak, because there's legislation that say, we may not need this speculative behavior in the market. So, I think we're going to know more in the next hour, Neil. It's a complicated situation. It's so besides the point, too, because if you just put your money in an index fund, you will probably do OK, if you know what I mean. This speculation never, never ends well for the average investor, never. It's just -- listen, I'm all for everybody buying stocks. That's a good thing. You want to go out there, do it long-term, if you can do it cheaply. If you want to trade, there's always a -- there is always a time and place for Vegas, not every day, but maybe once a year on vacation. But you see what I'm saying."

Shortly after the inauguration, China dispatched two large formations of warplanes, including bombers close to Taiwan. In response, Taipei scrambled fighter jets. The last time U.S. warships transited the Taiwan Strait was New Year's Eve. The USS Theodore Roosevelt sailed through the South China Sea, launching jets in another not-so-subtle message to China. U.S. warships transited the waterway 13 times last year, the most since 2016, during the Obama administration, when U.S. warships conducted 12 freedom-of-navigation operations -- Neil."

It's continuity between the Trump administration and the Biden administration, that the U.S. is going to sail wherever we want, whenever we want in recognized international waters, and that we are going to do the operations necessary to maintain readiness, but also at the same time send a signal to China that we do not recognize some of their illegal international claims to the South China Sea."

      "utterance": "I actually don't think they will, Neil. When you look at it, China's going to act rather bellicose. They're feeling rather rambunctious right now. They have built a Navy that is larger than the U.S. Navy. They're exercising that capability throughout the region, trying to intimidate our allies over there, from Australia, to Japan, to South Korea, and others, as they exercise their claims. And when you look at Taiwan, they have always viewed it as a renegade province."

It is concerning, though, that, when we sail our aircraft carrier and ships, that they're conducting mock bomb raids against them, just like the Soviet Union used to do back in the 1980s when I was in the Navy on other ships. So, giving that -- given that signal from China, we have no choice but to say, look, let's not get into this, let's not try and create the circumstances for a mistake to occur. But we are ready, willing and able if necessary. If something were to happen, we will respond to will respond quickly and forcefully to defend ourselves."

If anyone's going to enforce taking out those islands, should something happen, it would be the United States. And the first thing you have to look at is that those islands, which are commonly referred to as the dash-nine line, were -- if a conflict were to start, the first thing that would happen is, we would find a way to take those islands out, which would literally collapse China all the way back to Taiwan in being able to respond to it.

Of course, I'm talking about the former acting CDC Director Dr. Richard Besser with us now. Doctor, good to have you back. So, the mayor in this case, like others in other cities, saying, teachers, go back, it's fine, go back. They're saying no. CDC comes along to say vaccinations might be a good idea, but they're not the be-all and end-all and wouldn't make a difference going back one way or the other. Where are you on this? Who's right?"

      "utterance": "Yes, I mean, Neil, this is a -- it's a really challenging issue. You want everyone to be as safe as possible. And early on in this pandemic, the move was to get schools closed. And that was based on what we knew about flu and how readily flu spread through classrooms. What we're learning, both from studies in the United States and studies from around the globe, is that you can get children back to school safely, safely for the children, safely for the staff and safely for the teachers, if you're able to do those things, distance between children, so decompress some of the classrooms, improve ventilation, make sure you have staff available to do screening. These things work. And what the studies have shown -- there was a great paper that came out just this past week -- is that -- this was in Wisconsin, it was in Mississippi, it was in North Carolina -- that they were not seeing schools as a risk for transmission in communities. They were not seeing -- in these settings, in other settings, they have seen less transmission in schools than they're seeing in the ongoing community. So, I think teachers should be in the group of front-line workers who are given vaccines early. But you don't need to have that to be able to open schools very safely."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, obviously, teachers are concerned otherwise, Director, with the fact that they think they might catch it from the kids. How -- how likely is that? What are the odds that an adult, a vulnerable adult, could contract the virus from a child?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BESSER",
      "utterance": "I mean, it's possible. It's much lower than what we see with flu, if you ensure that staff and teachers and children are wearing masks, that you're able to identify quickly anyone who has symptoms and is sick. Those things work. They really do work. And it's one of the things that I see as, in a sense, a silver lining in this pandemic. As a pediatrician, I know how important it is for children to be in school, in person, learning. And I was very worried, and I was -- early on in this pandemic, I was calling for schools to go to remote because of what we knew from flu, what we knew from the 1918 pandemic. School districts that closed early, they saw a decrease in spread within the community. But what we're seeing here -- and New York showed this very clearly -- is that the rate of positive tests in kids in school was much lower than what they were seeing in the surrounding community. So, you need to make sure that teachers, especially teachers who are at high risk of having severe disease, that they're able to do their teaching remotely. But for the majority of teachers and staff and students, in person learning, you can do it safely."

Senator, thank you very much. You were very passionate about this. You warned the House and said that they decide who they want to be, and in their decision Greene, in other words, not to punish her, that the party of limited government, fiscal responsibility and other traditional values falls to the party of conspiracy theories and QAnon.

They vote for us because we believe in economic freedom, because we believe in fiscal responsibility, because we're the party of limited government. We believe that, to maintain strength as a nation, you have got to maintain a strong defense. Those are fundamental core Republican policies and principles and ideas. And I think, too often here lately, we have gotten caught up in personalities. We have gotten caught up in conspiracy theories. And I want to see a Republican Party that articulates a vision for the future that attracts people and is politics of addition, rather than politics of subtraction. And I think the way to do that is to get out and talk about those ideas, about those policies that can make a difference in everybody's -- in ordinary people's lives on a daily basis. And so that was what I was trying to get across. Obviously, the House Republicans have to take care of their own business. I do think it's a bad precedent to have the majority party--"

I'm going to speak the truth. And, sometimes, that's uncomfortable for people to hear. There were a lot of people who bought into the notion that the election was rigged, the election was stolen. And I have said all along, look, I know there are irregularities. There are irregularities in every election, and they need to be investigated to the fullest. And there are certainly things that we can do and make changes in at the state level that will ensure that there's more confidence and trust in future elections. But we had to move on as a country. We had an election, and it was investigated, and there were audits and recounts, and there were court cases, and the state certified, the Electoral College voted. It's time to move on. And that's all I was simply saying. And I think, at some point, even though it's uncomfortable for people to hear, you have got to give them the hard truth. And that's all I was doing. If that gets me crosswise with people, so be it. But I'd obviously love the opportunity to convince them and persuade them about the reasons for the conclusions that I came to.
