Well, just like the so-called public health experts, the media, they have zero credibility and maximum culpability here. Now remember, most adults have gotten at least one shot, many more already have natural or acquired immunity through prior exposure to COVID. We're likely already at herd immunity thresholds in most parts of the country. But none of that, none of those facts are going to stop them from promoting the government's vaccine pressure campaign, especially the ones that will target our children. The San Francisco Chronicle published a column yesterday, this was wild, saying, \"My husband had a stroke after his COVID vaccine. We gave our kid his shot anyway.\" She wrote, \"As my husband recovered at home, my son stuck his arm out the car window and got his jab.\" Insane. Now, most media outlets refuse to even discuss the adverse reactions that have been linked to the vaccine, even when they're among kids.",

But in the two days between his immunization and death, Jacob went to sleep that night and never woke up. But these stories, including the risk of heart damage, rarely, if ever get mentioned in that White House briefing room. Why? Because being honest about the true risk benefit analysis would actually help their credibility, but instead the government officials just seem to be getting more and more desperate. Remember, they've dangled cash lotteries, free concert tickets and even free beer to increase vaccinations. But Biden still didn't reach a 70 percent July 4th target. So whoever is making the decisions in the White House decided, ok, I guess it's time to intensify the pressure campaign.",

They hijack the body's cellular machinery to produce the dangerous spike protein.

And what will be done with those notes? How will this information be used? These are all important questions that bear directly on matters of personal medical privacy. But the Biden administration, they can always just rely on their big business and university pals that all end up getting some federal help or federal money, and they'll end up doing the strong arming for the government against all those hesitant Americans."

We know that there are different risks that the FDA has acknowledged for Moderna and Pfizer, the risks are myocarditis, or inflammation of the heart. And then with girls and women, age 18 to 48 is the risk of cavernous sinus thrombosis in the brain. The vaccines actually have a dangerous mechanism of action. They hijack the body's cellular machinery to produce the dangerous spike protein. And that happens within sensitive organs like the brain, the heart, it circulates in the bloodstream, damages blood vessels and causes blood clotting. And for those reasons, unless we really have a compelling case, no one under age 30 should be seeing any one of these vaccines."

She wasn't aware of that when she went to her doctor in Washington, DC, recently. She wasn't aware she had that reaction. So she wasn't aware to tell her doctor about that reaction to the pertussis vaccine.

Now, New York's Andrew Cuomo ended their state - his state's emergency declarations only to announce another gun violence is now the latest health emergency there. But in Minnesota, the GOP is fighting back. Last week Democratic governor Tim Walz attempted to extend his powers until August 1. But Republicans with only a one seat Senate majority stayed in special session and forced the governor to back down. Joining us now, the man who spearheaded this effort Minnesota Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka.

So it just was well, well beyond what a governor should be doing. And so in the end, I was willing to or able to work out a deal with the House Democrats to end the emergency powers against his wishes.

I went to a meeting with 70 leaders, state leaders from around the country. All of them talked about emergency powers being abused. Our governor and a lot of Democrat governors just use them far, far more than the typical Republican governor. And so we all have to stand up. We've got to stand up for our liberty.

And they did that when they gave these companies immunity. Now they gave it way before they even existed, which makes it silly, but they've encouraged them by giving them immunity to do things that Congress can't do themselves. Congress can't censor you. Also by coercion, when all those Democratic senators over, I don't know, the last year, year and a half, kept threatening these companies. If you don't do what we say and ban Trump, censor Trump, censor their definition of misinformation or hate speech, we will maybe tear you apart. We might be to take away your immunity, whatever. But the Supreme Court said you can't coerce them to do those things. And the other thing you can't do is participate in government actions as Fauci did with Facebook and what CDC did with Twitter and Facebook. Now it's just fine if Fauci or the CDC want to say something or give their opinion, that's one thing. But they do not have the right as government entities to censor people who may have a different opinion. So what they did is they farm that out to Facebook, Twitter, and Google.

And when you read it - if you read the rest of it, it seemed like it was might have been referencing, we're going to do better to crack down on misleading claims. That's where it seemed like that probably would go - it's just my guess, but that would be dispositive perhaps toward your claim that they're kind of colluding together to use their favorite word as a quasi state actor.

      "utterance": "It's a reasonable question to ask, why isn't this being covered by the media, and what else do we need to know about them? Joining me now are two men who know these types well. Todd McGhee, former Massachusetts state trooper, and Chris Swecker, former FBI assistant director. Todd, you know this group. I'd never heard of this group before, but you know them well from your time as a state trooper up there. What can you tell us?"

      "speaker": "TODD MCGHEE, FORMER MASSACHUSETTS STATE TROOPER",
      "utterance": "I think we first need to point back to sovereign citizen ideology. And what's important about sovereign citizen ideology is recognizing the recruitment tools and the propaganda that is used by the rise of the moors and other Moorish groups such as this. And they will point to things such as the treaty dating back to 1777. I've also seen dates of 1787, which was a treaty between the United States and the country of Morocco. What that treaty was about, was about maritime, laws for maritime that allowed privilege of the United States and the privileges for the Moroccan country, there maritime, to support privileges based on economic, not treaties for citizens, but economic reasons. Just like sovereign citizens will also use maritime laws in order to confuse law enforcement during motor vehicle stops. So we have to understand that they don't recognize themselves as sovereign citizens. However, their ideology is closely aligned to sovereign citizen ideology."

      "utterance": "It's very bizarre. Chris, here's what one of the men said about their supposed rights."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "UNIDENTIFIED MALE",
      "utterance": "We operate in law. We don't break the law. We're not against the law. We have the right to travel as a well-regulated military style militia with the right to having no tags, no licenses, or no registration."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Chris, again, I think most people are just shocked by this, also shocked, but maybe not all that shocked that the media gave it a pretty much a big yawn over the weekend. Again, what do Americans need to understand about this?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHRIS SWECKER, FORMER FBI ASSISTANT DIRECTOR",
      "utterance": "These groups emerged in the 90s in different iterations of the Moorish nation, sovereign nation, what have you. I dealt with them when I was the head of the FBI in North Carolina. They don't recognize any authority whatsoever. But they are basically a criminal organization, or a set of criminal organizations that wrap themselves in some convoluted political ideology, basically to justify committing crimes. And the crimes they commit, they are prolific fraudsters. They will take over someone's home, file quitclaim deeds, and then move into the home while they are not there. They commit tax fraud, file false tax returns. They've killed over a dozen police officers since 2002, in particular in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. One individual, one Moorish nation individual killed three officers and wounded three others. So they present a clear and present danger to law enforcement, and nobody should take them lightly. They aren't some benign political organization. That's just a facade."

    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "And Todd, another member spoke about what they claim were there travel plans."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "UNIDENTIFIED MALE",
      "utterance": "Our vehicle is full of camping equipment, which supports what I said about how we are going to our private land to train, which is our Second Amendment right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "So Todd, what kind of training are they doing? And they seem to both cite the Constitution, and then kind of claim they are not really beholden to any laws that are passed constitutionally. It's a very odd dynamic. They're kind of picking and choosing what they will be held accountable by and to."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MCGHEE",
      "utterance": "And that's the argument, they say they are not -- that they are not antigovernment. But to Chris's point, they skirt around with their language, their ideology. They make reference to that they are independent of the law, not antigovernment. To me if you are not following the laws of the U.S., then you are antigovernment. But regarding the ideology, as they would speak to traveling, they say it's their God-given right to travel, that's why they don't need drivers licenses. So again, they split hairs. They find this way to manipulate words and make the words basically justify their actions. What we are seeing with social media, the flag, and all these different things, this is going to be a propaganda recruitment tool. So they are absolutely going to use and leverage this to gain other people and interests. Now, we don't know how many are out there. There are conflicting numbers. But watch and see the level of interest that this most recent incident over the weekend will gain the attention for the Rise of the Moors."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Chris, we have heard a lot from our FBI director, Christopher Wray, and from the attorney general of the United States, Merrick Garland, about the growing white supremacist threat in the United States, growing domestic terrorist threat. I've never heard these guys mentioned, and yet in Daytona a couple of weeks ago in Florida, a black paramilitary individual shot and killed a Daytona police officer. This doesn't fit the narrative of Charlottesville or the white supremacists and everything that they obsess on, so why aren't we really understanding more about them? And why isn't the federal government speaking out about this?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SWECKER",
      "utterance": "As you mentioned, they present a danger to law enforcement. They don't recognize any authority. But yet, they are not recognized as extremists. Even the Southern Poverty Law Center backed off on that. They had them classified as a sovereign nation and almost a domestic terrorist group. But they backed off on that and just said they are antigovernment. I don't know why it doesn't cut both ways. It should. This is a black extremist group primarily, and we can come out and say that. They don't recognize any authority. I really think they are more criminal organizations than they are political, ideological based. I think they use that to justify their crimes, because that's pretty much all they do."

      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Two big announcements tonight on THE ANGLE. Yesterday morning our own Mike Bastasch (ph) and wife Jackie (ph) welcome their son David (ph) Andrew (ph). David (ph) joins big brothers Mikey (ph) and Curtis (ph). New Anglers, congratulations to the entire family. And other big news is that thanks to your purchases of all of our Freedom Matters gear on my website, LauraIngraham.com, we raised more than $17,000 for Rachel's Challenge last month. It's just amazing. So let's keep it going every month. And we have a new cool thing. Here's the new Freedom Matters tote bag all made in the USA, and the new red freedom matters hat. We get the good t-shirts. We make as much as we can in the United States. And this month's charity is the Horatio Alger Association. Phenomenal scholarships offered to high school students who may not otherwise be able to go to college, who have enormous determination against really difficult odds. Integrity, perseverance, just some of the characteristics that the scholarship rewards. All the proceeds from Freedom Matters gear goes to a new charity every month. So keep it up. That's all the time have tonight. Greg Gutfeld takes it all from here. Content and Programming Copyright 2021 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2021 VIQ Media Transcription, Inc.
