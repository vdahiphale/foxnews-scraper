This is an egregious, vicious act of political violence against the U.S. Constitution and our country. It's also an incredibly stupid mistake, that's going to hurt Joe Biden.  Now, first, I want to tell everyone, they have to spare us the claim that Democrats and a handful of Republicans are trying to make that they truly care about punishing individuals who incite political violence.   Where was their sanctimony and demands for justice when Minneapolis was smoldering? How about when businesses and innocent people in L.A. and New York were under attack? Or how about with rioters and looters using the George Floyd case as an excuse to rampage across cities across this nation? And don't forget how left wingers in Wisconsin occupied the state capitol several years ago to protest actions that they didn't like? Where are all the concerns raised then?  Second, the entire exercise is unconstitutional. As former federal appellate Judge Ken Starr said last night,",

What would they have said about that?   Third, this impeachment action is as pointless as it is vindictive. \"The Hill\" reporting that, only five or six Republican senators at the most seem likely to vote for impeachment. And a conviction would require at least 17 GOP votes if every Democrat vote to convict Trump.   So, it's like watching a football game, you already know what the score is going to be at the end. So, since we already know that impeachment will fail, Democrats plus senator - I like to call them Romkowski (ph), must believe that their votes to convict will put them on the right side of history. What self-indulgent, self-righteous goofballs they are? You don't have to believe that President Trump did everything right post election and I don't to find the impeachment mob sickening. They're not trying to address a constitutional problem here. They're trying to tag all Trump supporters as dangerous white supremacist who want to overthrow the government.    Right now, it's unclear who will even preside over the sham of an impeachment trial. But if its Chief Justice John Roberts, if they want him, he should refuse on grounds that Trump's no longer president. But relying on him to do the right thing, by the way, is like relying on a 13-year-old boy to remember to clean his room before going to bed.",

Well, of course you don't, because Obama was much too smart for that. He had too much sense.  And if Democrats really believe that Donald Trump is disgraced and washed up with no political future, man, they're acting really insecure about that concept. Why are they so hell bent on a second unconstitutional impeachment trial? Don't they believe that they beat him and his ideas legitimately?  Finally, a word about Republicans who think impeachment will help them score points for the Democratic establishment and maybe even convince Republicans to turn their backs on Trump, you guys are suckers, and you're fools.    Most of the GOP don't believe for a moment that Trump actually wanted the rioters to take over the Capitol and carry out a coup. That idea is patently absurd. There was no malicious intent in Trump's words to be, \"strong and fight for him.\" Things, by the way, he said many times over the past five years. And look at what happened to poor Liz Cheney after her impeachment grandstanding. She's already chalked up a primary challenger. Meanwhile, Mitt Romney is a running joke even in his home state of Utah. I mean, does he really believe the Democrats who savaged him as an out of touch Thurston Howell, the third type elite in 2012, now are clamoring to collaborate with him on policy. They despise him now as much as they did back then.   Republicans supporting impeachment believe that conviction would be worth it in order to get the Trump cancer out of the Republican Party. That's the real reason they're doing it. Yet no serious political observer could possibly think that the party that turned out in historic numbers for Trump is about to boomerang back to the policies of the Bush-Cheney era.   Let's hope with this delay, that Republicans will have more time to grow a backbone. We hope they hear from you, many of their constituents to tell them that we want you to fight for conservative policies and against the ridiculous Democrat sham that we're seeing in the Biden administration tonight.  They want to bury the America first populist movement - the Democrats do. It's up to Republicans to prevent them from doing it, resist all the way. But my friends, if Democrats insist on going through with this unconstitutional impeachment, Republicans have to ensure that they pay a heavy political price.  And if Joe Biden, by the way thinking about all of this, if you were really smart, if he really had his wits about him, truly capable of saying what it, how this would be actually in his own interest to do this, he would call Schumer and call off the impeachment dogs.   But Joe's not going to do that, because he's just too weak to steer his party away from its own self-destructive ways, and that's \"The Angle.\"  Joining me now is Jonathan Turley, George Washington University Law Professor and Constitutional Law Expert and Fox News Contributor. Jonathan, is there any way that John Roberts could decide that he will not preside over this impeachment? Could he just refuse?",

      "sentences": "Well, he can. He doesn't - he's not a business, he doesn't pick up everyone that he stops next to. He has to determine whether this is a function that is given to him by the Constitution. The problem is that the Constitution states that the Chief Justice shall preside of a trial of the President. The President in this trial will be Joe Biden. And I doubt the Democrats want to remove him. And so there's a threshold issue for Roberts. He might not even be asked.   But that will beg the question of who is being tried? It's clearly not the president, and it's clearly not to remove him from office. It is a private citizen. Who the Senate will vote on removing from an office that he's already left. Now, that creates a serious threshold issue for the Senate. In fact, they may have the most consequential vote ahead of them in their entire tenure as senators, and that is whether to go forward with this trial.  The Constitution states that the principal question for impeachment is whether to remove the president. And that creates a rather curious vote. And the problem is that constitutional novelties can easily become constitutional nuisances. We've already had a snap impeachment, where the House didn't even hold a single hearing to consider the language or implications of the impeachment, give a formal opportunity for the President to respond. And now we're going to hand a snap impeachment over to a retroactive trial. That is a very serious question for all these senators to weigh.   I'll point out one other thing. There were only two cases in history where this type of retroactive measure was used. And the first one was with William Blunt. And when that happened, many of the signers of the Constitution were in Congress. Most of them were still alive. Blunt himself was a signer. And he was a former - he was a senator who had been expelled from the Senate. The Senate refused to hold the trial. So when the ink had just barely dried on the Constitution, the Senate had a threshold vote, and said we're not going to do this.",

Also, I want to point out to something that a lot of legal scholars have said in response to your argument just now about the removal. You can't remove him from office because he's already gone from office. So, a group of these scholars penned an open letter - don't even love the open letters? That argues that the, disqualification from holding future office is equal to the removal from the office and the Constitution. Now, I don't understand how that could be possibly read into the Constitution. But these are some very well-respected constitutional scholars who are arguing with us. Why are they wrong?",

But I have to stress, these are good faith arguments. This has been an open debate. I've wrestled with this since 1999. I talked about the value of even retroactive trials. But what I believe today is that those values are outweighed by the costs. And I don't agree with what the letter says. Disqualification is an optional penalty that the Senate may impose. But it is only considered after the main task of impeachment has done, you've tried and removed a president.  And when they talk about future disqualification, it's in a sense that is meant to limit the power of the Senate to say you can't go beyond removal or disqualification.

And said children should be able to learn without worrying about whether they'll be denied access to the restroom or locker room or school sports. What does that mean? That means biological boys will be in the locker rooms with biological girls. And their speculation that public schools could end up having funding polled federal funds if they don't adhere to this. Female athletes saying, Joe Biden is erasing what it is to be a female athlete in the United States. Author Abigail Shrier put it bluntly, \"A new glass ceiling was just placed over girls.\" And by the way, don't think any of these changes with hormone treatment or makes competition fairer among biological boys, between boys and girls, because a recent study discovered that hormone therapy does not suddenly remove the natural athletic benefits that biological men naturally have over women. It was published last month in the British Journal of Sports Medicine.

Now, after initially suggesting a trial next week, the Senate reached an agreement earlier tonight to push it till February 9th. But folks that doesn't change the facts. This is an egregious, vicious act of political violence against the U.S. Constitution and our country. It's also an incredibly stupid mistake, that's going to hurt Joe Biden. Now, first, I want to tell everyone, they have to spare us the claim that Democrats and a handful of Republicans are trying to make that they truly care about punishing individuals who incite political violence. Where was their sanctimony and demands for justice when Minneapolis was smoldering? How about when businesses and innocent people in L.A. and New York were under attack? Or how about with rioters and looters using the George Floyd case as an excuse to rampage across cities across this nation? And don't forget how left wingers in Wisconsin occupied the state capitol several years ago to protest actions that they didn't like? Where are all the concerns raised then?

What would they have said about that? Third, this impeachment action is as pointless as it is vindictive. \"The Hill\" reporting that, only five or six Republican senators at the most seem likely to vote for impeachment. And a conviction would require at least 17 GOP votes if every Democrat vote to convict Trump. So, it's like watching a football game, you already know what the score is going to be at the end. So, since we already know that impeachment will fail, Democrats plus senator - I like to call them Romkowski (ph), must believe that their votes to convict will put them on the right side of history. What self-indulgent, self-righteous goofballs they are? You don't have to believe that President Trump did everything right post election and I don't to find the impeachment mob sickening. They're not trying to address a constitutional problem here. They're trying to tag all Trump supporters as dangerous white supremacist who want to overthrow the government. Right now, it's unclear who will even preside over the sham of an impeachment trial. But if its Chief Justice John Roberts, if they want him, he should refuse on grounds that Trump's no longer president. But relying on him to do the right thing, by the way, is like relying on a 13-year-old boy to remember to clean his room before going to bed."

Well, of course you don't, because Obama was much too smart for that. He had too much sense. And if Democrats really believe that Donald Trump is disgraced and washed up with no political future, man, they're acting really insecure about that concept. Why are they so hell bent on a second unconstitutional impeachment trial? Don't they believe that they beat him and his ideas legitimately? Finally, a word about Republicans who think impeachment will help them score points for the Democratic establishment and maybe even convince Republicans to turn their backs on Trump, you guys are suckers, and you're fools. Most of the GOP don't believe for a moment that Trump actually wanted the rioters to take over the Capitol and carry out a coup. That idea is patently absurd. There was no malicious intent in Trump's words to be, \"strong and fight for him.\" Things, by the way, he said many times over the past five years. And look at what happened to poor Liz Cheney after her impeachment grandstanding. She's already chalked up a primary challenger. Meanwhile, Mitt Romney is a running joke even in his home state of Utah. I mean, does he really believe the Democrats who savaged him as an out of touch Thurston Howell, the third type elite in 2012, now are clamoring to collaborate with him on policy. They despise him now as much as they did back then. Republicans supporting impeachment believe that conviction would be worth it in order to get the Trump cancer out of the Republican Party. That's the real reason they're doing it. Yet no serious political observer could possibly think that the party that turned out in historic numbers for Trump is about to boomerang back to the policies of the Bush-Cheney era. Let's hope with this delay, that Republicans will have more time to grow a backbone. We hope they hear from you, many of their constituents to tell them that we want you to fight for conservative policies and against the ridiculous Democrat sham that we're seeing in the Biden administration tonight. They want to bury the America first populist movement - the Democrats do. It's up to Republicans to prevent them from doing it, resist all the way. But my friends, if Democrats insist on going through with this unconstitutional impeachment, Republicans have to ensure that they pay a heavy political price. And if Joe Biden, by the way thinking about all of this, if you were really smart, if he really had his wits about him, truly capable of saying what it, how this would be actually in his own interest to do this, he would call Schumer and call off the impeachment dogs. But Joe's not going to do that, because he's just too weak to steer his party away from its own self-destructive ways, and that's \"The Angle.\" Joining me now is Jonathan Turley, George Washington University Law Professor and Constitutional Law Expert and Fox News Contributor. Jonathan, is there any way that John Roberts could decide that he will not preside over this impeachment? Could he just refuse?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JONATHAN TURLEY, FOX NEW CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "Well, he can. He doesn't - he's not a business, he doesn't pick up everyone that he stops next to. He has to determine whether this is a function that is given to him by the Constitution. The problem is that the Constitution states that the Chief Justice shall preside of a trial of the President. The President in this trial will be Joe Biden. And I doubt the Democrats want to remove him. And so there's a threshold issue for Roberts. He might not even be asked. But that will beg the question of who is being tried? It's clearly not the president, and it's clearly not to remove him from office. It is a private citizen. Who the Senate will vote on removing from an office that he's already left. Now, that creates a serious threshold issue for the Senate. In fact, they may have the most consequential vote ahead of them in their entire tenure as senators, and that is whether to go forward with this trial. The Constitution states that the principal question for impeachment is whether to remove the president. And that creates a rather curious vote. And the problem is that constitutional novelties can easily become constitutional nuisances. We've already had a snap impeachment, where the House didn't even hold a single hearing to consider the language or implications of the impeachment, give a formal opportunity for the President to respond. And now we're going to hand a snap impeachment over to a retroactive trial. That is a very serious question for all these senators to weigh. I'll point out one other thing. There were only two cases in history where this type of retroactive measure was used. And the first one was with William Blunt. And when that happened, many of the signers of the Constitution were in Congress. Most of them were still alive. Blunt himself was a signer. And he was a former - he was a senator who had been expelled from the Senate. The Senate refused to hold the trial. So when the ink had just barely dried on the Constitution, the Senate had a threshold vote, and said we're not going to do this."

You didn't have to do it, go much into the legislative history even if you believe that, because they were there. That's a fascinating point, Jonathan. Also, I want to point out to something that a lot of legal scholars have said in response to your argument just now about the removal. You can't remove him from office because he's already gone from office. So, a group of these scholars penned an open letter - don't even love the open letters? That argues that the, disqualification from holding future office is equal to the removal from the office and the Constitution. Now, I don't understand how that could be possibly read into the Constitution. But these are some very well-respected constitutional scholars who are arguing with us. Why are they wrong?"

    {
      "speaker": "TURLEY",
      "utterance": "Well, I know, and like many of them. I actually responded to that letter on my blog today, because I believe it's ultimately wrong. But I have to stress, these are good faith arguments. This has been an open debate. I've wrestled with this since 1999. I talked about the value of even retroactive trials. But what I believe today is that those values are outweighed by the costs. And I don't agree with what the letter says. Disqualification is an optional penalty that the Senate may impose. But it is only considered after the main task of impeachment has done, you've tried and removed a president. And when they talk about future disqualification, it's in a sense that is meant to limit the power of the Senate to say you can't go beyond removal or disqualification. So, I don't think that these things are equal in that sense."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",

I mean, what if they want to put on a multi-day or even a few weeks defense? We're going to have the presiding judge say no, you can only do X number of days. So, they want to they want to have a snap impeachment happen really fast, and they hope to take him out by - at the knees."

They actually first had a vote on impeachment before they had even identified what the impeachment charge was even going to be. That was early on in his presidency. Then they actually impeached him. And now they want to do it again. I was asked in 2020 about House Democrats keeping the majority, what their priorities would be. And I said that the only thing if House Democrats keep the majority that they know for sure they want to accomplish in 2021 is that they would want to make Donald Trump the first president to be impeached twice. The answer to your question, if the shoe was on your foot, we know exactly what Democrats would say, and Republicans would be consistent on it, absolutely not, Of course not."

But let's say he runs again in 2024? I mean, you would think that after what they did to him over years, that they would feel like, Oh, God, we got this - well, we beat him in 2020.

You don't have to be a student of the law. But you do have to be able to read what is actually in the Constitution. And the Constitution says that a president, not a former president, not an ex-president, can be removed from office only upon conviction of high crimes and misdemeanors - impeachment for that. So there is no jurisdiction here. What the president's lawyers ought to do - if McConnell proceeds in this idiotic move to hold the trial, what the republicans ought to do is they ought to support a presidential motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. The Senate has no jurisdiction over Donald Trump. Period, end of argument"

So the extent that Bernie Sanders is willing to go to take positions of be it mass prison release, to allow felons to have their vote again, even if it's a terrorist like the Boston Marathon bomber. And here, you're looking at due process where he's supporting a House impeaching the president for a second time, within hours. We ain't talking about a few weeks, within hours. And now he wants the Senate to do it as quickly as possible? It's completely contradictory and hypocritical to everything Senator Sanders has stood for in - over the course of multiple presidential races and his entire career in public service.

Well, you heard a lot about this during the campaign that the Biden administration was supposedly shattering the glass ceiling for women everywhere. But their actual policies tell a different story. In an inauguration day executive order that elated the transgender community, the Biden administration pledged to combat discrimination based on sexual orientation and identity - gender identity. And said children should be able to learn without worrying about whether they'll be denied access to the restroom or locker room or school sports. What does that mean? That means biological boys will be in the locker rooms with biological girls. And their speculation that public schools could end up having funding polled federal funds if they don't adhere to this. Female athletes saying, Joe Biden is erasing what it is to be a female athlete in the United States. Author Abigail Shrier put it bluntly, \"A new glass ceiling was just placed over girls.\" And by the way, don't think any of these changes with hormone treatment or makes competition fairer among biological boys, between boys and girls, because a recent study discovered that hormone therapy does not suddenly remove the natural athletic benefits that biological men naturally have over women. It was published last month in the British Journal of Sports Medicine. Now, the study's lead author Dr. Timothy Roberts said, at one year the transwomen on average still have an advantage over the biological women - they call cis women. So is this why Joe Biden was elected? Was this part of his mandate? So much for unity. Well, from gender to good paying jobs, the Biden administration seems intent on destroying it all."

And complete detail what we're going to do. We will make sure that science and -- scientists and public health experts will speak directly to you.

The World Health Organization is now admitting what many of us have known for months, which is that there is an unknown but potentially huge quantity of what they call false positives test results using the supposed gold standard PCR test. And here in the United Kingdom, for example, our own government, despite doing some half-a-million tests every single day, has also admitted in the house of Parliament, it doesn't know what its operational false-positive rate is. And here we've got to the World Health Organization finally say, actually, you need to review every result, and you need to look at the symptoms of the potential patient, the potential person carrying the disease. And you then need to look at the strength of the test, or the weakness of the test to see whether actually you need to do a second confirmatory test if it's a weak one to see whether or not it's a true result or actually is it a false, or what I term an irrelevant positive, where it's, yes, there's a tiny bit of something, but it's so small and it's taken so many magnifications to find it that actually it's irrelevant and you don't need to worry about it."

I'm not a doctor, but we knew the thing about the cycling of the PCR test back in June, and they are just getting around to admitting this now? And they are still calling this the gold standard?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "TICE",
      "utterance": "Let's be very clear. If it's done, if this PCR test is done as it was supposed to be done, which is in a specialized laboratory by specialized technicians, then yes, it is gold standard. But if it's done on an industrial scale in temporary laboratories using unqualified people, than the risk of contamination, Laura, is huge. And that's the problem that we've got in the United Kingdom. That's the problem that I feel may be taking place around the rest of the world. And on that basis, it then becomes not gold standard. It becomes I think a rather dirty standard, unless it is double checked. And interestingly, Laura, in Norway for example, wherever they get a positive result from someone who doesn't have any symptoms, they always double-check with a second test. And guess what, they have a much, much lower overall positive case rate than we have here in the United Kingdom."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Richard, it's the case that the U.K. elections could be put off because of the case numbers even though when you look at the chart from the COVID world meter, whatever it is, the plateau seems to be a surety. It looks like the peak in the U.K. was two weeks ago. But it looks like you guys could be putting off elections because of this?"

YouTube takes down things if it doesn't accord with government information. And now they're going to take away our democracy, it seems, by taking away the ballot box, which is absolutely ridiculous. One senior politician suggested he was a bit worried about COVID on the pencils. I said listen, for heaven's sake, if you're short of pencils, I will sort it out. This is ridiculous. You've just had a big election, over 150 million people voted. We can have it over two days, three days, it will be warm. We can have it outside. Where there's a will, there's a way, Laura."
