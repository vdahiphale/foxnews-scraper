      "sentences": "Good evening and welcome to “Tucker Carlson Tonight.” The 2020 presidential race is effectively underway, and has been since the midterms in November. The most formidable candidates have not officially announced yet. They want to be fashionably late to the party. But it's obvious who they are. Their shadow campaigns are busy lining up donors, ginning up publicity, and trying, in general, to seem impressive. The most vigorous contender in this group is Robert Beto O'Rourke of Texas. O'Rourke nearly beat Ted Cruz in the Senate race this fall, you'll remember.  Democrats love him for that. Affluent progressives on the coasts love him best. He's one of them. In the betting markets, O'Rourke is now the favorite to win the Democratic nomination. Two years from now, he plausibly could be sitting in the Oval Office.  So, it's worth taking Beto O'Rourke seriously. What kind of president would he be? Well at this point, we can only guess. We do know that, like most people in his social class, he is totally against Border walls.",

Then perhaps you can be forgiven for thinking that a wall is going to solve the problem.  We in El Paso are ashamed of this now. But this is going to be one of those moments where the folks in Germany look back on the Berlin Wall or the United States looks back on its project to intern Japanese Americans during World War II.",

    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "sentences": "Did you hear that? So Berlin Wall, bad. Border wall also bad, indeed, bad very much like interning the Japanese during World War II was bad. It was another racist attack on the Asians from the FDR Administration or something like that. Whatever! Walls are bad, OK? So far, that's been about the sum total of what we know about Beto O'Rourke's policy views. That and he also went to the dentist recently. We know because he put it on Instagram.   But thankfully, now, we know even more. O'Rourke just did a two-hour long interview with a reporter from Jeff Bezos' Washington newspaper, the Washington Post, which like O'Rourke himself is a full-time mouthpiece for guilty rich people. O'Rourke knew he was speaking to his own community, so he relaxed long enough to explain what he really thinks about things, including Border walls. Walls are bad, O'Rourke explained, not just because they intern perfectly decent Japanese people but because they literally commit murder, or rather, we commit murder when we build walls. As O'Rourke put it, if you construct a barrier along our Southern border, \"You will ensure death. You and I, as Americans, have caused the deaths of others through these walls.\"  Let that settle. Whoa! We killed people, and we didn't even know it. That's pretty heavy. How many people did we kill? Should we turn ourselves in to the authorities or prepare for life on the lam? Do we need new passports, cosmetic surgery? Does Paraguay have an extradition treaty? So many questions.   The real question though is what the hell is Beto O'Rourke talking about? To be fair, it's not like he's pretending to know. O'Rourke makes it perfectly clear that he has no idea what he's saying, and that's OK. He's not embarrassed about it. When the Washington Post asked O'Rourke what he would do about illegal aliens overstaying their visas, which is a huge part of our immigration crisis, he answered this way, \"I don't know.\" Thank you, Mr. Spicoli (ph). Please take your seat.  Beto's not into details. Beto's into ideas, big ideas, ideas of the future, sweeping panoramic truths about being in personhood and new modes of authentic expression, the kind of stuff that would spill your bong water and blow your mind. Beto's not a micro guy. He's bigger than that. He's a transformer. And what Beto wants to transform next, after failing to transform Texas, is nothing less than the United States of America starting with the beliefs this country was founded on. That's what he told Jeff Bezos' newspaper.  Does this still work, he asked, this being America, and Beto wasn't so sure. And so, he asked the question that future historians will recognize as a pivot point in the life of this country. Can America, quote, still be managed by the same principles that were set down 230-plus years ago?  And that's not a small question. The principles, Beto refers to, would include the Bill of Rights, freedom of speech, freedom of religion and assembly, the right to self-defense, and a fair trial. Does any of that still matter, or those all just old ideas, stumbling blocks that are preventing people like Beto, good and brilliant people, who went to Columbia and have beautiful weekend homes, from getting the power they need to turn this place into a truly awesome country?  A country where skateboards outnumber SUVs and everyone is thin, and has quality childcare, a nation that values hot yoga above football, a place where insensitive thoughts are banned and punished appropriately. Beto doesn't know the answer to those questions right now, but he's thinking about it.   Nate Lerner is thinking about it too. He's co-Founder of DraftBeto.org. It's a website promoting O'Rourke's presidential run, and he is kind enough to join us tonight. Unlike so many people on the Democratic side, you have come, and I really appreciate that. So let me just ask a very straightforward question. When Beto O'Rourke says that we need to re-think some of the principles upon which the country was founded, would that include the freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, freedom of religion, the Second Amendment? What - what does that mean?",

And also, when you build a massive wall during the - in - in - at the points where people - of entry where people are most likely to illegally cross the border, they will seek out other points, and those points tend to be more dangerous. And so, if you force people to find different and new ways to come into the - come into the country, a lot of those tend to be more dangerous and you're more - you're increasing the likelihood of killing people. So, he's saying, we need to find a more civil and humane way of treating those who come into our country. And, you know, that doesn't mean, no border security. He's not for open borders.

A racist would support treating people differently based purely on their skin color. They'd hand out jobs and contracts and college admissions letters based on your DNA, rather than anything that you had done. They'd also say that some people's opinions don't matter because of their skin color. That would be a racist statement. Wouldn't it? They would ridicule people regularly on the basis of their skin color. Racism? Yes. They would also believe in race-based retribution most ominously. That means people of one race paying the price today for actions decades or centuries ago by people they may not have any relationship to at all, other than a similar appearance. What would that be? Well that would be the definition of racism, right? People like this might even cancel activist marches if too many people of the wrong color showed up. What is that if not racism? They might also write op-eds saying they don't want their own children to be friends with people of another race. They might say a friendship like that would be impossible. That's what they would do. Does that sound like what Republicans are doing? I don't know. We'll let you decide. Victor Davis Hanson is a Fellow at the Hoover Institution, and he joins us tonight.

The most flagrant abuse, not surprisingly, concerns abortion.

For example, videos by abortionist turned pro-life activist Andy Letivino (ph) were buried, displaced by pro-abortion content from BuzzFeed and CNN.

I think people should be encouraged to do Democratic activities like this on both sides and help with elections.

Here, you have the one example of Maxine Waters. But let's just play - let's just play this out. Now, we have about 20-plus Democrats running for - for the Democratic nomination. If Google decides to bump up the search engine results in a positive way for Beto O'Rourke in response, for example, to Democratic candidates for President 2020, and then bump down Tulsi Gabbard or some others, for example, that's going to be a contribution, and that contribution, in - in my opinion, to those candidates who benefit from it, and a very valuable one.

He recently gave a long interview to a website called Spiked about the Yellow Vest demonstrations there that have convulsed French society, and terrified the French government. Our media haven't said very much about the Yellow Vests, and that should not surprise you. Ostensibly, their protests are a reaction to global warming taxes and speed cameras. But as Guilluy explains, what you're actually watching is a revolt against a deeply selfish and stupid establishment, and that very much includes the media. Listen to his analysis here, and ask yourself if it sounds at all familiar. \"Fifteen years ago, I noticed that the majority of working-class people actually live very far away from the major globalized cities, far from Paris, Lyon and Toulouse, and also very far from London and New York. Technically, our globalized economic model performs well. It produces a lot of wealth. But it doesn't need the majority of the population to function. It has no real need for the manual workers, laborers and even small- business owners outside of the big cities. Paris creates enough wealth for the whole of France, and London does the same in Britain. But you cannot build a society around this. What the Yellow Vest protestors have in common is they live in areas where there is hardly any work left. They know that even if they have a job today, they could lose it tomorrow, and they won't find anything else. They are also culturally misunderstood by the elite. One illustration of this cultural divide is that most modern, progressive social movements and protests are quickly endorsed by celebrities, actors, and the media and the intellectuals. But none of them approve of the Yellow Vests. Their emergence has caused a kind of psychological shock to the cultural establishment. It is exactly the same shock that the British elites experienced with the Brexit vote and that they are still experiencing now, three years later. Many voters wanted to remind the political class that they exist. That's what French people are using the Yellow Vests for, to say \"We exist.\" We are seeing the same phenomenon in populist revolts across the world. All the growth and dynamism is in the major cities, but people cannot just move there. The cities are inaccessible, particularly thanks to mounting housing costs. The cities have become very unequal, too. The Parisian economy needs executives and qualified professionals. It also needs workers, predominantly immigrants, for the construction industry and catering etcetera. Business relies on this very specific demographic mix. The problem is that the people outside the cities still exist. The non- urban population actually encompasses the majority of French people. We have a new bourgeoisie, but because they are very cool and progressive, it creates the impression that there is no class conflict anymore. It is really difficult to oppose the hipsters when they say they care about the poor and about minorities. But actually, they are very much complicit in relegating the working classes to the sidelines. Not only do they benefit enormously from the globalized economy, but they have also produced a dominant cultural discourse, which ostracizes working-class people. Think of the \"deplorables\" evoked by Hillary Clinton. There is a similar view of the working class in France and Britain. They are looked upon as if they are some kind of Amazonian tribe. The problem for the elites is that this is a very big tribe. The reaction to the Yellow Vests has been telling in France. Immediately, the protesters were denounced as xenophobes, anti-Semites and homophobes. The elites present themselves as anti-fascist and anti-racist. But this is merely a way of defending their class interests. It is the only argument they can muster to defend their status, but it's not working anymore. Now the elites are afraid. A lot has been made of the fact that the Yellow Vests' demands vary a great deal. But above all, it's a demand for democracy. Fundamentally, they want to be taken seriously and they want to be integrated into the economic order. We need a cultural revolution, particularly in the universities and in the media. They need to stop insulting the working class, to stop thinking of them as imbeciles. Cultural respect is fundamental. There will be no economic or political integration until there is cultural integration. Then, of course, we need to think differently about the economy. That means dispensing with neoliberal dogma. We need to think beyond Paris, London and New York.\" Well if you found yourself, as you heard that, thinking that Guilluy was talking about your country, not France, there's a reason. In many ways, he was. Imagine what it would look like if our Republican leaders understood what you just heard. They might start winning elections.",

      "utterance": "Good evening and welcome to “Tucker Carlson Tonight.” The 2020 presidential race is effectively underway, and has been since the midterms in November. The most formidable candidates have not officially announced yet. They want to be fashionably late to the party. But it's obvious who they are. Their shadow campaigns are busy lining up donors, ginning up publicity, and trying, in general, to seem impressive. The most vigorous contender in this group is Robert Beto O'Rourke of Texas. O'Rourke nearly beat Ted Cruz in the Senate race this fall, you'll remember. Democrats love him for that. Affluent progressives on the coasts love him best. He's one of them. In the betting markets, O'Rourke is now the favorite to win the Democratic nomination. Two years from now, he plausibly could be sitting in the Oval Office. So, it's worth taking Beto O'Rourke seriously. What kind of president would he be? Well at this point, we can only guess. We do know that, like most people in his social class, he is totally against Border walls."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BETO O'ROURKE, D-TX, FORMER REPRESENTATIVE",
      "utterance": "Will fight when necessary against a President who's focused on building walls. No wall is going to solve legitimate security concerns. Then perhaps you can be forgiven for thinking that a wall is going to solve the problem. We in El Paso are ashamed of this now. But this is going to be one of those moments where the folks in Germany look back on the Berlin Wall or the United States looks back on its project to intern Japanese Americans during World War II."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Did you hear that? So Berlin Wall, bad. Border wall also bad, indeed, bad very much like interning the Japanese during World War II was bad. It was another racist attack on the Asians from the FDR Administration or something like that. Whatever! Walls are bad, OK? So far, that's been about the sum total of what we know about Beto O'Rourke's policy views. That and he also went to the dentist recently. We know because he put it on Instagram. But thankfully, now, we know even more. O'Rourke just did a two-hour long interview with a reporter from Jeff Bezos' Washington newspaper, the Washington Post, which like O'Rourke himself is a full-time mouthpiece for guilty rich people. O'Rourke knew he was speaking to his own community, so he relaxed long enough to explain what he really thinks about things, including Border walls. Walls are bad, O'Rourke explained, not just because they intern perfectly decent Japanese people but because they literally commit murder, or rather, we commit murder when we build walls. As O'Rourke put it, if you construct a barrier along our Southern border, \"You will ensure death. You and I, as Americans, have caused the deaths of others through these walls.\" Let that settle. Whoa! We killed people, and we didn't even know it. That's pretty heavy. How many people did we kill? Should we turn ourselves in to the authorities or prepare for life on the lam? Do we need new passports, cosmetic surgery? Does Paraguay have an extradition treaty? So many questions. The real question though is what the hell is Beto O'Rourke talking about? To be fair, it's not like he's pretending to know. O'Rourke makes it perfectly clear that he has no idea what he's saying, and that's OK. He's not embarrassed about it. When the Washington Post asked O'Rourke what he would do about illegal aliens overstaying their visas, which is a huge part of our immigration crisis, he answered this way, \"I don't know.\" Thank you, Mr. Spicoli (ph). Please take your seat. Beto's not into details. Beto's into ideas, big ideas, ideas of the future, sweeping panoramic truths about being in personhood and new modes of authentic expression, the kind of stuff that would spill your bong water and blow your mind. Beto's not a micro guy. He's bigger than that. He's a transformer. And what Beto wants to transform next, after failing to transform Texas, is nothing less than the United States of America starting with the beliefs this country was founded on. That's what he told Jeff Bezos' newspaper. Does this still work, he asked, this being America, and Beto wasn't so sure. And so, he asked the question that future historians will recognize as a pivot point in the life of this country. Can America, quote, still be managed by the same principles that were set down 230-plus years ago? And that's not a small question. The principles, Beto refers to, would include the Bill of Rights, freedom of speech, freedom of religion and assembly, the right to self-defense, and a fair trial. Does any of that still matter, or those all just old ideas, stumbling blocks that are preventing people like Beto, good and brilliant people, who went to Columbia and have beautiful weekend homes, from getting the power they need to turn this place into a truly awesome country? A country where skateboards outnumber SUVs and everyone is thin, and has quality childcare, a nation that values hot yoga above football, a place where insensitive thoughts are banned and punished appropriately. Beto doesn't know the answer to those questions right now, but he's thinking about it. Nate Lerner is thinking about it too. He's co-Founder of DraftBeto.org. It's a website promoting O'Rourke's presidential run, and he is kind enough to join us tonight. Unlike so many people on the Democratic side, you have come, and I really appreciate that. So let me just ask a very straightforward question. When Beto O'Rourke says that we need to re-think some of the principles upon which the country was founded, would that include the freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, freedom of religion, the Second Amendment? What - what does that mean?"

And also, when you build a massive wall during the - in - in - at the points where people - of entry where people are most likely to illegally cross the border, they will seek out other points, and those points tend to be more dangerous. And so, if you force people to find different and new ways to come into the - come into the country, a lot of those tend to be more dangerous and you're more - you're increasing the likelihood of killing people. So, he's saying, we need to find a more civil and humane way of treating those who come into our country. And, you know, that doesn't mean, no border security. He's not for open borders.

How'd if - you know if you are racist. And so, we have a handily checklist for you. Get a pen and follow along. See if you can answer these questions. A racist - what would a racist do? A racist would support treating people differently based purely on their skin color. They'd hand out jobs and contracts and college admissions letters based on your DNA, rather than anything that you had done. They'd also say that some people's opinions don't matter because of their skin color. That would be a racist statement. Wouldn't it? They would ridicule people regularly on the basis of their skin color. Racism? Yes. They would also believe in race-based retribution most ominously. That means people of one race paying the price today for actions decades or centuries ago by people they may not have any relationship to at all, other than a similar appearance. What would that be? Well that would be the definition of racism, right? People like this might even cancel activist marches if too many people of the wrong color showed up. What is that if not racism? They might also write op-eds saying they don't want their own children to be friends with people of another race. They might say a friendship like that would be impossible. That's what they would do. Does that sound like what Republicans are doing? I don't know. We'll let you decide. Victor Davis Hanson is a Fellow at the Hoover Institution, and he joins us tonight.

The New York Times was not upset. Then we've got this whole trope now in - in rap music, all the major marquee rappers, Ice Cube, Jay-Z, Scarface, it's just rampant anti- Semitism. And we saw LeBron James, our national icon, re-tweeting an anti- Semitic tweet and with no - of a rapper with no consequences. So, the American people are saying to themselves, \"Wow!

The most flagrant abuse, not surprisingly, concerns abortion. After receiving a complaint from a political activist posing as a reporter at Slate.com, there are a lot of those, Google intervened to bury pro-life videos on YouTube, and replace them in search with pro-abortion videos. For example, videos by abortionist turned pro-life activist Andy Letivino (ph) were buried, displaced by pro-abortion content from BuzzFeed and CNN. Well, in a statement, YouTube denied doing anything wrong and said any shifts were purely due to their algorithms which, of course, are controlled by people.

Harmeet Dhillon, unlike us, is an attorney, and she joins us tonight.

And - and if anybody thinks that this is some sort of aberration, Google has been doing this and bragging about it internally, even in the last election. Tucker, I think, your show has previously covered the fact that Google made what, I think, one internal person at Google, a Manager at Google called silent campaign contribution by turning out the vote and contributing turnout the vote efforts in several states that were swing states for Hillary Clinton, and specifically targeting Latino voters. I think people should be encouraged to do Democratic activities like this on both sides and help with elections. But when a corporation does it with its corporate assets, it needs to be dis - disclosed as a campaign finance violation, declared and disclosed on the other side as a campaign finance receipt by the campaign. Here, you have the one example of Maxine Waters. But let's just play - let's just play this out. Now, we have about 20-plus Democrats running for - for the Democratic nomination. If Google decides to bump up the search engine results in a positive way for Beto O'Rourke in response, for example, to Democratic candidates for President 2020, and then bump down Tulsi Gabbard or some others, for example, that's going to be a contribution, and that contribution, in - in my opinion, to those candidates who benefit from it, and a very valuable one. And if it isn't being disclosed as such, then that is a fraud on our democracy. And you can then imagine what they're doing vis-a-vis Donald Trump. They're already doing it to Republicans as we - you have previously reported with regard to search engine results for Republican Women, for California Republican Party, for various other Republicans. So, I think this is, you know - you know, we all think every story is important when it comes to Google and what they do online. But this is a particularly shocking and alarming story that we really need to see our Members of Congress, Senators and the White House wake up about this issue because otherwise we aren't going to be talking about a democracy in the next two election cycles.

He recently gave a long interview to a website called Spiked about the Yellow Vest demonstrations there that have convulsed French society, and terrified the French government. Our media haven't said very much about the Yellow Vests, and that should not surprise you. Ostensibly, their protests are a reaction to global warming taxes and speed cameras. But as Guilluy explains, what you're actually watching is a revolt against a deeply selfish and stupid establishment, and that very much includes the media. Listen to his analysis here, and ask yourself if it sounds at all familiar. \"Fifteen years ago, I noticed that the majority of working-class people actually live very far away from the major globalized cities, far from Paris, Lyon and Toulouse, and also very far from London and New York. Technically, our globalized economic model performs well. It produces a lot of wealth. But it doesn't need the majority of the population to function. It has no real need for the manual workers, laborers and even small- business owners outside of the big cities. Paris creates enough wealth for the whole of France, and London does the same in Britain. But you cannot build a society around this. What the Yellow Vest protestors have in common is they live in areas where there is hardly any work left. They know that even if they have a job today, they could lose it tomorrow, and they won't find anything else. They are also culturally misunderstood by the elite. One illustration of this cultural divide is that most modern, progressive social movements and protests are quickly endorsed by celebrities, actors, and the media and the intellectuals. But none of them approve of the Yellow Vests. Their emergence has caused a kind of psychological shock to the cultural establishment. It is exactly the same shock that the British elites experienced with the Brexit vote and that they are still experiencing now, three years later. Many voters wanted to remind the political class that they exist. That's what French people are using the Yellow Vests for, to say \"We exist.\" We are seeing the same phenomenon in populist revolts across the world. All the growth and dynamism is in the major cities, but people cannot just move there. The cities are inaccessible, particularly thanks to mounting housing costs. The cities have become very unequal, too. The Parisian economy needs executives and qualified professionals. It also needs workers, predominantly immigrants, for the construction industry and catering etcetera. Business relies on this very specific demographic mix. The problem is that the people outside the cities still exist. The non- urban population actually encompasses the majority of French people. We have a new bourgeoisie, but because they are very cool and progressive, it creates the impression that there is no class conflict anymore. It is really difficult to oppose the hipsters when they say they care about the poor and about minorities. But actually, they are very much complicit in relegating the working classes to the sidelines. Not only do they benefit enormously from the globalized economy, but they have also produced a dominant cultural discourse, which ostracizes working-class people. Think of the \"deplorables\" evoked by Hillary Clinton. There is a similar view of the working class in France and Britain. They are looked upon as if they are some kind of Amazonian tribe. The problem for the elites is that this is a very big tribe. The reaction to the Yellow Vests has been telling in France. Immediately, the protesters were denounced as xenophobes, anti-Semites and homophobes. The elites present themselves as anti-fascist and anti-racist. But this is merely a way of defending their class interests. It is the only argument they can muster to defend their status, but it's not working anymore. Now the elites are afraid. A lot has been made of the fact that the Yellow Vests' demands vary a great deal. But above all, it's a demand for democracy. Fundamentally, they want to be taken seriously and they want to be integrated into the economic order. We need a cultural revolution, particularly in the universities and in the media. They need to stop insulting the working class, to stop thinking of them as imbeciles. Cultural respect is fundamental. There will be no economic or political integration until there is cultural integration. Then, of course, we need to think differently about the economy. That means dispensing with neoliberal dogma. We need to think beyond Paris, London and New York.\" Well if you found yourself, as you heard that, thinking that Guilluy was talking about your country, not France, there's a reason. In many ways, he was. Imagine what it would look like if our Republican leaders understood what you just heard. They might start winning elections."

If weed smoking causes schizophrenia and there's a suggestion that it does, schizophrenia kills lots of people, and so does suicide, and so does violence. And if marijuana use hikes rates of violence and it seems like there's a lot of evidence that it does, then that kills people. So, the question is not, do they die from lung cancer. The question is do they die from suicide or violence. And those are real questions, and you don't know the answers to them. So, why are you saying it's totally safe when you - you don't know that that's true?"
