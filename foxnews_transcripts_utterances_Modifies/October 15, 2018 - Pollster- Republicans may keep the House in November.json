      "sentences": "I am Laura Ingraham and this is \"The Ingraham Angle.\" Thank you so much for joining us. Elizabeth Warren is catching a little bit of heat for claiming Native American ancestry. The Cherokee nation is out tonight with a statement slamming the Massachusetts senator, one of its members is here to sound off. Plus, while most pollsters think the Republicans will lose the House this November, a few are beginning to take a different view. One of them joins us tonight to explain.  And violent Antifa mobs seemingly running the streets of Portland, Oregon? A counter protester is here with this first-hand account before Mark Fuhrman explains how the city leadership is failing its people miserably. But first, Democrats peddle victimhood as the midterm strategy. That is the focus of tonight's Angle.  At some point in life, we all have to decide whether we want to be victims or victors. Do we want to be defined by slights and wrongs, ones that are perceived or real? That we suffer at the hands of others. Two hundred and forty-two years ago, our forefathers made the decision that kind of sitting around bemoaning our fate under British rule wasn't going to get us anywhere. They decided to do something about it.  We are a people who chose freedom and liberty rooted in a sense of virtue over despair and hopelessness. And with courage, sacrifice, and an indomitable spirit and an abiding faith in God, we won our independence and eventually created the greatest country in the world. Powerful forces in today's Democratic Party though, are at war with that fundamental understanding of the American story. In fact, many think the founding of our country was inherently corrupt and even illegitimate, and they have made a decision to run against that version of America. In the absence of an actual plan to grow American prosperity and keep us safe, Democrats are embracing victimhood as a political platform this midterm cycle. Democrat Stacey Abrams is running for governor in Georgia.",

That's where the scale goes. It goes like from .09 percent to I don't know, like everybody else. According to The New York Times, scientists say the average European- American is 0.18 percent Native American. So that would make Warren less Native American than the average European-American. Wait a second. What the heck happened to liberal concerns about cultural appropriation? I guess that's out the window. Warren is kind of a typical Democrat though here. She's racially obsessed and let's face it, that's just easier than being factually informed. And worst, she is willing to scam the system, in this case, play in Indian to get a boost professionally or in this case politically.  And to add insult to injury, her DNA specialist, Carlos Bustamante, flatly admitted that he didn't even use Native American samples for the test. Seriously? To make up for the lack of those samples, he used one from Mexico, pero, and Colombia. Keep this up and warren is going to be claiming that she's more Latina than Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez by 2020.  Well, speaking of Latinos, a new migrant caravan from Central America, the second in six months, is now headed up through Mexico to the United States this week. It already has 1,600 members. Naturally, Democrats have started their old narrative about Trump separating families at the border. If only they had the same concern for Americans brutally victimized by illegals here in the United States. In the last few weeks, two illegals have committed vicious rapes just in the New York area. One, Ever Martinez-Reyes followed a Nassau County woman home, knocked her out, and repeatedly raped her for about an hour. Then there's Julio Ayala. He is thought to be a member of MS-13. And Ayala broke into the bedroom of an 11-year-old girl he did not know and raped her on a bunk bed with her brother below them.   Meanwhile, we hear almost nothing on those stories or so many more like them from Democrats who at the same time agonized over noncitizens overwhelming our border patrol. When Lesley Stahl tried to melt hearts with her family separation narrative last night, the president set her straight.",

You felt it in that \"60 Minutes\" interview last night. The left is fuming that \"60 Minutes\" actually aired the interview. Check out the blog. But he has that extra bounce in his step and a sense that his party is now on the rise again. Following the Kavanaugh battle, you would've thought though that the Democrats might've gotten a message that victimhood for political gain is not a great strategy. It won't work and it hasn't. And the good news is, the Republicans may have finally found their groove. They are outselling the peace, prosperity, and security agenda that Trump won on and is delivering on.  I don't know, in the end, I think most Americans are just smart enough to see that victimhood is a dead-end personally and politically. And that's the Angle.  Joining me here in studio, former Trump deputy campaign manager Dave Bossie and University of Maryland lecturer Jason Nichols. Jason was chopping at the bit and I want him to go right at this. Jason, here's what -- let's start with Elizabeth Warren. I think Elizabeth Warren and you go back to the Harvard faculty where she is described as a premier minority hire at the Harvard Law School. I'm thinking if you're trying to pass yourself off as a Cherokee Indian and you had to get a guy from 23andMe who is a paid advisor to that company, like, do this goofy like Hallmark video, like, yes you are part Cherokee.  You know, the Cherokee Nation tonight says the following. The Cherokee Nations says, \"Using a DNA test to lay claim to any connection to the Cherokee Nation or any tribal nation, even vaguely, is inappropriate and wrong. Senator Warren is undermining tribal interests with her continued claims of tribal heritage.\" She was trying to play the victim card and she got exposed.",

And another thing people don't understand is the police have slowly been changing their tactics in Portland where they used to just stand back completely. They would never intervene. If you look at August 4th, they did do their job, and then even last Saturday, fights broke out that lasted maybe a minute, a minute-and-a-half, and then they got everyone separated.  So I think that --",

Former LAPD detective Mark Fuhrman joins us to react. Mark, you have been seeing this Antifa stuff happening for some time.

The Cherokee nation is out tonight with a statement slamming the Massachusetts senator, one of its members is here to sound off. Plus, while most pollsters think the Republicans will lose the House this November, a few are beginning to take a different view. One of them joins us tonight to explain. And violent Antifa mobs seemingly running the streets of Portland, Oregon? A counter protester is here with this first-hand account before Mark Fuhrman explains how the city leadership is failing its people miserably. But first, Democrats peddle victimhood as the midterm strategy. That is the focus of tonight's Angle. At some point in life, we all have to decide whether we want to be victims or victors. Do we want to be defined by slights and wrongs, ones that are perceived or real? That we suffer at the hands of others. Two hundred and forty-two years ago, our forefathers made the decision that kind of sitting around bemoaning our fate under British rule wasn't going to get us anywhere. They decided to do something about it. We are a people who chose freedom and liberty rooted in a sense of virtue over despair and hopelessness. And with courage, sacrifice, and an indomitable spirit and an abiding faith in God, we won our independence and eventually created the greatest country in the world. Powerful forces in today's Democratic Party though, are at war with that fundamental understanding of the American story. In fact, many think the founding of our country was inherently corrupt and even illegitimate, and they have made a decision to run against that version of America. In the absence of an actual plan to grow American prosperity and keep us safe, Democrats are embracing victimhood as a political platform this midterm cycle.

That's where the scale goes. It goes like from .09 percent to I don't know, like everybody else. According to The New York Times, scientists say the average European- American is 0.18 percent Native American. So that would make Warren less Native American than the average European-American. Wait a second. What the heck happened to liberal concerns about cultural appropriation? I guess that's out the window. Warren is kind of a typical Democrat though here. She's racially obsessed and let's face it, that's just easier than being factually informed. And worst, she is willing to scam the system, in this case, play in Indian to get a boost professionally or in this case politically. And to add insult to injury, her DNA specialist, Carlos Bustamante, flatly admitted that he didn't even use Native American samples for the test. Seriously? To make up for the lack of those samples, he used one from Mexico, pero, and Colombia. Keep this up and warren is going to be claiming that she's more Latina than Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez by 2020. Well, speaking of Latinos, a new migrant caravan from Central America, the second in six months, is now headed up through Mexico to the United States this week. It already has 1,600 members.

If only they had the same concern for Americans brutally victimized by illegals here in the United States. In the last few weeks, two illegals have committed vicious rapes just in the New York area. One, Ever Martinez-Reyes followed a Nassau County woman home, knocked her out, and repeatedly raped her for about an hour. Then there's Julio Ayala. He is thought to be a member of MS-13. And Ayala broke into the bedroom of an 11-year-old girl he did not know and raped her on a bunk bed with her brother below them. Meanwhile, we hear almost nothing on those stories or so many more like them from Democrats who at the same time agonized over noncitizens overwhelming our border patrol. When Lesley Stahl tried to melt hearts with her family separation narrative last night, the president set her straight."

You felt it in that \"60 Minutes\" interview last night. The left is fuming that \"60 Minutes\" actually aired the interview. Check out the blog. But he has that extra bounce in his step and a sense that his party is now on the rise again. Following the Kavanaugh battle, you would've thought though that the Democrats might've gotten a message that victimhood for political gain is not a great strategy. It won't work and it hasn't. And the good news is, the Republicans may have finally found their groove. They are outselling the peace, prosperity, and security agenda that Trump won on and is delivering on. I don't know, in the end, I think most Americans are just smart enough to see that victimhood is a dead-end personally and politically. And that's the Angle. Joining me here in studio, former Trump deputy campaign manager Dave Bossie and University of Maryland lecturer Jason Nichols. Jason was chopping at the bit and I want him to go right at this. Jason, here's what -- let's start with Elizabeth Warren. I think Elizabeth Warren and you go back to the Harvard faculty where she is described as a premier minority hire at the Harvard Law School. I'm thinking if you're trying to pass yourself off as a Cherokee Indian and you had to get a guy from 23andMe who is a paid advisor to that company, like, do this goofy like Hallmark video, like, yes you are part Cherokee. You know, the Cherokee Nation tonight says the following. The Cherokee Nations says, \"Using a DNA test to lay claim to any connection to the Cherokee Nation or any tribal nation, even vaguely, is inappropriate and wrong. Senator Warren is undermining tribal interests with her continued claims of tribal heritage.\" She was trying to play the victim card and she got exposed."

They are trying to match people to people. That's not a bad idea. It's a problem it disparately effects people.

Bring millions of new voters from the Rust Belt to the heartland out to get them to vote for President Trump. The typical midterm election is 90 million voters. What's going on right now is each party is trying to excite their base to get more of their base out. So the Democrats are trying to get the anti-Trump vote out and we are trying to get the Trump voters out, and the Kavanaugh's Supreme Court fiasco was really about a Democrat effort to suppress our vote. What they really wanted the president to do was either withdraw it or the Republicans not giving the votes to get past. And if that had happened, millions of Trump voters would have stayed home. So what's happened, it has backfired on them. Even ABC today has a battleground pulse saying the Republicans are up in the generic ballot in the 66 targeted districts that are most contested in the House. So, what you've got is, you've got Nancy Pelosi, who's really unpopular. In our September survey, she had a 55 percent unfavorable rating. Only 30 percent favorable.

I mean, we all want people to vote but my point is if you sell this idea of victimhood and fear, or you sell peace and prosperity? Is it fairness over victimhood, peace, prosperity, safety?

And, you know, her squeezing someone's hand, maybe she was just trying to process it all. I believe that every woman's voice needs to be heard but at the same time, there needs to be processes in place so that everyone gets the right to be able to say what they need to say, which didn't happened in this Kavanaugh case.

This is the exertion of power and a power differential between an adult man who is the head of the most important, most powerful nation on earth, with an intern. How, as a feminist, do you say that that is legitimate consent? How is that consent when you are the president of the United States and she is a low level intern with her first job, with no experience at all in the workplace.

      "speaker": "GIBSON",

And so the goal was to eventually get the mayor to allow the police to do their job. So from city to city, it changes. And Portland right now, as you saw a week ago, there were protesters blocking the streets and they were attacking motorists, and the police did nothing about it. So we went back in there and we did a flash march to kind of bring attention to this issue, to put the pressure on Ted Wheeler in hopes that would have some sort of response. So it depends on the situation, but a lot of it is bringing media attention, inspiring other people to stand up for what they believe in, especially in these far left cities."

If you carry an American flag in Portland by yourself, you're going to get bloodied. That's the thing that people to understand. So until the city makes some changes and the culture makes some changes, free speech isn't truly going to exist in the city until they really make changes, especially with the police. And another thing people don't understand is the police have slowly been changing their tactics in Portland where they used to just stand back completely. They would never intervene. If you look at August 4th, they did do their job, and then even last Saturday, fights broke out that lasted maybe a minute, a minute-and-a-half, and then they got everyone separated.  So I think that --"

And you think that Portland's mayor Ted Wheeler would've noticed what was happening by now, but he's actually pretty supportive of police backing away generally from confronting violent protesters. Former LAPD detective Mark Fuhrman joins us to react. Mark, you have been seeing this Antifa stuff happening for some time. What kind of message does it send of the people of Portland when their mayor is encouraging cops to kind of stand down and tolerate these violent street protesters and basically leave citizens to fend for themselves?"

We saw it in Washington even after we had a protest here recently. We have seen it, of course, as Gibson said, in Berkeley, but not just there. We thought at these WTO, anti-WTO rallies before that. Sometimes at Occupy Wall Street things broke out. So this has been ramping up over time, Mark, and it seems that police just do not have a good handle on this."

And I would like to apologize to all the line officers in all of these cities. We know it is not you. Your fellow officers, your retired officers, people know it is not you. If you want to actually confront these groups, once they deviate from the policy in the permit guidelines, it is now an unlawful assembly, and then you take action. But Laura, the thing that the cities actually do is they make it impossible for the police to actually do that. They don't give them the absolute manpower and the reserve manpower. They don't give them city buses to transport people they have arrested, set up field jails and actually have a system where they plan on maybe arresting 100, 200, or 300 people. They want it to go away. They want to hold their breath. They want to hope that there's only a couple altercations and nothing happens and nothing is burned down and nobody is murdered, and then they can sigh --"

People had guns. People had clubs. You can pass laws in the city of Portland to actually curb this by saying no masks, no disguises, no certain pieces of wood on signs. You can actually curb this, but if you don't want to do that, which the mayor seems to not want to do, then you're going to have more violence.

We live in a country where most of the nonnative population doesn't understand or know basic information about our identity, about tribal sovereignty, and about our history as native people.
