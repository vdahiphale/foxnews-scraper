It's 5 o'clock in New York City and this is \"The Five.\" There's a new political fallout for Hillary Clinton. Fox News now confirming that Clinton and the DNC paid for the research that led to that infamous Russian dossier. As you may recall, that dossier tried to tie the president to Moscow. Here's what we know. A lawyer representing the Clinton camp retained a firm called Fusion GPS to compile opposition research. The firm hired dossier author Christopher Steele, a former British spy. Earlier, President Trump reacted to the revelation.",

You look at this -- they commissioned this dossier which led to a Trump investigation, which now leads us back to Hillary. She's the initial and primary colluder. I mean, I call that kirony, it's a mixture of karma and irony. I think Trump, in a way, has every reason to be kind of angry over this because people have been mocking the tweets about this and it turns out he's right. I don't know.

His speech was high drama that gets pats on the head from his cool new friends in the media. Flake basically went for a short-term sugar high. Sure, that deep-fried Twinkie is initially pleasing at the street fair, but you'll regret it. And you saw that in Flake's exit interviews. So like a poodle, he took his moment to get his back scratched by the Dems and a belly rub from the media. The validation, a nice doggy treat, but it was cheap and it was damaging to his body and the body politic. Yet, as he bails, he still claims the high ground. No. If you're leaving because you know you can't win, just go quietly. This stand isn't brave. It's petulance. Scorched earth bravado as you go to your room and slam the door. Now opposing Donald Trump it's a real option for anyone in honest government, but hit-and-run guerrilla tactics only work when you stay in the battle. This is the teacher's pet who sticks his tongue out at you, then hides behind the teacher. It's the courage of a spectator.

When that's lifted, he has documents; he has e-mails; he has recordings. And the FBI knew. Now, the FBI director at the time, interestingly, is a guide by the name of Mueller. The guy in the FBI that's the head of it is Rosenstein. That now raises a ton of conflicts of interest as they look at Trump-Russia collusion, which has been dead, I think, for a long time.

It's 5 o'clock in New York City and this is \"The Five.\" There's a new political fallout for Hillary Clinton. Fox News now confirming that Clinton and the DNC paid for the research that led to that infamous Russian dossier. As you may recall, that dossier tried to tie the president to Moscow. Here's what we know. A lawyer representing the Clinton camp retained a firm called Fusion GPS to compile opposition research. The firm hired dossier author Christopher Steele, a former British spy.

That's also weird because they almost were about to use our taxpayer money to unseat a president, which is also weird. I love the fact that for the longest time Hillary has been blaming her loss on Russian collusion. And there's that old line I remember from sleep away camp, whoever smelt it, dealt it. You look at this -- they commissioned this dossier which led to a Trump investigation, which now leads us back to Hillary. She's the initial and primary colluder. I mean, I call that kirony, it's a mixture of karma and irony. I think Trump, in a way, has every reason to be kind of angry over this because people have been mocking the tweets about this and it turns out he's right. I don't know.

Trump may not be your choice, but Flake's exit seems more about losing a future election than feuding with the president. His speech was high drama that gets pats on the head from his cool new friends in the media. Flake basically went for a short-term sugar high. Sure, that deep-fried Twinkie is initially pleasing at the street fair, but you'll regret it. And you saw that in Flake's exit interviews. So like a poodle, he took his moment to get his back scratched by the Dems and a belly rub from the media. The validation, a nice doggy treat, but it was cheap and it was damaging to his body and the body politic. Yet, as he bails, he still claims the high ground. No. If you're leaving because you know you can't win, just go quietly. This stand isn't brave. It's petulance. Scorched earth bravado as you go to your room and slam the door. Now opposing Donald Trump it's a real option for anyone in honest government, but hit-and-run guerrilla tactics only work when you stay in the battle. This is the teacher's pet who sticks his tongue out at you, then hides behind the teacher. It's the courage of a spectator. True, there's been nothing like Donald Trump in tone or tenor among Republicans, but there's always been rough rhetoric from the left. This is new turf for us. Too bad, Jeff flaked.

They basically let it go. And I think if they want to be -- continue to be more successful about -- not just uniting the party by getting people to accept, ignoring the words, and just looking at what he does, then they have to also, I think, that they realize this.

And I that think President Trump has a strategy here. For the last week or two, he's been saying things like \"Everything looks good. We're all together.\" And it makes -- it's like having a coach. And the coach is saying, \"We're all going to do this together. Let's stick together.

So wouldn't you be frustrated at the way you've been mistreated and the how unfair the press has been and the inordinate amount of stories that are negative towards the president? Totally flying in the face of positive accomplishments and deeds. And they complained about the tweets, but they crave them. They crave the information. They crave the transparency.

Why would anybody in America ever give 20 percent of America's uranium, the foundational material for nuclear weapons, why would you ever give it to the Russians? It didn't make sense on paper. What's fascinating, the new developments are this. In 2009, we have an FBI informant. This informant now will have a nondisclosure at some point. I think that's going to be lifted. When that's lifted, he has documents; he has e-mails; he has recordings. And the FBI knew. Now, the FBI director at the time, interestingly, is a guide by the name of Mueller. The guy in the FBI that's the head of it is Rosenstein. That now raises a ton of conflicts of interest as they look at Trump-Russia collusion, which has been dead, I think, for a long time. But the more fascinating side of it, and the dangerous side of it is, was there a kickback? I believe America's national security was sold out and compromised, and millions of dollars made it into the Clinton Foundation that was first revealed in Peter Schweizer's book."

And Putin had an interest, because he wanted to gain an access and foothold into the marketplace in the United States. The sad thing is, they got it. American security was compromised. That is, to me, a massive scandal. And they got financial money back. What we've learned in terms of the money-laundering side of it, is a lot of the money went through Latvia.

Intellectual, emotionally, spiritually, I was moved by it.\" I said, \"If you ever have another one, let me know.\" This story, I have now shown the movie to at least a couple hundred people. Everyone has cried. It has -- it's a very powerful movie taken right from the headlines today. The movie starts out with Kevin Sorbo, who plays an atheist that wrote the book \"Aborting God.\" And he's debating a Christian. The crowd loves the atheist. And it's about his journey. The other thing I love about it, you're never going to predict during the movie how it ends."
