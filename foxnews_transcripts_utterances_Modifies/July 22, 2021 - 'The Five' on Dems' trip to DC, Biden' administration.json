There's no end in sight to the crime wave rocking America, murders and shootings are surging coast-to-coast. In states like California are becoming the epicenter of other types of lawlessness where they have basically legalized theft. Police say shoplifters in L.A. didn't even bother to run, they just casually walked out of a store carrying a bunch of clothes. And we've seen this happen before in San Francisco when thieves looted a different high- end department store in broad daylight, law enforcement is blaming scenes like this on proposition 47 which lowers jail sentences for shoplifting on theft less than $950 worth of goods. California Governor Gavin Newsom was grilled about that specific law today but he says it's not to blame.",

So, I think that's an easy scapegoat for a folks, people that never supported those initiatives in the first place.",

If you bring up the violent crime wave, the Democrats will immediately say, not all Democrats but most of them will say it's a local problem, and pull a Pontius Pilate, it's a local problem, the police can handle it but then they will turn around and with a straight face look into a camera and say gun violence is a national epidemic. Right? So, the criminal, the criminal act is a local problem but the weapon is a national problem. And I'm trying to figure out, why would they do that? Is that, I mean, in my brain, I'm going, they want the crime to proceed while disarming the public, is that why they are doing it? And I'm trying to think, who would do that? And I was thinking about what Harold said yesterday, which was the truth. It's like every normal person, Democrats and Republicans alike, black-and- white, is against crime. We all, everybody, like nobody wants it so who is behind this? Who is behind the idea that law and order is a detriment to the world's greatest country? And it has to be this elite activist class. We have radicals in our country who realize that if you want to, in order to remake society first you have to destroy it and they realize destroying it from within by marrying racial warfare to the concept of justice prevents politicians, and anybody from actually trying to protect themselves because that will be seen as an act of racism because law and order now is fundamentally racist. This is why when you listen to the business owners and you listen to law enforcement they keep saying, we've never seen this before. We don't, this is so strange and crazy to see such brazen crime and that's because it's an internal mutiny of moral and civil order. This is something that is new. It's scary and I hate using the phrase slippery slope because it's a cliche but I don't -- I think that there is - - it just keeps going, I don't see the stop on this.",

And the prosecutors who have been elected and backed by these big left-wing activists are the ones who are prosecuting law-abiding citizens who simply just want criminals to leave them alone. And the worst part of it is, these mayors and these congresswomen and congressmen who are for the defund the police movement, who are on the city councils who defunded the police for these communities and they use taxpayer dollars for their own personal security, for private security while they make rest of these people live in these crime-ridden, awful scenarios where they have no one to return to. And they think, well, even if I call the police the prosecutors aren't going to keep them in jail so it will continue to be our problem. On the issue of the businesses, it's horrible to watch people walking out of T.J. Maxx which is a corporation with hundreds of dollars' worth of stuff. But what if you are a guy who has a bodega or you're a small business or you're an immigrant who came here with nothing from another country and you started a business. And this is the way that you are being treated. And there's nobody in government, no politicians are willing to stand up for you and say enough is enough, we are not going to let your life savings and your life's work be wiped out by a bunch of criminals because we are incompetent and past these propositions that allow crime to continue. And that's why I think about. And I think the people who work at T.J. Maxx for minimum wage who are trying to earn an honest living who have to watch these guys come in and this criminality and walk out the door and eventually it just feels really hopeless.

The upside-down logic of what you hear, Harold, from one of the Democrats is that here you'll say, if you prosecute shoplifting, if you treat theft as a crime then that's criminalizing poverty because poor people need to steal. However, what happens is the more you let people steal, these businesses go away.

The bail reform effort that passed here in New York at the very beginning, I thought there were things about it that made a lot of sense in practice. It's not working so I don't fault people for trying things. But when they don't work you change those things. AI think we've conflated two -- a few issues here, the gun issue, I don't disagree with you, Katie, about allowing everyday Americans and we see that gun purchases have gone up even amongst, I think we've -- some of the data has shown amongst Democrats and people who might be considered liberals. And for that matter people who want more gun control measures, people want to be, want to be protected. I think when the Democrats talk about guns and we have that conversation about ghost guns and so forth. I do think that's a legitimate conversation. I wonder how Jesse (Inaudible) with me saying that these kids can get fresh apples but they, maybe some of the other things they can't get. But I don't understand how guns find their way into these communities. But there is no excuse for what's happening in California. Gavin Newsom is a friend but I think he may be mistaken, at least the video I see and the data I see. There has to -- we should act about this. And there should be a change, small businesses or big businesses should not have to worry about people walking into their stores and doing what these young men are doing.

So, proposition 47, they called it the Safe Neighborhoods and Schools Act, sounds pretty. And this goal was to keep nonviolent offenders from overcrowding already crowded prisons. But what it did was it just sent property crime skyrocketing. And guess who bankrolled proposition 47? George Soros. They had only $500,000 for the vote no side and the vote yes on proposition 47 had $9 million and a large chunk of that came from George Soros' open society institute so they didn't stand a chance. And 30 years ago, you didn't have left-wing ideologue multimillionaires bankrolling propositions to soften crime and D.A.s, you didn't have that. All the money went to governor's races and Senate and presidential races. Now they're getting into local races and it's just blowing out because of the cash any opposition. So that's why you have these soft D.A.s and these weak laws. So, it used to be you could steal 450 bucks and that was a felony, now you can steal up to a g, you can walk out of the store with a $900 TV and they're not going to do anything about it. It's a misdemeanor. It's like a trespassing ticket. So, a lot of these high-end chains, they have insurance, they're not going to -- they have a no-confront policy. You can't go and stop shoplifters because that could end up in an accident that could cause a huge lawsuit. So, they just write that off and that's fine.

And I'm curious to know how he got to London, if he's flying again private because they still have a private jet. John Kerry has been promoting climate change for years. I'm not sure what his qualifications are other than being well-connected to leaders around the world who want us to give them a lot of money like for the Paris Climate Agreement. During testimony a couple of months ago in front of Congress, John Kerry admitted that the United States knows that China is building solar panels, which the left says is green, with slave labor from the Uyghurs who they're trying to genocide from their country. And he also did an interview this week saying that no matter what happens, we're going to work with China on this issue. China doesn't care about the environment. They're building coal plants. And the biggest issue moving forward is not what John Kerry says and tries to scare everyone into believing is that just like we saw with COVID, and the lab leak theory getting suppressed, big tech like Facebook and media are completely suppressing debate on this issue. There's a scientist named Steven Koonin who worked in the Obama Energy Department who just wrote this book called Unsettled. It's about how climate change doesn't have to be this \"the sky is falling\" thing. And Facebook fact-checked it and buried it and said that everything in his book is discredited when he just has a different point of view on this issue. So, I think that paying money to government bodies will not do anything to help solve the climate problem.",

There's a great civilization we have here. I think we can adapt to that. The Netherlands, 25 percent below sea level, they're like a powerhouse in Europe.

There's no end in sight to the crime wave rocking America, murders and shootings are surging coast-to-coast. In states like California are becoming the epicenter of other types of lawlessness where they have basically legalized theft. Police say shoplifters in L.A. didn't even bother to run, they just casually walked out of a store carrying a bunch of clothes. And we've seen this happen before in San Francisco when thieves looted a different high- end department store in broad daylight, law enforcement is blaming scenes like this on proposition 47 which lowers jail sentences for shoplifting on theft less than $950 worth of goods. California Governor Gavin Newsom was grilled about that specific law today but he says it's not to blame."

So, I think that's an easy scapegoat for a folks, people that never supported those initiatives in the first place."

      "utterance": "All right. There is a weird bait and switch going on with this crime wave. If you bring up the violent crime wave, the Democrats will immediately say, not all Democrats but most of them will say it's a local problem, and pull a Pontius Pilate, it's a local problem, the police can handle it but then they will turn around and with a straight face look into a camera and say gun violence is a national epidemic. Right? So, the criminal, the criminal act is a local problem but the weapon is a national problem. And I'm trying to figure out, why would they do that? Is that, I mean, in my brain, I'm going, they want the crime to proceed while disarming the public, is that why they are doing it? And I'm trying to think, who would do that? And I was thinking about what Harold said yesterday, which was the truth. It's like every normal person, Democrats and Republicans alike, black-and- white, is against crime. We all, everybody, like nobody wants it so who is behind this? Who is behind the idea that law and order is a detriment to the world's greatest country? And it has to be this elite activist class. We have radicals in our country who realize that if you want to, in order to remake society first you have to destroy it and they realize destroying it from within by marrying racial warfare to the concept of justice prevents politicians, and anybody from actually trying to protect themselves because that will be seen as an act of racism because law and order now is fundamentally racist. This is why when you listen to the business owners and you listen to law enforcement they keep saying, we've never seen this before. We don't, this is so strange and crazy to see such brazen crime and that's because it's an internal mutiny of moral and civil order. This is something that is new. It's scary and I hate using the phrase slippery slope because it's a cliche but I don't -- I think that there is - - it just keeps going, I don't see the stop on this."

You saw it in Virginia and that's why, again, it's all about guns but you are more and more removing people's ability to protect themselves and their families."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAVLICH",
      "utterance": "But it's worse than that because these politicians have removed on the local and federal level a number of ways that Americans can protect themselves and now if you live in a place even where you are legally allowed to own a firearm and you defend yourself, you are the one who is vilified rather than the criminal who may break into your home or into your house. And the prosecutors who have been elected and backed by these big left-wing activists are the ones who are prosecuting law-abiding citizens who simply just want criminals to leave them alone. And the worst part of it is, these mayors and these congresswomen and congressmen who are for the defund the police movement, who are on the city councils who defunded the police for these communities and they use taxpayer dollars for their own personal security, for private security while they make rest of these people live in these crime-ridden, awful scenarios where they have no one to return to. And they think, well, even if I call the police the prosecutors aren't going to keep them in jail so it will continue to be our problem. On the issue of the businesses, it's horrible to watch people walking out of T.J. Maxx which is a corporation with hundreds of dollars' worth of stuff. But what if you are a guy who has a bodega or you're a small business or you're an immigrant who came here with nothing from another country and you started a business. And this is the way that you are being treated. And there's nobody in government, no politicians are willing to stand up for you and say enough is enough, we are not going to let your life savings and your life's work be wiped out by a bunch of criminals because we are incompetent and past these propositions that allow crime to continue. And that's why I think about. And I think the people who work at T.J. Maxx for minimum wage who are trying to earn an honest living who have to watch these guys come in and this criminality and walk out the door and eventually it just feels really hopeless. And these politicians continue to put people in these horrible positions."

I see people shop-lifting from my local drugstore all the time. Because if you put your hands on someone, they scream rape, they scream racism and the like. The upside-down logic of what you hear, Harold, from one of the Democrats is that here you'll say, if you prosecute shoplifting, if you treat theft as a crime then that's criminalizing poverty because poor people need to steal. However, what happens is the more you let people steal, these businesses go away. They disappear, the jobs disappear and you have vast wastelands, deserts in these cities where you can't have, there are no bodegas."

The bail reform effort that passed here in New York at the very beginning, I thought there were things about it that made a lot of sense in practice. It's not working so I don't fault people for trying things. But when they don't work you change those things. AI think we've conflated two -- a few issues here, the gun issue, I don't disagree with you, Katie, about allowing everyday Americans and we see that gun purchases have gone up even amongst, I think we've -- some of the data has shown amongst Democrats and people who might be considered liberals. And for that matter people who want more gun control measures, people want to be, want to be protected. I think when the Democrats talk about guns and we have that conversation about ghost guns and so forth. I do think that's a legitimate conversation. I wonder how Jesse (Inaudible) with me saying that these kids can get fresh apples but they, maybe some of the other things they can't get. But I don't understand how guns find their way into these communities. But there is no excuse for what's happening in California. Gavin Newsom is a friend but I think he may be mistaken, at least the video I see and the data I see. There has to -- we should act about this. And there should be a change, small businesses or big businesses should not have to worry about people walking into their stores and doing what these young men are doing. These guys should be arrested and they should be prosecuted whether it's a small store or a big store."

So, proposition 47, they called it the Safe Neighborhoods and Schools Act, sounds pretty. And this goal was to keep nonviolent offenders from overcrowding already crowded prisons. But what it did was it just sent property crime skyrocketing. And guess who bankrolled proposition 47? George Soros. They had only $500,000 for the vote no side and the vote yes on proposition 47 had $9 million and a large chunk of that came from George Soros' open society institute so they didn't stand a chance. And 30 years ago, you didn't have left-wing ideologue multimillionaires bankrolling propositions to soften crime and D.A.s, you didn't have that. All the money went to governor's races and Senate and presidential races. Now they're getting into local races and it's just blowing out because of the cash any opposition. So that's why you have these soft D.A.s and these weak laws. So, it used to be you could steal 450 bucks and that was a felony, now you can steal up to a g, you can walk out of the store with a $900 TV and they're not going to do anything about it. It's a misdemeanor. It's like a trespassing ticket. So, a lot of these high-end chains, they have insurance, they're not going to -- they have a no-confront policy. You can't go and stop shoplifters because that could end up in an accident that could cause a huge lawsuit. So, they just write that off and that's fine. But a lot of these, as you said, the smaller places can't afford to do that. And now, property crime is up and people are scared."

One, the vaccinations are available, two the economy is worrying again. It roared a lot under President Trump without question, but it's worrying again. Three, we've unified our allies again, particularly in Europe, and we're finding ways I think, to marshal resources to go up to China. We've said at this table, and I'll be brief here, crime and immigration. I would agree, if he does not -- if democrats are perceived as being the problem with these two issues rising and worsening, this certainly puts the rest of the agenda at risk. On the infrastructure piece, it's reported today that there was a blow to Senator Schumer and Democrats in the Senate, but the negotiators continue to work. If we get a good -- $1 trillion bill, then it's amazing. The Chinese are spending trillions on their military and all kinds of technology advances and we're debating $1 trillion infrastructure bill. I got to think the Chinese are sitting back laughing at us. So, he's got to make crime and immigration and infrastructure, make progress there, those numbers will continue to go up.

I'm not sure what his qualifications are other than being well-connected to leaders around the world who want us to give them a lot of money like for the Paris Climate Agreement. During testimony a couple of months ago in front of Congress, John Kerry admitted that the United States knows that China is building solar panels, which the left says is green, with slave labor from the Uyghurs who they're trying to genocide from their country. And he also did an interview this week saying that no matter what happens, we're going to work with China on this issue. China doesn't care about the environment. They're building coal plants. And the biggest issue moving forward is not what John Kerry says and tries to scare everyone into believing is that just like we saw with COVID, and the lab leak theory getting suppressed, big tech like Facebook and media are completely suppressing debate on this issue. There's a scientist named Steven Koonin who worked in the Obama Energy Department who just wrote this book called Unsettled. It's about how climate change doesn't have to be this \"the sky is falling\" thing. And Facebook fact-checked it and buried it and said that everything in his book is discredited when he just has a different point of view on this issue.

That's nice. And then John says, just being on the same planet as Greg is flattery enough. Greg, you're even more handsome than Jesse. True. And Greg, you have a sharp, sassy mind. You have been flattered. Here's a -- here's a pictograph. We had a dip last weekend, but it's getting more intense for the last day. It looks like Tuesday we had a lot of flattery, but I think today we're going to over -- we're probably going to beat that number. The happy faces represents 40 million people. Yes, in case you didn't know that. And now it's time to flatter the panelists. Dagen, you smell like gunpowder and gasoline."

Alanna Rizzo was the on-field reporter, and Heidi Watney and Lauren Gardner hosted the pregame and postgame coverage.

All right, so last time, my husband I and two of our wonderful friends and our best friend, our furry friend, Gadsden, went to the Marine Corps Sunset Parade which takes place every Tuesday night, I believe, in the summertime at Iwo Jima Marine Corps Memorial just outside of Arlington Cemetery in Arlington, Virginia, right across the river from Washington D.C. It's been a tradition since 1956. They also have a different parade called the evening parade that happens down near the Marine barracks in Washington D.C. at nighttime as well. So, there are three more parades. If you're in the area and want to drive in, it' scheduled for the summer all on Tuesdays July 27, August 3, and August 10 7:00 p.m. We had a wonderful full time. They played the National Anthem. They played taps. It was just a great patriotic experience. So, Semper Fi, go Marines."
