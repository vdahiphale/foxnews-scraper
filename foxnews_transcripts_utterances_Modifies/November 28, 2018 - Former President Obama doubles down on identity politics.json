Except, that it is excuses the one flaw that if fixed could unify his party and this country, and that flaw is identity politics, which prefers disunity and differences over mutual understanding. Political power based on grievance requires an endless supply of oppressors. Without them, there's no power. No wonder young healthy individuals with endless opportunities feel and seem hopeless. It's because the anger ruins them.  Identity politics as you're never going to win until you're the oppressor, and that means embracing a vengeance based dogma. And it says that others, no matter their age, are still guilty of a huge historical crime against blacks, women, gays, you name it.   Ultimately, each group will turn on itself since one person's oppressor is another's victim. And it removes forgiveness and commonality, replacing it with a grievance drift that leaves you un-hirable and bitter. Until the Democrats discard this obstacle to unity, it's only going to get worse.  Hell, it's not often that I give advice, earnest advice to Democrats. What the hell am I thinking?",

And that identity politics to my mind, especially the politics of today, I think a lot of it begins with things like birther movement, this guy is the other, he's really not an American, or those guys, I wish he fires those son of [expletive] who are kneeling, the black football players. I could go on in that regard, but you know the story.   But to my mind, what I'm seeing right now is the emphasis that Trump has placed on white identity politics and it's embolden people who I think in the past were biting their tongues about it. But I think this is part, Greg, of the shifting demographics of the country, especially among young people. More people of color, more immigrants coming to the country. And I think it challenges the idea of the white majority, white control. But, you know what? We need to get away from that, so that's where I agree with you, and focus on things that bring us together. But I don't think Trump is that guy.",

It's based on an idea. So, diversity is a strength as the Democrats message, right? So -- OK, well, may be. You can see how far you can get that way, but what would bring all of us together is a reminder that the focus America based on an idea that all men are created equal, that this is not about our heritage. It's not about a certain people. And that's why when Macron brought up nationalism at that speech in France and everyone thought it was a slam against Trump. And maybe, Macron meant it that way. Just listening to a few people explained it better is that nationalism in France -- absolutely, that was bad. Like look what happened. We get it. When you talked about nationalism in America, it's not based on an identity in terms of -- as a people. It's based on that we all agree on this ideal that brought us together. And that's going to keep the country strong going forward. It's not just a diversity is a strength. It's that the founding fathers set us up for success and we should take them up on.",

And that was a moment where this whole country comes together during the National Anthem, and Trump wanted everyone to be united at that moment, so I see it a little-bit differently.  You know, when Obama was talking about identity politics, he was brilliant at playing that game and he was very effective at it, but it worked for him personally but it didn't work for his party. His party got shredded for eight years trying to do that. Takes a very gifted and special politician to pull that off the way he did. Now, in the Democratic primary if it goes all identity politics it's useful against Republicans, but against each other, I think they're going to cannibalize themselves. They're so diverse and there's going to be so many candidates this year, you're going to have whites, blacks, Hispanics, men, women, cultural appropriators.

Now, I think what happened with Hillary, she wasn't -- didn't play the gender card when she was attacked by Trump on policy too much.

I mean, these are people that are going to be tough sale with the kind of messaging that they often do.  I will say also just on the identity politics that I agree with you, Juan.  I think both sides do do-it. And I think there's a profound lack of self- awareness on both sides when they do it. But I think they do it because it does work a lot. I really do. I think with young voters. I think that war on women talk. I think when they went after Mitt Romney on that binders full of women, I think that really took him out. And I do think a lot of people are receptive to it because when you compartmentalize the country, that a way that Democrats, in particular, I think made people feel like they were being heard. Like, OK, you're a woman. These are your issues particular to you. We're going to solve those issues for you. You know, Republicans are anti-contraception. They're you know -- they don't want to protect your right to choose. And it makes people feel for a moment that they're being heard and that person is fighting for them.

Political power based on grievance requires an endless supply of oppressors. Without them, there's no power. No wonder young healthy individuals with endless opportunities feel and seem hopeless. It's because the anger ruins them.  Identity politics as you're never going to win until you're the oppressor, and that means embracing a vengeance based dogma. And it says that others, no matter their age, are still guilty of a huge historical crime against blacks, women, gays, you name it. Ultimately, each group will turn on itself since one person's oppressor is another's victim. And it removes forgiveness and commonality, replacing it with a grievance drift that leaves you un-hirable and bitter. Until the Democrats discard this obstacle to unity, it's only going to get worse.  Hell, it's not often that I give advice, earnest advice to Democrats. What the hell am I thinking?"

But I do think, contrary to what you said that, you know, I mean, you left Donald Trump out of there and I think he's a guy who has found it politically advantageous to divide us as Americans. And that identity politics to my mind, especially the politics of today, I think a lot of it begins with things like birther movement, this guy is the other, he's really not an American, or those guys, I wish he fires those son of [expletive] who are kneeling, the black football players. I could go on in that regard, but you know the story. But to my mind, what I'm seeing right now is the emphasis that Trump has placed on white identity politics and it's embolden people who I think in the past were biting their tongues about it. But I think this is part, Greg, of the shifting demographics of the country, especially among young people. More people of color, more immigrants coming to the country. And I think it challenges the idea of the white majority, white control. But, you know what? We need to get away from that, so that's where I agree with you, and focus on things that bring us together. But I don't think Trump is that guy."

It's based on an idea. So, diversity is a strength as the Democrats message, right? So -- OK, well, may be. You can see how far you can get that way, but what would bring all of us together is a reminder that the focus America based on an idea that all men are created equal, that this is not about our heritage. It's not about a certain people. And that's why when Macron brought up nationalism at that speech in France and everyone thought it was a slam against Trump. And maybe, Macron meant it that way. Just listening to a few people explained it better is that nationalism in France -- absolutely, that was bad. Like look what happened. We get it. When you talked about nationalism in America, it's not based on an identity in terms of -- as a people. It's based on that we all agree on this ideal that brought us together. And that's going to keep the country strong going forward. It's not just a diversity is a strength. It's that the founding fathers set us up for success and we should take them up on."

And that was a moment where this whole country comes together during the National Anthem, and Trump wanted everyone to be united at that moment, so I see it a little-bit differently.  You know, when Obama was talking about identity politics, he was brilliant at playing that game and he was very effective at it, but it worked for him personally but it didn't work for his party. His party got shredded for eight years trying to do that. Takes a very gifted and special politician to pull that off the way he did. Now, in the Democratic primary if it goes all identity politics it's useful against Republicans, but against each other, I think they're going to cannibalize themselves. They're so diverse and there's going to be so many candidates this year, you're going to have whites, blacks, Hispanics, men, women, cultural appropriators.

And on the other hand, if you criticize a black or Hispanic or a female in the Democratic primary and they're going to try to deflect and maybe they'll play the gender card or they'll play the race card and they won't argue their points on substance and that's going to do them a disservice in the general. Now, I think what happened with Hillary, she wasn't -- didn't play the gender card when she was attacked by Trump on policy too much. She was pretty sharp on policy and I have to give her some respect for that. Obama didn't always play the victim. You know, he was on the attack, he was pretty tough. I just think the culture and the country, they're going to see 40 Democrats playing the victim and whining. And they're not -- they don't see winners there. I think they're going to see losers."

I mean, these are people that are going to be tough sale with the kind of messaging that they often do. I will say also just on the identity politics that I agree with you, Juan.  I think both sides do do-it. And I think there's a profound lack of self- awareness on both sides when they do it. But I think they do it because it does work a lot. I really do. I think with young voters. I think that war on women talk. I think when they went after Mitt Romney on that binders full of women, I think that really took him out. And I do think a lot of people are receptive to it because when you compartmentalize the country, that a way that Democrats, in particular, I think made people feel like they were being heard. Like, OK, you're a woman. These are your issues particular to you. We're going to solve those issues for you. You know, Republicans are anti-contraception. They're you know -- they don't want to protect your right to choose. And it makes people feel for a moment that they're being heard and that person is fighting for them.

Well, wait a second, so that means that it's possible that all we've gone through with criminal prosecution, with plea deals, apparently, plea deals that were broken, really don't matter because Trump might pardon him.

I think Democrats would be much better off just admitting, once and for all, that her setting up a private email server, Hillary Clinton, was wrong. Then they would -- they would be able to stop having to defend it. Just like they have, like, with Bill Clinton. They don't defend that stuff anymore. So, like, just like to move on. And the thing is -- about Hillary Clinton, is she's been in government for decades. She became secretary of state, and immediately, she had a plan to hive off her emails so she would never have to -- that they would never see the light of day, so she could keep them separate, because she had plans to run for the president -- presidency.

So there's just not a real appetite for these people anymore. If you look at the Democratic Party, there's two kind of undercurrents that are pulling these two off the stage.

If he hasn't been true to her, that's a different topic. But that's no -- you can't blame her for the sins of her husband. So I think she is a very interesting character to lots of people.
