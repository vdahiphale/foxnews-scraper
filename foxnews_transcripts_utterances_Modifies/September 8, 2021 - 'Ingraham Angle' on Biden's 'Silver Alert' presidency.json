Afghan refugees involved in multiple incidents of sexual assault, as well as many using Ubers to leave, despite not having completed the vetting process. Oh, yes. Congressman Green is here with a full story a little bit later on. Also, Raymond Arroyo returns with the report on how Biden staffers really feel when the President steps up to the mic. Seen and unseen with can't miss video. But first, Silver Alert at the White House. That's the focus of tonight's \"Angle\". Well, you can't say he didn't try to warn us.",

Joe Biden's first eight months seem like eight long years, because everything in his party, he and his party have touched have turned bad. From domestic to foreign policy, the nation's in a tailspin. Even the press can't avoid covering it now. Recent headlines are devastating. Biden's muscle questioned amid falling polls. The middle turns on Biden. The poll that will send Dems into a panic. Fewer Americans than ever think Biden has a clear plan to fight COVID. A clear plan? Half the time the man doesn't have a clear plan on how to exit the podium he is standing at. I know Democrats think Americans are stupid, but they're smart enough to know that behind Joe's aviator sunglasses, is an elder in distress. This presidency feels like a never ending Silver Alert. Except every day we wake up and realize anew that this missing senior citizen is actually living in the White House as the country's being run into the ground by whoever's pulling his strings. And by the way, in the absence of other information, we're left to assume that Biden's portly Chief of Staff Ron Klain is the guy with the real power. He's not just playing the role of Oval Office gatekeeper and personal Biden caretaker, Klain's also acting as the de facto president and commander-in-chief. When we think of who's presiding over cabinet meetings, directing the discussions from COVID to commerce, we sure as hell know it ain't Joe. Heck, he's lmanucky if he remembers any of their names at the cabinet meeting.",

And there were more cases reported yesterday than when he took office. That's even with the vaccines that Trump delivered. Biden's answer is, of course, just to blame the red states then to push booster shots and throw masks at the problem. Well, none of it's really working. It's a virus and it's going to virus. Meanwhile, the only curve Biden seems to have flattened is job growth. Job openings hit a record high of 10.9 million back in July, but there's no one to fill them. Thanks to, what I like to call, Biden bucks. The Mailbox money that keeps going out to those finicky workers who've gotten used to CouchSurfing and ordering from Doordash. For example, \"An estimated 50 percent of small business owners in Indiana reported that they could not fill job openings last month, a record high. Unfilled job openings across the state are far above the 48-year historical average of 22 percent.\" Well, but if you're looking to Biden's brainiacs for answers, well, you're out of luck.

Now, Biden is handing families $300 per kid per month. Yes, we're supposed to believe that's making parents, especially single mothers, less able to work. Once again, they think you're stupid. Trump was able to keep the labor market tight and wages growing by controlling our borders, keeping the cheap labor down and putting the pressure on manufacturers through smart trade policy. But now Biden's eroding all of that with open borders. And soon, an untold number of refugees, many of whom will be competing with low wage workers as well. Everything that he's done from causing gas prices to double the fanning racial tension through critical race theory, all of it has harmed the very people who this pandemic hurt most. America's working class, their safety, their cost of living, their sense of optimism. All needlessly compromised. A far cry from what the Gray Panther from Delaware pledged during the campaign.",

Like their commander, the Silver Alert is sounding for this entire administration, a group lost in their delusions and missing in action. And that's the \"Angle\". Now, for the first time in his short, short presidency, Joe Biden's approval ratings have tanked to 39 percent in a new YouGov poll. That's lower than Trump's approval during his entire presidency. Among independents, it's even worse for Joe with just 35 percent approval rating. Joining me now is Ben Domenech, co-founder and publisher of The Federalist and a Fox News contributor. Also with me, Tom Bevan, co-founder and president of RealClearPolitics. Tom, now, this didn't just happen, because of Afghanistan. You get the sense that Americans are just finally waking up to the fact that Biden doesn't seem oftentimes to have any idea of where he is, or what he's doing. TOM BEVAN, CO-FOUNDER & PRESIDENT, REALCLEARPOLITICS: Yes. No, that's right. I mean, he's been dealing with multiple crises from the immigration situation at the border, to inflation, to crime, et cetera. But I do think Afghanistan was the moment where the myth was exploded that one of - was one of Joe Biden's cornerstone of his campaign that he was - his experience and competence that those were back in charge, I mean, that is gone now. And the other thing that I think that happened is one of the intangibles is that, it's taken a bite out of his credibility. He promised the American people he would always tell us the truth, good, bad, or otherwise. And he's been shown to not be - being square with the American people. He's been contradicted by members of his own administration by reports on the ground. And so I think for those two reasons, Afghanistan has really hurt him and really accelerated the decline that was, sort of, already underway.",

We said, you were competent, we said that you were compassionate, we said that you were an adult in the room, we said that you were able to manage the government in the way that President Trump was not.

It is what it costs for them at the kitchen table, what it costs to put food on the table. And as people are looking around, they are seeing these rising prices. I would also say back to Ben's point, in addition to the competence issue, I mean, one of the problems for the Biden administration is many of these crises are self created, self inflicted. They are policy based, right? The situation at the border, what happened in Afghanistan, these were choices that were made by the Biden administration. These were not things that came out of the blue. You could say COVID was inherited, but even on that score, they have, I think, created their own problems with regard to handling that issue.

And instead what we've seen is that, in California, the air quality is so bad and the gyms are shut down. You can't go outside. You can't exercise. You can't really live your life. I mean, California should be the Golden State. It should be something that we all aspire to. It should be a symbol of greatness for America. And instead, it's an embarrassment. And I think that when you see the type of policies that Gavin Newsom has pursued, a lot of it is echoed in what Joe Biden brings to the table. Look, we are in a tailspin moment right now, not just for Joe Biden. But what I think is really true for the Democratic coalition. The coalition that he got together in 2020, including a lot of these suburban, white, well-educated women who turned against Donald Trump because of mean tweets and things like that. Guess what, they're the same people who have signs talking about how much they love refugees in front of their houses. These are the same people who are now turning against Joe Biden.

Of course, he fought for the Confederacy, he owned slaves. But he also played an indispensable role in post war reconstruction that was just instrumental and reuniting the country. In fact, Lee has long been respected and even admired by northerners and southerners alike. Nowhere is that more obvious than enrichment where Lee's statue towered over Monument Avenue for 131 years. Of course, that was until today. Early this morning, Lee's statue was taken down, then cut in half and sent to a woman's prison on the orders of Governor Ralph blackface Northam. He called it part of the healing process, so Virginia can move forward and become a welcoming state with inclusiveness and diversity.

That's why he chose John Nance Garner from Texas at his running mate in 1932, and why he chose Harry Truman as his running mate from Missouri in 1944, because it was to stitch up enough of a base for the Democratic Party so they could stay in power and keep power.

Joe Biden's first eight months seem like eight long years, because everything in his party, he and his party have touched have turned bad. From domestic to foreign policy, the nation's in a tailspin. Even the press can't avoid covering it now. Recent headlines are devastating. Biden's muscle questioned amid falling polls. The middle turns on Biden. The poll that will send Dems into a panic. Fewer Americans than ever think Biden has a clear plan to fight COVID. A clear plan? Half the time the man doesn't have a clear plan on how to exit the podium he is standing at. I know Democrats think Americans are stupid, but they're smart enough to know that behind Joe's aviator sunglasses, is an elder in distress. This presidency feels like a never ending Silver Alert. Except every day we wake up and realize anew that this missing senior citizen is actually living in the White House as the country's being run into the ground by whoever's pulling his strings. And by the way, in the absence of other information, we're left to assume that Biden's portly Chief of Staff Ron Klain is the guy with the real power. He's not just playing the role of Oval Office gatekeeper and personal Biden caretaker, Klain's also acting as the de facto president and commander-in-chief. When we think of who's presiding over cabinet meetings, directing the discussions from COVID to commerce, we sure as hell know it ain't Joe. Heck, he's lmanucky if he remembers any of their names at the cabinet meeting."

And there were more cases reported yesterday than when he took office. That's even with the vaccines that Trump delivered. Biden's answer is, of course, just to blame the red states then to push booster shots and throw masks at the problem. Well, none of it's really working. It's a virus and it's going to virus. Meanwhile, the only curve Biden seems to have flattened is job growth. Job openings hit a record high of 10.9 million back in July, but there's no one to fill them. Thanks to, what I like to call, Biden bucks. The Mailbox money that keeps going out to those finicky workers who've gotten used to CouchSurfing and ordering from Doordash. For example, \"An estimated 50 percent of small business owners in Indiana reported that they could not fill job openings last month, a record high. Unfilled job openings across the state are far above the 48-year historical average of 22 percent.\" Well, but if you're looking to Biden's brainiacs for answers, well, you're out of luck.

Now, Biden is handing families $300 per kid per month. Yes, we're supposed to believe that's making parents, especially single mothers, less able to work. Once again, they think you're stupid. Trump was able to keep the labor market tight and wages growing by controlling our borders, keeping the cheap labor down and putting the pressure on manufacturers through smart trade policy. But now Biden's eroding all of that with open borders. And soon, an untold number of refugees, many of whom will be competing with low wage workers as well. Everything that he's done from causing gas prices to double the fanning racial tension through critical race theory, all of it has harmed the very people who this pandemic hurt most. America's working class, their safety, their cost of living, their sense of optimism. All needlessly compromised. A far cry from what the Gray Panther from Delaware pledged during the campaign."

Like their commander, the Silver Alert is sounding for this entire administration, a group lost in their delusions and missing in action. And that's the \"Angle\". Now, for the first time in his short, short presidency, Joe Biden's approval ratings have tanked to 39 percent in a new YouGov poll. That's lower than Trump's approval during his entire presidency. Among independents, it's even worse for Joe with just 35 percent approval rating. Joining me now is Ben Domenech, co-founder and publisher of The Federalist and a Fox News contributor. Also with me, Tom Bevan, co-founder and president of RealClearPolitics. Tom, now, this didn't just happen, because of Afghanistan. You get the sense that Americans are just finally waking up to the fact that Biden doesn't seem oftentimes to have any idea of where he is, or what he's doing. TOM BEVAN, CO-FOUNDER & PRESIDENT, REALCLEARPOLITICS: Yes. No, that's right. I mean, he's been dealing with multiple crises from the immigration situation at the border, to inflation, to crime, et cetera. But I do think Afghanistan was the moment where the myth was exploded that one of - was one of Joe Biden's cornerstone of his campaign that he was - his experience and competence that those were back in charge, I mean, that is gone now. And the other thing that I think that happened is one of the intangibles is that, it's taken a bite out of his credibility. He promised the American people he would always tell us the truth, good, bad, or otherwise. And he's been shown to not be - being square with the American people. He's been contradicted by members of his own administration by reports on the ground. And so I think for those two reasons, Afghanistan has really hurt him and really accelerated the decline that was, sort of, already underway."

I mean - and in fact, the thing that is really going on here, Laura, and you know this, is that it's not so much motivated by all the bad things that are happening. It's that Joe's making them look bad. It's like we vouched for you. We said, you were competent, we said that you were compassionate, we said that you were an adult in the room, we said that you were able to manage the government in the way that President Trump was not. We went out there, we got out over our skis saying, during this pandemic weird campaign where you were completely hidden from the voters, oh, no, you can trust in Joe. And now they're looking around and saying, Joe, you're making us look bad. You know, we promised that you were going to be good. And now a factor after factor is going against him. And one more thing about this. It's not ideological, in the sense that, like you can have an ideological critique of what's going on at the border. But really, it's a competence critique. You can have an ideological critique of the decisions about Afghanistan. But really, it's, can you do your job? And I think that Americans are waking up to the fact that Joe Biden really can't.

    {
      "speaker": "BEVAN",
      "utterance": "No, I don't think telling people that, if they just don't eat hamburgers or chicken sandwiches, that that's going to make things better. Look, there's a YouGov poll out this week that show that 44 percent of Americans, what they look to is the indicator for whether the economy is good or not. It's not the stock market. It is what it costs for them at the kitchen table, what it costs to put food on the table. And as people are looking around, they are seeing these rising prices. I would also say back to Ben's point, in addition to the competence issue, I mean, one of the problems for the Biden administration is many of these crises are self created, self inflicted. They are policy based, right? The situation at the border, what happened in Afghanistan, these were choices that were made by the Biden administration. These were not things that came out of the blue. You could say COVID was inherited, but even on that score, they have, I think, created their own problems with regard to handling that issue. So a lot of this, what's going on with the Biden administration is really self inflicted."

I think, frankly, you look at Biden going out to California and you kind of see California as the test case for so many policies that Democrats want to bring national, that they want to take to the whole country. And instead what we've seen is that, in California, the air quality is so bad and the gyms are shut down. You can't go outside. You can't exercise. You can't really live your life. I mean, California should be the Golden State. It should be something that we all aspire to. It should be a symbol of greatness for America. And instead, it's an embarrassment. And I think that when you see the type of policies that Gavin Newsom has pursued, a lot of it is echoed in what Joe Biden brings to the table. Look, we are in a tailspin moment right now, not just for Joe Biden. But what I think is really true for the Democratic coalition. The coalition that he got together in 2020, including a lot of these suburban, white, well-educated women who turned against Donald Trump because of mean tweets and things like that. Guess what, they're the same people who have signs talking about how much they love refugees in front of their houses. These are the same people who are now turning against Joe Biden.

And I think that speaks to the fact that, look, the fact that Gavin Newsom is even in trouble, in somewhat trouble right now, I think is not a good omen for the Democrats. And I will just add real quickly. Look, Joe Biden, his approval ratings right now in Southern - California is a very blue state, obviously. But when you look at places like Arizona, where Mark Kelly is up for reelection, Georgia, Maggie Hassan in New Hampshire, where Joe Biden's underwater now by 10 points, his approval rating.

And so it's so important to talk about Islamic extremism and to call these men who did the 9/11 attacks, hijackers. It's just a tragic travesty of justice really in terms of our education system. We had parents watching this video. They reported it to us at Parents Defending Education. We rang the alarm bell. And the Virginia Department of Education put the video down.

Her views and opinions do not reflect the views and opinions of the VDOE.\" Asra, does everybody get that sensitivity toward topics? How about of Roe versus Wade?

Of course, he fought for the Confederacy, he owned slaves. But he also played an indispensable role in post war reconstruction that was just instrumental and reuniting the country. In fact, Lee has long been respected and even admired by northerners and southerners alike. Nowhere is that more obvious than enrichment where Lee's statue towered over Monument Avenue for 131 years. Of course, that was until today. Early this morning, Lee's statue was taken down, then cut in half and sent to a woman's prison on the orders of Governor Ralph blackface Northam. He called it part of the healing process, so Virginia can move forward and become a welcoming state with inclusiveness and diversity. Here with me now to give us some perspective, Craig Shirley, presidential historian, Ronald Reagan biographer. Craig, diversity and inclusion.

It requires a nuance of thinking, which really eludes a lot of liberals. Saul Alinsky, C.S. Lewis, (inaudible) all said, conceal your real intentions from your enemy. And they said it in very permutations. And the real objective of the left is not just taking down statues. That's beside the point that's just keep us occupied and distracted. What the real goal is the destruction of the American civilization, Western civilization. That is the real goal. And we have to draw a line in the sand and say you will not advance any farther. We are standing here. That's why Mitch McConnell really broke our pick the other day when he said that the Senate won't impeach Joe Biden. He missed the point. The point is permanent offense. The point is that there is something like, what, 50, 75 Republicans who all called for Joe Biden's impeachment. And he should have gone along with it and said yes, he should be impeached, and by the way, add my name to the list. The only solution to stopping the left is to be stronger than the left.

I want to remind everyone, Craig, I want to remind everyone really briefly about what one of the Democrat icons, American icon, FDR said at the unveiling of the Robert E. Lee Memorial in Dallas back in 1936. He said \"We recognize him as a great leader of men, as a great general, but also all over the United States, I believe that we recognize him as something much more important than that. We recognize Robert E. Lee as one of our greatest American Christians and one of our greatest American gentleman.\" Craig, how did we get from there to here?"

      "speaker": "SHIRLEY",
      "utterance": "Because there is partial insanity going in American politics now. There was a sanity by FDR and his approach to the American culture and history. Of course, paying homage to Lee also fit in with the Democratic Party's southern strategy. It was never part of Republican Party. It was always part of the Democratic Party. That's why he chose John Nance Garner from Texas at his running mate in 1932, and why he chose Harry Truman as his running mate from Missouri in 1944, because it was to stitch up enough of a base for the Democratic Party so they could stay in power and keep power. So his words are true, but there was also a political use to them, too. So we've got to be careful about laying too much praise on FDR."

So short of disinterring, which I guess they want to do as well, right, Confederate soldiers bodies and burning them on a funeral pyre -- I am from Connecticut. I'm a Connecticut Yankee, but do you do have to ask where this all ultimately ends, and your conclusion is it ends with -- final line, Craig. We've got to roll."
