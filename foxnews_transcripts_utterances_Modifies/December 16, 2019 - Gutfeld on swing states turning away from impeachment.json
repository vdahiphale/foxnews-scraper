      "utterance": "Hello, everyone, I'm Dana Perino along with Dagen McDowell, Juan Williams, Jesse Watters, and Greg Gutfeld. It's 5:00 in New York City. This is The Five. Senator Chuck Schumer ready to accuse Republicans of a coverup. It's another huge week on Capitol Hill. House Democrats are preparing a historic vote on impeachment. And then over in the Senate, Chuck Schumer says a trial won't be fair unless Republicans give into his demands on witnesses. Other Democrats are ramping up the rhetoric even further claiming that if President Trump is not impeached, the 2020 election itself could be compromised."

But now, Chuck Schumer has to deal with this in the Senate, and he is suggesting that Mitch McConnell would be involved in a coverup if they don't do what they want."

We're not going to bend over backwards after they've treated the Republicans so unfairly. The whole thing, to say that Trump has rigged past elections and is rigging future elections, that is a lie told by losers. They can't win, so they have to spin. These are now election birthers. Anytime a Republican wins an election, it's some vast Republican-Russian conspiracy. The Republicans haven't even begun a Senate trial, and they're being accused of rigging it. But the Republicans should ask Democrats how to rig stuff because the Democrats are pretty good at it. Hillary rigged the primary against Bernie. She tried to rig the general against Trump by paying for foreign interference in an election with the dossier. The witch hunt was rigged, 17 liberal lawyers. I believe the midterms are rigged because Mueller knows there's no collusion, but he lets the dark cloud of Russia hang over that election. And then they rigged this hearing in the dark by a whistleblower, Schiff colluding. It's ridiculous. And I brought charts, Dana --"

And it always, without fail, results in an overcorrection, right? If you look at the Tea Party, if you look at 2016, if you look at Covington, if you look at Cavanaugh, the Dems are the masters of overkill, and it always blows up in their face.

But half the country wants him impeached, and half the country doesn't. I don't think a whole lot is changed on that front. But I do think this: That we can agree -- I think everybody at this table can agree. Fox poll is a good poll. The president doesn't like it, but it's a very good poll."

They sound desperate, and they look desperate. To Nadler and Schiff's point, they don't have a Constitutional right to try and do a preemptive impeachment to stop an act that the president might do, as the Wall Street Journal editorial page has pointed out. They're using scare tactics. By the way, what Chuck Schumer's doing, he doesn't want to call any of these witnesses, and he's actually calling out Nancy Pelosi for not doing her job by saying, \"We don't know what evidence these witnesses would present. It might be exculpatory or incriminating.\" He's basically saying Pelosi has fallen down on what she was supposed to do."

The group that the people sampled were skewed towards Democrats, which we already know, because that always happens. But the other thing is, people who support Trump are going to lie. Why is it? Because we're in a climate where it is unpopular to voice your opinion. So, if some pollster's going to call me, I'm wondering if that pollster is going to talk about what I said. I don't -- right? I don't trust them. I don't trust --"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "Greg Gutfeld",
      "utterance": "If you live in a swamp, you die by the swamp. Which is why it's good once in a while to peek your head above the gators in the media and see what's really happening on dry land. Places like Saginaw, Michigan, a town in a swing state that went for Trump in 2016. Axios, a thing, held a focus group of voters who had once voted for Obama but now are for Trump. It's a small sample, but it's still a window into the real world that most media prefer to board up. The gist? These voters see impeachment as a bust, a distraction that wastes time and money, and worse, a ploy to regain political power. In sum, they see what CNN would rather keep secret from you. What drives these beliefs? A profound distrust in the media's Trump obsession, including their drooling impeachment coverage. They're like selling teens at a Comic-Con, battling an imaginary villain and thinking it's all true. But the more they attack Trump, the better he looks and the crazier they look, because the attacks come off as deeply emotional hatred of the voters themselves, the people who put Trump in office and still don't regret it. So why take advice from thin-skinned, half-educated trolls who mock you behind your back while denying that Trump's done anything good? You shouldn't. With impeachment, the media are kids at the wheel, unable to navigate the twists and turns of reality, skidding into an idiotic premise that this will all work out. It won't. So every day they crawl through their own wreckage, believing they have everything under control, even while they fly headfirst through reality."

What is the quote? \"Now, women. I just want you to know you are not perfect. But what I can say pretty indisputably is that you're better than most of us-\" [gasps]- \"I'm absolutely confident that for two years, if every nation on earth was run by women, you would see a significant improvement across the board on just about everything, living standards and outcomes.\" He should be impeached."

You saw it again in the British election last week, where strongholds for Labour since the -- before World War II flipped to the Conservative Party. Stop talking down to these individuals.
