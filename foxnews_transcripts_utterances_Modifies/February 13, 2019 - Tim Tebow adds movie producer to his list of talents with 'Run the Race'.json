      "sentences": "Welcome to “Hannity.” And wall construction on the southern border, guess what, is under way according to a report, \"Washington Examiner\", look at this, miles of desperately need brand new steel barriers are under construction all along the Rio Grande Valley. This portion of the wall was funded with federal money previously negotiated by the Trump administration. Nobody seems to report that. We've also repaired a lot of the bad walls out there. And there is new construction.  Meanwhile, this garbage deal that I've been telling you about, out of Washington, which allocates a measly additional $1.375 billion for wall construction -- well, that has not been signed by the president. As a matter of fact, nobody in the White House has seen any language in the bill, none.  So, let's be frank. It's not nearly enough money. Washington lawmakers, the swamp creatures, they have once again let we, the people, the American people down, this is a swamp compromise. Now, let me make predictions. Based on what the president is saying publicly, I love the press love to speculate, how did Hannity get his information?  All right. We know this is a president that keeps his promises. And he goes at the speed of Trump. And if you watch every speech, if you actually listen to Donald Trump's words, you know, especially you people in the hate Trump media, you psychos, he telegraphs. He's saying exactly what he's planning to do. You're too stupid to listen. Watch this.",

Illegal immigration provides a lucrative cash flow to put it mildly, lucrative, to some of the most dangerous criminal organizations on the planet. These deadly cartels flood our city with narcotics that kill thousands of citizens, ruin families. They use fear, intimidation, violence to get their way.  There's only one moral course of action, to put these ruthless criminal cartels out of business and out of business fast. I will never waiver from my sacred duty to defend this nation and its people. We will get the job done.",

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "sentences": "All right. He's saying he's going to get the job done. Let me make a prediction. Let's base on it what you just heard. And what we've witnessed the last two years. The president is going to find a way to get the money. Now, look at this bill, 1.375 billion, not enough. But it will keep the ball in the project moving along assuming, we haven't seen the language, there's no poison pill or restrictions in there thrown in by a swamp creature in the last minute that says you can't build a wall with the money. That happens I don't think the president will sign that bill. And in that case you probably move to a short-term CR and the Congress creatures go back to doing the crappy work they usually do. And then if they get it right, he'll sign that bill.   But let's assume that they get it right. That, in other words, he gets $1.375 billion for the wall now -- well that, prevents the government shutdown. That's a good thing. But in order to meet on borders and our security needs, the president has stated publicly, not just to Sean Hannity, that he will also tap in to hundreds of millions, at least 900 million, I'm told the number is much higher, other discretionary funds that he can direct that money directly to the wall which then brings to us two or three billion dollars. Again, in the interim, and it sounds like what he's saying is he's going to simultaneously declare a national emergency, to free up billions more. Now, the hate-Trump media, if that happens, are going to feign moral indignation, outrage, hysteria will break out. Meanwhile, they'll say, how did Hannity know? Well, because I've listened to him and he's telling you the entire time what he's going to do.  Donald Trump, quote, I will add whatever I have to add to build the wall. President tweeting: I am getting almost $23 billion for border security.   Now, that money, the $23 billion he's talking about, that can be spent on everything else but the wall. But if he declares a national emergency, or uses the law which we've been citing on this program, U.S. Code 284, well, we know what the Democrats are going to do. They're going to immediately run to the courts, they'll go judge shopping to find a liberal activist judge somewhere in California, or anywhere in the Ninth Circuit. They will lose. The president will lose the first round. Go to the ninth circuit. He'll lose the second round.  But in the interim, he still gets $1.375 billion, so continues the project, and the other funds, continues the project. And I believe when it gets to the Supreme Court, he's going to win. And this Supreme Court has to take this case, considering -- let's see, it's a constitutional question about his role as commander-in-chief. It's about separation of powers. It's about national security.  And just a side note, all of you in the media, I don't know why, everyone has been obsessed, Hannity's predicting this. That's what I'm predicting is going to happen, because I actually listened to the publicly stated words of the president. So, keep speculating, nobody in the media has any idea who my sources are, who they're not, and who I talk to, who I don't talk to. And I will not reveal my sources.  And all of these hate touch media outlets, they all pretend they're unbiased, that they're journalists. Well, I don't claim to be a journalist, we do journalism, but what we say about being a talk show host, we're like the whole newspaper. Now, we do straight news when there's a war, straight news on weather, straight news on important incidences that are happening, like Ferguson when that was happening, or, Baltimore. And then we give a lot of opinion. So, we're the news page, editorial page, the opinion page. We even do gossip and sports like tonight for example, Tim Tebow is on. So, we're like, the whole newspaper. That's what we do, freedom of the press. But we identify what we do.  Now, we do our own research, like we did with vetting Obama, like we do on the deep state, we do investigations, we bring you news and information you won't hear or see anywhere else. And opinion you won't get anywhere else.   But all of these hate Trump news people that claim to be journalists, no, they're really editorial writers. And ones that make up a lot of B.S. at the same time. So, tonight, when it comes to building the wall, whatever has to be done, the president is saying will be done. Not for political reasons, but for the safety and the security of all Americans. He sees this rightly so as a life and death issue. But don't just take my word for it. Maybe some of the people in the fake news channels, maybe they should start speaking to angel moms and dads. Maybe a woman like Maureen Maloney, her son, Matthew, killed by a drunk driving illegal immigrant from Ecuador. You got that, Senator Menendez? He was upset that illegal immigrants could actually be classified as criminals, if they get caught drunk driving.  And, yesterday, Maloney urged President Trump to hold strong in the fight for the border wall. Now, sadly, she is among thousands of our fellow Americans whose lives have been ripped apart, permanent separation, by violent criminals because we have open borders that have entered this country illegally. In the past two years alone, ICE arresting illegal immigrants accused or convicted of 4,000 murder, homicide charges.  Carnage from illegal drugs -- 90 percent of the heroin crossing that southern border is even worse. Every single week, 300 Americans are dying from heroin overdoses, almost all of which is trafficked across the border. Now, that's why Americans are overwhelmingly backing up the president and his plan to secure the border. Brand new Fox poll, 66 percent of Americans approve of the president's efforts, you Republicans in the House and Senate, you may just want to follow his lead. Good politics. According to Gallup, the president's overall poll numbers are up a whopping 7 points since the government shutdown. He hit his highest number 52 percent on the Rasmussen poll. Earlier this week, he filled an arena in El Paso, Texas. Look at that.   And, oh, that's inside the arena, am I correct? Yes, then he had thousands and thousands of others outside the arena. Nobody in the media talks about this. What other president got those types of crowds? Now, some on the left try to pretend, the president has no support at all. I've never seen president with more support. Look at late night loser Stephen Colbert himself just last week, watch this.   STEPHEN COLBERT, LATE NIGHT TV HOST/COMEDIAN: Trump's inaugural committee raised a record $107 million which was double the previous record set by Barack Obama. What was all that money for? I mean, obviously, they didn't need it for crowd control.",

Which brings us tonight to the “Hannity Watch” on what is the radical socialist takeover, the Democratic Party. Now, the president is promoting freedom, low taxes, national security and strength. Uninformed socialist extremists -- they are now steering the ship at the DNC in a pretty big way, kind of scary way. Look at freshman Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez who says the world is going to end in 12 years. She's now leading the way. She's the chief spokesman leader for the Democratic Party.

      "sentences": "Hmm. I guess it's no surprise that Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez's Green New Deal is now a nationwide laughingstock, except for the fact Democrats really serious about this insane piece of legislation, take it seriously. 2020 presidential hopefuls are literally tripping over each other to support the Green New Deal. Make no mistake: Democrats want to radically reshape this country into a little socialist eco-utopia that will promise everything and deliver nothing but catastrophe and poverty.  And if you're wondering what a socialist utopia looks like, well, this new green deal -- oh, no more oil, no nuclear gas, no more nuclear, no more airplanes, no more gas-powered cars, no more-gas powered ovens, no more cows because of flatulence, government promised paid leave, medical leave, paid vacation, oh, now they wrecked high school K-through-12, so now they wreck college, education free for all, healthy food for all, government- forced renovation of every building in America in the name of energy efficiency, government paid for high speed rail connecting every city in America. We won't have airplanes. So, I guess we will have high speed trains to Australia, and Asia and Europe. And they're going to guarantee income to every single person even those unwilling to work. Wow, and retirement plan. But, believe it or not, there's more madness.  Now, we would be here all night if I listed it all. So, look at the side of your screen. And here's the kicker, the Green New Deal is calling for this to happen in ten years, and the world is going to be over in 12 years according to Ocasio-Cortez if we don't act. On Twitter today, she said passing the Green New Deal is a life or death issue.  Well, in a way, she's right, because if this ever happens in this country, the American Dream that has created more wealth, more prosperity, than any other country on the face of this earth, it's over. Government will take over every single industry. The healthcare industry, no private healthcare, the energy industry, they will give you that cradle to grave, womb to tomb promise. They'll tell you what car you can drive, where you can travel, what you can eat, and even how to cook it.  And more notably, in order to try to pay for that insanity, mother government -- well, they'll own your paycheck, from each according to their ability, to each according to their needs, right, Congresswoman? And I know you watch the show. And let's not forget about those who would be impacted first. Airlines, 700,000 employees -- goodbye. Over 10 million people owe their jobs to oil and the gas industry -- see you. Millions more serve in roles related to those two major industries.  Promoting this stupid deal, Democrats, they're actively calling for tens of millions of Americans to lose high paying jobs and it's only going to get bigger. We have two pipelines on the line and we opened ANWR. We're the number one world producer surpassing Saudi Arabia and Russia for the first time in 70 years. And all of the high-paying career jobs that will be available for people. Look at this Fox News poll, 25 percent of Americans have a favorable view of socialism. It promises everything and never delivers historically a thing. And another freshman Democratic lawmaker making news for awful the wrong reasons. And that's Congresswoman Omar embroiled in a serious controversy over her constant stream of hatred and anti-Semitic remarks. And she has since issued an apology on one of the remarks. But her bad behavior on Capitol Hill is not going away. Look at this from earlier today, a hearing with the administration's new special envoy for Venezuela, Elliott Abrams. Watch this doozy.",

Multiple top Democrats supporting a bill to turn America into a socialist disaster eco-state. Multiple 2020 candidates for the Democrats calling for tax increases and government stealing. One still apologizing for faking her ethnicity. Spartacus himself at least calling for an end to all meat consumption. What a week, to think the race just getting started. We'll have full coverage on all of this later. First, we turn “Hannity Watch” on the deep state. Now, while we sound the alarm, Democrats are suspiciously silent on the increasing evidence of corruption, abuse of power inside the FBI, and the Justice Department. Like the alleged quid pro quo agreement between the FBI, the Clinton State Department.  We have new documents obtained by Judicial Watch. The top FBI brass, including Lisa Page, who was, well, with Peter Strzok, they're scrambling in the run-up to the 2016 election, about evidence of an offer from a Clinton ally, ex-State Department official Patrick Kennedy, to have the bureau reduce the classification that they found on Anthony Weiner's laptop, a Clinton e-mail, in exchange will boost FBI personnel abroad. But just change the classification so she doesn't to have go to jail. We'll have the report later in the show. But, first, joining us now, to our top story, former acting ICE director, Fox News contributor, Thomas Homan, and Freedom Caucus chairman, Mark Meadows. Congressman Meadows, I was listened to the president publicly and I hear a guy saying, OK, it's clean, the 1.375, I can use it for the wall, I'll take it, I'm going to use this extra money, anywhere between $900 million and maybe billions, and I'm going to declare a national emergency and people don't seem to want to listen to him.",

This portion of the wall was funded with federal money previously negotiated by the Trump administration. Nobody seems to report that. We've also repaired a lot of the bad walls out there. And there is new construction. Meanwhile, this garbage deal that I've been telling you about, out of Washington, which allocates a measly additional $1.375 billion for wall construction -- well, that has not been signed by the president. As a matter of fact, nobody in the White House has seen any language in the bill, none. So, let's be frank. It's not nearly enough money. Washington lawmakers, the swamp creatures, they have once again let we, the people, the American people down, this is a swamp compromise. Now, let me make predictions. Based on what the president is saying publicly, I love the press love to speculate, how did Hannity get his information? All right. We know this is a president that keeps his promises. And he goes at the speed of Trump. And if you watch every speech, if you actually listen to Donald Trump's words, you know, especially you people in the hate Trump media, you psychos, he telegraphs. He's saying exactly what he's planning to do. You're too stupid to listen. Watch this."

There's only one moral course of action, to put these ruthless criminal cartels out of business and out of business fast. I will never waiver from my sacred duty to defend this nation and its people. We will get the job done."

      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "utterance": "All right. He's saying he's going to get the job done. Let me make a prediction. Let's base on it what you just heard. And what we've witnessed the last two years. The president is going to find a way to get the money. Now, look at this bill, 1.375 billion, not enough. But it will keep the ball in the project moving along assuming, we haven't seen the language, there's no poison pill or restrictions in there thrown in by a swamp creature in the last minute that says you can't build a wall with the money. That happens I don't think the president will sign that bill. And in that case you probably move to a short-term CR and the Congress creatures go back to doing the crappy work they usually do. And then if they get it right, he'll sign that bill. But let's assume that they get it right. That, in other words, he gets $1.375 billion for the wall now -- well that, prevents the government shutdown. That's a good thing. But in order to meet on borders and our security needs, the president has stated publicly, not just to Sean Hannity, that he will also tap in to hundreds of millions, at least 900 million, I'm told the number is much higher, other discretionary funds that he can direct that money directly to the wall which then brings to us two or three billion dollars. Again, in the interim, and it sounds like what he's saying is he's going to simultaneously declare a national emergency, to free up billions more. Now, the hate-Trump media, if that happens, are going to feign moral indignation, outrage, hysteria will break out. Meanwhile, they'll say, how did Hannity know? Well, because I've listened to him and he's telling you the entire time what he's going to do."

    {
      "speaker": "Donald Trump, quote, I will add whatever I have to add to build the wall. President tweeting",
      "utterance": "I am getting almost $23 billion for border security. Now, that money, the $23 billion he's talking about, that can be spent on everything else but the wall. But if he declares a national emergency, or uses the law which we've been citing on this program, U.S. Code 284, well, we know what the Democrats are going to do. They're going to immediately run to the courts, they'll go judge shopping to find a liberal activist judge somewhere in California, or anywhere in the Ninth Circuit. They will lose. The president will lose the first round. Go to the ninth circuit. He'll lose the second round. But in the interim, he still gets $1.375 billion, so continues the project, and the other funds, continues the project. And I believe when it gets to the Supreme Court, he's going to win. And this Supreme Court has to take this case, considering -- let's see, it's a constitutional question about his role as commander-in-chief. It's about separation of powers. It's about national security. And just a side note, all of you in the media, I don't know why, everyone has been obsessed, Hannity's predicting this. That's what I'm predicting is going to happen, because I actually listened to the publicly stated words of the president. So, keep speculating, nobody in the media has any idea who my sources are, who they're not, and who I talk to, who I don't talk to. And I will not reveal my sources. And all of these hate touch media outlets, they all pretend they're unbiased, that they're journalists. Well, I don't claim to be a journalist, we do journalism, but what we say about being a talk show host, we're like the whole newspaper. Now, we do straight news when there's a war, straight news on weather, straight news on important incidences that are happening, like Ferguson when that was happening, or, Baltimore. And then we give a lot of opinion. So, we're the news page, editorial page, the opinion page. We even do gossip and sports like tonight for example, Tim Tebow is on. So, we're like, the whole newspaper. That's what we do, freedom of the press. But we identify what we do. Now, we do our own research, like we did with vetting Obama, like we do on the deep state, we do investigations, we bring you news and information you won't hear or see anywhere else. And opinion you won't get anywhere else. But all of these hate Trump news people that claim to be journalists, no, they're really editorial writers. And ones that make up a lot of B.S. at the same time. So, tonight, when it comes to building the wall, whatever has to be done, the president is saying will be done. Not for political reasons, but for the safety and the security of all Americans. He sees this rightly so as a life and death issue. But don't just take my word for it. Maybe some of the people in the fake news channels, maybe they should start speaking to angel moms and dads. Maybe a woman like Maureen Maloney, her son, Matthew, killed by a drunk driving illegal immigrant from Ecuador. You got that, Senator Menendez? He was upset that illegal immigrants could actually be classified as criminals, if they get caught drunk driving. And, yesterday, Maloney urged President Trump to hold strong in the fight for the border wall. Now, sadly, she is among thousands of our fellow Americans whose lives have been ripped apart, permanent separation, by violent criminals because we have open borders that have entered this country illegally. In the past two years alone, ICE arresting illegal immigrants accused or convicted of 4,000 murder, homicide charges. Carnage from illegal drugs -- 90 percent of the heroin crossing that southern border is even worse. Every single week, 300 Americans are dying from heroin overdoses, almost all of which is trafficked across the border. Now, that's why Americans are overwhelmingly backing up the president and his plan to secure the border. Brand new Fox poll, 66 percent of Americans approve of the president's efforts, you Republicans in the House and Senate, you may just want to follow his lead. Good politics. According to Gallup, the president's overall poll numbers are up a whopping 7 points since the government shutdown. He hit his highest number 52 percent on the Rasmussen poll. Earlier this week, he filled an arena in El Paso, Texas. Look at that. And, oh, that's inside the arena, am I correct? Yes, then he had thousands and thousands of others outside the arena. Nobody in the media talks about this. What other president got those types of crowds? Now, some on the left try to pretend, the president has no support at all. I've never seen president with more support. Look at late night loser Stephen Colbert himself just last week, watch this. STEPHEN COLBERT, LATE NIGHT TV HOST/COMEDIAN: Trump's inaugural committee raised a record $107 million which was double the previous record set by Barack Obama. What was all that money for? I mean, obviously, they didn't need it for crowd control."

Which brings us tonight to the “Hannity Watch” on what is the radical socialist takeover, the Democratic Party. Now, the president is promoting freedom, low taxes, national security and strength. Uninformed socialist extremists -- they are now steering the ship at the DNC in a pretty big way, kind of scary way.

We won't have airplanes. So, I guess we will have high speed trains to Australia, and Asia and Europe. And they're going to guarantee income to every single person even those unwilling to work. Wow, and retirement plan. But, believe it or not, there's more madness. Now, we would be here all night if I listed it all. So, look at the side of your screen. And here's the kicker, the Green New Deal is calling for this to happen in ten years, and the world is going to be over in 12 years according to Ocasio-Cortez if we don't act. On Twitter today, she said passing the Green New Deal is a life or death issue. Well, in a way, she's right, because if this ever happens in this country, the American Dream that has created more wealth, more prosperity, than any other country on the face of this earth, it's over. Government will take over every single industry. The healthcare industry, no private healthcare, the energy industry, they will give you that cradle to grave, womb to tomb promise. They'll tell you what car you can drive, where you can travel, what you can eat, and even how to cook it. And more notably, in order to try to pay for that insanity, mother government -- well, they'll own your paycheck, from each according to their ability, to each according to their needs, right, Congresswoman? And I know you watch the show. And let's not forget about those who would be impacted first. Airlines, 700,000 employees -- goodbye. Over 10 million people owe their jobs to oil and the gas industry -- see you. Millions more serve in roles related to those two major industries. Promoting this stupid deal, Democrats, they're actively calling for tens of millions of Americans to lose high paying jobs and it's only going to get bigger. We have two pipelines on the line and we opened ANWR. We're the number one world producer surpassing Saudi Arabia and Russia for the first time in 70 years. And all of the high-paying career jobs that will be available for people. Look at this Fox News poll, 25 percent of Americans have a favorable view of socialism. It promises everything and never delivers historically a thing. And another freshman Democratic lawmaker making news for awful the wrong reasons. And that's Congresswoman Omar embroiled in a serious controversy over her constant stream of hatred and anti-Semitic remarks. And she has since issued an apology on one of the remarks. But her bad behavior on Capitol Hill is not going away. Look at this from earlier today, a hearing with the administration's new special envoy for Venezuela, Elliott Abrams. Watch this doozy."

Multiple top Democrats supporting a bill to turn America into a socialist disaster eco-state. Multiple 2020 candidates for the Democrats calling for tax increases and government stealing. One still apologizing for faking her ethnicity. Spartacus himself at least calling for an end to all meat consumption. What a week, to think the race just getting started. We'll have full coverage on all of this later. First, we turn “Hannity Watch” on the deep state. Now, while we sound the alarm, Democrats are suspiciously silent on the increasing evidence of corruption, abuse of power inside the FBI, and the Justice Department. Like the alleged quid pro quo agreement between the FBI, the Clinton State Department. We have new documents obtained by Judicial Watch. The top FBI brass, including Lisa Page, who was, well, with Peter Strzok, they're scrambling in the run-up to the 2016 election, about evidence of an offer from a Clinton ally, ex-State Department official Patrick Kennedy, to have the bureau reduce the classification that they found on Anthony Weiner's laptop, a Clinton e-mail, in exchange will boost FBI personnel abroad. But just change the classification so she doesn't to have go to jail. We'll have the report later in the show. But, first, joining us now, to our top story, former acting ICE director, Fox News contributor, Thomas Homan, and Freedom Caucus chairman, Mark Meadows. Congressman Meadows, I was listened to the president publicly and I hear a guy saying, OK, it's clean, the 1.375, I can use it for the wall, I'll take it, I'm going to use this extra money, anywhere between $900 million and maybe billions, and I'm going to declare a national emergency and people don't seem to want to listen to him."

He's going to do it this time. I'm confident of that. If he passes this bill to make sure that the government stays open, so be it.

What they had thought this is going to be was a fun way to signal to millennials and to progressives about what they stood for without having to do anything about it, without anything really needing to exist. A resolution is not a bill. And so, they thought it was just going to be a lot of media and press. Having to vote is a reminder though that people will either have to vote with the individuals who want to pay people who are unwilling to work, or they're going to have to vote against them, which will signal to the base that this has been an unserious framework from the start."

Sean, just a few years ago, this would be sort of one of the fringe things of the Democratic Party. Unfortunately, it is now the mainstream. You look at every one of the 2020 announced or prospective candidates for President on the Democratic side, and they're all embracing this. But what are they embracing? Not a policy difference, not more spending, that would be typical for a Democrat. But they're basing something that they can't even tell you where it ends up.

Patrick Kennedy was in the middle of the whole Benghazi scandal.

So he tried to run interference, he goes to the FBI, he says, look I can give your agents posts overseas, in Iraq, in other areas throughout the world, if we could just work something out. They did not. According to the FBI and according to the information that we have that's been made available, the FBI did not do what Patrick Kennedy suggested.

Well, you can now add movie producer to the list. Tim Tebow, Executive Producer of Run the Race, inspirational film about two brothers trying to find their way and in the process they get closer to God. Oh this isn't a public school, we can talk about God, amazing. Now the film is in theaters nationwide February 22nd. There's a quick clip of the film's trailer.

You talk about your faith and why it -- I think you even paid a price for it in the sense that, it's too controversial for some teams. You never backed down and then here you are playing football, now like I'm going to go play baseball, and you do so successfully. That's hard to do when you're -- you know, you are flying a private jet and now you're back in a bus."

But that's not why I do it, because I didn't want to do something and I don't want to do something and let the world define me. I wanted - the only person I get to define me is God, and I want to go after my dreams and what's on my heart, and shoot, even a lot of my team down the street at CAA were kind of like, whoa whoa whoa, why would you go do this, you might embarrass yourself?

And really when I left that boy, I knew what I felt like I was supposed to do for the rest of my life, and that was fight for people that can't fight for themselves, and fight for the underdog and love people.

Last year, he requested to change prisons, but he exchanged it for cooperation. The FBI says he then, \"Went through city and state, and gave the number of people he killed in each place.\" In all, he claims to have killed 90 women, 34 have been confirmed. To find the rest, Samuel Little is drawing pictures of his victims, detailing their hair color, hair style, eye color, even facial expressions and lipstick. The FBI is now releasing the drawings, hoping that family and friends will recognize them and provide evidence to identify them. Prosecutors say the pictures are generating numerous tips, but locating the victims is difficult, because the killer has a photographic memory, but his timelines about when some of the murders happened are off by as much as a decade, Sean."
