Since 2009 the defense department of been moving in some 10,000 foreigners into a program called the Military Accessions Vital to National Interests, or MANVI, as you just heard right there. In exchange for service, these foreigners selected for language or other needs skills can receive an expedited path to U.S. citizenship. The problem is that we are just hearing that there is foreign infiltration in the program, and there are some number of these enrollees who are now unaccounted for in this country. And that is creating a national security concern.  Let's bring in the panel: Katie Pavlich, news editor at Townhall.com; Jonah Goldberg, senior editor of National Review, and here at the White House with me, Shannon Pettypiece, White House correspondent for Bloomberg News. Shannon, I'll start with you. I had Kellyanne Conway out here. The reason I didn't ask her about it is beforehand we prepped her about the story and they said they just didn't have anything. And they were looking for any information on it. It is of concern security-wise.",

And of course there is a security concern, but there is also a personnel concern here too because this program was really created to help the Department of Defense fill positions they had trouble filling with people who speak a language like Mandarin or Arabic that they have trouble finding U.S. citizens who speak that language or who have the special skills that they need. So thousands of people have actually been through this program, and it's something that Defense Department depends on, but obviously, yes they saw your reporting, it sounds like it something they are taking closer look on to make sure they are handling all that appropriately.",

I do think it's a good thing the defense Department, unlike many government agencies in Washington, wants to put a halt to the program. They have suspended it, and I hope that they can figure out the problem, go back to vetting fewer people more thoroughly because, as we've talked about, a lot of these positions are vital to the national security interests of the United States in terms of translators, people who can go into special operations overseas and blend in and get us vital intelligence.
