      "speaker": "HANNITY",
      "sentences": "All right. Welcome to \"Hannity\". We start tonight, a FOX News alert -- the president of the United States, Donald Trump, will join us live. We will talk about the debates, COVID-19, Joe Biden, and so much more, only moments away. Tonight, there are 26 days until Election Day. You will be the ultimate jury, buckle up, brace yourself. This will be a rollercoaster ride the next 26 days. Now, during last night's debate, Vice President Mike Pence was unflappable, and he not only eviscerated, frankly, Senator Kamala Harris, but he exposed just how radical and frankly dangerous her and Joe Biden's positions truly are to this country. She also got caught in one lie after another. Her rambling, her disorganized answers at times were even hard to watch. Frankly, it's hard to believe she was ever a prosecutor given her utter lack of preparation and terrible execution. More importantly, by the way, today, Senator Harris and her frail, weak running mate, the ever-forgetful Joe Biden, they still are flat-out refusing to answer significant, serious questions, dozens of them, including whether or not they plan to neuter the United States Supreme Court with a corrupt practice known as court packing. Frankly, it is unconscionable that they refused to tell you, the American people, the truth. I guess they must think that we the American people are really that stupid. They really think that they can just coast to the finish line without being honest, without being transparent, without being forthright. Now, of course, the media mob, state-run TV news, state run newspapers, so far, they've allowed them to get away with all of this, which would be the biggest power grab in history and, by the way, that is exactly what will happen. Their non-answers as Vice President Pence said, that's their answer. Now, coming up, we have full reaction, Dan Bongino, Karl Rove, Congressman Matt Gaetz, the great one, Mark Levin, will be here with their full reaction and analysis. And don't forget, the president will join us straight ahead. But first, we do need to talk about the Commission on Presidential Debates. Now, it's supposedly nonprofit -- well, supposedly nonpartisan, an organization responsible for carrying out the presidential and vice presidential debates. But today, the commission, unilaterally, without consulting either campaign, decided to upend the next matchup between President Trump and former Vice President Biden. Now, they were citing the president's COVID-19 diagnosis and the commission announced that the debate would be held out virtually out of, quote, \"safety concerns.\" The problem is that was a unilateral decision. They did not consult with the president's doctors. They didn't consult with any doctor that we know of or the Trump campaign or the president himself. And, by the way, by October the 15th, the president will be more than 14 days away from when he first contracted COVID-19, which means he will no longer, according to our own CDC, be shedding the virus, and will likely have immunity, and I'm sure our doctors will be checking that out in the first place. So, what's really going on here? Isn't really about COVID-19, or is this debate commission trying to basically harness President Trump and help Joe Biden? Earlier today, Donald Trump Jr. tweeted the following: Does anyone else find it awfully coincidental that the morning after Pence destroys Kamala Harris in a debate that the debate commission unilaterally changes the format to obviously benefit basement Biden? Now, keep in mind, during a virtual format, the moderators, well, they would have access to a mute button and sleepy Joe would have easy access to his trusty teleprompter. So, today, during an interview with our colleague and friend Maria Bartiromo, the president announced that he will not participate in this virtual debate and this last-minute rule change. And the president is right. It's time that we now ask the important question here: Is the Commission on Presidential Debates in the tank for Joe Biden? Has this turned into an anti-Trump organization? I think the evidence and the answer is sadly all too obvious. The moderator of the second presidential debate, if it happens, is a guy by the name of Steven Scully. Actually, know him, met him, actually like him. He interned for Joe Biden. He worked for Senator Ted Kennedy. Was that a factor in the debate commission's decision? And, meanwhile, last night's vice presidential moderator, Susan Page, well, currently is writing a seemingly glowing biography of Nancy Pelosi entitled, quote, \"Madam Speaker: Nancy Pelosi and the Lessons of Power.\" I guess it's no surprise that she failed to ask Senator Harris dozens of important questions. Why? I don't know. She didn't ask about law and order and safety and security, and the unrest that we've been watching for the entire summer. She didn't ask about Senator Harris' support for that bail fund in Minneapolis that put violent riders and anarchists back on the streets. She didn't ask, well, Senator Harris about, you know, all about calling Joe Biden pretty much a racist on a Democratic debate stage. She didn't ask about the time that Harris said she believed Biden's sexual harassment and assault the accusers. She didn't ask Kamala Harris about her smear of Justice Kavanaugh. She didn't ask about zero experience Hunter and the millions of dollars that he made from foreign countries while his father was the vice president. She didn't even ask about packing the courts. In fact, it was Vice President Mike Pence who brought up any of these issues and when he did, Senator Harris just flat-out refused to answer the question, and all- important power grab, a constitutional issue, something that has not been touched in over 150 years and he asked her over and over again and still didn't get an answer.

Him not answering should scare every American. And let me let you in on a little secret -- and Vice President Pence was right last night -- Joe and Kamala Harris have decided they're going to pack the U.S. Supreme Court. As Chuck Schumer said, everything is on the table. Now, if they get their way and they increase the number of justices on the Supreme Court and they fill it with new activist jurists that believe they can legislate from the bench, people like Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor and Justice Breyer, well, that would be corrupt, it would be illicit, it would be authoritarian, it would be a maneuver to give the Democrats total control over the courts and that which they couldn't win at the ballot box or legislatively, it would destroy coequal branches of government. That would cease to exist. Our American systems of checks and balances would be completely eviscerated. The media mob, by the way, is enabling them to get away with not answering this question. What else do they have in mind? Do they want to end the Electoral College? They want to end the legislative filibuster? Do they want to make this place or that place or D.C. a state? How many states do they want to have in the Union? This would be the single biggest power grab in this country in a hundred 50 years and it would transform this country to its core in a way that would not be good for every American and could very well destroy this constitutional republic. It is a clear and present danger and that's why Joe and Kamala Harris are keeping it a secret. But guess what? They're not stopping at court packing. They likely want to end the legislative filibuster. Again, Chuck Schumer, everything's on the table. They want to ditch the Electoral College. Are they ready and willing to give Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico, statehood in order to add four more guaranteed in their minds Democratic senators, in their view a guaranteed Democratic majority in the U.S. Senate in perpetuity? Do they want one state party rule, zero rights, zero input for the minority party? Because that's what it looks like. And the media mob, the so-called unpartisan debate moderators can't even be bothered to ask a single question about such a heavy constitutional issue and the impact it will have on this country and future generations, and meanwhile the truly unhinged Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, she's busy fantasizing still about getting rid of President Trump. She still has not accepted the results of the 2016 election and now says we are going to talk about the 25th Amendment, which lays out a plan of succession should the president become incapacitated.

This is an election where we're trying to get every Trump order to turn out and Biden is trying to get every Biden voter. But what Trump did in the debate as he got Biden to renounce Biden voters. Now, think about it -- again, a lot of people are missing this. Mike Pence did the same thing last night with Kamala Harris saying, no, no, no, we're not going to ban fracking. Well, that may sound great to people in the middle, but the radical left, including AOC, are losing their minds and they're the ones who are going to vote. Trump is doing this on purpose.

You reported on the Commission of Presidential Debates, Sean, and have to say the Commission on Presidential Debates looks more like a boring Washington, D.C., dinner party than it does like real America. I would almost rather left the cast of \"Love Island\" to set the rules for the next debate, and, of course, the commission which represents the elite wants to give Joe Biden the home-field advantage of a Zoom call from his own basement. But when the jobs of Americans are on the line, when our national security is on the line, you don't get to Zoom into those meetings, you have to show up.

Karl, listen, they lied about fracking. They lied on taxes. They lied on the issue of race. They're now talking about packing the courts. Joe -- Schumer says everything's on the table, ending the filibuster is on the table, ending the Electoral College is on the table, D.C., Puerto Rico statehood is on the table. Karl Rove, they're not -- how are they getting away with not answering fundamental questions and lying into such a high level?",

And here's what they're going to do. They're going to change the Senate rules to no longer require 60 votes to take up a bill. Virtually every -- not every piece of legislation but virtually all major bills in the Senate require 60 votes to begin the debate, and that's what we call the filibuster. If you don't get 60 votes, you can't take it out. Ironically, it will take only 50 votes, plus the vice president of the United States to break the tie to get rid of the 60 vote requirement, and that's what they're hiding. They don't want to say that they're not going to do that, because that's exactly what they're going to do. And what does that mean? What does that mean? Here's what it means. They will need only 50 votes plus the vice president, or 51 votes if they don't have the vice president to pass court packing, expand the number of judges so that the majority of liberals on the bench. Repeal the Trump tax cuts. Raise the new taxes that are called for in their platform. Taxes on business, taxes on wealth, tax on savings, even taxes on retirement. They say they want to do something but the tax advantage of like 401(k)s and IRAs. The public option, which is a government takeover of health care, done with -- not like Medicare for All, that does it immediately, this takes a couple of years to have the government take it over entirely. The college, taxpayer-funded abortion, abolish ICE, free health care for illegals, all of those things could be done with only 50 votes or 51 votes if you have 51 senators or 50 senators plus the vice president. Now, you want to get a list of what they want to do? They want to get rid of right to work, they want the federal unit -- FDR said we should never allow federal unions to negotiate for wages. They want to do that. They want to, quote, reimagine the police department. They want to get rid of natural gas power plants and oil-fueled power plant by 2035. They want to have -- they want to take 2 million houses out of 139 million houses in America and retrograde, up fit those places. Who's going to be 29 the 200 out of 139? They want what they call net zero agriculture. Go tell some farmer that he can't use a tractor because that's putting out -- that's putting out carbon. They want D.C. statehood and Puerto Rico, and if you think I'm making up this list, Google \"Biden Sanders unity task force recommendations\" and read that document, 80 pages, 2020 Democratic Party platform, you will find it all in their and their object is to pass all of those items with 50 votes in the United States Senate and vote of the vice president to break the tie.",

First, joining us now, best selling author, \"Unfreedom of the Press\", host of \"Life, Liberty, Levin\". I call him the great one, also nationally syndicated radio host, Mark Levin. Mark, let me go right to your wheelhouse, which is our Constitution. Joe Biden literally said that he'll tell us after the election where he stands on court packing. I want your position on that. Pelosi's comments on the 25th Amendment, the threat of Schumer to end the legislative filibuster, the biggest power grab that I have seen in 150 years. And tell us the constitutional significance of this. MARK LEVIN, \"UNFREEDOM OF THE PRESS\" AUTHOR: This is our Constitution. Men and women have gone to war to defend this document. Men and women have died to defend this document. It is the finest governing document ever created and established by mankind. You want to know why? Because it protects the individual from centralized government. It protects us from the mob and it protects us from the monarchy. Right now, the mob has a voice in the Democrat Party. The Democrat Party wants to destroy this country. That's why it intends to attack the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court is one of our three branches. The Democrat Party is saying we don't give a damn, if that branch doesn't out to our will, we're going to destroy it. They want to destroy half of Congress by loading up of Democrats, so there's Democrats in Congress that control that body for a generation. Then they want to destroy the legislative process, so nothing can be done, nothing, to stop them. All the checks and balances will be killed. All the checks and balances will be destroyed. Why? Because Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer have an agenda that they want to ram down the throats of the American people. This election is about this, the Constitution of the United States. When you vote, when you vote, you're voting now, you're voting on your liberty. You're voting on your country. You're voting for the men and women in uniform overseas who are fighting for this document. The Democrat Party is not this country. It doesn't get to rule over us. It doesn't get to have monopoly power over our government yet that's what it seeks. And we have a coward, a coward, in Joe Biden, a man who has been a racist for much of his life, a segregationist for much of his life, a bigot for much of his life, hiding behind a virus, hiding behind a virus. And he won't tell us if he will defend the Constitution of the United States. We have a candidate for president of the United States who will not tell us if you will defend separation of powers. One of the branches of the federal government because he's concerned that will be a headline? It will be a headline God forbid if he is sworn in and puts his hand in this document and says he's going to uphold the Constitution. I don't know who the hell Chuck Schumer thinks he is, he's a passing footnote in history or Nancy Pelosi, a passing foot in history, they don't get to decide in New York City and San Francisco how the rest of us live. Now, let me tell you how ignorant Nancy Pelosi is. How bombastic and buffoonish Nancy Pelosi is. The 25th Amendment, I didn't even know she could count to 25. Does she know what's in the 24th or 23rd Amendment? She knows nothing. The 25th Amendment provides, in part, that the vice president in a majority of either the principal officers of the executive departments or of such other body as Congress may by law provide determines that the president is no longer able to carry out his duties. Well, the vice president and the majority of the principal offices aren't going to do this, so they need another body. The problem is, there is no other body, because there's no law that's created another body. So she gets up there on stage with her stupid-looking mask that looks like it was somebody's old sofa, and she gets up there, and you know what? Come back tomorrow. We are going to talk about the 25th Amendment. What are you going to tell us, Nancy? Let me tell you what she's going to do in the media are going to run with it because they are as ignorant as anybody else. We're going to set up a commission. We're going to pass a bill in the house to set up a commission with experts to look at this president, the medicines that he's taking. But it's not the law, because the Senate is not going to pass in the president is not going to sign it. She's setting up nothing. She's doing a fan dance. This is another phony Nancy Pelosi drama act three and a half weeks before the election. Let me tell you about this woman. This woman has told our airlines, our pilots, she is told our ticket agents, she's told people who work in the airline industry go to hell and drop dead because I can't get the money to bail out Cuomo, I can't get the money to bail out Newsom and all these other fools that run these states into the ground, and because I can't get that money, people are unemployed are getting nothing, people who run those stores are getting nothing. The airlines are going to go upside down because Nancy Pelosi has decided - - she is blackmailing America. Nancy Pelosi has decided you either give into her, you either destroy the Constitution, or -- or what? Or she's going to destroy the country.",

We campaigned on it. I protected this. If I weren't president, you wouldn't have a Second Amendment right now. And Biden does that. Nobody -- nobody talks about life anymore, pro-life. Is he pro-life? No, he's not pro-life. What is he? Why don't you ask him that question? He doesn't want to talk about it. But he endorsed a governor of Virginia who not only executed a baby, late- term abortion, but executed a baby, because said, the baby can be born, and then you can kill the baby. And he's totally in favor of that. And I can tell you, your pro-life groups are -- they're en masse. They're en masse. This is -- this is their one shot, because what's going on is so -- is so bad, is so evil. The governor of Virginia said, we will execute the baby after the baby's born. That's when -- you talk about late-term abortion. This is early-term execution. And it's a very, very bad thing. But you don't ever hear anybody talking about pro-life/pro-choice with Biden. You never -- did you ever hear it? I haven't heard it. Very rarely do you hear it. I don't think he would know how to discuss it.

And so, I think I should do very well with suburban women, because I'm the one that's protecting them, both in terms of law and order and in terms of zoning.

I got the biggest tax cuts ever given, as you know, Sean, better than probably most. But he's going to end those tax cuts and reverse them.

      "utterance": "All right. Welcome to \"Hannity\". We start tonight, a FOX News alert -- the president of the United States, Donald Trump, will join us live. We will talk about the debates, COVID-19, Joe Biden, and so much more, only moments away. Tonight, there are 26 days until Election Day. You will be the ultimate jury, buckle up, brace yourself. This will be a rollercoaster ride the next 26 days. Now, during last night's debate, Vice President Mike Pence was unflappable, and he not only eviscerated, frankly, Senator Kamala Harris, but he exposed just how radical and frankly dangerous her and Joe Biden's positions truly are to this country. She also got caught in one lie after another. Her rambling, her disorganized answers at times were even hard to watch. Frankly, it's hard to believe she was ever a prosecutor given her utter lack of preparation and terrible execution. More importantly, by the way, today, Senator Harris and her frail, weak running mate, the ever-forgetful Joe Biden, they still are flat-out refusing to answer significant, serious questions, dozens of them, including whether or not they plan to neuter the United States Supreme Court with a corrupt practice known as court packing. Frankly, it is unconscionable that they refused to tell you, the American people, the truth. I guess they must think that we the American people are really that stupid. They really think that they can just coast to the finish line without being honest, without being transparent, without being forthright. Now, of course, the media mob, state-run TV news, state run newspapers, so far, they've allowed them to get away with all of this, which would be the biggest power grab in history and, by the way, that is exactly what will happen. Their non-answers as Vice President Pence said, that's their answer. Now, coming up, we have full reaction, Dan Bongino, Karl Rove, Congressman Matt Gaetz, the great one, Mark Levin, will be here with their full reaction and analysis. And don't forget, the president will join us straight ahead. But first, we do need to talk about the Commission on Presidential Debates. Now, it's supposedly nonprofit -- well, supposedly nonpartisan, an organization responsible for carrying out the presidential and vice presidential debates. But today, the commission, unilaterally, without consulting either campaign, decided to upend the next matchup between President Trump and former Vice President Biden. Now, they were citing the president's COVID-19 diagnosis and the commission announced that the debate would be held out virtually out of, quote, \"safety concerns.\" The problem is that was a unilateral decision. They did not consult with the president's doctors. They didn't consult with any doctor that we know of or the Trump campaign or the president himself. And, by the way, by October the 15th, the president will be more than 14 days away from when he first contracted COVID-19, which means he will no longer, according to our own CDC, be shedding the virus, and will likely have immunity, and I'm sure our doctors will be checking that out in the first place. So, what's really going on here? Isn't really about COVID-19, or is this debate commission trying to basically harness President Trump and help Joe Biden?"

Now, keep in mind, during a virtual format, the moderators, well, they would have access to a mute button and sleepy Joe would have easy access to his trusty teleprompter. So, today, during an interview with our colleague and friend Maria Bartiromo, the president announced that he will not participate in this virtual debate and this last-minute rule change. And the president is right."

    {
      "speaker": "It's time that we now ask the important question here",
      "utterance": "Is the Commission on Presidential Debates in the tank for Joe Biden? Has this turned into an anti-Trump organization? I think the evidence and the answer is sadly all too obvious. The moderator of the second presidential debate, if it happens, is a guy by the name of Steven Scully. Actually, know him, met him, actually like him. He interned for Joe Biden. He worked for Senator Ted Kennedy. Was that a factor in the debate commission's decision? And, meanwhile, last night's vice presidential moderator, Susan Page, well, currently is writing a seemingly glowing biography of Nancy Pelosi entitled, quote, \"Madam Speaker: Nancy Pelosi and the Lessons of Power.\" I guess it's no surprise that she failed to ask Senator Harris dozens of important questions. Why? I don't know. She didn't ask about law and order and safety and security, and the unrest that we've been watching for the entire summer. She didn't ask about Senator Harris' support for that bail fund in Minneapolis that put violent riders and anarchists back on the streets. She didn't ask, well, Senator Harris about, you know, all about calling Joe Biden pretty much a racist on a Democratic debate stage. She didn't ask about the time that Harris said she believed Biden's sexual harassment and assault the accusers. She didn't ask Kamala Harris about her smear of Justice Kavanaugh. She didn't ask about zero experience Hunter and the millions of dollars that he made from foreign countries while his father was the vice president. She didn't even ask about packing the courts. In fact, it was Vice President Mike Pence who brought up any of these issues and when he did, Senator Harris just flat-out refused to answer the question, and all- important power grab, a constitutional issue, something that has not been touched in over 150 years and he asked her over and over again and still didn't get an answer. Take a look."

By the way, back to Harris, she never answered the vice president's question. The moderator never held her accountable, didn't even follow up, so it should be no surprise that earlier today, Joe Biden once again, he refused to answer the question. He did say he will give us an answer after the election. Take a look."

      "utterance": "This is a question of constitutional magnitude. You're supposed to tell us where you stand on the positions to garner support of the American people. Him not answering should scare every American. And let me let you in on a little secret -- and Vice President Pence was right last night -- Joe and Kamala Harris have decided they're going to pack the U.S. Supreme Court. As Chuck Schumer said, everything is on the table. Now, if they get their way and they increase the number of justices on the Supreme Court and they fill it with new activist jurists that believe they can legislate from the bench, people like Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor and Justice Breyer, well, that would be corrupt, it would be illicit, it would be authoritarian, it would be a maneuver to give the Democrats total control over the courts and that which they couldn't win at the ballot box or legislatively, it would destroy coequal branches of government. That would cease to exist. Our American systems of checks and balances would be completely eviscerated. The media mob, by the way, is enabling them to get away with not answering this question. What else do they have in mind? Do they want to end the Electoral College? They want to end the legislative filibuster? Do they want to make this place or that place or D.C. a state? How many states do they want to have in the Union? This would be the single biggest power grab in this country in a hundred 50 years and it would transform this country to its core in a way that would not be good for every American and could very well destroy this constitutional republic. It is a clear and present danger and that's why Joe and Kamala Harris are keeping it a secret. But guess what? They're not stopping at court packing. They likely want to end the legislative filibuster. Again, Chuck Schumer, everything's on the table. They want to ditch the Electoral College. Are they ready and willing to give Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico, statehood in order to add four more guaranteed in their minds Democratic senators, in their view a guaranteed Democratic majority in the U.S. Senate in perpetuity? Do they want one state party rule, zero rights, zero input for the minority party? Because that's what it looks like. And the media mob, the so-called unpartisan debate moderators can't even be bothered to ask a single question about such a heavy constitutional issue and the impact it will have on this country and future generations, and meanwhile the truly unhinged Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, she's busy fantasizing still about getting rid of President Trump. She still has not accepted the results of the 2016 election and now says we are going to talk about the 25th Amendment, which lays out a plan of succession should the president become incapacitated.

It relates to an appearance I did with you after the Trump-Biden debate a couple weeks ago, Sean. What President Trump managed to do a lot of people missed. What he did in the debate, is he managed to get Joe Biden to divorce the left. That's a big problem, Sean, because this is the base election. There are very few independents left. This is an election where we're trying to get every Trump order to turn out and Biden is trying to get every Biden voter. But what Trump did in the debate as he got Biden to renounce Biden voters. Now, think about it -- again, a lot of people are missing this. Mike Pence did the same thing last night with Kamala Harris saying, no, no, no, we're not going to ban fracking. Well, that may sound great to people in the middle, but the radical left, including AOC, are losing their minds and they're the ones who are going to vote. Trump is doing this on purpose. This is a strategy and he's got them playing their game, and that's why they will not admit that they won't pack the court, because if they do, it will be the final straw with the radical left and the surgical operation separating Biden from the radical left will be complete."

You reported on the Commission of Presidential Debates, Sean, and have to say the Commission on Presidential Debates looks more like a boring Washington, D.C., dinner party than it does like real America. I would almost rather left the cast of \"Love Island\" to set the rules for the next debate, and, of course, the commission which represents the elite wants to give Joe Biden the home-field advantage of a Zoom call from his own basement. But when the jobs of Americans are on the line, when our national security is on the line, you don't get to Zoom into those meetings, you have to show up.

And here's what they're going to do. They're going to change the Senate rules to no longer require 60 votes to take up a bill. Virtually every -- not every piece of legislation but virtually all major bills in the Senate require 60 votes to begin the debate, and that's what we call the filibuster. If you don't get 60 votes, you can't take it out. Ironically, it will take only 50 votes, plus the vice president of the United States to break the tie to get rid of the 60 vote requirement, and that's what they're hiding. They don't want to say that they're not going to do that, because that's exactly what they're going to do. And what does that mean? What does that mean? Here's what it means. They will need only 50 votes plus the vice president, or 51 votes if they don't have the vice president to pass court packing, expand the number of judges so that the majority of liberals on the bench. Repeal the Trump tax cuts. Raise the new taxes that are called for in their platform. Taxes on business, taxes on wealth, tax on savings, even taxes on retirement. They say they want to do something but the tax advantage of like 401(k)s and IRAs. The public option, which is a government takeover of health care, done with -- not like Medicare for All, that does it immediately, this takes a couple of years to have the government take it over entirely. The college, taxpayer-funded abortion, abolish ICE, free health care for illegals, all of those things could be done with only 50 votes or 51 votes if you have 51 senators or 50 senators plus the vice president. Now, you want to get a list of what they want to do? They want to get rid of right to work, they want the federal unit -- FDR said we should never allow federal unions to negotiate for wages. They want to do that. They want to, quote, reimagine the police department. They want to get rid of natural gas power plants and oil-fueled power plant by 2035. They want to have -- they want to take 2 million houses out of 139 million houses in America and retrograde, up fit those places. Who's going to be 29 the 200 out of 139? They want what they call net zero agriculture. Go tell some farmer that he can't use a tractor because that's putting out -- that's putting out carbon. They want D.C. statehood and Puerto Rico, and if you think I'm making up this list, Google \"Biden Sanders unity task force recommendations\" and read that document, 80 pages, 2020 Democratic Party platform, you will find it all in their and their object is to pass all of those items with 50 votes in the United States Senate and vote of the vice president to break the tie."

First, joining us now, best selling author, \"Unfreedom of the Press\", host of \"Life, Liberty, Levin\". I call him the great one, also nationally syndicated radio host, Mark Levin. Mark, let me go right to your wheelhouse, which is our Constitution. Joe Biden literally said that he'll tell us after the election where he stands on court packing. I want your position on that. Pelosi's comments on the 25th Amendment, the threat of Schumer to end the legislative filibuster, the biggest power grab that I have seen in 150 years. And tell us the constitutional significance of this. MARK LEVIN, \"UNFREEDOM OF THE PRESS\" AUTHOR: This is our Constitution. Men and women have gone to war to defend this document. Men and women have died to defend this document. It is the finest governing document ever created and established by mankind. You want to know why? Because it protects the individual from centralized government. It protects us from the mob and it protects us from the monarchy. Right now, the mob has a voice in the Democrat Party. The Democrat Party wants to destroy this country. That's why it intends to attack the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court is one of our three branches. The Democrat Party is saying we don't give a damn, if that branch doesn't out to our will, we're going to destroy it. They want to destroy half of Congress by loading up of Democrats, so there's Democrats in Congress that control that body for a generation. Then they want to destroy the legislative process, so nothing can be done, nothing, to stop them. All the checks and balances will be killed. All the checks and balances will be destroyed. Why? Because Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer have an agenda that they want to ram down the throats of the American people. This election is about this, the Constitution of the United States. When you vote, when you vote, you're voting now, you're voting on your liberty. You're voting on your country. You're voting for the men and women in uniform overseas who are fighting for this document. The Democrat Party is not this country. It doesn't get to rule over us. It doesn't get to have monopoly power over our government yet that's what it seeks. And we have a coward, a coward, in Joe Biden, a man who has been a racist for much of his life, a segregationist for much of his life, a bigot for much of his life, hiding behind a virus, hiding behind a virus. And he won't tell us if he will defend the Constitution of the United States. We have a candidate for president of the United States who will not tell us if you will defend separation of powers. One of the branches of the federal government because he's concerned that will be a headline? It will be a headline God forbid if he is sworn in and puts his hand in this document and says he's going to uphold the Constitution. I don't know who the hell Chuck Schumer thinks he is, he's a passing footnote in history or Nancy Pelosi, a passing foot in history, they don't get to decide in New York City and San Francisco how the rest of us live. Now, let me tell you how ignorant Nancy Pelosi is. How bombastic and buffoonish Nancy Pelosi is. The 25th Amendment, I didn't even know she could count to 25. Does she know what's in the 24th or 23rd Amendment? She knows nothing. The 25th Amendment provides, in part, that the vice president in a majority of either the principal officers of the executive departments or of such other body as Congress may by law provide determines that the president is no longer able to carry out his duties. Well, the vice president and the majority of the principal offices aren't going to do this, so they need another body. The problem is, there is no other body, because there's no law that's created another body. So she gets up there on stage with her stupid-looking mask that looks like it was somebody's old sofa, and she gets up there, and you know what? Come back tomorrow. We are going to talk about the 25th Amendment. What are you going to tell us, Nancy? Let me tell you what she's going to do in the media are going to run with it because they are as ignorant as anybody else. We're going to set up a commission. We're going to pass a bill in the house to set up a commission with experts to look at this president, the medicines that he's taking. But it's not the law, because the Senate is not going to pass in the president is not going to sign it. She's setting up nothing. She's doing a fan dance. This is another phony Nancy Pelosi drama act three and a half weeks before the election. Let me tell you about this woman. This woman has told our airlines, our pilots, she is told our ticket agents, she's told people who work in the airline industry go to hell and drop dead because I can't get the money to bail out Cuomo, I can't get the money to bail out Newsom and all these other fools that run these states into the ground, and because I can't get that money, people are unemployed are getting nothing, people who run those stores are getting nothing. The airlines are going to go upside down because Nancy Pelosi has decided - - she is blackmailing America. Nancy Pelosi has decided you either give into her, you either destroy the Constitution, or -- or what? Or she's going to destroy the country."

He's not even close. But Chris was terrible. He was protecting Biden the whole night. I asked Biden about, why did he get all of that money from the mayor of Russia, from the wife of the mayor of Russia? And Chris wouldn't let that be answered. When I said, why did he do the billion dollars, you're not getting a billion dollars to Ukraine unless you get rid of the prosecutor? Chris wouldn't let that. He protected him.

But I will say this, that it is -- it's a very sad thing. Now you have this Debate Commission is a joke. The commission's a joke. Take a look at the letter they wrote me four years ago, when they apologized. They were oscillating my mic. They were turning it up and down when I was speaking to Hillary, crooked Hillary, who turns out to be very crooked. Look at all the stuff we found out on Obama and Biden and her. So, we will see what happens. But, no, I'm not interested in doing a virtual. I'm not Joe Biden. I'm not going to do a virtual debate, sit behind a computer screen. And that gives him the answers, because they will be handing him the answers, just like he gets when he asks -- I mean, he does news conferences. He does them, and they give him the answer, and they give him the question. And they give him -- what kind of a news conference? He does them all the time.

And we have -- I'm going to have 300 judges by the time I finish, 300. It's a record, by the -- by the end of the first term. Think of that. It's a record to the term. By the end of the first term, I will have 300 judges, just about, give or take a few, couple."

But he was exposed as a clown, as much worse than that, but I want to be nice, because it's a nice evening show. But he was exposed as a clown. He wants to take away your guns. He's going to take away your Second Amendment. Nobody ever -- nobody asks him about the Second Amendment anymore. Do you notice that? The Second Amendment is very important. It's a big thing. We campaigned on it. I protected this. If I weren't president, you wouldn't have a Second Amendment right now. And Biden does that. Nobody -- nobody talks about life anymore, pro-life. Is he pro-life? No, he's not pro-life. What is he? Why don't you ask him that question? He doesn't want to talk about it. But he endorsed a governor of Virginia who not only executed a baby, late- term abortion, but executed a baby, because said, the baby can be born, and then you can kill the baby. And he's totally in favor of that. And I can tell you, your pro-life groups are -- they're en masse. They're en masse. This is -- this is their one shot, because what's going on is so -- is so bad, is so evil. The governor of Virginia said, we will execute the baby after the baby's born. That's when -- you talk about late-term abortion. This is early-term execution. And it's a very, very bad thing. But you don't ever hear anybody talking about pro-life/pro-choice with Biden. You never -- did you ever hear it? I haven't heard it. Very rarely do you hear it. I don't think he would know how to discuss it. But, very importantly, the Second Amendment, though, they just don't discuss the Second Amendment. He's going to take your guns away. So, everybody with a gun, you can't vote for him, because you're not going to have your gun. At the same time, they wanted to defund the police. So, you're not going to have police protection, and you -- by the way, you can't have a gun. So, when one of these maniacs breaks into your house at night because there are no cops around, you don't have a gun to protect yourself. That's a great combination. And the suburbs are going to fall. You know, a lot of people talk about the women of the suburbs, right, women of the suburbs. They do or don't like Trump. I don't know. But what I have done is incredible for the suburbs. The suburbs are over, as you know. The suburbs will become more unsafe than the cities, run by the Democrats. And so, I think I should do very well with suburban women, because I'm the one that's protecting them, both in terms of law and order and in terms of zoning. They want to build low-income housing right next to your house, as you destroy -- as the American dream is destroyed, destroyed."

It's not just the right. It's the right. It's the left. But the left has been the problem for a long time. Antifa is a big, big problem. And I see Whitmer today. She's complaining, but it was our Justice Department that arrested the people that she was complaining about. It was my Justice Department that arrested them. But, instead, she goes and does her little political act. And she keeps her state closed, although we just won the big case, as you know, to open up Michigan, because what she's doing is a horrible thing to the people. The churches are closed. The schools are closed, and the whole state is closed. And people are being hurt very badly by it, in the form of drinking and suicides and depression. It's a very sad thing. But, no, Joe Biden wants to raise taxes, and, very sadly, if you take a look. He wants to raise taxes, but he says he's going to end our tax cut. Well, people are getting actually much more. Mike handled it great. He said $2,000. It was actually much more than $2,000 in child tax credits, which is $1,000 a child. But he wants to take all that away. So, therefore, if you do nothing else, you're raising taxes by the largest percentage in the history of our country. If you -- if he terminated my tax cuts, which is one of the reasons that our economy has done so great, even now in this pandemic, which hopefully, we're rounding the turn. And we have incredible cures and a lot of therapeutics, and the vaccines are going to be coming very soon. But I will tell you, what I took is incredible. To me, I viewed it as a cure. It's incredible. And we're going to get it to everybody, free of charge. It's going to hospitals. It's starting very soon. The military is going to be delivering it. But he's looking to do big, big tax cuts - big, big tax increases, like at a level that's never been seen. Nobody's ever gotten the cuts that I got. I got the biggest tax cuts ever given, as you know, Sean, better than probably most. But he's going to end those tax cuts and reverse them. And now people are going to pay $2,000, plus child tax credits, all that. It's going to be a disaster for our country. It's going to -- it's going to put our country into a depression. And your 401(k)s are going to go down the tubes. And your jobs are going to go away. And you're going to have a depression, the likes of which our country has never seen before, and that possibly includes 1929."

I mean, they literally want to take buildings down and rebuild them with tiny little windows, OK, little windows, so you can't see out, you can't see the light. And the whole thing is so crazy. It's such a crazy thing. And take a look. And Biden agreed to this with crazy Bernie, because, you know, they have the manifesto. They have agreed to most of these things. And it's going to cost more money. Our country will be a ninth world country, not a third world country, a ninth world country. We won't have energies. Look at what's happening with the rolling blackouts in California. Look at where California is going to have to ration water. You know why? Because they send millions of gallons of water out to sea, out to the Pacific, because they want to take care of certain little tiny fish that aren't doing very well without water, to be honest with you. But it's a very sad thing that's happening. It's no common sense. Even the fires in California, I -- I talk about, you need -- I was with Governor Newsom. I get along with him very well. We disagree on a lot of things, but I get along with him. Number one, you should let water come down from the north and accept it, instead of throwing it out to the Pacific. But you also have to have forest management. We send them so much money. I don't have to, but I want to help California. But they have the biggest forest fires because they don't manage their land. They don't have separators. They have trees that have been laying on the ground that are stone-cold, dead dry, like a matchstick. And you throw a cigarette butt on it. Between the leaves and the trees, everything catches on fire, and you lose 200,000 acres in a short period of time. They got to manage their forests."
