Of course, impeachment fever is sweeping Congress and we have got an all-star line up to take you through every “Angle.” Our legal experts Sol Weisenberg, Alan Dershowitz break down everything you need to know, Rudy Giuliani responding to a breaking story from \"The Washington Post\" regarding his role in the entire Ukraine affair and Andy McCarthy is here with some shocking details about the lawyer representing the whistleblower. And House GOP Whip Steve Scullies is here with all the consequences of Pelosi caving to the radicals in here caucus.  But first, desperate Democrats go to defcon one. That is the focus of tonight's “Angle.” It looks like we are ending Trump's first term where it began with member of the resistance borrowed into government leaking incomplete information with the worst possible spin on it all done to ensnare the President and another major costly investigation. And January 2017 it was Comey and the deep state. September 2019, it is Nancy and whistleblower case.",

However, we don't know if we have this here. It is really shocking to me that these people couldn't even wait one day to read the transcript and can't wait. Apparently, we get the full list of a whistleblower report in a week or so which is shocking to me that you would try to start the stampede without actually looking at the materials.  I find it very troubling. And I also want to say that I find it also troubling when someone mentioned earlier, I mean, how does a whistleblower even know about this? How do people even know about this conversation? What kind of leaking is going on? I think that is very concerning. But I guess my main point, go ahead, sorry.",

They had a vote on it. The frame of the constitution said no, that would give Congress too much power or would turn the United States into a parliamentary system like Great Britain.  That is when they introduce the concept of bribery, treason or other high crimes and misdemeanors. A high crime means crimes that involve corruption of office. When Alexander Hamilton admitted he committed adultery which was a serious felony and paid extortion money but he denied that he paid it out of treasury funds.  He wrote \"The Federalist\" paper about impeachment. So he knew the difference. If he had just paid extortion money that would be low crime but if he paid out of treasury funds, it would be high crime because it would involve both the crime and corruption. So with respect to I disagree. I think you need both the crime and the crime that is a high crime that shows maladministration of office.",

It really goes back to small-time stuff when he first got into the Senate with his brother who was enriching himself on Biden's public office. And then the numbers got outrageous during the Obama administration -- $5-$6 million to a son who's a seriously incompetent person, who got put on a board of the most corrupt company in Ukraine.",

As we told you earlier, senior officials telling Fox that the Trump administration will also release a document tomorrow showing the intel community inspector general found the whistleblower had political bias in favor of a rival candidate. Joining me now is Andy McCarthy, former U.S. attorney, Fox News contributor, and author of \"Ball of Collusion,\" as well as Chris Hahn, former aide who Senator Chuck Schumer and host of the \"Aggressive Progressive\" podcast.

I met with the representative of Mr. Zelensky. We never discussed any kind of pressure about a criminal case. We never discussed any kind of quid pro quo or pressure. So I more than willing to have anybody talk to the person that I talked to. Plus, everybody on the Ukraine side has said they weren't pressured, which they weren't. My conversation was to help the State Department facilitate a meeting. An ambassador, Ambassador Volker called me, he asked me to do it. He set up the meeting or helped me to set it up. I debriefed him three times in great detail about it. And if that incredibly irresponsible person thinks that I would ever do anything that's illegal or unethical, maybe I'm kind of just a simple little lawyer and I'm not very good at criminal crisis or criminal investigation, but I sure as heck know how to protect myself and my client. It was a perfectly appropriate, perfectly legitimate, and a completely authorized communications, and it's all documented. And once again, the Democrats just make false charges.

These hysterias are just serial now and there's not a substance to it. The Mueller implosion, the 25th Amendment, it's serial. And who's the beneficiary of this, Laura? Half of your news coverage today as well with other networks has been about Joe Biden. Joe Biden is no longer collateral damage. He's damaged. And that poses sort of a Latin phrase, cui bono. To whose interest was that? It's almost as if Elizabeth Warren is the real beneficiary. And then ironically it will be Donald Trump, because if Biden is damaged, Warren will be a far less formidable candidate. And then where did we go beyond that? Michael Flynn's business partner's case was thrown out by the judge, of all people. And we have criminal referrals that are starting to metamorphosize into indictments.

But look for the administration to highlight that. Each site is going to put out they are facts that are helpful to them that's how these cycles go.

You don't go around convicting the President, verdict first, trial later. \"Alice in Wonderland\" type injustice. They have not even seen the material. They haven't seen the transcript of the conversation. They don't know enough about the whistleblower. Nobody, Nancy Pelosi and nobody else has mentioned a statute that this would violate even if it were true. You have to find bribery. This isn't bravery. You have to find treason, obviously not treason. It's not a high crime of misdemeanor in fact Nancy Pelosi herself said it was a violation of the constitution. I don't know what that means.

Again going back to the Russian inclusion narrative. So they are using Russian collusion and kind of a whole stack of tidbits that they are putting together in this big impeachment sandwich that they are now dining out on. So that's where we are at. But to Alan's point from is this crime rising to a level of a high crime or misdemeanor? If this even happened?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WEISENBERG",
      "utterance": "Well, I don't believe and I may disagree with Professor Dershowitz on this point. Most constitutional scholars would agree with me that high crime or misdemeanor is not confined to a criminal code crime that you can impeach somebody for a serious breach of the public's trust, public corruption and the like. However, we don't know if we have this here. It is really shocking to me that these people couldn't even wait one day to read the transcript and can't wait. Apparently, we get the full list of a whistleblower report in a week or so which is shocking to me that you would try to start the stampede without actually looking at the materials. I find it very troubling. And I also want to say that I find it also troubling when someone mentioned earlier, I mean, how does a whistleblower even know about this? How do people even know about this conversation? What kind of leaking is going on? I think that is very concerning. But I guess my main point, go ahead, sorry."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DERSHOWITZ",
      "utterance": "Go ahead, I'm sorry. You also have to look at this constitution. The frame has debated this. Some of the framer said abusive office should be enough for impeachment. They had a vote on it. The frame of the constitution said no, that would give Congress too much power or would turn the United States into a parliamentary system like Great Britain. That is when they introduce the concept of bribery, treason or other high crimes and misdemeanors. A high crime means crimes that involve corruption of office. When Alexander Hamilton admitted he committed adultery which was a serious felony and paid extortion money but he denied that he paid it out of treasury funds. He wrote \"The Federalist\" paper about impeachment. So he knew the difference. If he had just paid extortion money that would be low crime but if he paid out of treasury funds, it would be high crime because it would involve both the crime and corruption. So with respect to I disagree. I think you need both the crime and the crime that is a high crime that shows maladministration of office."

And then since then, I guess what the White House Counsel's office and the DOJ they decided release the full transcript of the call, release the whistleblower complaint, release the IG report and they are allowing the width whistleblower to justify. How does this, Sol I will go to you first, how is this exactly the Watergate cover-up playbook that I've heard supposedly really smart people on television all day long citing Watergate without an eye about it on the other side of the camera? I've never seen anything like it."

But again, I am going to wait, okay, I don't know what's in the transcript. I don't know what's in the report. I'm going to wait to actually read it.

If he would impeach a Democrat on the basis of these criteria, then you can impeach Republican and vice versa. You can't have special rules for the party you oppose. That turns the constitution into a political weapon."

The Senate is not going to convict him. But it is going to run the narrative right up to the next campaign. This campaign into the 2020 season, right smack dab in the middle of it. I think that lens some more, even more persuasiveness to what Professor Dershowitz is saying. This starts to look like a political solution. To what they may not be so confident about next November, which is, you know removing President Trump the old fashion way, at the ballot box. That is when it begins to look like when you make comments about a case. I think you're being very prudent about it and I salute you for that, reserving judgment at the very least until the documents come out. But no, they cannot do that. They want the new cycle like that."

I think the Democrats have stepped into something way beyond what they realize. It reminds me of a fighter who is swinging wildly against a really skilled fighter who has a great right hand and puts him right down. They have walked into something that I was hoping they'd walk into for six months. And what they've exposed is probably what's going to turn out to be one of the major scandals of the early part of the 21st century, which is Joe Biden. It's a lot of money, Laura. It's not just Ukraine. It's a pattern of conduct. It's a very serious pattern of conduct. It really goes back to small-time stuff when he first got into the Senate with his brother who was enriching himself on Biden's public office. And then the numbers got outrageous during the Obama administration -- $5-$6 million to a son who's a seriously incompetent person, who got put on a board of the most corrupt company in Ukraine."

So I more than willing to have anybody talk to the person that I talked to. Plus, everybody on the Ukraine side has said they weren't pressured, which they weren't. My conversation was to help the State Department facilitate a meeting. An ambassador, Ambassador Volker called me, he asked me to do it. He set up the meeting or helped me to set it up. I debriefed him three times in great detail about it. And if that incredibly irresponsible person thinks that I would ever do anything that's illegal or unethical, maybe I'm kind of just a simple little lawyer and I'm not very good at criminal crisis or criminal investigation, but I sure as heck know how to protect myself and my client. It was a perfectly appropriate, perfectly legitimate, and a completely authorized communications, and it's all documented. And once again, the Democrats just make false charges.

These hysterias are just serial now and there's not a substance to it. The Mueller implosion, the 25th Amendment, it's serial. And who's the beneficiary of this, Laura? Half of your news coverage today as well with other networks has been about Joe Biden. Joe Biden is no longer collateral damage. He's damaged. And that poses sort of a Latin phrase, cui bono. To whose interest was that? It's almost as if Elizabeth Warren is the real beneficiary. And then ironically it will be Donald Trump, because if Biden is damaged, Warren will be a far less formidable candidate. And then where did we go beyond that? Michael Flynn's business partner's case was thrown out by the judge, of all people. And we have criminal referrals that are starting to metamorphosize into indictments.

But look, the author of the articles of impeachment -- and again, there's nothing to impeach the president on, but yet the member of Congress who filed the articles of impeachment himself today said that they don't think that they can beat the president so they're going to use impeachment. And if you look at the Constitution, impeachment is supposed to be used as a check against the executive. Nancy Pelosi is trying to use impeachment as a check against the electorate. That's not the way it's supposed to work."

      "utterance": "We pointed that out on “The Angle” tonight. This is a last ditch, DEFCON one, nuclear option, because I don't think, Victor -- I think they thought that the economy was going to go into a recession. It dipped down today because no one wants impeachment, investigators don't want it. So I think they thought the recession was going to deliver them electoral nirvana next November. It doesn't look like it, doesn't look like it. And their candidates are -- Biden is having some trouble. Warren is really way out there, even though she's drawing some big crowds. I don't think they're as confident as they initially might have thought they would be, and I think that's freaking them out. So they're going to the Squad. Whatever the Squad wants, the Squad gets. Victor?"

And what is ironic about -- again, ironic, is that Trump has somehow demonized, they are so -- I don't know what the word is -- demonized by Trump, or they're unhinged, what they're doing is they have a law or theorem when they get on that debate stage that says no candidate shall be so the left of me, and they have all moved way far from anything we've ever seen in the last 50 years. So now they're in this situation where they can't propose an alternate agenda because every single item polls below 50 percent in any poll. So now they are back and saying we kind of got ourselves into a jam. We can't run into that issues, so we have got to go back to Trump is a monster, Trump is unhinged, all this stuff."

And by the way, a really important piece from John Yoo, former deputy U.S. attorney general. He was writing for the \"New York Times,\" and this just was published, about what this is doing to the office of the presidency. He said \"We should be aware that rushing into any impeachment may do long term harm to the presidency and our national security. If Congress could regulate presidential discussions with foreign leaders, presidents and foreign leaders would speak less candidly or stop making the calls altogether. United States foreign policy would be crippled.\" Congressman?"

We're going to have an election next year. I think this, number one, it strengthens President Trump's case because they hurt Joe Biden, they helped Elizabeth Warren. This is not a good day for them."

The details of this conversation matter. And we want to give everybody enough time across the board to get their points in. We're going to call everyone accountable.
