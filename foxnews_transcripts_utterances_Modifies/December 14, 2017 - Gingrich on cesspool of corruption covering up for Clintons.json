      "sentences": "And welcome to \"Hannity.\" And this is a Fox News alert. James Comey, the former FBI director is in huge legal trouble tonight. We have major breaking news. Fox News has now obtained the draft of James Comey's exoneration statement about the Clinton server investigation remember before the investigation was even completed. We now know that the legal term grossly negligent was changed to extreme carelessness in two specific places.  Also, the word likely was removed from a section where Comey talked about foreign actors actually gaining access to top secrets, special access program information on her server.  Plus, explosive new information about how the Obama State Department actually gave Hillary Clinton and her top aide Huma Abedin special treatment. Now Judicial Watch is obtained documents that show Clinton and Abedin were allowed to actually physically remove electronic records from the State Department that they claim were quote, \"unclassified and personal.\"  Also Sara Carter is here tonight with a new bombshell report about the FBI using an NSA surveillance program to spy on the American people. Also, we have new details on how the anti-Trump, pro-Clinton text messages from the FBI agent Peter Strzok and his FBI lawyer girlfriend Lisa Page were discovered. And according to a brand new poll a majority of you, the American people, believe that Special Counsel Robert Mueller's tainted and corrupt investigation is biased. We have been telling you the rest of the media needs to catch up. That's happening right in this breaking news opening monologue.  All right. A major development in the Clinton server scandal. You've got to pay close attention tonight. This is going to be a blockbuster hour. We here at Fox News have obtained the draft of James Comey's exoneration statement that let Hillary Clinton off the hook as it relates to the email server. The document shows that the term \"grossly negligent\" was, in fact, changed to \"extreme carelessness\" in two places. Remember, grossly negligent is the legal standard which would have meant that Clinton broke the law. And here's the other piece of new information. In the part where Comey was talking about foreign actors accessing Clinton's server, the word \"likely accessed\" was removed. This is national security. All of this continues to prove that the fix was in from the very beginning of what is a farce of an investigation.  There was the exoneration before the investigation was anywhere near concluded. And here's why. The draft statement is from May 2, 2016. Hillary and others in her case wasn't interviewed by the FBI until the Fourth of July weekend. So, how could Comey, how could this Hillary-loving, Trump-hating FBI agent Peter Strzok, reach any conclusion about Clinton's server investigation two months before they even interviewed her or other key people?   The fix was in. Plain and simple. We now have the evidence. And Fox News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett says what we just laid out could mean James Comey is guilty of obstruction of justice. That is a crime. That is a felony. We'll hear from him coming up later in the program. Also tonight, Judicial Watch has uncovered an absolutely bombshell report about the special treatment that Hillary Clinton and her top aide Huma Abedin were given by the Obama State Department. We now have documents that were obtained through the Freedom of Information Act, it shows that Clinton and her top aide, they were given permission by the State Department to remove both electronic and physical records that they claim were, quote, \"personal\" and, quote, \"unclassified\" and non-recorded materials. According to Judicial Watch, this includes records of Hillary Clinton's calls, her schedules, which conveniently will not be made available to you, the American people. Also in addition to all this, the document shows that Huma Abedin was allowed to take five boxes of physical files from the State Department, some of which were described as, quote, \"Muslim engagement documents.\"   This is beyond outrageous and it shows that there is a different set of rules and standards for the Clintons and their allies, a two-tiered justice system we have been talking about and warning you about. Make no mistake, it shouldn't be surprising, because it's all part of a pattern when it comes to the Clintons, the fix is in all the time. The fix is against Bernie. The fix is in here. The fix is on other issues. Removing, destroying documents, that's now just part of Clinton standard operating procedures. Now, remember, Clinton on her own, 33,000 subpoenaed emails from her personal server. Remember, she deleted them, she acid watched them, she used Bleach Bit. And guess what, her aides were smashing mobile devices with hammers. And by the way, they gave the other mobile device to the FBI. It didn't have a SIM card. It was useless. Why? Because Clinton claims they were personal between her and her husband who doesn't email. And it was about a wedding, a funeral and yoga and grandkids. Bill Clinton doesn't use email. Here is another wrinkle to this scandal that is disturbing that needs to be investigated. According to documents that Judicial Watch received, Clinton's calls, her schedules were blocked from being made public and were allowed to be removed. Well, that's interesting when you consider this article from the AP in August of 2016. The headline, many donors to Clinton Foundation met with her at state. And the article goes on to detail, quote, \"At least 85 of 154 people from private interest who met or who had phone conversations scheduled with Clinton while she led the State Department, they all donated to her family charity or pledged commitments to its international programs according to a review of State Department calendars released so far to the AP, combined the 85 donors contributed as much as $156 million. And at least 40 donated more than $100,000 each and 20 gave more than $1 million.\"  So, is that why Clinton and Abedin wanted to remove records of Hillary's calls and schedules? This would have come out in the campaign and people would have been asking good questions? Now, Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton, he will be here in just a few minutes.   Also tonight breaking, investigative reporter Sara Carter is out with damning new details on this controversial NSA surveillance program that may have been used to collect information on Americans without a warrant. These people not hear of our U.S. Constitution against unreasonable search and seizure? That would be number four. Sara Carter reporting that numerous former intelligence law enforcement officials are now blowing the whistle on this potentially dangerous conduct in the way your government is conducting surveillance. And this is getting scary. According to the report, well, the officials, they were concerned over a practice that is known as reverse targeting, which, quote, \"Occurs when intelligence and law enforcement officials use a foreign person as a legal pretense for their intended target, an American citizen.\" In other words, without a warrant. In other words, illegal. In other words, no Constitution. No Fourth Amendment. Now, Sara Carter will also join us in a moment to explain how this practice may have been used as a political weapon. How often have you heard me talk about weaponizing our intelligence community? Weaponizing the system of justice we have in this country, dual system of justice.  Now, also tonight, we have breaking information about how the anti-Trump, pro-Clinton text messages from that FBI agent Peter Strzok and his FBI lawyer girlfriend Lisa Page were discovered. DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz is now revealing that his office requested those text messages from government issued cell phones of several FBI employees that handled the Clinton email case, in this particular case, there are more than 10,000 of them, text messages between Strzok and his girlfriend, Page. Well, as of now, 375 -- that's it -- Fox News was able to obtain, just those show a severe anti-Trump/pro-Hillary Clinton bias. Now, these text messages include calling Trump a loathsome human being, an idiot. Strzok and Page also disparaging and mocking Trump supporters. And that is just the start of it. Now, here is what is raising all kinds of red flags and it should. In August of 2016, Strzok texted, \"I want to believe the path you threw out for consideration in Andy's office, that there is no way he gets elected but I'm afraid we can't take that risk. It's like an insurance policy in the unlikely event you die before you're 40.\"  Fox News believes -- we haven't confirmed yet -- that Andy in that message is Andrew McCabe. That would be the deputy FBI director. That's the same guy whose wife Jill got $700,000 in donations from Democrats, including Terry McAuliffe up to his eyeballs in this, during a 2015 Virginia State Senate run. That's an obscene amount of money for that race.  We also have this exchange. Now, we edited out the middle of it which contained a web link and Page says, \"Maybe you are meant to stay where you are because you're meant to protect the country from that menace.\" Wow! Isn't that great to take that all upon themselves? Strzok replies, \"Thanks. It's absolutely true that we're both very fortunate and, of course, I will try and approach it that way. I just know it will be tough at times. I can protect our country at many levels, not sure if that helps.\" Now, why would Strzok, why would his girlfriend Page and who we now think is Andrew McCabe, need an insurance policy against Donald Trump if he is on his way to win the election? What exactly did that mean? Now, Judicial Watch just announced that it has filed a lawsuit to gain access to all the FBI records about the removal of Strzok from the Mueller investigation.  Here's what the deal is. You, the American people. You deserve answers. There's a lot at stake here. There is all wreaks of this deep state we have been telling you about, and their effort to undermine a candidate that then became president. And the Wall Street Journal is reporting that this apparent meeting between Strzok, Page and McCabe happened during the same time the FBI started its counter-intelligence investigation into, quote, \"possible Trump/Russia ties.\" And as we have been telling you, this FBI agent Peter Strzok, is tied to everything. And his FBI lawyer girlfriend also served on Robert Mueller's team.   Here's what we know about Strzok. Before being demoted from Mueller's investigation, he was a top counter intelligence official, he was the guy that actually signed the document that kicked off the Russian investigation. Strzok's team also oversaw the handling of the anti-Trump dossier, the Russian propaganda, when it was given to the FBI. He was in charge of the interview of former National Security Adviser Lieutenant General Michael Flynn. And this is where it gets really interesting. Giving Strzok's anti-Trump/pro-Hillary text messages, he also played a pivotal role in this Clinton email exoneration so-called investigation. Now, this includes sitting in on Hillary's FBI interview. Remember, that was in July. In May, they were already writing the exoneration. He was also in the room for the interviews with key Clinton aides Huma Abedin and Cheryl Mills. And this is the most damning piece of information when it comes to Strzok. He is the guy, he is the one that actually changed the legal standard language in James Comey's exoneration statement about Hillary Clinton from \"grossly negligent\" to \"extreme carelessness.\" Well, that allowed Hillary Clinton a get out of jail free card. That allowed the fix to be in from the get-go even though we know she broke the law. What in God's name is Robert Mueller thinking to have ever put together this abusively biased, this corrupt FBI agent and so many other people that have agendas on his so-called investigative team? Mueller claims to have, oh, impeccable integrity, a sterling reputation. Why would anybody allow that to happen?  And then, again, that all seems to make sense when you consider all the Democratic donors that Mueller has handpicked to be part of the investigation. Now, these investigators have given over 50 grand in cash to Democrats, including Barack Obama and, you guessed it, Hillary Clinton. Just one donated to a Republican and none of them gave any money to the Trump campaign.  This entire investigation is corrupt to its core. It has now become a witch hunt and it's now the time where Jeff Sessions needs to do his job. It's time for you the American people to understand this. According to a new poll, 54 percent say, Robert Mueller has a conflict of interest because of his friendship -- he's BFF with James Comey. And as we have been telling you, these two are best friends, and as Fox News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett has pointed out on many an occasions, their relationship could also actually be a violation of the law. Calling Attorney General Sessions: Where are you? Step up and do your job.   Joining us now the President of Judicial Watch Tom Fitton, investigative journalist Sara Carter, Fox News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett. We will start with you, Gregg. Where do you begin when you read this Comey exoneration written early May? She doesn't get interviewed until July. Others don't get interviewed. The fix was in.",

We know that Comey testified about this just before he was fired. And he adamantly stated that we never did anything illegal. But the problem is when the fifth courts, when the foreign intelligence surveillance courts took a look at this, they said wait a minute, no, you mishandled this program and you were actually using it as a back door without a warrant and one out of 20 searches, upstream data searches were done inappropriately and they even said, they think it was far greater than that.   The only reason why these intelligence officials and law enforcement officials, Sean, came forward is because they were so concerned after what happened with President Trump and his team.

      "utterance": "And welcome to \"Hannity.\" And this is a Fox News alert. James Comey, the former FBI director is in huge legal trouble tonight. We have major breaking news. Fox News has now obtained the draft of James Comey's exoneration statement about the Clinton server investigation remember before the investigation was even completed. We now know that the legal term grossly negligent was changed to extreme carelessness in two specific places. Also, the word likely was removed from a section where Comey talked about foreign actors actually gaining access to top secrets, special access program information on her server. Plus, explosive new information about how the Obama State Department actually gave Hillary Clinton and her top aide Huma Abedin special treatment. Now Judicial Watch is obtained documents that show Clinton and Abedin were allowed to actually physically remove electronic records from the State Department that they claim were quote, \"unclassified and personal.\" Also Sara Carter is here tonight with a new bombshell report about the FBI using an NSA surveillance program to spy on the American people. Also, we have new details on how the anti-Trump, pro-Clinton text messages from the FBI agent Peter Strzok and his FBI lawyer girlfriend Lisa Page were discovered. And according to a brand new poll a majority of you, the American people, believe that Special Counsel Robert Mueller's tainted and corrupt investigation is biased. We have been telling you the rest of the media needs to catch up. That's happening right in this breaking news opening monologue. All right. A major development in the Clinton server scandal. You've got to pay close attention tonight. This is going to be a blockbuster hour. We here at Fox News have obtained the draft of James Comey's exoneration statement that let Hillary Clinton off the hook as it relates to the email server. The document shows that the term \"grossly negligent\" was, in fact, changed to \"extreme carelessness\" in two places. Remember, grossly negligent is the legal standard which would have meant that Clinton broke the law. And here's the other piece of new information. In the part where Comey was talking about foreign actors accessing Clinton's server, the word \"likely accessed\" was removed. This is national security. All of this continues to prove that the fix was in from the very beginning of what is a farce of an investigation. There was the exoneration before the investigation was anywhere near concluded. And here's why. The draft statement is from May 2, 2016. Hillary and others in her case wasn't interviewed by the FBI until the Fourth of July weekend. So, how could Comey, how could this Hillary-loving, Trump-hating FBI agent Peter Strzok, reach any conclusion about Clinton's server investigation two months before they even interviewed her or other key people? The fix was in. Plain and simple. We now have the evidence. And Fox News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett says what we just laid out could mean James Comey is guilty of obstruction of justice. That is a crime. That is a felony. We'll hear from him coming up later in the program. Also tonight, Judicial Watch has uncovered an absolutely bombshell report about the special treatment that Hillary Clinton and her top aide Huma Abedin were given by the Obama State Department. We now have documents that were obtained through the Freedom of Information Act, it shows that Clinton and her top aide, they were given permission by the State Department to remove both electronic and physical records that they claim were, quote, \"personal\" and, quote, \"unclassified\" and non-recorded materials. According to Judicial Watch, this includes records of Hillary Clinton's calls, her schedules, which conveniently will not be made available to you, the American people. Also in addition to all this, the document shows that Huma Abedin was allowed to take five boxes of physical files from the State Department, some of which were described as, quote, \"Muslim engagement documents.\" This is beyond outrageous and it shows that there is a different set of rules and standards for the Clintons and their allies, a two-tiered justice system we have been talking about and warning you about. Make no mistake, it shouldn't be surprising, because it's all part of a pattern when it comes to the Clintons, the fix is in all the time. The fix is against Bernie. The fix is in here. The fix is on other issues. Removing, destroying documents, that's now just part of Clinton standard operating procedures. Now, remember, Clinton on her own, 33,000 subpoenaed emails from her personal server. Remember, she deleted them, she acid watched them, she used Bleach Bit. And guess what, her aides were smashing mobile devices with hammers. And by the way, they gave the other mobile device to the FBI. It didn't have a SIM card. It was useless. Why? Because Clinton claims they were personal between her and her husband who doesn't email. And it was about a wedding, a funeral and yoga and grandkids. Bill Clinton doesn't use email. Here is another wrinkle to this scandal that is disturbing that needs to be investigated. According to documents that Judicial Watch received, Clinton's calls, her schedules were blocked from being made public and were allowed to be removed. Well, that's interesting when you consider this article from the AP in August of 2016. The headline, many donors to Clinton Foundation met with her at state. And the article goes on to detail, quote, \"At least 85 of 154 people from private interest who met or who had phone conversations scheduled with Clinton while she led the State Department, they all donated to her family charity or pledged commitments to its international programs according to a review of State Department calendars released so far to the AP, combined the 85 donors contributed as much as $156 million. And at least 40 donated more than $100,000 each and 20 gave more than $1 million.\" So, is that why Clinton and Abedin wanted to remove records of Hillary's calls and schedules? This would have come out in the campaign and people would have been asking good questions? Now, Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton, he will be here in just a few minutes. Also tonight breaking, investigative reporter Sara Carter is out with damning new details on this controversial NSA surveillance program that may have been used to collect information on Americans without a warrant. These people not hear of our U.S. Constitution against unreasonable search and seizure? That would be number four. Sara Carter reporting that numerous former intelligence law enforcement officials are now blowing the whistle on this potentially dangerous conduct in the way your government is conducting surveillance. And this is getting scary. According to the report, well, the officials, they were concerned over a practice that is known as reverse targeting, which, quote, \"Occurs when intelligence and law enforcement officials use a foreign person as a legal pretense for their intended target, an American citizen.\" In other words, without a warrant. In other words, illegal. In other words, no Constitution. No Fourth Amendment. Now, Sara Carter will also join us in a moment to explain how this practice may have been used as a political weapon. How often have you heard me talk about weaponizing our intelligence community? Weaponizing the system of justice we have in this country, dual system of justice. Now, also tonight, we have breaking information about how the anti-Trump, pro-Clinton text messages from that FBI agent Peter Strzok and his FBI lawyer girlfriend Lisa Page were discovered. DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz is now revealing that his office requested those text messages from government issued cell phones of several FBI employees that handled the Clinton email case, in this particular case, there are more than 10,000 of them, text messages between Strzok and his girlfriend, Page. Well, as of now, 375 -- that's it -- Fox News was able to obtain, just those show a severe anti-Trump/pro-Hillary Clinton bias. Now, these text messages include calling Trump a loathsome human being, an idiot. Strzok and Page also disparaging and mocking Trump supporters. And that is just the start of it. Now, here is what is raising all kinds of red flags and it should. In August of 2016, Strzok texted, \"I want to believe the path you threw out for consideration in Andy's office, that there is no way he gets elected but I'm afraid we can't take that risk. It's like an insurance policy in the unlikely event you die before you're 40.\" Fox News believes -- we haven't confirmed yet -- that Andy in that message is Andrew McCabe. That would be the deputy FBI director. That's the same guy whose wife Jill got $700,000 in donations from Democrats, including Terry McAuliffe up to his eyeballs in this, during a 2015 Virginia State Senate run. That's an obscene amount of money for that race. We also have this exchange. Now, we edited out the middle of it which contained a web link and Page says, \"Maybe you are meant to stay where you are because you're meant to protect the country from that menace.\" Wow! Isn't that great to take that all upon themselves? Strzok replies, \"Thanks. It's absolutely true that we're both very fortunate and, of course, I will try and approach it that way. I just know it will be tough at times. I can protect our country at many levels, not sure if that helps.\" Now, why would Strzok, why would his girlfriend Page and who we now think is Andrew McCabe, need an insurance policy against Donald Trump if he is on his way to win the election? What exactly did that mean? Now, Judicial Watch just announced that it has filed a lawsuit to gain access to all the FBI records about the removal of Strzok from the Mueller investigation. Here's what the deal is. You, the American people. You deserve answers. There's a lot at stake here. There is all wreaks of this deep state we have been telling you about, and their effort to undermine a candidate that then became president. And the Wall Street Journal is reporting that this apparent meeting between Strzok, Page and McCabe happened during the same time the FBI started its counter-intelligence investigation into, quote, \"possible Trump/Russia ties.\" And as we have been telling you, this FBI agent Peter Strzok, is tied to everything. And his FBI lawyer girlfriend also served on Robert Mueller's team. Here's what we know about Strzok. Before being demoted from Mueller's investigation, he was a top counter intelligence official, he was the guy that actually signed the document that kicked off the Russian investigation. Strzok's team also oversaw the handling of the anti-Trump dossier, the Russian propaganda, when it was given to the FBI. He was in charge of the interview of former National Security Adviser Lieutenant General Michael Flynn. And this is where it gets really interesting. Giving Strzok's anti-Trump/pro-Hillary text messages, he also played a pivotal role in this Clinton email exoneration so-called investigation. Now, this includes sitting in on Hillary's FBI interview. Remember, that was in July. In May, they were already writing the exoneration. He was also in the room for the interviews with key Clinton aides Huma Abedin and Cheryl Mills. And this is the most damning piece of information when it comes to Strzok. He is the guy, he is the one that actually changed the legal standard language in James Comey's exoneration statement about Hillary Clinton from \"grossly negligent\" to \"extreme carelessness.\" Well, that allowed Hillary Clinton a get out of jail free card. That allowed the fix to be in from the get-go even though we know she broke the law. What in God's name is Robert Mueller thinking to have ever put together this abusively biased, this corrupt FBI agent and so many other people that have agendas on his so-called investigative team? Mueller claims to have, oh, impeccable integrity, a sterling reputation. Why would anybody allow that to happen? And then, again, that all seems to make sense when you consider all the Democratic donors that Mueller has handpicked to be part of the investigation. Now, these investigators have given over 50 grand in cash to Democrats, including Barack Obama and, you guessed it, Hillary Clinton. Just one donated to a Republican and none of them gave any money to the Trump campaign. This entire investigation is corrupt to its core. It has now become a witch hunt and it's now the time where Jeff Sessions needs to do his job. It's time for you the American people to understand this. According to a new poll, 54 percent say, Robert Mueller has a conflict of interest because of his friendship -- he's BFF with James Comey. And as we have been telling you, these two are best friends, and as Fox News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett has pointed out on many an occasions, their relationship could also actually be a violation of the law."

Sara Carter, let me go to you. This is blockbuster. We are talking about the Fourth Amendment, the illegal search and seizure.

But what they have done is they used it as a back door. The FBI uses that as a back door to do warrantless searches on Americans. And this is a huge problem. I mean, they have admitted to it. We know that Comey testified about this just before he was fired. And he adamantly stated that we never did anything illegal. But the problem is when the fifth courts, when the foreign intelligence surveillance courts took a look at this, they said wait a minute, no, you mishandled this program and you were actually using it as a back door without a warrant and one out of 20 searches, upstream data searches were done inappropriately and they even said, they think it was far greater than that. The only reason why these intelligence officials and law enforcement officials, Sean, came forward is because they were so concerned after what happened with President Trump and his team. Particularly the unmasking and the revelations that people on Obama's -- in Obama's administration have requested all of this information, they thought it was important that this be exposed."

And, frankly, I think it puts an enormous amount of pressure on the Attorney General. Because I think Attorney General Sessions has an absolute obligation to look at this information and begin to think about how they are going to prosecute Comey and how they are going to prosecute all of these other senior FBI agents who clearly, based on their text messages back and forth. And including, by the way, I think, a great deal of his yet unreported guilt in terms of the chief deputy whose wife had gotten I think $900 from the Democrats and yet who were still engaged in all of this. I mean, you have here a cesspool of corruption, covering up for the Clintons in a way which I would have to as a historian is unimaginable. I do not know of any point in American history where you have this level of a system of corruption. We have had occasional attorney generals. We had one under Harding. We had one under Grant. Did you go back and find individuals who were crooks. But this level of constant methodical undermining of the rule of law? People who thought it was their job to save America? I mean, when you are talking about law enforcement officials who decide they will impose their version on the American people, you are talking about something very scary. Something which totally undermines the American system."

Because on a level far deeper than Watergate ever was here, there is corruption at the highest levels. This is no longer paranoia. It's provable fact that the fix was in here. You have James Comey. Then you have the pro-Hillary, anti-Trump, Peter Strzok and then his girlfriend Lisa Page, yeah, they are the ones going to save America with what they are doing, but this exoneration of Hillary Clinton, when you take out the word likely foreign actors were able to access her email account, to cover up a foreign a national security breach in this country, then when you take the actual legal language gross negligence and remove that and put in and try to be cute and put in extreme carelessness, I don't even know what to say.

But, imagine that the reverse had happened. Imagine that, they had allowed the law to follow its natural course. Imagine that you had gotten a report last summer, the summer of 2016 by Director Comey saying, well, you know, it's likely that foreign agents did get to her accounts, because of the way she had handled them and the way she had broken the rules. It is clear that she was guilty of gross negligence, which, in fact, is as a technical term meaning that she had broken the law. And if he had said, therefore, I am recommending that she be prosecuted. I mean, you would have blown the whole campaign wide open at that point. You probably would have had Trump winning with 55 or 60 percent of the vote. You would have had a shattering of the Democratic Party. All of this is -- I literally and I will challenge anybody in our audience to find me a case where you have this kind of methodical corruption. This violation of the rule of law at this level of bureaucracy. Not the political appointees at the very top. The people who have spent their career who are sworn to uphold the law.

Let me just stay on what he is exonerating here. Because we know the mishandling of classified top secret, special access programming information, we know that was on that server and a mom and pop shop bathroom, closet by the way. We know that she destroyed such information. We know that she lied when she said she didn't have this information on there. That she didn't send a receipt. That is been debunked. Then you have the whole thing about deleting 33,000 subpoenaed emails. Then you have the acid wash and the use of bleach bit, most Americans had never heard of it before. Then you have an aide busting up devices, blackberries and the like with hammers and the only thing they turn over to the FBI in terms of a device is one without a sim card, rendering it useless for the FBI. Now, that sounds to me. It is obvious that laws were broken here. And that we now know five foreign agencies tapped into that particular server that compromised national security.

First of all, the Obama administration didn't have the authority to violate law by having this kind of a deal. Second, this is a whole new zone that just showed up during the day today as a report of a special arrangement that she had made to be able to take all this stuff away, even though it was illegal in terms of the security."

Part one is Hillary and the entire gang from the foundation through her aides, et cetera, that is got to be reopened. Part two is the level of corruption and dishonesty in the FBI and the Justice Department. That is an entire new case. Both of these cases, I think the congress has to insist and, frankly, Attorney General Sessions has to insist that both of these are going to be pursued not as a matter of vengeance. Not to go after people, but because the rule of law, the very base of the American system requires that we take seriously when powerful people are corrupted. And you have both a Clinton corruption and Comey FBI corruption, those are two separate cases. They both have to be brought to light and people have to be prosecuted."

It's time for the Attorney General to step up to the plate and do his job. He has no excuse as somebody who I know believes in the law. He has no excuse for hiding he has to set up a Clinton investigation. He has to set up an FBI Justice Department investigation. This is his obligation under the law to enforce it and to protect the American people. And Jeff Sessions has nowhere to hide on this. He can't recuse himself. He can't say he is not involved.

To your point about the text messages I think Peter Strzok should have been removed, but he also exchanged text messages about Bernie Sanders who I believe is a liberal. Eric Holder also liberal. Chelsea Clinton mega liberal. This is not just about Trump."

This is not a knock on the rank and file FBI. I worked with them and women, by the way, they are wonderful. But this case is a sham. Joe Scarborough by the way should be embarrassed. I know Jim Jordan well. Jim Scarborough couldn't wipe Jim Jordan's nose if he had a cold. Sean, this is a critical question right now, which, by the way, honorable man Jim Jordan has asked. Was this dossier used to spy on Americans or not? Have you noticed, Sean? Nobody could answer the question. Rod Rosenstein said oh, I have the answer, but I can't answer it. That is the critical question and thank god people like Jim Jordan are asking it right now."

He has now been accused by half the American people and propagandize on a regular basis that he collaborated and colluded with the Russians to alter the elections."
