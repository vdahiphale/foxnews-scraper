All 100 Senators will get a copy. Have time to review it, but then, he is steaming ahead with an up or down vote he says this week. And that may be because of what we've just learned moments ago, that this FBI report could be delivered to the White House as soon as tomorrow, that from our colleague John Roberts. Dr. Ford's legal team has just fired off a letter to the FBI demanding that they talk to the agency. But sources are telling us she and Kavanaugh may not be interviewed because they've already given hours of testimony. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer who opposed Kavanaugh even before any of these allegations came out, complained today about this moving too fast. Claimed his side was blocked from a call with the White House counsel about the scope of the FBI probe. Republicans say that's false.   He also raised eyebrows by saying, \"If Democrats take back the majority he'll look at raising the threshold for Supreme Court nominations back to 60 votes. When remember, it was Harry Reid who lowered it to 51. Schumer, knows moderate Democrats are now on the griddle. Heidi Heitkamp, North Dakota now trailing her Republican opponent one poll by 10 points in North Dakota. A poll by the conservative Judicial Crisis Network found 56 percent of North Dakotans want Kavanaugh confirmed. While in West Virginia, Democrat Joe Manchin has to deal with the fact that the same conservative poll found 58 percent of voters in his state want a yes vote on Kavanaugh. But, two key moderate Republicans, Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski who haven't run into one another on an elevator as reporters swarm them today are not tipping their hands. That's why Jeff Flakes vote is so critical.  He did say today he understands why someone who thinks they've been falsely accused would lash out.  But then, he said it was a mistake for Kavanaugh to get so combative and that troubles him because he said the Supreme Court is one of the last institutions Americans have faith in. Watch.",

It was received and detected at a federal mail sorting facility yesterday but the Secret Service will not tell us at least yet which facility that was. The letter did contain the very same substance as two letters sent to the Pentagon yesterday and those letters tested positive for ricin. As you noted the first letters were addressed to Defense Secretary James Madison and Admiral John Richardson. He is the Chief of Naval Operations.  They were intercepted at a mail screening facility in the Pentagon compound but the envelopes did not enter the main Pentagon building. Tonight that mail facility remains under quarantine and there is still no word yet if all three letters are connected but they are being examined by FBI forensic teams. If you don't know, ricin is a naturally occurring substance that's found in castor beans but it takes a deliberate and precise act to turn them into biological weapons. It can either be used in the form of a powder, a pellet, a mist, or acid and it can be inhaled, injected, or ingested.  Experts say within 36 to 48 hours -- 48 hours it'll begin to shut down major organs. There is no antidote but you should know it's not always fatal and of course, children are more at risk than adults. Remember, in 2013 letters testing positive for ricin were addressed to a Mississippi Senator, a Mississippi Judge, and President Obama. All three envelopes were intercepted and the man who sent that letter is now in prison. And of course shortly after 9/11, letters containing anthrax were mailed to the offices of two senators and some media outlets, those threats also intercepted. As we find out more about this sorting facility that intercepted the letter intended for President Trump, we'll get back to you.  Martha?",

      "speaker": "ED HENRY, FOX NEWS",
      "utterance": "Martha, great to see you.  Breaking tonight, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell is now telling Senators in both parties, expect a report from the FBI very soon. All 100 Senators will get a copy. Have time to review it, but then, he is steaming ahead with an up or down vote he says this week. And that may be because of what we've just learned moments ago, that this FBI report could be delivered to the White House as soon as tomorrow, that from our colleague John Roberts. Dr. Ford's legal team has just fired off a letter to the FBI demanding that they talk to the agency. But sources are telling us she and Kavanaugh may not be interviewed because they've already given hours of testimony. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer who opposed Kavanaugh even before any of these allegations came out, complained today about this moving too fast. Claimed his side was blocked from a call with the White House counsel about the scope of the FBI probe. Republicans say that's false. He also raised eyebrows by saying, \"If Democrats take back the majority he'll look at raising the threshold for Supreme Court nominations back to 60 votes. When remember, it was Harry Reid who lowered it to 51. Schumer, knows moderate Democrats are now on the griddle. Heidi Heitkamp, North Dakota now trailing her Republican opponent one poll by 10 points in North Dakota. A poll by the conservative Judicial Crisis Network found 56 percent of North Dakotans want Kavanaugh confirmed. While in West Virginia, Democrat Joe Manchin has to deal with the fact that the same conservative poll found 58 percent of voters in his state want a yes vote on Kavanaugh. But, two key moderate Republicans, Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski who haven't run into one another on an elevator as reporters swarm them today are not tipping their hands. That's why Jeff Flakes vote is so critical.  He did say today he understands why someone who thinks they've been falsely accused would lash out. But then, he said it was a mistake for Kavanaugh to get so combative and that troubles him because he said the Supreme Court is one of the last institutions Americans have faith in. Watch."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "HENRY",
      "utterance": "But, if the FBI finds nothing new, remember, what Flake's said Friday morning, \"Our system of justice affords a presumption of innocence of the accused, absent corroborating evidence. That is what binds us,\" he said, \"to the rule of law. While some may argue a different standard should apply regarding the Senate's advice and consent. I believe that the constitution provisions of fairness and due process apply as well, I will vote.\" Remember Flake, said then to confirm Judge Kavanaugh. So, if the FBI, Martha, finds no corroborating evidence for any of these allegations, it will be a remarkable flip-flop for Flake to suddenly suggest the presumption of innocence is less important. Martha."

That was a sequence of events. The nomination was made, the Democrats came out almost unanimously against it immediately before any hearings, before any inquiries of any kind. Then, during the course of the hearings that his record as a judge which you would think would be the most important thing when almost unremarked upon. No questions about it, no criticisms about it, none of that to speak of, almost nothing. Then, after the hearings were over, these unverified allegations leaked out. Not to mention, of course, the fact as I mentioned earlier that he'd been called evil by at least one Democrat on the Judiciary Committee -- three of whom, by the way.

Please, not to mention the fact that The Times had to put out an editor's note later in the day or a statement by its P.R. representative that one of the people whose bylines is on that story is a woman named Emily Bazelon. She is a liberal activist, she's up at Yale and she came out on virtually the day that the Kavanaugh nomination was announced on Twitter and said that he must be resisted because he'd be a fifth vote to turn the Supreme Court hard to the right. So, she was a committed anti-Kavanaugh partisan. And here she is with writing stories for the New York Times about his nomination.

This is a note that reportedly he wrote -- Brett Kavanaugh wrote. But it says, it's signed by Bart. I don't know if that was a nickname. But it says, it would -- and is sort of informing all of his friends about the plan for Beach Week and he's outlining whatever one needs to bring and all of this stuff.

      "speaker": "TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS",
      "utterance": "Hi, Martha! The Secret Service is now confirming the last letter was addressed to President Trump but did not make it into the White House or near the White House. It was received and detected at a federal mail sorting facility yesterday but the Secret Service will not tell us at least yet which facility that was. The letter did contain the very same substance as two letters sent to the Pentagon yesterday and those letters tested positive for ricin. As you noted the first letters were addressed to Defense Secretary James Madison and Admiral John Richardson. He is the Chief of Naval Operations.  They were intercepted at a mail screening facility in the Pentagon compound but the envelopes did not enter the main Pentagon building. Tonight that mail facility remains under quarantine and there is still no word yet if all three letters are connected but they are being examined by FBI forensic teams. If you don't know, ricin is a naturally occurring substance that's found in castor beans but it takes a deliberate and precise act to turn them into biological weapons. It can either be used in the form of a powder, a pellet, a mist, or acid and it can be inhaled, injected, or ingested.  Experts say within 36 to 48 hours -- 48 hours it'll begin to shut down major organs. There is no antidote but you should know it's not always fatal and of course, children are more at risk than adults. Remember, in 2013 letters testing positive for ricin were addressed to a Mississippi Senator, a Mississippi Judge, and President Obama. All three envelopes were intercepted and the man who sent that letter is now in prison. And of course shortly after 9/11, letters containing anthrax were mailed to the offices of two senators and some media outlets, those threats also intercepted. As we find out more about this sorting facility that intercepted the letter intended for President Trump, we'll get back to you.  Martha?"

So also tonight we are just five short weeks now from the midterm elections and the fate of a few deep red state Senate Democrats could hinge on how they vote on Judge Kavanaugh.  It's a rock in a hard place. They either defy their liberal base or they alienate the Republican majority in their state. One of those on the bubble is North Dakota Senator Heidi Heitkamp who will not commit at this point either way. She is now down six points to her GOP challenger Kevin Cramer. And in Indiana Senator Joe Donnelly who now wants to see the FBI report before he decides how he's going to vote. He has a two-point lead. He originally said he would vote no, then he said he would wait and see the FBI report and the numbers as well, no doubt. In Missouri critical swing vote Claire McCaskill is the virtual tie -- in a virtual tie with her Republican challenger Josh Hawley.

The reason in these red states, Democrats are within the margin of error across the board is because of Donald Trump. The fact that according to the Fox News poll he is running at 30 or what, 35 percent believe he cares about people like them, and The Wall Street Journal poll showed that 53 percent including majority of Republicans want a check and balance on the President."

Donald Trump and his failing standings in the poll and has failed policies, that is what's giving -- that that's what's giving these Democrats a boost because the country wants a check and balance and these states show they want to check and balance on the Trump administration."

Certainly this incident there, given the nearness of it, the danger of it, something like that could escalate where our captain felt necessary to fire a warning shot, they'd fire back, next thing you know, we're using bigger weapons because one of our ships has been hit. So that's the concern that we have about something like that. But the larger issue, it was identified in the Trump team's national security strategy and national defense strategy when I think they set the current strategic framework very accurately and described that has a return to big power competition with China and Russia and specifically identified China as the long-term strategic threat to the United States national interest and to the security of the American people. And the reality is, China is conducting something they described as unrestricted warfare. And it's a doctrine that they have imposed on themselves and it gives them, in their minds, is their means to use anything that's available to them to gain influence over adversary countries. All the means available short of war. So economic warfare that should have--"

And to a certain extent, the United States but much more significant in the region. Where they are undermining the government, disrupting civil societies, they are actually buying up newspapers so they can gain influence. One of the countries they are doing this rather significantly is far away as Australia. It's not exactly a country that is tangential to China but it's in the region and they want influence. The most rapid military buildup in the world today is being done not by the United States and the Trump defense budget, which we all applaud, but by China. Rebuilding their ground forces, the maritime forces are at parity with us now in the Pacific and they are going to l go right past us in capability. Deep water ports in Pakistan and also in Djibouti, why, influence the Middle East from Djibouti, influence the Indian Ocean from Pakistan. They have put in writing they want to dominate the Asia-Pacific in a near term, and in 20 years be the preeminent global power replacing the United States.

Now that's fantasy, like the Russia explanation, but more than that, and more upsetting is that nobody, -- by the way, this includes some of the Republican leadership, has thought to why this happened. And of course it happened because the people in charge on Election Day in 2016 made a bunch of bad decisions and voters are mad about it.

Atticus Finch didn't hash tag, believe all women. He didn't take an accusation at face value. He defended an alleged rapist vigorously and unremittingly, making use of every other opportunity provided to him by the norms of the Anglo-America system of justice.

Can you think of any? Did any come to mind? Like, what the NAACP founded in response to this? I think it was. How quickly we forget. Look, this moment will all be gone. People running things will be gone. Our grandchildren will still be here, one hopes, living in a country where people are not punished until they have been proved to have committed a crime.

Also probably the most patriotic campus I've seen other than our service academies. They love our veterans and our military. But I had a chance to talk to some of the students and ask them as a college student right now, in light of what you are seeing with the Brett Kavanaugh conversation, how do you feel about these allegations and the conversation being had?

I feel very differently about the things -- that John Hughes movies she was talking about -- now.\" Here with me now, Kat Timpf and Tom Shillue, both are Fox News contributors. And Kat had to brush up on some of her 80s movies today to keep up with it.
