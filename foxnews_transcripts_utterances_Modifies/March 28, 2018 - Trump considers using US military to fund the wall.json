      "sentences": "Great to see you, Martha. A lot of shake-ups continuing here at the White House. As you note, Navy Rear Admiral Ronnie Jackson now in as Veterans Affairs Secretary. You mentioned his proximity to the president, David Shulkin, now out. The reason why Ronnie Jackson had so much credibility when he came out in January and gave the president of clean bill of health is that he also served under then President Barack Obama seen as bipartisan, as Shulkin was seen as well -- he was an Obama holdover, but didn't quite work out that way. Lindsey Graham tweeting tonight: 'If there ever was a home run pick, Admiral Jackson fits the bill. Combat surgeon, career military officer who loves his country and will provide the highest quality health care and services to our wonderful veterans.' Now, interesting, I mentioned that bipartisan note, it didn't work out for Shulkin. He took his wife to Wimbledon on a taxpayer dime. A scathing report about that, blew up in his face because of the taxpayer dollars used, lost the confidence of the president. So, this is important now for the president to get his team in place. Shulkin now has the distinction like Rex Tillerson of being fired by tweet. The president, obviously, very active on Twitter. And also, not just on personnel moves, but policy pronouncements. You mentioned this issue of immigration, based on the Constitution, it would be hard for the president to shift money from the Pentagon that was in that omnibus spending bill, and all of a sudden, shifted over to pay for the wall. But do not underestimate the sheer will of this president to try and make it happen. This stem, of course, from two flash points with his political base that came together with that omnibus bill that he said he was reluctantly signing into law last Friday.  One, he is under great pressure to deliver on that promise, to build call what he called 'a big, beautiful wall'. And two, he tried to justify signing that bill by saying he was holding his nose over the sharp increases in money for liberal programs in exchange for a big boost in defense money. So, the president started laying the groundwork for a merger of these priorities Sunday, tweeting: 'Because of the $700 and $716 billion gotten to rebuild our military, many jobs are created, military is again rich. Building a great border wall with drugs, poison, and enemy combatants pouring into our country, is all about national defense. Build wall through 'M' -- apparently, Mexico.   Now, the president had floated to speak with Paul Ryan in private, that one way to get around Democrats like Nancy Pelosi on the wall is by sliding money from the Defense Department over to building the wall by calling it 'national defense.' It's highly unlikely, though, the speaker would give up Congress' power of the purse, you would need a separate vote to approve moving the money. Though, Sarah Sanders today suggested at the White House podium they're not quite taking no for an answer yet.",

They took about two miles of a tiny barrier that was built in the 1990s, and then now replacing it with a 30-foot high bollard. So, technically, it's not the wall the president promised in the campaign, but a piece by piece, they find a dollar here, a dollar there and keep fortifying that barrier.

It's a way for him to highlight the fact that here was the centralized campaign promise, by all accounts got him elected president. And he comes to Washington and Democrats, Republicans, the swamp, the establishment, everybody is opposed to this thing and he is pushing for it. And obviously, he comes up with the most creative, imaginative ways to try to figure out how do it. The problem is, of course, getting the military -- you know, trying to redirect money out of the DOD to building the wall, means that you're going to have to get a vote from Congress, Ed is exactly right. You can't just do that because the money that's directed to go to the Pentagon by Congress is supposed to pay for specific things. So, it's difficult, but in the meantime, while he's trying to get his way, it's a great argument to be making.",

So, you know, we can talk about this all day, we can talk -- call it great politics, we can try to, you know, show that maybe Trump is still fighting for this wall that the swamp and many, you know, majority of Americans, and the majority - and people in Washington don't want.

A scathing report about that, blew up in his face because of the taxpayer dollars used, lost the confidence of the president. So, this is important now for the president to get his team in place. Shulkin now has the distinction like Rex Tillerson of being fired by tweet. The president, obviously, very active on Twitter. And also, not just on personnel moves, but policy pronouncements. You mentioned this issue of immigration, based on the Constitution, it would be hard for the president to shift money from the Pentagon that was in that omnibus spending bill, and all of a sudden, shifted over to pay for the wall. But do not underestimate the sheer will of this president to try and make it happen. This stem, of course, from two flash points with his political base that came together with that omnibus bill that he said he was reluctantly signing into law last Friday."

So, the president started laying the groundwork for a merger of these priorities Sunday, tweeting",

Building a great border wall with drugs, poison, and enemy combatants pouring into our country, is all about national defense. Build wall through 'M' -- apparently, Mexico. Now, the president had floated to speak with Paul Ryan in private, that one way to get around Democrats like Nancy Pelosi on the wall is by sliding money from the Defense Department over to building the wall by calling it 'national defense.' It's highly unlikely, though, the speaker would give up Congress' power of the purse, you would need a separate vote to approve moving the money.

They took about two miles of a tiny barrier that was built in the 1990s, and then now replacing it with a 30-foot high bollard. So, technically, it's not the wall the president promised in the campaign, but a piece by piece, they find a dollar here, a dollar there and keep fortifying that barrier.

So, here to weigh in on all of the big news this evening: Charlie Hurt, Political Columnist at the Washington Times and a Fox News Contributor; and Adrienne Elrod, Strategic Communications Director for the Hillary Clinton Campaign and a Democratic Strategist. So, Charlie, let me start with you. He's got to build a wall, he promised it up and down, he has some supporters, you know, who are no longer supporters because they are very frustrated with the recent omnibus bill and also the wall. How's he going to do it?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHARLES HURT, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR AND POLITICAL COLUMNIST AT THE WASHINGTON TIMES",
      "utterance": "Well, first of all, you know, this idea of getting the military to pay for the wall is great politics for the president, as usual. He's got very good instincts on this. It's a way for him to highlight the fact that here was the centralized campaign promise, by all accounts got him elected president. And he comes to Washington and Democrats, Republicans, the swamp, the establishment, everybody is opposed to this thing and he is pushing for it. And obviously, he comes up with the most creative, imaginative ways to try to figure out how do it. The problem is, of course, getting the military -- you know, trying to redirect money out of the DOD to building the wall, means that you're going to have to get a vote from Congress, Ed is exactly right. You can't just do that because the money that's directed to go to the Pentagon by Congress is supposed to pay for specific things. So, it's difficult, but in the meantime, while he's trying to get his way, it's a great argument to be making."

    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yes. Obviously, you have a huge defense budget as the president pointed out, big jumps in defense. That has to go, Adrienne, to the kind of things that the president has been talking about. C-130s that, you know, come in on their nose because they don't have landing gear that works -- excuse me, that has to be the priority. But he got $1.6 billion in omnibus bill. Then, there'll be another bill that starts in October 1st. If it's going to take 20-something billion to build a small, it looks like the president is going to try to do it in bits and pieces, and just keep adding onto that budget."

      "speaker": "ADRIENNE ELROD, STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR FOR THE HILLARY CLINTON CAMPAIGN AND DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST",

I mean, the bottom line: he absolutely cannot get the spending for the wall in the current Pentagon budget because Congress did not appropriate that funding -- that is the law, that is the way the system works. So, if he actually wants to get some sort of funding for the wall in the military budget, he's got to go back to Congress, he's got to make the request and Congress has to pass it. So, you know, we can talk about this all day, we can talk -- call it great politics, we can try to, you know, show that maybe Trump is still fighting for this wall that the swamp and many, you know, majority of Americans, and the majority - and people in Washington don't want. But ultimately, he's got to go about it a different way."

You know, President Trump's administration has confronted Russia more than his predecessors have, that's an established fact now. But at the same time, President Trump has not singled out Putin, and that's by design. I think what's happening here, Trump knows that, full well, that Putin is a thug, that he's a bully, that he's manipulated world leaders, he manipulated Trump's predecessors quite successfully. I think he's itching, Martha, to be getting into a room with this guy and confront him and try to work out a relationship that could have some mutual benefit to both of our countries despite the enormous challenges that separate us from a policy perspective. And I think that's why Putin has not singled him out because he doesn't want to forfeit the opportunity by personally attacking Putin that was having -- establishing a good relationship with him when he needs him. Trump knows that evicting 60 spies or diplomats is not going to deter Putin, but he would like to see if he can work something out with him, and I think that's commendable."

But this is a tweet that the president put out this morning: 'Received message last night from Xi Jinping of China that his meeting with Kim Jong Un went very well, and that Kim looks forward to his meeting with me.

If you would've told me that 14 months ago, when Trump became president, that these two leaders would make that statement and have it recorded publicly for all the world to hear, I would be telling you that I just don't see how that could ever happen, but it is happening. Now, all that said, let's not go too far with optimism here because when Trump gets with Kim Jong Un, it's going to be about the conditions, they're going to say we want all the troops out of South Korea- U.S. troops, and will be nuclearized. We're going to say no, then they're going to come back and say stop the exercises with South Korea, we'll going to say no, but we probably be willing to negotiate frequency and scale. So, it's going to get down to that, but I'll tell you, we're in a remarkable position heading towards the summit that South Korean president is going to have and also that President Trump is going to have.

As attorney general, you investigated a couple of the elements of that and you continue to investigate a couple more.

Hawley is not -- he is learning as he goes to a certain degree, you can see that he is trying to figure out -- he's a very conservative Republican, and he's trying to figure out how to be more populous Republican in the Trump era. But maybe the best thing he has going for him is that he has a united party behind him, that the President is behind him. He does not have the problem that other Republican front runners in other states have, where he's facing some sort of a savage primary. He's got a clear shot at this. Republicans are going to pour money in, and you know why not? If there is one race in the country that Republicans can look to as their hope for holding onto the Senate, they can flip that one.

Conspiracy to commit hazing, alcohol violations, but the most serious, involuntary manslaughter is now off the table.

All this makes the Roseanne's premiere at the highest rated comedy episode on any network in almost four years. Trace Gallagher is live in our west coast newsroom with more on the return of Roseanne, hi, Trace."

      "utterance": "Hi, Martha. Not since Archie Bunker's ardent support of Richard E. Nixon, his words not mine, has a sitcom character so fully embraced the GOP President, and it is no surprise that Roseanne Barr's support of Donald Trump would show up in the voice of her TV alter ego, Roseanne Connor. Barr made it clear that even after a 20 year hiatus, her show would strive for a realistic portrait of working- class America. And the central theme of the first episode was that Roseanne and Aunt Jackie, played by Laurie Metcalf hadn't spoken since the 2016 election. Watch."

She once sought the Green Party's nomination for the presidency and has been an equal opportunity basher of the Clintons, President Bush, and President Obama. Here she is last week on Jimmy Kimmel."

      "utterance": "Of course, late night host Jimmy Kimmel, who is prominently anti-Trump is part of the reason ABC and its parent company Disney have often been criticized for being too liberal and ignoring conservative viewpoints. But analysts say 18 million plus viewers are proof that politics from both sides of the aisle can be profitable. Watch again."

      "speaker": "MIKE HUCKABEE, FBN CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "First of all, it is a nice start. I mean they at least have somebody on network television that actually voted for Donald Trump and who has -- carries the star of the show status. If they really, really want to go for diversity, let them do a show in which the real Trump voters are also portrayed. I am talking about evangelical voters, people who are pro-life, people who are pro-biblical marriage, people who are very family oriented. But this was refreshing, just to see that there was at least somebody who wasn't portrayed as a complete nutcase who was sick and tired of getting run over by (Inaudible) leads. And it ought to be a wake-up call to the entertainment industry, but I doubt they'll still get it. We see so many signs, like the movie 'I Can Only Imagine' that busted all the box office at the time when other movies were not doing so well. Let's hope this is a trend. Who knows?"

And do think it reminds a lot of families around America of the debates that they with their family and friends, and it reminded me of family. Watch this clip."

      "utterance": "But the greatest gift, and you and I were both laughing out loud when we're seeing that clip of 'All in the Family,' the greatest gift of the Roseanne's show is this, it is funny. The point is so many people today lack a sense of humor, and that's what we need so much in our culture our today so we can communicate and not be angry and mad at people all the time. That would go a long way."

      "speaker": "ASHTON KUTCHER, THE RANCH, ACTOR",
      "utterance": "I was looking on TV and there was nothing that represented the way that I grew up in the middle of the country, slightly conservative values, hard work, dust, and shaken up. And so we built the show around that idea that there is a misunderstanding of what the middle of America represents and what those values actually are."

Nobody can stop you from getting better, and nobody can stop you from trying to make something right. That's our story for tonight. We'll see back here tomorrow night. Tucker Carlson up next."
