Now obviously, the pledge is not a legally binding document. It's one step above a blood oath in a tree house made by two kids in knee socks. And we all know Donald only signs deals with escape hatches. A big fan of the prenup, his success is in maintaining a plausible way out.

If that relationship should ever sour, he could consider changing his mind.\"  Now, that does not sound like in sickness or in health.  But as we ponder Trump going third party, why not second? After all, Trump could rule as a Dem, a party that's all pantsuit, no cattle. Trump's for higher taxes, a trade war, defends Planned Parenthood and single payer. Talk about a persuasive candidate. He's turned millions of righties into lefties. So while I'm glad he signed the pledge, pledges are meant to be broken. Remember, no new taxes lasted as long as a fruit fly's puberty.   In sum, the only good pledge is the kind that polishing your wood or the one that fetches your beer at a kegger.",
