But first, joining us now is Republican Senator Rand Paul, who’s among a group of Republicans opposing the current bill, and has some ideas on how to get repeal and replacement through. Senator Paul, good to talk to you this morning. Let me start off with a tweet that the presidents in earlier, which was actually what convinced her to come on the July 4th weekend. The president tweeting, quote: If Republican senators are unable to pass what they're working on now, they should immediately repeal and then replace at a later date. The president appears to be listening to you. You mentioned this to him on Wednesday, though your colleague from Nebraska, Ben Sasse, is also claiming credit for this.

And even those 49, there's another member, Todd Young from Indiana, who when he was in the House voted for the bill, too. So, you have 50 members on record having voted for that recently.

So, if this is the route we go, then there's that opportunity. But it's quite just ingenuous I think for Senator Schumer to talk about getting together when today, right now today, we had 49 members of our folks that we put up for Senate confirmation approved. At the same point in Obama's administration on July 1st, he had 179. We have one quarter -- what Senator Schumer has often said rather disingenuously is to say it’s because we are not getting nominees. We have 133 nominees sitting in front of the Senate right now waiting to get hearings in order so they can get confirmation.

And part of that story is actually what we've accomplished on Capitol Hill. This is the first administration to get a Supreme Court justice confirmed in the first 100 days since 1881.

Will they have enough votes, though, to pass the bill? In a few minutes, we’ll be joined by Democratic Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia. But first, joining us now is Republican Senator Rand Paul, who’s among a group of Republicans opposing the current bill, and has some ideas on how to get repeal and replacement through. Senator Paul, good to talk to you this morning. Let me start off with a tweet that the presidents in earlier, which was actually what convinced her to come on the July 4th weekend. The president tweeting, quote: If Republican senators are unable to pass what they're working on now, they should immediately repeal and then replace at a later date. The president appears to be listening to you. You mentioned this to him on Wednesday, though your colleague from Nebraska, Ben Sasse, is also claiming credit for this. But Senator McConnell has said thanks, but no thanks. So, will this idea even fly?"

      "speaker": "PAUL",

Every time you add more federal money, more spending for the big government Republicans, it offends the conservatives. So, right now, this bill, which is not a repeal, has become the kitchen sink. We have nearly $200 billion in insurance bailouts. Does anybody remember us complaining that ObamaCare had insurance bailouts? We now have codified nearly $200 billion. There's $45 billion in here for opioids. So, I mean, the bill is just being lit up like a Christmas tree, full of billion-dollar ornaments, and it's not repeal. We don't repeal the regulations. We don't repeal the subsidies. Now, there are Republicans getting so weak-kneed they are saying, oh, we are afraid to repeal the taxes. What happened to these people?

    {
      "speaker": "PAUL",
      "utterance": "Well -- and I agree. When I say separate the bills, I think they could still be done concurrently. In fact, I think the moderates won't vote for repeal, a clean repeal unless they have some other bill going on simultaneously (ph). So, what I’ve suggested is (AUDIO GAP) big government spending programs from the repeal. Let's do clean repeal like we promised, and I think you can get 52 Republicans for clean repeal. You can have a simultaneous bill or a concurrent bill that they can call replace and that I think perhaps if it's big spending, they could probably get Democrats to go along with big spending. I’m not for that, but I’m saying, I want repeal to work, and the way you do it is you separate into two bills and you do it concurrently. Right now, you are right. Senate leadership is not doing that. Senate leadership is loading the bill like a Christmas tree with billion-dollar ornaments, bubbles, you name it. They’re going to spend money like there's no tomorrow on the current bill and try to buy off support. That's traditional Washington, but I’m asking for something that’s not traditional -- separate the bills."

      "speaker": "ROBERTS",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "PAUL",

That's my idea of replacement. So, it's funny, back in January, I was pushing repeal and replace because I thought Republicans believed in replacing it with the marketplace. Now, I’ve discovered that at least half of my Senate Republican colleagues think replacement means replacement with ObamaCare light more federal spending and more federal programs. I’m not for that. But I am for repeal and replace. I want to expand the amount of people to get insurance at a cheaper price. But I would do it through freedom of choice, I would do it through the marketplace, buying groups across state lines, and letting people save more money in HSAs. And I think the problem with Republicans now if they have insufficient confidence in what made America great. That's capitalism, freedom of choice, competition."

Would you sign onto the idea of working through the August recess?"

In fact, I think you could do this in the next three weeks, there are other bills out there that are sitting around that have bipartisan support. Separate repeal and replace (AUDIO GAP). If there are a big government spending programs that offend conservatives like myself, put them on some other bill, but the thing is, is you can't get conservative votes or you can get my vote (AUDIO GAP) this bill with a bunch of federal spending.

So, for example, President Obama I think wanted to help people -- more people get health care. I think ObamaCare failed, but I don't question his motives or his goodness as a person in trying to do it. In the same tone, I think Democrats that are saying thousands of people are going to die if Republicans pass their health care plan, that’s so over-the-top and so goes to sort of painting people as mean-spirited or as evil, and then you get people who are so crazed by this and obsessed that they’ll come to a baseball field and shoot people. You know, there is a problem and I think we need to both acknowledge we want the same things, but we have to argue over which economic system works best. Does capitalism work best or socialism? And let’s have those arguments and those are valid arguments, but I don't think we need to question whether each of us believe in trying to fix the system and get more people health care."

And then on top of that, we can do better through efficiencies by working and educating people that have gotten the expansion, gotten health care for the first time and up until that point in time, they were using health care basically at the emergency room. So, we need to show people and teach people and educate people how to use it effectively and efficiently, so they don’t abuse it and basically, we can save an awful lot of money there.

I want to sit down and find the product and the market and get more flexibility, hold people accountable and responsible for how they use it if it’s being given to them free. There are so many things that we can sit down and agree on. We have never been asked to get in the room. If they're not talking to me, if they are not saying, hey, Joe, what do you think, you know, then they’re not really reaching out. So, Susan Collins and some of our dear friends, we tried to sit down and meet. I think they are determined on making a vote. I would say if you don't have the 50 votes, you can get rid of the budget reconciliation, they can get rid of this piece of legislation, the repeal of ObamaCare or the Affordable Care Act. But when you start replacing it, you’re back to the process to where we have to work together. That's why the Senate is so much different than the House. It's not just a simple majority of 51. That means 60 for cloture. That means you’re going to have to get bipartisan agreement. Start working with us now, I’m willing to sit down tonight."

And he made very clear in that interview that you just had with him that he has no interest whatsoever of working on a replace bill.

This is what kicked off his campaign. This is what defined his campaign. And it shocked everyone. It shocked even Republicans. And he got accused of all sorts of things of being, you know, xenophobic and racist and all this kind of stuff. And he plowed on through and wound up beating everybody.
