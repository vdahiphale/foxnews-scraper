Coming up, my angle will explain how Joe's supposed COVID strategy, is that what we're calling it? Will keep us stuck for years in this absurd and destructive pandemic paranoia. Plus, Raymond Arroyo brings us weekend at Biden's in tonight, Seen and Unseen. What does old Joe forget this time? We'll reveal. And I went to Ohio State University where students told me, they're actually scared to reveal their political views on campus. Dinesh D'Souza knows a lot about this. He's been all over the country on college campuses talking politics. What does this type of new radicalism mean for our daily lives? But first, as Joe Biden continues to phone it in and let the press do his campaigning for him, President Trump continues to demonstrate that regardless of what the polls say and you see them all over the place, he remains an unwavering political force of nature. Just over the past 72 hours, he has held massive rallies in Ohio, then to Wisconsin. Then he went live free or die in New Hampshire, and then it was up to Maine. And today, three more stops in Pennsylvania.",

And that means Laura, we're sticking to the Constitution's text, sticking to the text of the laws. And I have to tell you, I think that Judge Barrett, now Justice Barrett is going to do exactly that. But it is important that in this day and age, you can be openly pro-life. She was openly critical of Roe when she was a professor, when she was in private practice. And you know what? That's not a disqualification. It's OK to be a pro-life Catholic and be on the Supreme Court of the United States. It's OK to be openly critical of Roe. You can do that and be on the Supreme Court of the United States. This confirmation is vital for setting that principle down. She's going to be a great justice.",

Now Biden and his shut down crowd have been lying to you about COVID. The truth is, Joe's plan consists of what Trump has already done on PPE and vaccine distribution plans, along with lockdowns, tracing and tracking and mask mandates. Well, guess what? A lot of that, all of that stuff is being done in Europe and what's happened there. We'll get to that. Now, most Americans were already wearing masks. This survey comes out. 92 percent of 2200 Americans, poll said they wear face masks when leaving their home, with 74 percent saying they always do. So, given these facts, the notion that a national mass mandates going to make any difference on COVID is a ludicrous distraction from reality. And as I said, they've taken all those measures in Europe that Biden's experts are pushing extended lockdowns. And guess what's happening now in the EU? France mandated masks, put a national strategy in place, has widespread contact tracing and now a record number of new cases in France. The same thing in Spain, which actually brought in the military to do their contact tracing. But COVID is exploding there as well, and new restrictions already in place. In Germany, check this out, thousands marched in Berlin over the weekend to protest their newest coronavirus restriction as cases have search, especially in Berlin. Now, you're not going to hear this on the other cable outlets. You're not going to hear it from a lot of the experts. But Europe now has 250,000 COVID deaths, and its nation's economies are in the toilet compared to ours. Again, understand this, Europe was supposedly the gold standard and managed in COVID, now has more COVID deaths, and they've wrecked their businesses, their economies. The facts show, and so will history, that Trump was right. His approach was more balanced. Theirs was all in on lockdowns and restrictions, tracing and tracking, and still it failed miserably. The Democrats, if successful, heaven forbid, on November 3rd, if they are in there, they're never going to control the virus because that's not how viruses work. But Biden's keepers will keep inflicting untold emotional, physical, and financial harm onto millions of Americans with their strategy. We must not allow that to happen over a virus, even one as horrid and tragic and awful as this one. We need to take reasonable precautions based and real science and heed the old Churchill line, stand firm and carry on. And that's THE ANGLE.

This is the most openly pro-life justice of my lifetime, the most openly pro-life judicial nominee to the Supreme Court of my lifetime. And you know what, she didn't back away from that in her confirmation hearings. She didn't back away from any of her views, any of the things she had written. She stood her ground.

And that means Laura, we're sticking to the Constitution's text, sticking to the text of the laws. And I have to tell you, I think that Judge Barrett, now Justice Barrett is going to do exactly that. But it is important that in this day and age, you can be openly pro-life. She was openly critical of Roe when she was a professor, when she was in private practice. And you know what? That's not a disqualification. It's OK to be a pro-life Catholic and be on the Supreme Court of the United States. It's OK to be openly critical of Roe.

I mean, this has been their whole mantra here now for a long time. I mean, the Democrats were threatening the Supreme Court months ago by saying we're going to restructure you. That's their new word. They want to pack the court. They want to pack the Senate. They want to rig American democracy and basically overturn the results of the last two elections.

You know, I mean, have some guts, say yes, I want to change the court and then we can have a debate about it. But let's make no mistake, Laura, their goal here, the Democrats agenda, pack the court, pack the Senate, rig our democracy just like they rigged our economy under Obama.

That's what they want to go back to. And Biden, he's an apologist for China. He also said in that interview that he thought that Russia was our biggest threat. He can barely bring himself to name China as a competitor. I mean, this guy is totally out of touch with reality, totally in the pocket of the big corporations.

And I think part of that is a reflection of people having learned a lesson by what they saw the media put Brett Kavanaugh through and they were not about to put up with it again. So, each time these hit stories came out or these crazy attacks, people just responded by not taking the bait."

So, if they lose an election, they say it's not legitimate. If there are results from those elections, such as the confirmation of Supreme Court justices, they say those aren't legitimate. Now they're saying Amy Coney Barrett is not legitimate, but they said the exact same thing about Brett Kavanaugh, and they said the exact same thing about Neil Gorsuch. And Mitch McConnell pointed out that when it comes to norm breaking, there has been quite a history of norm breaking, unfortunately, by Democrats in the Senate, including as recently as last year or earlier this year. Chuck Schumer making a threat against Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch, sitting members of the Supreme Court. He threatened them while on the steps. He was rebuked strongly, even by liberals for it, where you have senators saying that if you don't vote the right way on a certain decision in the way that we want you to rule, we will enact retribution, we will pack the court or we will do other things to punish you.

This just supports what we've been saying for a while now. The virus is likely attenuating and we're getting a lot better at treating it.

Investors clearly don't want more lockdowns, which would obviously put the brakes on our current recovery and put tens of millions out of work. Now, think about it this way.

Now Biden and his shut down crowd have been lying to you about COVID. The truth is, Joe's plan consists of what Trump has already done on PPE and vaccine distribution plans, along with lockdowns, tracing and tracking and mask mandates. Well, guess what? A lot of that, all of that stuff is being done in Europe and what's happened there. We'll get to that. Now, most Americans were already wearing masks. This survey comes out. 92 percent of 2200 Americans, poll said they wear face masks when leaving their home, with 74 percent saying they always do. So, given these facts, the notion that a national mass mandates going to make any difference on COVID is a ludicrous distraction from reality. And as I said, they've taken all those measures in Europe that Biden's experts are pushing extended lockdowns. And guess what's happening now in the EU? France mandated masks, put a national strategy in place, has widespread contact tracing and now a record number of new cases in France. The same thing in Spain, which actually brought in the military to do their contact tracing. But COVID is exploding there as well, and new restrictions already in place. In Germany, check this out, thousands marched in Berlin over the weekend to protest their newest coronavirus restriction as cases have search, especially in Berlin. Now, you're not going to hear this on the other cable outlets. You're not going to hear it from a lot of the experts. But Europe now has 250,000 COVID deaths, and its nation's economies are in the toilet compared to ours. Again, understand this, Europe was supposedly the gold standard and managed in COVID, now has more COVID deaths, and they've wrecked their businesses, their economies. The facts show, and so will history, that Trump was right. His approach was more balanced. Theirs was all in on lockdowns and restrictions, tracing and tracking, and still it failed miserably. The Democrats, if successful, heaven forbid, on November 3rd, if they are in there, they're never going to control the virus because that's not how viruses work. But Biden's keepers will keep inflicting untold emotional, physical, and financial harm onto millions of Americans with their strategy. We must not allow that to happen over a virus, even one as horrid and tragic and awful as this one. We need to take reasonable precautions based and real science and heed the old Churchill line, stand firm and carry on. And that's THE ANGLE. Joining me now is Dr. Ramin Oskoui, cardiologist, CEO of Foxhall Cardiology, founding member of the Medicine Cabinet. Dr. Oskoui, wonderful to see you tonight."

You need herd immunity to develop, and that's going to be somewhere between about 50 and 66 percent. Young healthy individuals get COVID, they get sick, they move on with their lives for the vast, vast majority. Look at President Trump. He's 70 plus. He got COVID, he did beautifully. I think that we need to talk about the fundamental issues, vitamin D, zinc. If you're sick, quarantine. If you're fragile, vulnerable, again, stay safe, quarantine.
