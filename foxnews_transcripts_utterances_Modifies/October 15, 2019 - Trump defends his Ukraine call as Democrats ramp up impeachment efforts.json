The firefighters, both fathers to young girls, started talking to her about the polish to calm her down, and even then ask her to paint their nails. Within minutes, she did.

      "utterance": "Trump says he took $1.5 billion, and he's saying I didn't do that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "OK. This night, these 12 candidates on one stage -- I've moderated debates with eight, nine, 10. Twelve could get messy."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "YORK",
      "utterance": "Somebody is going to be unhappy. There's just no doubt about it. Either the moderators will spend too much time on the top ranked candidates or they will spend too much time on the people who have no chance. Somebody is going to be unhappy. But this is the first debate since the impeachment came up, and it's the first debate that Joe Biden wasn't the real frontrunner."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Quinnipiac has a new poll out, Q-Poll one, Elizabeth Warren at 30 percent, Joe Biden at 27, Bernie Sanders at 11. And then it's single digits all the way down. If you look at who has the best policy ideas, Elizabeth Warren 40 percent, Joe Biden 16, Bernie Sanders 12."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LIASSON",
      "utterance": "And the next is who do you think is best to beat Donald Trump? And Joe Biden is still 48 and she's about half of that. So Biden has some opportunities tonight in addition to trying to flip the script on Trump with Ukraine. He's got a big softball coming over the plate, and that's Syria. He is the only candidate on that stage with considerable foreign policy experience. He should be able to take advantage of that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "You have all of these candidates who are single digits who have to do something to change the dynamic."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "YORK",
      "utterance": "We've seen them try to do that before. Julian Castro tried to do it at an earlier debate and got into kind of an ugly mess with Biden in which Castro was actually wrong. So I expect somebody will try to do something like that. And the last thing that's different, by the way, is this is after Bernie Sanders had a heart attack and has really fallen in the polls. Not sure what he can do to try to convince people that he is the same old Bernie."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Be energetic?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LIASSON",
      "utterance": "Be energetic."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "YORK",
      "utterance": "Do some pushups. I don't know."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LIASSON",
      "utterance": "But you know what, all those single digit candidates, who do they go after? Do they go after Biden? It hasn't worked in the past. Or do they finally start going after Elizabeth Warren who has really faced very little scrutiny, hardly any attacks. I think of those candidates Pete Buttigieg is the best positioned. Remember, he raised the third largest amount of money, and he is clearly angling to be the understudy to Biden in the centrist lane should Biden collapse."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Also, first time that this has been after the Turks invaded Syria, going after the Kurds. You heard Senator Graham on the show earlier. There is an effort to try to clean this up, the vice president going over to the region with the secretary of state."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "YORK",
      "utterance": "I think the message from what Senator Graham said, you're exactly right, is we are trying to fix this, and also to deflect blame, because he was talking about this letter that President Trump wrote to Erdogan saying don't do this, now, don't do this. I think many people, Republicans and Democrats, are saying, really, do you think a letter was going to change the whole situation?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LIASSON",
      "utterance": "The president of the United States asked a NATO ally not to do something, and they did anyway? That's bad."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "YORK",
      "utterance": "Clearly, it's an effort to try to clean things up."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Will the sanctions effect Erdogan? He's already there."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LIASSON",
      "utterance": "No. These sanctions are like a slap on the wrist. Go back to the original 50 percent steel tariffs and then talk about a $100 billion trade deal. Right now Turkey does about $25 billion of trade with us. That $100 billion was aspirational. It's not like we're taking away $100 billion from Turkey."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Does this factor into this debate significantly tonight?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LIASSON",
      "utterance": "It could."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "YORK",
      "utterance": "I think there will be a lot of unanimity in criticizing President Trump. This is one way --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Although they want to bring U.S. troops home, too."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "YORK",
      "utterance": "They won't be yelling at each other. I think they will be yelling at Trump on this one."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LIASSON",
      "utterance": "Yes. And like I said, advantage for Biden if he can take advantage of it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "All right, we'll see. Thanks, guys. Coming up, we have some firefighters thinking fast and getting their nails done?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Finally tonight, an act of kindness and some really quick thinking, responding to a scene of a car crash, North Davis, Utah, Fire District Chief Alan Hadley and Captain Kevin Lloyd noticed an uninjured but very scared little girl. She was crying. She was clutching, actually, bottles of fingernail polish. The firefighters, both fathers to young girls, started talking to her about the polish to calm her down, and even then ask her to paint their nails. Within minutes, she did. The child had calmed down, and the men had snazzy new colored nails. Good job for those firefighters. Thanks for inviting us into your home tonight. That's it for the “Special Report,” fair, balanced, and unafraid. Complete wrap-up with Shannon Bream. I'll join that show as well, 11:00 p.m. Eastern Time tonight after the democratic debate. \"The Story\", hosted by Martha MacCallum in New York, starts right now.
