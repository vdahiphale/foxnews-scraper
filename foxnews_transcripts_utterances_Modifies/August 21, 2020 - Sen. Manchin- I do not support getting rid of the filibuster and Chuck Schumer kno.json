Giannulli's accepted deal calls for five months in prison, a $250,000 fine, community service, probation.

Judge Nathaniel Gorton delivering a scathing scolding to Giannulli, noting the businessman was not someone -- quote -- \"stealing bread to feed your family,\" so, roughly quoting again, \"you have no excuse for your crime, and that makes it all the more blameworthy.\" Prior to Loughlin and Giannulli, 22 defendants had been sentenced, two coaches, 20 other parents.

Eventually, the entire plane was forced to get off. JetBlue isn't making any apologies. The airline says it's updated its mass policy earlier this month, and passengers received e-mails before the flight with the latest guidance, telling FOX News children age 2 and over must wear a face covering, consistent with CDC guidelines. Now, this comes just a couple of days after a fight broke out on an American Airlines flight when a woman reportedly refused to keep her face mask on after boarding. You can see in this video several other passengers are not too happy about that choice. The woman was eventually removed from the plane.

There were problems around the world, and certainly in China. It was our president who put in the travel restrictions, and he was called a racist for doing so. Thank God he did. My point is this. It's easy during a convention, and to give a nice speech that somebody has written for you, and talk about how you're in the center. They're not in the center. They are not in the center.

So, where does this leave the House and millions of Americans waiting on help? Let's get the read from The New York Post's Michael Goodwin, Democratic strategist Jason Nichols, and market watcher Rebecca Walser is here. Michael, let's begin with you. Why is Nancy Pelosi rejecting these calls from her own party? I have got this letter in hand, signatures of nearly half of the Democratic Caucus, 114 rank-and-file lawmakers pressing her on this."

There are a lot of people who have not gotten their jobs back, whose job may be gone forever. So the fact that the House does not want to, I think, put this $600 into the post office bill suggests that Pelosi is playing some other game, that she has some other plan. But I think it's maybe too smart to be apparent to everybody else, because it seems rather obvious that you would want to get the money to the people as fast as possible. It's already been a while since the first federal installment on the unemployment expired. So I'm not sure what she's holding out for, but it's clearly something."

So, they have already passed the HEROES Act, which includes money for COVID testing. It includes money for rental assistance. It includes money for people who are food insecure. So why just give them the $600 without all these other protections, including also a moratorium on evictions? They have already agreed upon this in the House. It's Mitch McConnell who is being an obstructionist, which is coming to define his entire career? He needs to come to the table and actually take this up and take this up for a vote. But, instead, he's obstructing. Nancy Pelosi, I understand the concerns of Cedric Richmond. I actually admire him. I understand the concerns of the other 99 Democrats, but I think Nancy Pelosi actually has a point here, that they have already passed something. And it's time for Republicans to stop obstructing."

And other than President Trump's executive order, they would be out of out of luck completely. So, I completely disagree that the Republicans are holding this hostage. Nancy Pelosi and the House Democrats knew that $3 trillion in the HEROES Act was such a far overreach. And they chose to go ahead and move forward with that bill, at the expense of 30 million Americans weekly, so that they could give money to state and local governments that have been vandalized for rebuilding. There's all kinds of stuff, Sandra, $3 trillion, which should be, to give extra special interests all kinds of things that is not relevant to coronavirus and to the recovery of our economy. So this is ridiculous that we're being held hostage for $3 trillion. She doesn't have the votes. She should have come to the table. And her own House Democrats are telling her to come to the table."

I consider myself to be more on the progressive wing of the party. And I think that he's open to hearing these things. And one of the things that he has pretty much committed himself to is a $15 minimum wage. He's committed himself to ending sub-minimum wage jobs or to sub-minimum wages for certain jobs in the service industry, things that we need in order to really recover and get us back to the 2007 level, before the Great Recession."

Chris Christie was on a radio program with Brian Kilmeade earlier today. And he says, you didn't hear the mention of those specific policy details. He says it would -- quote -- \"scare the bejesus out of the American people\" that may vote for him."

    {
      "speaker": "GOODWIN",
      "utterance": "I think there's something to that, that the American public is, is much more closer to the center than the activists who are running the Democratic Party. The Bernie Sanders wing of the party is predominant. And I think Sanders has said explicitly that the goal is to unite behind Biden now, get him elected. And then, when you get into government, then you begin to move farther to the left. So, when President Trump calls Joe Biden something of a Trojan horse, I think that's what he's talking about, that they're not being honest now about what they would do if they got into power."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SMITH",
      "utterance": "You know, it's really -- it's really interesting, Rebecca, when you look at his use of those left -- far left-wing policies and how much he did talk about that running up to securing the nomination. Chris Christie went on to say he did that because he had to. He will pursue those policies if he is elected. But that leaves the question, what do we hear from Joe Biden from now until November?"

    {
      "speaker": "WALSER",
      "utterance": "That's exactly right, Sandra. Any time a policy is not being presented publicly on a public forum, especially at the convention, which is supposed to launch the actual planks of the policy of the party, then there's something that's being hidden. And we know that President Trump wants to call him a Trojan horse. You might call him a Manchurian Candidate, because we know that he's got this unity task force with Sanders that talks about these really far left policies, where we're talking about the elimination of all cash bail, we're talking about the elimination of non-green combustible energy plans by -- within 20 -- within five years, by 2025. We're going to end all electric power plants. It's so aggressive. As a right, housing and health care, both as a right to all citizens or non- citizens. There's not even -- there's a question about what that is. It's so far left. This is the most left..."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "NICHOLS",
      "utterance": "Well, first of all, President Trump has never been big on policy. He comes with big ideas, which I don't think is a bad idea, particularly for conventions. He talked about building a wall. It was going to be 30- feet-high and 100-feet-deep so you couldn't build tunnels behind it. It's all these big ideas that are actually absurd. But that's what you do during conventions, is you give big ideas."

So what was the key takeaways from this study?"

    {
      "speaker": "FASANO",
      "utterance": "Well, this study was really conducted to answer the question why kids are spared by the COVID-19 pandemic. That was our understanding based on epidemiological data. So we were very surprised, in surveilling almost 200 kids in the Boston area, that they are affected. They can be infected by the virus. And when they do, they have little to no symptoms. So they are not the visible part of the iceberg of this pandemic. And they harbor as many virus, if not more, of adults. They're so sick to be admitted in the hospital in the intensive care units."

    {
      "speaker": "FASANO",
      "utterance": "I don't say anything on the matter, because it's based on who is the policymaker here to use this data and decide what to do about it. The data just show that kids are not spared. They can be infected with the virus. Now, if you want to close the school, open the school, or have of a mixed model, this is based on the policymakers and the local situation. My only recommendation is, if the kids will go to school, and therefore it's going to be in-person, we have to really implement those policies that have been effective so far to prevent or minimize the risk of spreading, so physical distance, wearing the mask, and make sure the kids, they wash their hands frequently."

      "speaker": "SMITH",
      "utterance": "All very important things to do. But, of course, those policymakers are at the mercy of what they hear from the medical doctors and the studies before them and the recommendations of the CDC, and so forth. But what is about to happen is flu season as well. So, many parents are asking, well, in general, we're fearful of that. And now we have got the flu season combined with COVID. What does this study tell us about that and the overlap of the two coming up?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "FASANO",
      "utterance": "Yes, this is a good point. And I'm a parent myself, so I'm wondering, coming flu season, what's going to happen here? Unfortunately, the symptoms of these kids that tested positive, the experiences are very mild that overlap with flu-like symptoms, like runny nose, a little bit of cough, mild fever. And, therefore, you can't distinguish between the two. So, you can't keep these kids home and just because they have symptoms like this, nor you can take the risk, if they have the symptoms like this, to be cavalier and allow them to come to school without precautions. And that's the reason why many states now are suggesting to vaccinate for the flu kids going to school and personnel, including teachers, against the flu, so that at least we will have this -- avoid this overlap and, therefore, the confusion this will generate if we go in-person school."

The judge accepting the plea agreements that they worked out with prosecutors. Loughlin's deal calls for two months behind bars, a $150,000 fine, probation, community service. Loughlin's voice was shaking as she apologized, saying she was truly, profoundly and deeply sorry. Giannulli's accepted deal calls for five months in prison, a $250,000 fine, community service, probation. Prosecutors say the couple shelled out half- a-million dollars to facilitate bribes through the scheme's ringleader, creating phony athletic profiles to get their two daughters into the University of Southern California as crew team members. Judge Nathaniel Gorton delivering a scathing scolding to Giannulli, noting the businessman was not someone -- quote -- \"stealing bread to feed your family,\" so, roughly quoting again, \"you have no excuse for your crime, and that makes it all the more blameworthy.\" Prior to Loughlin and Giannulli, 22 defendants had been sentenced, two coaches, 20 other parents.

Remember, there were 50 defendants initially, and, thus far -- there were 33 parents, coaches, some admissions counselors, et cetera. And, thus far, we have had 22 sentences prior to this couple here. But because of COVID, that had a significant impact. But they're not getting off scot-free. They still have two years of supervised release and quite a bit of community service. But I want to point out this fact, that the reason that the federal government has a 90 percent plea rate, it's because of the sentencing guidelines. All of those parents and coaches were facing considerable sentences, remember, decades."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "COMPAGNO",
      "utterance": "There is a small chance, but I think, given their relatively minimal sentences, that they both will serve their time. But I think I -- the way that you can get sort of plead down is if you get longer sentences, right? And generally, it's a year and a day. Then they'd be eligible for early release. But because these sentences were shorter than that, I foresee them actually serving time. But, definitely, the rate of COVID infections, it's spreading in federal prisons. And if that doesn't get under control, then there's going to be different issues that they have to manage it, because that's something that they have to get managed, under wraps."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "SMITH",
      "utterance": "Yes. You look at the course of events, when you look at this case and how they reversed course, Emily, and whether or not they have any regrets in doing that, or that was the right thing to do to get lesser sentences. But, for so long, they thought -- they said that -- they made the case that they thought they were making donations, and then they reversed course."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "COMPAGNO",
      "utterance": "That's exactly right. And look, I mean, I can't speak to their culpability, of course. No one knows their exact heart. But it seems to me a bit surprising that they actually thought they were making donations, given the amount of evidence that went toward them being proven, essentially, that they were absolutely creating fabricated applications, fabricating test scores, fabricating that their daughters were rowers, and mocking the entire system. What an expensive mistake it turned out to be on their part. But that's the weight of the government. When the government is sitting across the table from you, with the decades facing behind you, I mean, everyone capitulates at one point or another."

I intend to work anyway and -- any way possible that I can to make sure that we're able to move forward in a bipartisan way. And, basically, coming together is what Joe Biden does. So, if he brings people together -- he's worked very well with Republicans before. He doesn't chastise or villainize the other side just because he's a Democrat. So, I think you will see a whole 'nother flavor and a whole 'nother attitude in the Senate."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "MANCHIN",
      "utterance": "Sandra, I think what it was, it was mostly an attack on the behavior of the president. And I have tried -- I have tried as hard as anybody to work with him on many issues. And there's things that I agree with and I disagree. But it makes it very difficult. And I think what you saw is an attack on the demeanor of the president, how he reacts, how basically he chastises the other side and always blames them. I don't think you will see Joe Biden -- I never have seen him do that before. And, if he's anything, he got chastised from the left of the Democrat Caucus for working with Republicans, trying to make something happen. And that's what he does and what he's done well for 50 years. So, I assume that he would still take that position. I hope he does anyway. But to get rid of the filibuster means you are giving up on the Senate and the founding fathers of Jefferson and Washington, who said the Senate should be like a saucer to cool off the hot tea. Well, the House runs every two years, simple majority rules. If you have simple majority in the Senate, we're no more than a glorified House with a six-year term. I think that would be horrible. And it's definitely not what our founding fathers intended the Senate to be."

Byrd held. And he basically was the soul of the Senate. And he was the author of the rules of the Senate. And the bipartisan shouldn't -- I mean, we're supposed to have -- or the 60 vote threshold basically says, listen, rather than just a hard partisan vote, can't we have at least some people that's willing to meet in the middle? If it's going to be a confirmation for a judge or a confirmation for someone in the Cabinet, they should have skill sets and not just be a partisan hack. Then that should be able to be stopped.

They took three of them out. We had four of the re -- basically a re-sourcing type of machine. They took one of them out. He's already taken these machines out. He's already made the changes. And he said he's not going to do anything else. I'm saying, you have to go back. You don't go through an experiment.

So, I don't know what's going on with the Postal Service. You got 90 percent approval. People love their postal. They love their Postal Service, their postal workers. They love the way the system has worked. Now, they have made efficiencies. In West Virginia, Sandra, we used to have nine sourcing facilities, nine. We have one now. So, they have been consolidating and trying to find efficiencies all along. And, all of a sudden, now he comes in the 1st of June, and all these -- these new plans get implemented?

The read on that from a former Democrat-turned-Republican New Jersey Governor -- sorry -- New Jersey Republican Congressman Jeff Van Drew. Really looking forward to having you on the program tonight. So, what can you tell us about what you heard from Joe Biden and him trying to reach out to more voters last night? After you heard those far left policy proposals early on, he did move to the center last night."

      "speaker": "REP. JEFF VAN DREW (R-NJ)",
      "utterance": "Well, it was -- that's what's so disingenuous. It was more of a show than it really was a statement of policy and what you believe. I mean, that's what we heard last time, two years ago, when the new Congress came in. I was in that Congress. And yet we found that we had all kinds of -- everything from impeachment to, every single day, there were problems between the Democrats not accepting any Republican ideas or any Republican vision. There were problems with Iran that, fortunately, our president straightened out. There were problems with North Korea that our president straightened out. There were problems around the world, and certainly in China. It was our president who put in the travel restrictions, and he was called a racist for doing so. Thank God he did. My point is this. It's easy during a convention, and to give a nice speech that somebody has written for you, and talk about how you're in the center. They're not in the center. They are not in the center. I was there. I know they are being moved to the left more and more. They are even primarying people that are left-of-center, but aren't radical. The Democratic Party is becoming the socialist, radical party. And Joe Biden is much of a Trojan horse coming in to win the election, and then other folks are going to be taking over. And it's a shame."

      "utterance": "I have two questions. Were you running away from something when you left the Democratic Party, or were you running towards something? They're going to be having you speak, I just learned, at the RNC next week. What is your message going to be? What are you running towards, if that's the case?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "VAN DREW",
      "utterance": "I'm running towards America. I love this country. This is one of the most important elections since the Civil War. I want everybody who's listening to understand that. If we don't do the right thing in this election, we are going to never be, in my opinion, where we were as a country. This new group that's taking over, the Squad, et cetera, the new people that are winning election, are radical -- in the Democratic Party -- are radical Democrats that don't believe in American exceptionalism, that don't believe in Americanism, that don't believe in capitalism, that don't believe in our uniqueness as a country. So, we have got a decision to make. And that's what that's about. It's not about a fancy speech. And, yes, I'm going to give a speech, and we will all give speeches. And I know they will be good. But that's not the main point. It's really what has happened the last two years and what we have gone through, with so many of the policies and ideas that the radical left has tried to push through, you know, when it comes to open borders, and it comes to sanctuary states, and it comes to what's going on in our cities. Think how our country has changed in two years."
