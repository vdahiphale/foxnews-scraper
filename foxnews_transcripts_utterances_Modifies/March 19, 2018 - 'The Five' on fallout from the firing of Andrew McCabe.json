It's 5 o'clock in New York City and this is \"The Five.\" Andrew McCabe was supposed to be retired right now. He'd served in the FBI for more than two decades and rose to be the bureau's deputy director. But on Friday night, around 10:00 PM Eastern, he was stripped of his federal pension just 48 hours before it was set to kick in, fired by Attorney General Jeff Sessions for, quote, lack of candor under oath on multiple occasions. President Trump, a long critic of McCabe, called the termination a great day for democracy.  McCabe maintains he was sacked to undermine the credibility of the special counsel's investigation. He's turned over memos of his conversation with the president to Robert Mueller's team. There's, of course, a firestorm of reaction pouring in.",

And so, what you're seeing Adam Schiff say is it could be that Adam Schiff is just protecting himself from possible blowback. If you get a report from the inspector general, the office of professional responsibility, that indicates that McCabe either lied or was not forthcoming with them, then you would say, OK, so there was justification for it. What we do know is that McCabe has said that's not true. That he either was in chaos and was misunderstood or whatever. But he says he did not lie or mislead them.  So that's all we have on the table at the moment, Jesse. But I will say this, given the politics surrounding everything going on, from the Comey firing, to the house intelligence committee last week saying, oh, yeah, Russia, they didn't favor Donald Trump, you know, it just looks like -- when you look at this, you can't ignore the politics.

So they're negotiating that. So now, the president knows what that is. There's a subpoena to the Trump organization. There's McCabe's firing. There's the Dowd comment that his lawyers comments about Mueller that they should all end. And he says, yes, I'm speaking on behalf of the president.

If you look at everything from immigration to terror, it's all about strength. This issue provided him a perfect opportunity to exercise that. And when you say you're going to kill the dealers, you're not going to find much opposition. However, conservatives must be consistent with this argument, you know, with gun control, you talk about, you know, protecting the law-abiding citizens, going after the bad guy, which I think is what Trump is saying. You do not want to cast a wide net over people who need actual prescription medications to deal with their cancer pain or their other pain disorders, the disorders that often lead to suicidal depression, and these drugs are very necessary for them. So if you start making them feel like criminals, that is wrong. Be consistent and go after the criminal.  But finally, this is where my libertarianism kicks in. I don't trust the government on health issues. I mean, if you look at the war on drugs, it hasn't worked out. If you look at prohibition, not a good idea. The hideous nutrition pyramid, you know, we talked about a really bad mistake. You know, we had heart disease and diabetes on the rise and the nutrition pyramid said, you know, eat low-fat, high carb food. That was a mistake. So, I'm always suspicious of the government trying to get involved in our health. However, you know, dealing with, like, hard-core dealers who do kill more people than mass shooters, it's not such a bad idea. Just remember, when you make something illegal though, it's the street drugs that are killing people, right? It's because the drug delivery mechanisms that are so unreliable on the street. So we've learned that with medical marijuana and legalization of marijuana that -- you know, that may be the future for all drugs.",

But I have to tell you, even among some Republicans, it's be very difficult also to get through anything like this in terms of a death penalty for this type of situation. I was a death penalty prosecutor and I was on the death penalty panel reviewing cases that were eligible and/or appropriate, even if they were eligible for death penalty. And I'll tell you, it's a tough sell. You better have a very compelling case with, you know, lots of different elements to qualify.

I have not seen any data that would suggest that the war on drugs was effective. And to the contrary, and this situation, what you see is that people say that when you take the sledgehammer approach and say we've got to get tough with the drug dealers, what you do is you hike up or spike the prison population, but you don't necessarily reduce drug use. That -- we have that on the record. We know that for a fact. And so, when you say these kinds of things, it reminds people that, well, we need ideas. Alex Azar, who's the new secretary of health and human services, has said just that. That's the kind of policies his producing. But that's not what the president is saying today. So, I don't know if this is just rhetoric, but it seems to me like a step back into another world where you think, oh, yeah, if we just throw them in jail. Who are you going to throw in jail? The people who run the big pharmaceutical companies who are meeting, as Greg argues, a real need in terms of pain prevention for an older population? I don't know.

It's 5 o'clock in New York City and this is \"The Five.\" Andrew McCabe was supposed to be retired right now. He'd served in the FBI for more than two decades and rose to be the bureau's deputy director. But on Friday night, around 10:00 PM Eastern, he was stripped of his federal pension just 48 hours before it was set to kick in, fired by Attorney General Jeff Sessions for, quote, lack of candor under oath on multiple occasions. President Trump, a long critic of McCabe, called the termination a great day for democracy. McCabe maintains he was sacked to undermine the credibility of the special counsel's investigation. He's turned over memos of his conversation with the president to Robert Mueller's team. There's, of course, a firestorm of reaction pouring in."

He wouldn't be going out on a limb and saying something like that that might displeased his partisan, you know, base to think that President Trump is just, you know, running amok here. By saying that tells me he has knowledge and information to suggest that in fact it was justified. I think they wouldn't go out of their way to do it when they did and how they did it if they didn't have good reason and full costs and haven't investigated it thoroughly. And in fact, the people making the recommendation, the people that work with him at the FBI."

And you said, well, it's two days before the guy's, you know, retirement was going to be up. So you look at that aspect of it. But nevertheless, if the facts are there, persuasive and compelling, then they have to follow through with this."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Juan, people are saying that if it was just a regular guy in the FBI who, you know, out on the field and he did what McCabe did, he's be treated the exact same way. Do you understand that argument?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUAN WILLIAMS, CO-HOST",
      "utterance": "I don't think that's true. But I understand the argument. I think what's true is that, you know, FBI agents are not rich people and they really rely on pensions. And so, typically, there's a lot of leeway given, especially respected idea, oh, he's got two days to go, will let it happen. But I think what happened here is we don't know. And so, what you're seeing Adam Schiff say is it could be that Adam Schiff is just protecting himself from possible blowback. If you get a report from the inspector general, the office of professional responsibility, that indicates that McCabe either lied or was not forthcoming with them, then you would say, OK, so there was justification for it. What we do know is that McCabe has said that's not true. That he either was in chaos and was misunderstood or whatever. But he says he did not lie or mislead them. So that's all we have on the table at the moment, Jesse. But I will say this, given the politics surrounding everything going on, from the Comey firing, to the house intelligence committee last week saying, oh, yeah, Russia, they didn't favor Donald Trump, you know, it just looks like -- when you look at this, you can't ignore the politics. And the politics are stinky."

      "speaker": "DANA PERINO, CO-HOST",
      "utterance": "Well, I would like to see the full report before making a determination, because without that we're just basically going on gut instinct to what we hear, what might have been leaked or not, so until we have that. But I would say that politics are played except for that -- there -- if the president hadn't tweeted about this on Saturday morning and rubbing McCabe's face in it, then the story line would've been the whole weekend is that the office of professional responsibility recommended this firing. And so that, I think, would have been a nice place to just leave it right there and let everybody talk about the office of professional responsibility, that didn't happen."

It's like high school. It's like being in a high school cafeteria. And the cheerleader runs over and says let me hold your jacket because you're going to get into a fight. I mean, maybe that's the submission that Hillary keeps talking about. But his anger, it reflects the deep animosity that validates Trump's assumptions and assertions about people in power who want him gone. That's the hood ornament. That tweet is the hood ornament of all of these people who sincerely believe that there's a bad man in the White House and they got to get him out. And if you notice, it's the circle of media and the circle of the Trump critics and they match perfectly. So they're self-perpetuating engine of panic. So the media says, oh, my god, he's evil, he's evil. And then, you have this dude, and you have Comey, and you got the other guy, and this guy, who were in the government saying the same thing. These are the same people. The media and these -- I guess you would call them Washington insiders or establishment, whatever. The reactions are 99.9 percent identical. So that's where you get the hysteria and the panic because they're constantly -- there's no yin and yang. It's yin and yin."

I think it would be ill-advised at this point to do something like that, given that this has already gone so far down the road. They're sort of on the five-inch line. Let them complete the investigation. I don't see any upside for the president in removing him at this juncture. Only downside would be tremendous amount of fallout and criticism. We saw that when that happened with Comey, OK. And I just don't think this should follow in the footsteps. You've got McCabe gone. Do the investigation, complete it, come to the conclusion, see it through to, you know, all the way through fruition, and then see what we have."

I was spokesperson for Karl Rove during the special counsel, and it's very difficult to figure out the legal strategy and the communication strategy, but they really must work in tandem. It's a terrible idea for the lawyers to be out front and not in communication or coordination with the P.R. people, because the other thing that happened this weekend, or this past week is you had reports that questions from the Mueller team had gone to Trump's lawyers about these are the type of things we might want to ask him if we were to have an interview with him. So they're negotiating that. So now, the president knows what that is. There's a subpoena to the Trump organization. There's McCabe's firing. There's the Dowd comment that his lawyers comments about Mueller that they should all end. And he says, yes, I'm speaking on behalf of the president. And now we're like, oh, actually, no, I'm speaking in my own capacity. I don't believe any of that. I actually think -- one of their major problems is they have to get their P.R. people wind up and in sync with their legal people or they're going to continue to have news cycles like that."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "GUTFELD",
      "utterance": "I don't know if it will. I mean, look, number one, the politics of it -- Trump won because he was a law and order guy. If you look at everything from immigration to terror, it's all about strength. This issue provided him a perfect opportunity to exercise that. And when you say you're going to kill the dealers, you're not going to find much opposition. However, conservatives must be consistent with this argument, you know, with gun control, you talk about, you know, protecting the law-abiding citizens, going after the bad guy, which I think is what Trump is saying. You do not want to cast a wide net over people who need actual prescription medications to deal with their cancer pain or their other pain disorders, the disorders that often lead to suicidal depression, and these drugs are very necessary for them. So if you start making them feel like criminals, that is wrong. Be consistent and go after the criminal. But finally, this is where my libertarianism kicks in. I don't trust the government on health issues. I mean, if you look at the war on drugs, it hasn't worked out. If you look at prohibition, not a good idea. The hideous nutrition pyramid, you know, we talked about a really bad mistake. You know, we had heart disease and diabetes on the rise and the nutrition pyramid said, you know, eat low-fat, high carb food. That was a mistake. So, I'm always suspicious of the government trying to get involved in our health. However, you know, dealing with, like, hard-core dealers who do kill more people than mass shooters, it's not such a bad idea. Just remember, when you make something illegal though, it's the street drugs that are killing people, right? It's because the drug delivery mechanisms that are so unreliable on the street. So we've learned that with medical marijuana and legalization of marijuana that -- you know, that may be the future for all drugs."

There's those that shows and point to that they are, that it operates effectively as a deterrent to prevent future criminal conduct. I understand why the president is taking this position. He's trying to show that he's very serious about it. That it's going to stop. But I have to tell you, even among some Republicans, it's be very difficult also to get through anything like this in terms of a death penalty for this type of situation. I was a death penalty prosecutor and I was on the death penalty panel reviewing cases that were eligible and/or appropriate, even if they were eligible for death penalty. And I'll tell you, it's a tough sell. You better have a very compelling case with, you know, lots of different elements to qualify. I think, you know, he's well intentioned that shows how serious he is about this, but I think would be really -- the chances are going to be, you know, negligible that he's going to be able to get something like this through."

Like, increase the penalties for those top dealers, and also have some sort of prison reform or criminal justice reform to help those people who have been unfairly in prison."

I have not seen any data that would suggest that the war on drugs was effective. And to the contrary, and this situation, what you see is that people say that when you take the sledgehammer approach and say we've got to get tough with the drug dealers, what you do is you hike up or spike the prison population, but you don't necessarily reduce drug use. That -- we have that on the record. We know that for a fact. And so, when you say these kinds of things, it reminds people that, well, we need ideas. Alex Azar, who's the new secretary of health and human services, has said just that. That's the kind of policies his producing. But that's not what the president is saying today. So, I don't know if this is just rhetoric, but it seems to me like a step back into another world where you think, oh, yeah, if we just throw them in jail. Who are you going to throw in jail? The people who run the big pharmaceutical companies who are meeting, as Greg argues, a real need in terms of pain prevention for an older population? I don't know. I mean, lot of what we're talking about is that people who become addicted on the basis of prescription drugs, but then can't."

What they did was they hired five staff members from Cambridge, and they had to sign a deal to get the staffers to come to work with them in Texas. But they never used any of the so-called psychographic modeling. They used data and research from the RNC and from their own internal data network. So a lot of it's trying to paint the Trump campaign as if they -- you know, they reached into Facebook and ripped out all of this in an unethical way. It's just not true. But like you said, it's more about Facebook and protecting their customers' information. Obviously, they didn't do a great job about it, because they didn't let people know that their data was being mined. And I think Facebook has to answer to that."

In a way that influences outcomes of elections without saying, \"Oh, gee it's the machines. We didn't see any\" -- but something is going on when you have this much in the water, when people are harvesting information about who you are, your preferences, your likes, your dislikes, and understand how they can get to you in a way that will shift your thinking. And I think that's what's behind this. Now, to me, those folks that others on the panel called elite and arrogant and all that, I think are dumb. Because guess what? I don't think that people who ran -- who run Facebook understood the power. They think it's just a social network. Guess what? It's a political instrument."

An individual who has had kind of a history kind of fraught with frustration and perhaps some mental health issues. So this doesn't come as a surprise to me. It kind of looks like the paintings and portraits that the people that I've experienced that are serial killers and criminals. No, but really. I have experience with this. As a D.A., and they send me these pictures and these portraits and you see some of their writings that when you do search warrants on their jail cells if you're doing an active prison case, like I was doing with the Aryan Brotherhood. And you see some of the drawings and the musings of those that are a little bit disturbed. It reminds me of this. And I think Sarah Sanders is quite lovely and is working very hard on behalf of the country. And so I have no bid for this painting."
