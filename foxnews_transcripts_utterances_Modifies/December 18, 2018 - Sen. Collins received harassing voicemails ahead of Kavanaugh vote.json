      "sentences": "Hey there, Bret. Thank you very much. So, the hallmarks of the Trump White House over the past two years all coming to ahead this evening. Good evening, everybody. I'm Martha MacCallum so on the one end you've got the border wall. President Trump's signature campaign promise in jeopardy as the White House is now saying that they're flexible on the funding for the wall.  Democrats rejecting the latest offer, and the jockeying continues tonight. We're going to talk about that. On the other, the Mueller probe. Today, U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan in the face of all the experts. Saying that he would give former NSA adviser Michael Flynn zero time. The judge clearly had other ideas today. He blasted Flynn in the courtroom.  Gestured to the flag to make his point. Saying that his actions as a foreign agent for Turkey undermine everything this flag over here stands for. \"Arguably,\" he said, \"you sold your country out.\" At one point, even asking the prosecutor if Flynn's actions could be considered treason, which attorney Jonathan Turley found shocking.  Writing this tonight, \"It is so wildly out of place that it could have been viewed as an attempt by the judge at being facetious. The man in front of Sullivan was accused of lying in an FBI interview, even though the FBI agents who interviewed Flynn did not believe that his false statements were intentional.\" Turley also points out in his piece this evening that the judge had to walk back statements about Flynn being a foreign agent while serving as national security adviser because the prosecutors did not find that to be the case in terms of timing on all that.  Former Attorney General Michael Mukasey weighs in, in just a moment. Also tonight, transcripts from James Comey's second testy interview with House investigators. Texas Congressman John Ratcliffe, a member of the House Judiciary Committee was in the room, questioned former director Comey, and joins me now. Good to see you tonight, Congressman. Welcome, thanks for being here.",

The first vote has just been called a few minutes ago in a Comprehensive Criminal Justice Reform Bill. This is a bill that has the sponsorship or the support of the Fraternal Order of Police, of the National Association of Evangelicals, of Catholic Charities, U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Heritage Action, and the ACLU. You've got Republicans and Democrats in the Senate and the House supporting this bill. I expect it will pass later tonight after six votes and President Trump has said he will sign it. Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law was a key force in getting this bill to this point. I think this will make a real difference in making our criminal justice system at the federal level focus more on reducing sentences, making sure that folks who belong in jail or in jail and those who can be improved in terms of their behavior and who can return to society safely, it gives an opportunity for relief valve for folks who are currently serving overly long sentences for minor nonviolent drug-related crimes.",

The federal school safety report is 177 pages and replete with policy recommendations, like expanding mental health services and school security protocols, but its primary focus is rescinding Obama administration guidelines on discipline. Remember, back in 2013, '14, then Education Secretary Arnie Duncan and the administration argued that teachers were discriminating against students of color by punishing them at higher rates than white students. They argued it fostered a, quote, \"school to prison pipeline.\" The administration then sends school districts a letter warning that they could be subject to civil rights investigations. Two years later, a New York school survey focusing on schools that served predominantly students of color, reportedly showed dramatic deterioration from the 2013, '14 school year to the 2014, '15 school year. For example, physical fighting increased at 50 percent of schools, and decreased that only 14 percent, and peer respect got worse, at 58 percent of schools, and improved just 19 percent. USA Today says that during that same time frame, schools in St. Paul, Minnesota, said that assaults against teachers and other school staff had tripled. The school safety commission report says the Obama guidance, quoting here, \"sent the unfortunate message that the federal government, rather than teachers and local administrators, best handle school discipline.\" And a Charleston, South Carolina teacher summed it up more bluntly, quoting, \"Once the kid finds out he can F you, flip over a table and he won't get suspended, that's that.\" And it's important to note that instead of being expelled or arrested after numerous incidents of bad behavior, Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooter Nikolas Cruz was placed in an alternative program. Even though Cruz is white and his program had nothing to do with Obama-era guidance, Florida Senator Marco Rubio said it shows that failing to report troubled students to law enforcement can have dangerous repercussions. Today at the White House, some parents of those who lost children in the Parkland shooting praised the report. Watch.",

There are real concerns about the school to prison pipeline, and they can and should be addressed. They are best addressed with good programs and by sound policies made at the local level. But simply to take the blunt instrument that the Obama administration did and said, if you have 20 black students and 10 white students, that means you must discipline them in those exact proportions, fails to take into account a student differences, family differences, background differences, and the like.

Democrats rejecting the latest offer, and the jockeying continues tonight. We're going to talk about that. On the other, the Mueller probe. Today, U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan in the face of all the experts. Saying that he would give former NSA adviser Michael Flynn zero time. The judge clearly had other ideas today. He blasted Flynn in the courtroom. Gestured to the flag to make his point. Saying that his actions as a foreign agent for Turkey undermine everything this flag over here stands for. \"Arguably,\" he said, \"you sold your country out.\" At one point, even asking the prosecutor if Flynn's actions could be considered treason, which attorney Jonathan Turley found shocking. Writing this tonight, \"It is so wildly out of place that it could have been viewed as an attempt by the judge at being facetious. The man in front of Sullivan was accused of lying in an FBI interview, even though the FBI agents who interviewed Flynn did not believe that his false statements were intentional.\" Turley also points out in his piece this evening that the judge had to walk back statements about Flynn being a foreign agent while serving as national security adviser because the prosecutors did not find that to be the case in terms of timing on all that. Former Attorney General Michael Mukasey weighs in, in just a moment. Also tonight, transcripts from James Comey's second testy interview with House investigators.

And you were talking to him about whether or not President Obama was part of any of those back-and- forth e-mail exchanges with Hillary Clinton. And what happened to those e- mails. He claimed, no, there was never any classified information that flowed between President Obama who at times used a pseudonym, I guess, on some of his e-mails -- correct me if I'm wrong on that to Hillary Clinton."

But we were really trying to find out about the communications and as you saw, Martha, he confirmed that President Obama was communicating with former Secretary Clinton on an unclassified, unauthorized server, at least, at one point in time, while Secretary Clinton was in Russia. So, it was fair to ask those questions. That wasn't any information that he volunteered. And so, we were really trying to probe into that. Because again, the question here was, \"Was classified information mishandled?\" And really the question that we had was why wasn't Hillary Clinton asked about that?"

Wanting to know whether or not President Obama had any knowledge of this server or whether or not he received any information like that. You also press down on the date of the tarmac meeting between Loretta Lynch and Bill Clinton.

The exoneration memo that Jim Comey had written was changed to delete any references to President Obama from his public remarks. And three days later, the FBI sent a team of prosecutors and investigators into question Hillary Clinton. She didn't get a single question about the meeting between Loretta Lynch and her husband. She didn't get a single question about her communications with Barack Obama on an unsecured unclassified server. These are questions that every American would have asked right out of the gate. Director Comey didn't know why they were asked, didn't know if it was a good -- didn't have a good excuse for why no one in that room asked those questions. He didn't follow up with Loretta Lynch.

And he doesn't think it's fair if you ask questions that would have the story end any other way.

I've never -- there was only one judge that I ever saw and do things like that, and he was in a southern district to New York and was known to be off his rocker. These judges are generally restrained in their comments. Generally, they don't take on either defendants or lawyers in that fashion because it's not a fair fight. And everybody knows that instinctively. He suggested that Flynn was guilty of treason and backed off that, he suggested that he was an unregistered agent while in the White House, he backed off that."

And I don't know whether that was done at the behest of the government, or simply by the judge spontaneously. But again, it's -- it suggests an over-the-top approach to this case. Look, Michael Flynn pleaded guilty to making a false statement to the FBI. Serious crime. But, let's put it in proportion. The agents to whom he made that statement knew the truth. They weren't misled. The damage that resulted from it was nil. The damage possibly from false statements to other officials including the vice president was arguably substantial, but temporary."

He was not prosecuted for anything having to do with Turkey. And it would be really questionable whether the judge could take that into account as related conduct on a sentence. So, the reason for bringing that up frankly mystifies me."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "What about it what was revealed in terms of Michael Flynn's discussions with the Russian ambassador and his relationship with this entity in Turkey. It is -- you know, and I think it's kind of a dirty secret of Washington that a lot of people get paid by foreign governments. They're supposed to register as a foreign agent in order to be aboveboard about that. But apparently, the rules are a little bit squishy about what means you have to register, and that means you don't have to register."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MUKASEY",
      "utterance": "I think that getting paid by Turkey to have conversations with people in the government is lobbying. And yes, you have to register for that.

If they were going to prosecute him for that, they could have."

Now we're beginning detailed negotiations about what more might be needed in order to get a border security investment that the President would accept and that would allow us to complete our appropriations work for this year.

That got 52 votes on the floor of the Senate and -- excuse me -- got 54 votes on the floor of the Senate earlier this year. It also had a pathway to citizenship for DREAMers.

What is the latest proposal on the table today was another billion dollars in addition to the $1.6 billion that's in the bill now that would just be money that the President could spend as he wished?

I do think we can get this done in a bipartisan way. Let me take one moment before we end and give some hope to your viewers. The first vote has just been called a few minutes ago in a Comprehensive Criminal Justice Reform Bill. This is a bill that has the sponsorship or the support of the Fraternal Order of Police, of the National Association of Evangelicals, of Catholic Charities, U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Heritage Action, and the ACLU. You've got Republicans and Democrats in the Senate and the House supporting this bill. I expect it will pass later tonight after six votes and President Trump has said he will sign it. Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law was a key force in getting this bill to this point. I think this will make a real difference in making our criminal justice system at the federal level focus more on reducing sentences, making sure that folks who belong in jail or in jail and those who can be improved in terms of their behavior and who can return to society safely, it gives an opportunity for relief valve for folks who are currently serving overly long sentences for minor nonviolent drug-related crimes."

Specifically, those e-mails stated their official role and positions in the ongoing confirmation progress, and then they said donate now and contribute, which is against the rules, Ben."

I mean, you're in a middle of a contentious hearing over whether a crime did or did not happen years ago, and you are sending out fund-raisers on your own behalf in the middle of that? Even as Senator Kamala Harris, for example, was going out there and making completely unwarranted charges about Judge Kavanaugh. And it really was an astonishing display. Politics has become blood sport for so many people these days, including the people who are in Congress. And let's be frank about this, Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren were doing this because they are both running for president in 2020. It had nothing to do with principle, it had nothing to do with decency, it had nothing to do with due process. It was a disgusting display from beginning to end."

And at this point, we are hearing moments ago, that it sounds like Senator Shelby, basically they've reached a kick the can down the road agreement. I know that's a real shock.

It doesn't look like the wall is going to be built, and all the promises notwithstanding.

And I think, you know, in a perfect world, which I just discussed with Chris Coons, there is border security. They are securing the border, and I think that they really agree on it more than they disagree on it, and maybe we will get somewhere on that. But you find it ironic that they are passing this criminal justice reform, and that the president was, you know, very big on law enforcement and law and order, but this is what he is in favor of."

It's definitely a bizarre move by President Trump. Maybe he is trying to reach out to the middle in preparation for 2020, or maybe this is just incoherence, whatever it is. I think the president he's been fond of using the bully pulpit in the past for particular things he cares about. It seems to me that if he cares about the wall, if he cares about border security, if he cares about law and order, then this would be a great time for him to get on the stump and talk about it."

And that, the best way to work in the world is to work through that reason in trying to interpret a predictable universe that you can understand. That you have the capacity to get together with others and make a difference. But you are never allowed to force your views on other people. Now this is used to be basic American principles and if we don't inculcate them in our kids from the time that they are born and then enriched them with that continuing message over time, then everything starts to fall apart.

Joining me now is Tom Kenniff, a criminal lawyer, Iraq war veteran, former officer in the Army National Guard JAG Corps. Tom, always good to talk to about this kind of story. And I think, you know, people listen to the story and they just, they can't believe it. This is a decorated war hero who was trying to protect his own men, he said that he had the experience in the past of letting, you know, these guys go, and then they just came back around once they realized who they were working with, within the Afghan army. They came back to kill them. And he didn't want that to happen."

And, of course, everybody is going back to the statements is, what board of prosecutors will construe as admission, they made both on television, and apparently, in this interview that he did for employment with the CIA where he was hooked up to a lie detector test, and that lie detector test itself wouldn't be admissible in a general courts-martial, but the statements themselves that he made could be used as admission against him, whatever it is he supposedly said regarding this killing. So, you know, there's a lot of moving parts here. And obviously, him being a Green Beret and a member of the Special Forces.

Because the rules of engagement, the military rules for the use of force were becoming so restrictive that it really put them in an untenable situation. Of course, that would not justify a cold-blooded killing of a detainee in custody, if that's what this was. But it's not clear that that's what it was, and I think we all know that it wasn't."

There is still due process that will occur before this case could ever get to courts-martial. There's something called an article 32 here, which is sort of the military's equivalent of a grand jury or a felony hearing where a military officer is going to review these allegations for probable cause. That officer can make a determination that there is no probable cause, which then the general -- the commanding general will have to either agree to follow or not. He can also make findings and mitigation, determined that look, there perhaps was misconduct here, but it doesn't rise to the level of where this hero should be facing a general court-martial where he could get either life in prison or even the death penalty, for that matter."

      "speaker": "MACCALUM",
      "utterance": "Tonight, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos continues to chip away at President Obama's controversial school policies. During his administration, schools were basically told that punishment such as detention or suspension sometimes unfairly targeted minorities. But many teachers complain that with those punishments off the table, it was then difficult to keep students in line, and presented a challenge to learning and focusing for the students who were behaving. In some cases, teachers were even the targets of physical attack and felt that it was too tough to maintain control in their classrooms under those rules, or lack thereof. But the Trump administration now wants to roll some of them back. Trace Gallagher has the story for us tonight from the west coast newsroom."

    {
      "speaker": "TRACE GALLAGHER, CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Hi, Martha. The federal school safety report is 177 pages and replete with policy recommendations, like expanding mental health services and school security protocols, but its primary focus is rescinding Obama administration guidelines on discipline. Remember, back in 2013, '14, then Education Secretary Arnie Duncan and the administration argued that teachers were discriminating against students of color by punishing them at higher rates than white students. They argued it fostered a, quote, \"school to prison pipeline.\" The administration then sends school districts a letter warning that they could be subject to civil rights investigations. Two years later, a New York school survey focusing on schools that served predominantly students of color, reportedly showed dramatic deterioration from the 2013, '14 school year to the 2014, '15 school year. For example, physical fighting increased at 50 percent of schools, and decreased that only 14 percent, and peer respect got worse, at 58 percent of schools, and improved just 19 percent. USA Today says that during that same time frame, schools in St. Paul, Minnesota, said that assaults against teachers and other school staff had tripled. The school safety commission report says the Obama guidance, quoting here, \"sent the unfortunate message that the federal government, rather than teachers and local administrators, best handle school discipline.\" And a Charleston, South Carolina teacher summed it up more bluntly, quoting, \"Once the kid finds out he can F you, flip over a table and he won't get suspended, that's that.\" And it's important to note that instead of being expelled or arrested after numerous incidents of bad behavior, Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooter Nikolas Cruz was placed in an alternative program. Even though Cruz is white and his program had nothing to do with Obama-era guidance, Florida Senator Marco Rubio said it shows that failing to report troubled students to law enforcement can have dangerous repercussions. Today at the White House, some parents of those who lost children in the Parkland shooting praised the report. Watch."

      "speaker": "BILL BENNETT, CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "I think they are correct. I think the commission and Secretary DeVos did the right thing. You had a situation getting out of hand. The New York Times did a big story on this today, and blamed the commission, and said they ignored what happened at Parkland. In fact, they actually learned the lessons from Parkland. The murderer, Mr. Cruz should have been handed over to the police. He did several things that were illegal and threatening, but under the atmosphere created by the Obama-era guidelines, leniency was the order of the day. There are real concerns about the school to prison pipeline, and they can and should be addressed. They are best addressed with good programs and by sound policies made at the local level. But simply to take the blunt instrument that the Obama administration did and said, if you have 20 black students and 10 white students, that means you must discipline them in those exact proportions, fails to take into account a student differences, family differences, background differences, and the like. Teachers and administrators have to have the discretion to act when they think they should. They didn't act in the case of Parkland, and that cost the lives of a number of people."
