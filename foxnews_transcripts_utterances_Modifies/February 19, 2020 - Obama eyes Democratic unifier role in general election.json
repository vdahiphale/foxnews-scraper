And on the flip side, we know that Biden, Mayor Pete, and Klobuchar, they need him to fall, because they would be the alternative mainstream candidate to Bernie obviously surging.  And I think that to both of your guys' point, the only way, you know -- explaining controversial statements is losing. So yes, he needs to have a proactive, positive spin on the past.

I do think that Bloomberg is going to spend the majority of his time explaining the context of every out of context outrage, whether it's stop and frisk or the thing about minorities in the workplace, the farming -- he's going to have to say this is what I meant. This is what I meant. But the big news, the news that I love, is that NBC had to tweet out that Bloomberg will not be standing on a box, OK?  So think about this as yet another example of where Trump had created a visual that then sticks and takes a life of its own. Basically, Trump is a news magician, right? He's a -- he brings up the box and now the box has to be answered to. You have to talk about the box. And it's actually -- it's - - he's the Harry Potter of persuasion. He just comes up with this stuff. I think everybody is also pulling for Bloomberg, because, man, he's making some serious money for all of us. He is - his political advertising is breaking revenue records for a lot of companies. He is the reverse Trump. Like, you know, Bloomberg paid full price for the suit that Trump got wholesale off the back of a truck. Think of all that free media Trump got.

It's separate from -- in this particular state, my two issues with it, which I've said before are the crime classifications themselves and a lack of judicial discretion. So unlike other states, here, the classifications matter. So this particular new set of reform applies to a lot of crimes or excludes a lot of crimes that we would be horrified by like violent crimes against children.   But because of their classification, it doesn't count here, and those guys are on the streets. Secondly, removes judicial discretion. So a normal, reasonable person like yourself, as a judge, you can say. You know what? This guy -- I'm going to keep this guy locked up. This law remove that.

Bail reform right now in New York City is catch and release for criminals. And the media calls the evidence of this anecdotal. No, it is statistical don't lie. Statistics don't lie. We are seeing 30, 40 percent jumps and a lot of crime, because they are going out and they are blatantly committing more crimes. And we have to remember to this point. This is a cycle of degradation. Whenever Republicans come in, like whether it's Giuliani or Bloomberg and rebuild the city, it allows somebody like the de Blasio to degrade it.

I think his natural public demeanor is not combative. Obviously, we've seen him kind of trading barbs with Trump on Twitter and etcetera. But remember in the 2009 mayoral election, in those debates the New York Times said he has the ferocity of a bulldog. So I think tonight he's going to come out swinging. And on the flip side, we know that Biden, Mayor Pete, and Klobuchar, they need him to fall, because they would be the alternative mainstream candidate to Bernie obviously surging. And I think that to both of your guys' point, the only way, you know -- explaining controversial statements is losing. So yes, he needs to have a proactive, positive spin on the past.

Because to your point, Geraldo, you're absolutely right. He -- like, Sanders has produced nothing. Instead, he's lived off the producers as a politician for most of his life. I do think that Bloomberg is going to spend the majority of his time explaining the context of every out of context outrage, whether it's stop and frisk or the thing about minorities in the workplace, the farming -- he's going to have to say this is what I meant. This is what I meant. But the big news, the news that I love, is that NBC had to tweet out that Bloomberg will not be standing on a box, OK? So think about this as yet another example of where Trump had created a visual that then sticks and takes a life of its own. Basically, Trump is a news magician, right? He's a -- he brings up the box and now the box has to be answered to. You have to talk about the box. And it's actually -- it's - - he's the Harry Potter of persuasion. He just comes up with this stuff. I think everybody is also pulling for Bloomberg, because, man, he's making some serious money for all of us. He is - his political advertising is breaking revenue records for a lot of companies. He is the reverse Trump. Like, you know, Bloomberg paid full price for the suit that Trump got wholesale off the back of a truck. Think of all that free media Trump got. And now Bloomberg for the next eight months is going to paying full price. We are all going to get third homes."

I like the fact that there is equity now. But the system really has led to excesses that are untenable, it seems to me. You know, people arrested 141 times lose confidence in the system, liberal policies. And we want the president of the United States to have criminal justice reform.

That's going to get the crop shot? I mean, all of that is ridiculous. And I think that criminal justice reform is separate from bail reform. It's separate from -- in this particular state, my two issues with it, which I've said before are the crime classifications themselves and a lack of judicial discretion. So unlike other states, here, the classifications matter. So this particular new set of reform applies to a lot of crimes or excludes a lot of crimes that we would be horrified by like violent crimes against children. But because of their classification, it doesn't count here, and those guys are on the streets. Secondly, removes judicial discretion. So a normal, reasonable person like yourself, as a judge, you can say. You know what? This guy -- I'm going to keep this guy locked up. This law remove that. This reform removes that ability by the judge, unlike in New Jersey. So yes, I think the whole point is for all of us who are advocates for commonsense criminal justice reform. This is not that.

To prostitute themselves in open daylight and to relieve themselves in open daylight, that destroys the quality of life. And now in New York, have criminals committing crimes and than thinking Democrat politicians for letting them out of jail so they can commit more crimes.

We are seeing 30, 40 percent jumps and a lot of crime, because they are going out and they are blatantly committing more crimes. And we have to remember to this point. This is a cycle of degradation. Whenever Republicans come in, like whether it's Giuliani or Bloomberg and rebuild the city, it allows somebody like the de Blasio to degrade it.

I just want to say briefly that I think that Biden is guilty of the -- of what I see very commonly the ask a Democrat, do you think all Republicans are racist? And too many of them hesitate before they reluctantly say, no. So that's -- let's put that. In terms of the Hispanic vote, I think that this is a vote that's up for grabs. The President has in this harsh language about immigration left an opening for the Democrats to expand that base. I urge him, I talked to him personally, speak with compassion about this population. This is a population that you can -- these are entrepreneurial people, faith-based people, family-oriented people. These people could be Republicans, as George W. Bush famously said. So I want the president to be much more expansive and much kinder when it comes to that whole border issue. You can build the damn wall. I don't care about the wall as long as there's big doors. He says there's going to be a big door. I think that the President now has a historic opportunity to expand the Republican party in a way that we have not seen since Ronald Reagan in the second term. This is -- this is huge, and he can do it. He's just the guy to do it. I see him working it in the African American community. I want to help him you know, to get that language -- that language to the DACA students the DREAM Act students. Let's -- these are people that you want to bring into the American dream.

A new study shows that as badly educated far-left activists continue to label words as violence and ideas is not wrong but evil. They've helped turn arenas of free thought into monuments to the East German secret police. The new study found that a quarter and students believe you can silence views that they don't like and it's OK to obstruct the speakers in order to do so. Six times as many liberals felt that way as non-libs. And while nearly all conservatives said that they would be friends with a liberal, a large minority of libs wouldn't reciprocate. No wonder 70 percent of conservatives fear expressing their views in class. So this is where you send your kids not to be educated, but to be indebted. No longer to engage, but to punish each other. It's a place where its gatekeepers realize the only way to preserve their bad ideas is to enlist zombie students to cooperate against their rebellious peers, like guards in a prison camp. Does this help shape young minds? Well, if those mines can be found, they can certainly be shaped into what, one wonders."
