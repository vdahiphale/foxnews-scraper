Sensational stories, many of them you haven't heard anywhere else. Coast- to-coast, we have it covered. There's an explosive war of words underway in California over the sanctuary state laws there as the Attorney General Jeff Sessions sues the state. Governor Jerry Brown calls Sessions a liar who is just launching a reign of terror. Nice. Plus, a pair of chilling domestic terror stories including a cross-country jihad. The rest of the media are virtually ignoring this. And Dr. Phil analyzes the White House, what? While the media assails the president, it's all in our unseen and seen segments.   But first, reading, writing and activism, our collegiate indoctrination factories. That's the focus of tonight's Angle. Watching how things have played out during the first 13 months of the Trump era, I've come to the conclusion that liberals just aren't that interested in advocating policies that improve the lives of Americans. But what they do want, and part of the Obama legacy is a constant state of protest and agitation. A resistance force fed to them in their high school and college years and now professors themselves are nurturing the next generation of revolutionaries.  At many colleges, students are now expected to skip class to attend social justice rallies. Case and point, on Yale's admissions blog under the title 'In support of student protests', the assistant director of admissions writes, 'For those students who come to Yale, we expect them to be versed in issues of social justice.'   According to Walter Olson and your 'Wall Street Journal,' Yale does not count skipping classes for protests like we've seen lately against the applicant. No problem whatsoever. Check this out, the dean of admissions at Tufts University, her name is Karen Richardson, after the Parkland shooting issued this statement to applicants. She said, 'I want to assure you that Tufts is a place where civic engagement is not only tolerated, it's encouraged strongly. So, when you act on your values in a principled way on issues about which you feel passionately, it will not be held against you in the application process. In fact, we may even take notice.'  Forget volunteering with the elderly or helping special needs children, put that on your college application. If you really want to get into that college of your choice, go yell at a conservative senator and then posted on YouTube. There are other universities also stoking activism out there. At Valdosta State in Georgia, the Women and Gender Studies Department encourages students in their division to organize and implement annual social justice events such as the Intimate Partner Violence Awareness Month, and the productions of The Vagina Monologues and National Coming Out Day.  But politically perhaps I have to think about this. No one did more to encourage student organizing like Barack Obama. Last year, he talked about training the next generation of community organizers.",

But there's something insidious afoot here. A few years ago, Nicholas Christakis, who is the head of a Yale college was forced to resign after his wife, also a professor, dared to send out a mass email objecting to Yale's Halloween costume rules. She suggested merely that Yale students be allowed to wear whatever they want as a costume, kind of pro-choice, even obnoxious or offensive costumes. The protest crowd cornered Christakis on the quad. He tried to have an actual discussion with them.",

They would rather grand stand and bully and hurl insults than actually make a cogent argument. Now is it any wonder why a knight foundation survey found that 54 percent of college students say the climate on campuses stifles their expression for fear of offending others? The indoctrination of these students begins earlier and earlier. I'm talking grammar and middle school.   And once reprogrammed, liberal adults deploy these student bots to do their own political bidding. Just look at the way they've used the high school students in Parkland. Certain Stoneman Douglas student successfully did use their social media platforms to spread their anti-gun demands, no doubt about it.  But let's pull back the curtain here. Groups like 'Every Town for Gun Safety,' founded by billionaire, Michael Bloomberg, gave $2.5 million to support hundreds of marches for gun control, including the big one later this month. 'The Washington Post' is telling us that high school students in the St. Louis area are not only planning a walk out on April 20th, but they are planning a protest at the office of Republican Missouri Attorney General Josh Holly, who wants to unseat Democrat Senator Claire McCaskill. Again, the goal here is political power. The idea that this is merely a student-led, totally organic altruistic crusade to end gun violence is deceiving. You are not looking at it carefully enough.   The focus here really is power and it's partisan. March on the nearest conservative, take down one of the biggest advocacy groups like the NRA, you bet. Don't fall for all the fresh young faces you see reciting the liberal tropes. These student protesters are amplified, supported and funded by old guard liberals. Hollywood elites like George Clooney and Oprah. Business elites like Michael Bloomberg and the media vanguard at places like NBC and of course, CNN. So, without all of that support, of course, they wouldn't be receiving this attention. Maybe they would even be back at school learning something. But when you can get college credit, or maybe even a fast pass to the Ivy League by protesting, why study? Hanging out with Bill Maher and Ellen and helping me find my truth and social justice mission, totally. And that's the Angle.   Yesterday the mayor of Baltimore, Maryland, announced the city will help students get to the 'March For Our Lives,' that gun-control rally in Washington later this month.",

So, they want their voices to be heard and we thought it was important to address them, to welcome them and at the same time, we were being reached out as a city close to Washington asking if we would be interested in helping young people to get to Washington, D.C., so that their voices could be heard as it relates to gun violence in this country. And as you well know, we've had some 320 different school shootings since 2013 and when young people are asking you, are you protecting our schools, are you protecting us, are you going to make sure we are safe?

Sensational stories, many of them you haven't heard anywhere else. Coast- to-coast, we have it covered. There's an explosive war of words underway in California over the sanctuary state laws there as the Attorney General Jeff Sessions sues the state. Governor Jerry Brown calls Sessions a liar who is just launching a reign of terror. Nice. Plus, a pair of chilling domestic terror stories including a cross-country jihad. The rest of the media are virtually ignoring this. And Dr. Phil analyzes the White House, what? While the media assails the president, it's all in our unseen and seen segments. But first, reading, writing and activism, our collegiate indoctrination factories. That's the focus of tonight's Angle. Watching how things have played out during the first 13 months of the Trump era, I've come to the conclusion that liberals just aren't that interested in advocating policies that improve the lives of Americans. But what they do want, and part of the Obama legacy is a constant state of protest and agitation. A resistance force fed to them in their high school and college years and now professors themselves are nurturing the next generation of revolutionaries. At many colleges, students are now expected to skip class to attend social justice rallies. Case and point, on Yale's admissions blog under the title 'In support of student protests', the assistant director of admissions writes, 'For those students who come to Yale, we expect them to be versed in issues of social justice.' According to Walter Olson and your 'Wall Street Journal,' Yale does not count skipping classes for protests like we've seen lately against the applicant. No problem whatsoever. Check this out, the dean of admissions at Tufts University, her name is Karen Richardson, after the Parkland shooting issued this statement to applicants. She said, 'I want to assure you that Tufts is a place where civic engagement is not only tolerated, it's encouraged strongly. So, when you act on your values in a principled way on issues about which you feel passionately, it will not be held against you in the application process. In fact, we may even take notice.' Forget volunteering with the elderly or helping special needs children, put that on your college application. If you really want to get into that college of your choice, go yell at a conservative senator and then posted on YouTube. There are other universities also stoking activism out there. At Valdosta State in Georgia, the Women and Gender Studies Department encourages students in their division to organize and implement annual social justice events such as the Intimate Partner Violence Awareness Month, and the productions of The Vagina Monologues and National Coming Out Day. But politically perhaps I have to think about this. No one did more to encourage student organizing like Barack Obama. Last year, he talked about training the next generation of community organizers."

      "utterance": "I and others have been talking about how we can create an effective network of global activists, some who are in politics, some who are in business, some who are in journalism or working for NGOs, and provide them the tools, the training, the networks, the relationships, the funding so that they can be even more effective."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "I thought we were supposed to be training like cold writers to work in the 21st Century economy, but we are training the activists. I would say about what the president said there, they've already been pretty effective, right, policing speech codes on college campuses, ejecting administrators who don't toe their political line and now pushing for DACA and gun control laws. But there's something insidious afoot here. A few years ago, Nicholas Christakis, who is the head of a Yale college was forced to resign after his wife, also a professor, dared to send out a mass email objecting to Yale's Halloween costume rules. She suggested merely that Yale students be allowed to wear whatever they want as a costume, kind of pro-choice, even obnoxious or offensive costumes. The protest crowd cornered Christakis on the quad. He tried to have an actual discussion with them."

      "utterance": "This is not a debate, did you hear that? At least they admit it now. They are not interested in debate. They would rather grand stand and bully and hurl insults than actually make a cogent argument. Now is it any wonder why a knight foundation survey found that 54 percent of college students say the climate on campuses stifles their expression for fear of offending others? The indoctrination of these students begins earlier and earlier. I'm talking grammar and middle school. And once reprogrammed, liberal adults deploy these student bots to do their own political bidding. Just look at the way they've used the high school students in Parkland. Certain Stoneman Douglas student successfully did use their social media platforms to spread their anti-gun demands, no doubt about it. But let's pull back the curtain here. Groups like 'Every Town for Gun Safety,' founded by billionaire, Michael Bloomberg, gave $2.5 million to support hundreds of marches for gun control, including the big one later this month. 'The Washington Post' is telling us that high school students in the St. Louis area are not only planning a walk out on April 20th, but they are planning a protest at the office of Republican Missouri Attorney General Josh Holly, who wants to unseat Democrat Senator Claire McCaskill. Again, the goal here is political power. The idea that this is merely a student-led, totally organic altruistic crusade to end gun violence is deceiving. You are not looking at it carefully enough. The focus here really is power and it's partisan. March on the nearest conservative, take down one of the biggest advocacy groups like the NRA, you bet. Don't fall for all the fresh young faces you see reciting the liberal tropes. These student protesters are amplified, supported and funded by old guard liberals. Hollywood elites like George Clooney and Oprah. Business elites like Michael Bloomberg and the media vanguard at places like NBC and of course, CNN. So, without all of that support, of course, they wouldn't be receiving this attention. Maybe they would even be back at school learning something. But when you can get college credit, or maybe even a fast pass to the Ivy League by protesting, why study? Hanging out with Bill Maher and Ellen and helping me find my truth and social justice mission, totally. And that's the Angle. Yesterday the mayor of Baltimore, Maryland, announced the city will help students get to the 'March For Our Lives,' that gun-control rally in Washington later this month."

We didn't even know the young people who are marching down to city hall. But when we did hear that they were coming, I thought it important to receive them because when you have these many young people who are afraid and frightened to be in our classrooms, who are asking you to help them go out and want to have you hear their voices. I mean, they did not necessarily even know about the march in Washington, some of them, but many of them wanted their voices to be heard in terms of the violence that's happening in our city, in our country, and throughout this nation. So, they want their voices to be heard and we thought it was important to address them, to welcome them and at the same time, we were being reached out as a city close to Washington asking if we would be interested in helping young people to get to Washington, D.C., so that their voices could be heard as it relates to gun violence in this country. And as you well know, we've had some 320 different school shootings since 2013 and when young people are asking you, are you protecting our schools, are you protecting us, are you going to make sure we are safe? Just in our state alone, our governor has issued additional resources to help schools to become more safe."

Ethics county prosecutor said Ali Muhammad Brown was radicalized online and wanted to avenge U.S. policy in the Middle East. Meanwhile in St. George, Utah, police arrested a boy at his high school yesterday after finding a homemade bomb in his backpack. Investigators say the boy also admitted to replacing an American flag with an ISIS flag at a nearby school last month as well as spray painting 'ISIS is coming' on the school's exterior. What's going on here? No one is talking about the stories. Let's ask Jim Hanson, the terrorism expert and the president of Security Study Group.

After the Parkland shooting we would think that this would have gotten a lot of attention. An individual who tries to bang a bomb in a backpack. Turns out this kid in Utah of all places had tried to put the ISIS flag on another school and had done ISIS graffiti.

You would think the rest of the media might have been interested in the fact that had this bomb gone off dozens or more children could have been killed by this guy at ISIS's beck and call.

NRA membership has surged to record levels according to the organization. Now, Malloy, what he's doing, and I know his act really well, he's trying to deflect from his pathetic record at home. Cannot believe he was reelected. Companies are fleeing the state of Connecticut en masse. While the rest of the country is gaining jobs Connecticut lost thousands of jobs at the end of last year. And his rabid gun control policies alone have cost the state 3,000 manufacturing jobs and lost them nearly $50 million in taxes since 2013. Nice going, governor.
