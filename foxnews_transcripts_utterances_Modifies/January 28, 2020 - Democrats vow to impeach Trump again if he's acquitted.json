The President's impeachment defense rested today and went out with a bang. A member of that team Robert Ray is here. He's going to tell us what to expect next. Also, Adam Schiff threw a temper tantrum following the proceedings. Our legal eagles plus Congressman Lee Zeldin and Steve Scalise are here to react. And as the conversation moves to witnesses, we have two lawmakers on the frontlines of that debate. Senators Marsha Blackburn and James Lankford are both here.  Plus, THE INGRAHAM ANGLE brings you another investigation tonight. We have new information about how the person supposedly behind the entire Trump impeachment effort might have tried to take out the President well before that. But first, the Democrats mood Schiff, that's the focus of tonight's ANGLE.  What a difference 24 hours makes. Yesterday, Democrats and their media allies were positively giddy using phrases like blockbuster revelation, bombshell leak and impeachment game-changer. Well, they were sure that a story about John Bolton's new book would be enough to convince four Republicans to keep this twisted trial going. But today after the Trump defense team wrapped up its arguments even yielding back time to the Senate, the mood on the Left seems to have well shifted. Or should I say it, Adam shifted.",

One, simply on the off chance that they can defeat Trump, which I don't think they really believe they can, which is why Schiff was saying, well, you know, if we don't remove him now, you can't trust the election. You know, he might as well have said, hey, we know we're going to lose this thing come the fall.

The President's impeachment defense rested today and went out with a bang. A member of that team Robert Ray is here. He's going to tell us what to expect next. Also, Adam Schiff threw a temper tantrum following the proceedings. Our legal eagles plus Congressman Lee Zeldin and Steve Scalise are here to react. And as the conversation moves to witnesses, we have two lawmakers on the frontlines of that debate. Senators Marsha Blackburn and James Lankford are both here. Plus, THE INGRAHAM ANGLE brings you another investigation tonight. We have new information about how the person supposedly behind the entire Trump impeachment effort might have tried to take out the President well before that. But first, the Democrats mood Schiff, that's the focus of tonight's ANGLE. What a difference 24 hours makes. Yesterday, Democrats and their media allies were positively giddy using phrases like blockbuster revelation, bombshell leak and impeachment game-changer. Well, they were sure that a story about John Bolton's new book would be enough to convince four Republicans to keep this twisted trial going. But today after the Trump defense team wrapped up its arguments even yielding back time to the Senate, the mood on the Left seems to have well shifted. Or should I say it, Adam shifted."

Yes, CNN, MSNBC, the panelists there, Chuck Todd, Jake Tapper, et cetera, et cetera. Look, they don't have the votes to remove Trump. Democrats don't have those votes. Everyone on television was conceding that today. So, what is the point of doing this to the country? Well, as they did during the Kavanaugh fight, they just want to drag this out in hopes that the next news cycle will bring them some man from heaven to damage the President before the first ballots are cast. Our reporter at the New Jersey rally tonight tells us that they're serving drinks called Magaritas, and subpoena-coladas. Very cheeky, all over Wildwood, New Jersey. Should these moderate Republicans vote to help Schiff, Pelosi and Nadler prolong this national nightmare? There won't be enough booze in all of New Jersey to soothe the political pain coming their way. That will be political suicide. And that's THE ANGLE. Joining me now is Sol Wisenberg, former Deputy Independent Counsel, Bob Barr, former Clinton Impeachment Manager, and John Eastman, Claremont Institute Senior Fellow, Constitutional Scholar. John let's start with you. Now, John Bolton, Mick Mulvaney or any of the other witnesses, sorry, I should add, General Kelly, who's really relevant to this conversation, do any of them change the underlying facts of this case that night after night, we've been laying out."

And it really is funny to see these Democrats twist themselves around in circles like pretzels, trying to explain why what they said then is not really what they meant now. And the only dangerous one in all this, it isn't Schiff, it isn't Lofgren, it isn't Hakeem Jeffries. It's Chuck Schumer. Chuck Schumer is a very crafty, very mean-spirited street fighter. And he knows that if he can peel off some of these squishy Republicans, which he may very well do, he can keep this charade going for longer and longer and longer, which is what they want. There is no end game to what they're doing here. It is simply to go after Trump endlessly. And then maybe it will bring in something that Rex Tillerson said last month when he was in Texas, overheard - you get the point, what I am doing. I mean they're just - every day they're hoping that someone says something in the stratosphere of the former Trump staffers that they can advance our argument with. And Sol, this is what was said on CNN today about the recognition that there's no way they're going to ever have 67 senators to vote to remove this President. Watch."

And so, the longer you can have a trial, the more witnesses you can get, the better your opportunities are. But I just - I personally, as a citizen of this country, I demand to hear from General Kelly, and I want to know what he has to say about the Third Amendment."

      "utterance": "John, isn't it? It's not funny because what is being done to our Constitution, our entire representative democracy, if this thing is allowed to keep going. It is enormously toxic for the republic? I'm trying to create some moments of levity here, because otherwise I'll get beyond. I'm enraged about this. When I went to the Senate chamber, I was at gallery. I was enraged. First time, I was enraged and fell asleep. Second time, I was enraged and forced myself to sit through it. But I heard both sides and I was still enraged. Go ahead."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "EASTMAN",
      "utterance": "Well, and you ought to be. Look, they have turned this into the very thing the founders feared that if you admit in these nebulous charges, it's comparable to what they rejected at the convention, maladministration. And you turn impeachment into a perpetual political weapon and that destroys the possibility of any collaborative effort toward the common good. I just wanted to ask Zoe Lofgren, though, if she thinks the Republicans back in 1998 got rid of the word high crimes, a misdemeanor, they've gotten rid of the word crimes. They don't think even need a crime as long as they can put enough stuff out there. We don't like what he was doing. That's enough for an impeachment. We cannot have that as a standard or the President will no longer be an independent constitutional officer. He will simply be answerable to whatever the latest majority is in Congress."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Yes, the whims of Congress. If they dislike a policy or several policies, just moved to impeach him on some leaked so-called whistleblowers account and then be done with it.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "INGRAHAM",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARR",
      "utterance": "Well, she has about as much merit to her point as Zoe Lofgren did to hers. Absolutely not. What we had in the Clinton impeachment and then the trial back 21 years ago was a President who had already been reelected. It was not about an election back then. It was about high crimes and misdemeanors, proven crimes that the President had committed. This case, what they are trying to do is two-fold. One, simply on the off chance that they can defeat Trump, which I don't think they really believe they can, which is why Schiff was saying, well, you know, if we don't remove him now, you can't trust the election. You know, he might as well have said, hey, we know we're going to lose this thing come the fall. But the second thing that they're trying to do is they're trying to devalue and diminish Trump's credibility going forward in the same way that they did with Justice Kavanaugh. That's what it's really about, reducing their credibility."

If they get another vacancy before the election, this will be another argument that they can make to say, we're not going to let this go forward. There's no way you can because he's an impeached President. I think they're thinking down the road on that as well, possibly."

There's a difference between conduct that the framers might say, well, that's within the realm of what could be impeachable and removing a President. There's a difference. And I think it's completely legitimate to say, even if we don't like what the President did, we're not going to remove him from office. And it's very relevant that the removal would be 10 months before an election and the framers would have understood that."

Well, we expect him to speak for an hour and a half, two hours. But I thought it was really quite smart for him to - what else we're going to say, it's basically so obvious that we're going to give you the luxury of time back, which I think a lot of these senators probably really liked."

    {
      "speaker": "RAY",
      "utterance": "I think they appreciated it. I think we also did what we promised we would do at the outset. Look, the bottom-line as you have recognized for some time. We don't have trials just as sort of roving fact gatherers to decide anything under the sun. The task at hand is to have a trial to determine whether or not it's appropriate to remove the President from office. End of story. Once you've made your argument with regard to that question, which is, after all, the only question to be decided, I think it's time to sit down and let the senators - and put your faith and trust in them, as Pat Cipollone said at the end, and respect and abide by their wisdom. They're the people's elected representatives in this body. And that's what they're - that's what they're elected to do."
    },

Why don't the Republicans and Democrats start working together for the common good? Do the things that you were sent here to do that was actually really inspiring, I thought. And I think people who aren't really political watch that this probably saying to themselves, yes, that sounds pretty good."

      "utterance": "The president made those public comments that you referenced both on MSNBC and to the Russians, which was captured in the Oval Office. Put together these circumstances were articulable facts that indicated that a crime may have been committed. All those same sorts of facts cause us to wonder, is there an inappropriate relationship, a connection between this president and the government of Russia?"

      "utterance": "Could it be that a fairly young staffer who seems like a Democrat mole is at the heart of all three of these major events that lead to more and more trouble and perhaps the removal of a president of the United States, Lee Zeldin? Lee Smith. I have too many Lee's on the show tonight. It's impeachment. Sorry."

If they wind up calling witnesses, and I think we all hope this doesn't happen, but if it happens, this is an email that we certainly want to know what this whistleblower has been involved in and how many campaigns against the president he's been involved in."

      "speaker": "CARTER",
      "utterance": "They can't be shielded because they're really not an actual whistleblower, and it's actually an insult to whistleblowers who sacrifice everything and have firsthand knowledge and report facts and have to go public eventually and talk about those facts. This is somebody who appears to be targeting President Trump from deep within, from deep within the government, and somebody who needs to answer questions. And this is why even the Inspector General for the Intelligence Community, Michael Atkinson, needs to be questioned. His connections with the whistleblower, Adam Schiff's connections with the whistleblower and his committee need to be questioned. On its face, there is something that is extraordinarily wrong."

We could do a movie about this. No one would believe it. My earring fell off. Just to celebrate that fact, we've got to go. With that hearing, we have to go. Panel, thanks so much."

During an interview on Saturday night, one of my guests said something that made me laugh. And while in the moment I found that joke humorous, and I didn't catch everything that was said. I was laughing at the joke and not at any group of people."
