I have been a pretty tough critic of this president for a year or so, but I give him a lot of credit for listening, as he did the other day, to some pretty horrible stories, and coming up with ideas that I think we should be talking about. I get a little more excited about his discussion of a universal background check. That's something of course that has 97 percent or so of the American public behind it. Today, you don't get a background check if you make a private sale, if you buy at a gun show. That's an easy win that, would it solve all of the problems? Of course it wouldn't.  But just doing that, consistent with Second Amendment rights, I do suspect we could take some steps to keeping guns out of the hands of people who should not have them.",

Look, I do that we should provide incentives to states to contribute to that database where a gun store, a gun dealer can check to see if somebody has been ruled a danger to themselves or to others. I would even -- I just happen to have come from a meeting with a bunch of law enforcement guys here in Fairfield, Connecticut. And we should also talk about that moment when somebody has a temporary retraining order issued on them because they have been deemed to be violent towards their wife or whatever it may be.  I understand this gets into touchy constitutional issues. But there's moments when it would be good for the police on a temporary basis to say hey, for some period of time here, we have got to take the weapons out of the house, as long as there is some question about whether somebody is prone to be violent.",

The FBI botching this January 5 call by someone who was very concerned about the school shooter, that he might pull something like this off. And then it got lost. We have seen it on Boston on Patriots' Day after the slip-up, not being communicated about the Tsarnaev brothers by the FBI to local police. We saw it after 9/11. I can go back further and further.

But it's hard, because you made reference to the Boston case. Look, the FBI check out the Tsarnaev brothers in Boston.
