I think that's an important point that certainly meets the concern of Russia about NATO, future NATO relationship. Number two, with regards to these areas that are under Russian control right now, I think the people there ought to have a right to a referendum to decide whether they want to go with Russia or with Ukraine. I think that could be a potential way to try to resolve those issues. Number three, it's very clear that the Russians have to remove their troops from Ukraine in order to be able to arrive at any kind of meaningful cease- fire.

It's now in a lockdown for some 25 million people, Shanghai Disney shut down. And the fear is, since that's a very, very frenetic market for business in general, that demand will subside, and it could lead China to slip into maybe a slowdown or worse. And that was weighing on prices and the notion maybe that the brunt of that we feared could be stopped by a global recession. Whether it's justified or not, it did affect prices today.

Russian and Ukrainian delegates are arriving in Istanbul for negotiations between Russia and Ukraine which will take place tomorrow and Wednesday. Zelenskyy says that Ukraine could declare neutrality. At the same time, these kinds of conversations so far had had no effect in changing the ongoing situation and no effect in stopping some of the attacks, like the attacks that we saw here just a couple miles from the city center on Saturday. Meanwhile, the U.N. is making its best effort to send in as much military aid as possible. It was able to send in a massive amount of food and medical supplies to Kharkiv today.

      "sentences": "Well, yes, I mean, clearly, he did not apologize to Chris Rock. I think here's the thing with Will Smith. We clearly saw somebody who snapped. I mean, like, I'm sure he was probably later on a little bit embarrassed to realize what he just did. But, in that moment, he clearly snapped. Here's the thing. We shouldn't -- number one, you shouldn't be physically attacking anybody, OK? Let's leave that -- let's not have that happen. Number two, if you're going to slap somebody, don't let it be a comedian who's Chris Rock, whose whole entire brand and persona is to make fun of people and take jabs at them. And, three, don't do it during the Oscars and the biggest telecast for anybody in Hollywood. I truly think that, if Will Smith perhaps instead of actually slapping, maybe if they just -- the camera went to him and he just stared or glared at him or even said, \"Not funny,\" that would have made an even bigger point than right now, because, right now, Will Smith is -- he's the punch line now. He is -- for lack of better words or a phrase, but he is literally now going to be the butt of all jokes. And for Chris Rock, the secondary ticket sales -- he's on tour right now. He's on a comedy tour right now. Those things have skyrocketed. Ticket prices in the last 24 hours have skyrocketed for Chris Rock, because everyone wants to see what they're -- you know, what he's going to say next, what his response is. And going into what you were talking with Abby about, I don't think the Oscars to take away his trophy. I think maybe he gets like he can't come back next year or maybe a five-year ban. I don't think we need to be taking away the trophy. The bottom line is, he still won. He still did the movie. He still did a stellar job. Listen, he's embarrassed. He's not -- this is -- it was the biggest moment of his life for winning an award. And this is what he's going to be remembered for, the slap.",

And I truly don't believe that it was. But if the Oscars were smart, Neil, they would have Chris Rock host next year, because that would guarantee people would tune in. They should have Chris Rock. Tune in next year, because, Neil, the ratings just came down. And they broke up the hours. It was on -- it was on path to be the lowest rated Oscars of all time, lower than last year, which was the worst one. They had about nine million viewers before that happened. Afterwards, when it went all crazy across -- viral across social media, they jumped to over 15 million. So, it definitely worked for people talking about it.",

Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto, and this is \"Your World.\" And what in the world to make of the commander in chief still in some deal controversy over what he intended when he said that the guy has got to go. Does this guy have to go? Or is the message so clear, given the sanction environment and the punishment environment, with so many countries and individuals saying that they should remain in effect, no matter how the Ukraine war ends, as long as Vladimir Putin is in charge of Russia? It does seem to be consistent. Is it? Let's go right now to David Spunt at the White House with the fallout after explaining the fallout -- David."

Reaction to this, well, walking back, however you want to call it -- the president said he is not walking back anything -- from Leon Panetta, the former defense secretary, the former CIA director, former White House chief of staff. Director, always good having you. Did the president adequately explain his position?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LEON PANETTA, FORMER U.S. SECRETARY OF DEFENSE",
      "utterance": "Well, look, I think all of us share moral outrage about Putin and the brutality that he shown towards the Ukrainian people. That's understandable. But this is a moment in time when we just have to be unified between the United States and our allies, show strong unity, and not raise anything that might confuse that relationship. And so I think -- I think, in the end, it's a comment that probably should not have been used. And I hope, it's important that the president exercise as much discipline as possible to make sure that whatever he says is in line with the unity that he's put together between the United States and our allies."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Isn't he also saying, though, what other leaders are saying, Secretary, that no matter how this war ends, and hopefully soon, and hopefully without much more bloodshed, sanctions and punishments should remain in effect as long as Vladimir Putin is running Russia? Aren't they both on the same page?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PANETTA",
      "utterance": "Well, I think, right now, the principal focus would be on the ability to see whether or not we could negotiate some kind of cease-fire and settlement to this conflict in the Ukraine. I'm glad that the Ukrainians and the Russians are going to be meeting with delegations in Turkey. I think that's a positive sign. I think that President Zelenskyy has indicated that he's willing to accept some kind of neutrality in Ukraine. And that could be very helpful to trying to resolve some of these issues that are there. I think the most important thing is to focus on whether or not there are areas that can be resolved that can get us a cease-fire and that can end this war that's going on in Ukraine."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "We don't know if we're going to get that tomorrow when talks resume in Turkey, to your point, Secretary. But, as a former defense secretary, would you pause if, working for another president, he or she wanted to engage Vladimir Putin, long after all of this, assuming he is still in charge of Russia? Or would you recommend, no, I think we wait it out, he's just an evil guy, he is a monster, and we don't want to be at the same table with him ever?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PANETTA",
      "utterance": "No, look, I think, no matter -- no matter how this is negotiated, no matter how it ultimately is resolved, Putin is going to be weakened as a leader,and so is Russia. And I think..."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "But he would still be a leader, right, Leon? He would still be a leader. So, do you have to talk to the guy? Do you ignore the guy? What do you do?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PANETTA",
      "utterance": "Well, I think the bottom line is that the Russians will determine who their leader is going to be. And it's up to the Russian..."
    },

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "PANETTA",
      "utterance": "I think the Russians are going to face a very difficult position, because I think Putin is, without question, seriously weakened as a result of this terrible strategic decision that he made to invade Ukraine. It was a mistake. And I think, ultimately, he's going to pay the price for that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Do you think that the president's comments, Secretary, will speed up this effort to overthrow him in Russia or take away his powers or even kill him?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PANETTA",
      "utterance": "No, I think that the Russians and the Russian people will ultimately make that decision. I think that, considering that Putin is virtually a dictator in Russia, and that the Russians have kind of tolerated his leadership for a long time, it's going to -- it's going to take a real effort within Russia to be able to ultimately see if he's going to be replaced. I think it's a -- I don't think it's a fait accompli that somehow Putin is automatically going to get kicked out of office by the Russian people."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Do you think that we are better off with Putin gone, regardless, down the road? There is another expression, as you're well aware. The devil you know is better than the devil you don't. He could be replaced by someone who is much more dangerous. What do you think?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PANETTA",
      "utterance": "Well, that's always the case when you go after a bad leader. It was the case when we were going after bin Laden, that, even though we would be successful, they would always try to get somebody to replace him. I understand that. But the fact is, if you can get rid of one bad leader, I think it -- the chances are pretty good that the next leader, you might very well have a better relationship with, in terms of trying to work out the issues that we have with Russia. Look, we're living in the 21st century. This is a global world. I hope that, ultimately, in a global world, we can find a way to have a relationship with Russia that involves peace and prosperity."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Very quickly, Secretary, as well, these peace negotiations pick up tomorrow, as you know. And one of the things that we're told the Russians are keen on is keeping the land they have already locked down or quasi-locked down in the eastern part of the country, parts of the south, and that that might be a negotiating chit. By that, I mean they would want to keep that to secure an agreement and walk away. Do you think Ukraine would accept that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PANETTA",
      "utterance": "I doubt it. I think President Zelenskyy is not particularly interested in rewarding the Russians for the invasion that they made on Ukraine and allowing them to have territory that they conquered by military force. But, having said that, I think that there are a combination of issues, one being the neutrality that President Zelenskyy said he would support. I think that's an important point that certainly meets the concern of Russia about NATO, future NATO relationship. Number two, with regards to these areas that are under Russian control right now, I think the people there ought to have a right to a referendum to decide whether they want to go with Russia or with Ukraine. I think that could be a potential way to try to resolve those issues. Number three, it's very clear that the Russians have to remove their troops from Ukraine in order to be able to arrive at any kind of meaningful cease- fire. So, there are a lot of key elements here that I think could be worked out, assuming that both sides want to try to resolve this terrible war we're in."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "So, very quickly, then, given the president -- President Biden's comments about Leon -- about Vladimir Putin -- I'm sorry -- and that he wasn't really dialing them back, do you think that has emboldened Vladimir Putin to do pretty much whatever the hell he wants, because he figures he has nothing to lose?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "PANETTA",
      "utterance": "You know, my experience with Putin is, he's a bully, but he's also not stupid. And I think he's somebody who's been well-criticized by the world community, particularly after what he did in Ukraine. But I suspect that his primary worry right now is whether or not he's going to be able to wrap up this terrible war in Ukraine with at least some, some declaration that it represented accomplishment of some of the missions he was after. That's going to be what Putin is going to have to focus on in order to be able to get the hell out of there."

    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, another development today was a collapse in oil prices. I say collapse, $10 or so. It's still very, very pricey, but the catalyst for this had nothing to do with Ukraine war, everything to do with a spike in COVID cases right now in China that has virtually shut down Shanghai. It's now in a lockdown for some 25 million people, Shanghai Disney shut down. And the fear is, since that's a very, very frenetic market for business in general, that demand will subside, and it could lead China to slip into maybe a slowdown or worse. And that was weighing on prices and the notion maybe that the brunt of that we feared could be stopped by a global recession. Whether it's justified or not, it did affect prices today. But, in Ukraine, the focus right now is just living each day. And the latest in Lviv with our Alex Hogan on that -- Alex."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "You know, up until about 48 hours ago, there was a time in Ukraine, Lviv, on the western side of the country, you didn't have to worry about airstrikes or missile strike. That all changed Saturday, of course. And now those peace talks that resumed tomorrow in Turkey are getting an extra close eye. Alex Hogan with more from Lviv -- Alex."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HOGAN",
      "utterance": "Hi, Neil. So we have heard sirens just about an hour ago here in Lviv. Meanwhile, there is intense shelling taking place outside of the capital of Kyiv. And over in Mariupol, the mayor is now saying that most of the city has been taken over and is calling for an immediate evacuation of all of the residents who live there. Again, changing dynamics hour by hour, as we continue to cover the conflict here. And people had previously been told to evacuate if they could, but the mayor in Mariupol said that 160,000 people remained trapped in the city. Meanwhile, outside of Kyiv, the mayor of Irpin says that Ukrainian troops managed to liberate the town from Russian soldiers. Still, he says that Russian attacks are far from over."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "OLEKSANDR MARKUSHYN, MAYOR OF IRPIN, UKRAINE",
      "utterance": "It's not possible to return to Irpin yet. It's not safe yet. We're consolidating at our new positions. We will next move to liberate Bucha, Gostomel, Vorzel,"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HOGAN",
      "utterance": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy last night told defenders of Mariupol that they could retreat, an offer that they declined, saying that they would not leave behind the dead and the wounded. Well, this is new footage of what the scene looks like in Mariupol. Again tonight, the mayor is calling on people there to flee; 6.5 million people are displaced within Ukraine; 3.8 million people have fled the country altogether. Russian and Ukrainian delegates are arriving in Istanbul for negotiations between Russia and Ukraine which will take place tomorrow and Wednesday. Zelenskyy says that Ukraine could declare neutrality. At the same time, these kinds of conversations so far had had no effect in changing the ongoing situation and no effect in stopping some of the attacks, like the attacks that we saw here just a couple miles from the city center on Saturday. Meanwhile, the U.N. is making its best effort to send in as much military aid as possible. It was able to send in a massive amount of food and medical supplies to Kharkiv today. Kharkiv is the second largest city in Ukraine, and people there over the weekend had been huddled, sleeping in train stations. But getting some of that international aid at this point is still not possible in many of the cities like Mariupol that need it most -- Neil."

      "utterance": "Alex Hogan in Lviv. Thank you, Alex, very, very much. To Dan Hoffman right now, the former CIA station chief in Moscow, FOX News contributor. Dan, I had Leon Panetta with me a few minutes ago. You might have heard some of that. And he thinks that Vladimir Putin's future is really based on what the Russian people think of him, that the outcome of the war is one thing, but his support is undeniable up to now, and that might hold for a while. But, again, his fate is really in the hands of the Russian people. Do you agree with that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DAN HOFFMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "I do. I would -- I guess I would fine-tune those comments just a little bit and say that Vladimir Putin's fate is in the hands of those who could remove him. And so the moment that Russian military stop taking Vladimir Putin's orders to rain down hell on innocent Ukrainian civilians, the moment that his intelligence services stop doing the work that they're -- that he's -- that Putin is asking them to do in Ukraine to find and fix those Ukrainian targets and then target them lethally, then things are going to get different and change for Vladimir Putin. I don't think at this point that the mass of the Russian population is going to remove Vladimir Putin. Putin has mounted a massive Soviet-style repression, with control of the media, efforts to control protests and things in the major cities. But, again, his key leadership, that's another story. And that's why I think it's important for the United States with -- President Biden could have refined his statement a little bit from his excellent speech yesterday to say that, look, it's up to the Russian military. We don't -- to decide that they're no longer going to take Vladimir Putin's unlawful, unethical, immoral orders. And if they do that, then there's a chance for us to have a relationship with Russia. But, until that point, then we won't."

You know, if there's one thing I learned at the CIA, especially serving three years in a war zone side by side with the U.S. military, it's that message discipline matters for leaders, whether it's a brigade commander or the president of United States, being extremely clear in the delivery of the message, not -- to your targeted audience. And in this case, President Biden was speaking to the troops in Poland and to the United States, to our population, writ large. He was also speaking to Russian citizens, to the extent to which they could -- they could hear his speech, and Russian senior figures, who I'm sure did listen to the speech. And I just don't think that President Biden was clear enough and specific enough, as he could have been in those three cases that Peter Doocy outlined."

I have implemented the things that I tell people our duty to make Georgia number one in the country for business and have opportunity, no matter what your neighborhood, and stand up to woke corporations and do the right thing when no one's watching. And that's exactly what I have been doing here in the state of Georgia. So I'm running on my record. The ultimate endorsement is on May 24, when Georgians go to the polls. And I'm reminding of my -- reminding them of my conservative record and reminding them that I have done what I said I would do I followed the law and I followed the Constitution. And my ultimate goal is preventing Stacey Abrams for being our governor or our next president. And I'm the one that has the record to prevent that. And we need people in the fight to help us do that.

So I'm focused on what I could do and what I could control. That's what I have done. That's what I will continue to be doing as your governor. I'm not going to sit there and -- David Perdue is trying to blame everybody but himself for his loss. And that's not something that I can control. I'm focused on today and what we're going to do tomorrow and the day after that to win this primary, and then unite everyone to stop Stacey Abrams from being our governor, because, if she is, Neil, we're going to see the exact same policies that we have in Washington, D.C., in the state of Georgia.

The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, the group that hands out the Oscars now, has condemned Will Smith's slap of Chris Rock. And now is reviewing the incident, possible punishment. The read right now from our own Mike Gunzelman. We call him Gunz, the Internet radio host sensation, Abby Hornacek here as well, the FOX Nation host, extremely popular figures, both. So, Abby, they're contemplating -- that is, the Academy -- punishment. What if they go so far as to take his Oscar away? What do you think? ABBY HORNACEK, \"PARK'D\" HOST: Well, I think they might, Neil. I'm just -- I'm confused why they're just now exploring the consequences. Imagine if this was the NBA and LeBron James was on the court, and he was being heckled by a fan. And he went into the stands and slapped the fan across the side of the face. You think the league would be like, oh, no, LeBron, you can stay? And, oh, wait, actually, we're going to also give you the MVP Award. That's essentially what happened, right? He would be ejected in two seconds. So I think the Academy is right in exploring consequences. I do think they should have acted sooner. Will Smith should not have been sitting in that seat after that incident. He should have been removed right away. Should Chris Rock had made that joke? No, especially if he knew about Jada Pinkett Smith's alopecia. You just don't cross that line, go after someone's medical condition."

But, Gunz, I do want to play back what Will Smith had to say upon accepting his Oscar. He apologized to a lot of folks, because this was a few minutes after this incident, but one. Take a look at this."

    {
      "speaker": "MIKE GUNZELMAN, FOX NEWS HEADLINES ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER",
      "utterance": "Well, yes, I mean, clearly, he did not apologize to Chris Rock. I think here's the thing with Will Smith. We clearly saw somebody who snapped. I mean, like, I'm sure he was probably later on a little bit embarrassed to realize what he just did. But, in that moment, he clearly snapped. Here's the thing. We shouldn't -- number one, you shouldn't be physically attacking anybody, OK? Let's leave that -- let's not have that happen. Number two, if you're going to slap somebody, don't let it be a comedian who's Chris Rock, whose whole entire brand and persona is to make fun of people and take jabs at them. And, three, don't do it during the Oscars and the biggest telecast for anybody in Hollywood. I truly think that, if Will Smith perhaps instead of actually slapping, maybe if they just -- the camera went to him and he just stared or glared at him or even said, \"Not funny,\" that would have made an even bigger point than right now, because, right now, Will Smith is -- he's the punch line now. He is -- for lack of better words or a phrase, but he is literally now going to be the butt of all jokes. And for Chris Rock, the secondary ticket sales -- he's on tour right now. He's on a comedy tour right now. Those things have skyrocketed. Ticket prices in the last 24 hours have skyrocketed for Chris Rock, because everyone wants to see what they're -- you know, what he's going to say next, what his response is. And going into what you were talking with Abby about, I don't think the Oscars to take away his trophy. I think maybe he gets like he can't come back next year or maybe a five-year ban. I don't think we need to be taking away the trophy. The bottom line is, he still won. He still did the movie. He still did a stellar job. Listen, he's embarrassed. He's not -- this is -- it was the biggest moment of his life for winning an award. And this is what he's going to be remembered for, the slap."

      "speaker": "HORNACEK",

And, look, I mean, Will Smith, I think -- I might be unpopular in this opinion, but I think, as soon as you enter the public sphere, you have the moral obligation to be a role model, whether you want to or not.

    {
      "speaker": "GUNZELMAN",
      "utterance": "Yes, he did not live up to the standards. But let's be honest. We're talking about Hollywood here. Very few people are these great role models, especially in the Hollywood elite club. I think there's -- the other topic that's been going on right now is, was this all a work? And I truly don't believe that it was. But if the Oscars were smart, Neil, they would have Chris Rock host next year, because that would guarantee people would tune in. They should have Chris Rock. Tune in next year, because, Neil, the ratings just came down. And they broke up the hours. It was on -- it was on path to be the lowest rated Oscars of all time, lower than last year, which was the worst one. They had about nine million viewers before that happened. Afterwards, when it went all crazy across -- viral across social media, they jumped to over 15 million. So, it definitely worked for people talking about it."
