      "sentences": "Alright. I'm Laura Ingraham. This is \"The Ingraham Angle\" from another busy, busy Washington. Mollie Hemingway, Ben Shapiro, both will be here in moments to react to the abomination that was that Bill Barr hearing today. Also tonight, doctors vilified and censored for telling their COVID treatment stories. What's going on there? One of the doctors who organized yesterday's now infamous event is here exclusively.  And Senator Josh Hawley takes apart big pharma - oh I can't wait for this - after one major drug company issued a threat after the President's executive order to lower drug prices.  But first, berating Barr, befriending rioters, that's the focus of Tonight's Angle.  Over the past month or so, the Angle has been telling you that there's virtually no distance between the mobs in Portland and Seattle trying to burn down federal buildings and the Democrats on Capitol Hill. And once again, they've proved our point. For several hours today, we saw the mobsters at work, but they weren't outside the building. They were inside, verbally, viciously attacking one of the most well respected legal minds in America, our Attorney General Bill Barr.",

Because they know that AOC and the squad will destroy them if they deviate from the far left playbook for just a millisecond. The Democrats are more terrified of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez plus three because they're worried about her endorsing a primary challenger. They're worried more about that than what any reasonable American thinks. Ever since the impeachment effort failed, the Democrats have jumped on one crazy theory after another. Barr is a thoughtful and dedicated civil servant. He came out of retirement, not because he wanted something on his resume. He's already done everything.

We've heard sitting Congress people on the Democratic side suggest that these people who are serving us and protecting us and standing between the villains and civilization, we've heard them called the Gestapo. We have heard them called tyrants. We we've heard the suggestion that they are in fact the threat in these cities.

And why are Democrats doing this? Why was there not a single reason question from even one of them today? Because they know that AOC and the squad will destroy them if they deviate from the far left playbook for just a millisecond. The Democrats are more terrified of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez plus three because they're worried about her endorsing a primary challenger. They're worried more about that than what any reasonable American thinks. Ever since the impeachment effort failed, the Democrats have jumped on one crazy theory after another. Barr is a thoughtful and dedicated civil servant. He came out of retirement, not because he wanted something on his resume. He's already done everything.

But if they are to turn their - that same sort of hate and viciousness against a typical Republican, I think a lot of people understand that's what they want to do and it's what they will do if they have more power. In many ways, what we saw today was probably the best example of the choice facing American voters. There is a group of Democrats, a large group of Democrats who are unwilling to condemn violence against federal buildings and federal law enforcement officers, destruction of city centers, arson, looting, assault. They're unable to condemn those things. In fact they defend those things and they instead attack the people who are attempting to restore law and order to these places.

It's ridiculous on its face and it's disgusting because again, they're saving their most rabid language for federal law enforcement officers. We've heard sitting Congress people on the Democratic side suggest that these people who are serving us and protecting us and standing between the villains and civilization, we've heard them called the Gestapo. We have heard them called tyrants. We we've heard the suggestion that they are in fact the threat in these cities. If that's the line they're going to pursue, I think sooner or later Americans are going to fight back against this, obviously non-violently.

The reason why people don't like Attorney General William Barr is because he is attempting to hold people accountable for one of the most lawless things that has been done in the history of the country, if not the most - one of the most horrible things, which was this Russia collusion hoax, an attempt to take down the elected President of the country, to harm international relations, and to use it, to use all the tools of the intelligence services to do this. That was a horrible thing and Barr has said it clearly, and that's why they don't like him. But what's so galling about today is if you saw any pressure, it's not coming from people who are asking, it's not enough pressure coming from people who are asking for accountability. And it's all coming from people who are demanding that he stop, that he allow that lawlessness to continue, and that they be allowed to get away with what they did. And that is where the pressure is coming from."

Again, consumed by mayhem and their own leaders who seem completely unable or more accurately unwilling to stop the burning.

The Seattle City Council is currently deliberating a legislation to reduce the police force by 50%, which would have one of the lowest officers per capita of any large city if that happens. At the same time, the King County Executive Dow Constantine has pledged to close the Downtown jail and reduce the overall County jail capacity by 60% to 65%. It is just thing after thing after thing that the activists are pushing forward as we struggle with the COVID pandemic, as we struggle with this civil unrest. They're not waiting at all and their goal is very simple, abolish the police, abolish prisons and abolish the courts."

And Christopher, you got your hands on documents from King County's, it's called Zero Youth Detention Program, and they offer a template for Seattle's radical plan to abolish the prisons you just referenced. And that the document is full of ideas from critical race theory, including this page that describes white culture as \"individualism, meritocracy, progress and objectivity.\" Chris, doesn't it sound like it was written by a white supremacist there? Unbelievable."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "RUFO",
      "utterance": "Yes, there is a really increasingly fine line between old style racism and new style critical race theory. And what's happened is this, progressives have realized that the economic divide, classical Marxism is not a winning message. It has never worked anywhere it has been tried in the last century. So they've really grasped onto something that is unfortunately working much better for their aims, it's dividing people along racial lines and using the rhetoric of race to achieve the economic outcomes of Marxism. And Seattle is really ground zero and it's really astonishing, if you look at these documents, they're basically making the argument that the entire justice system is an institution of white supremacy, an institution of white domination, and the corrupt and evil racist culture, and the only solution for them, and this is at the highest levels of government, is to burn it all down. And that's what we're seeing not only in the streets, but we're seeing that in the boardrooms, in the decision-making centers, at the highest levels of government. It's really astonishing. And we haven't seen anything like this in recent history."

Christopher, stay on this for us please and thank you for bringing us this story. Now, we traveled 2000 miles east of Seattle to Chicago, where Mayor Lori Lightfoot's exceedingly bad leadership is exacerbating the horrific crime wave there now sweeping the city in the wake of George Floyd's death. But the failure isn't Lightfoot's alone; it also rests with Cook County State Attorney Kim Foxx. Now, that's right; that's a woman who refused to hold Jussie Smollett accountable for his hate crime hoax. She is now letting peaceful protesters who destroy and loot businesses off the hook. Why is she doing this? What's really her goal? Critics say she's refusing to uphold the rule of law because she wants a future in this new far left Democrat politics. Now, one of those critics and my next guest, Judge Pat O'Brien wants to derail her dangerous political ambitions. He joins me now and he's challenging her, Kim Foxx, for State's Attorney. Judge O'Brien, why is it so important in your mind that she be defeated in the next election?"

Last week HHS and the Pentagon announced that it would pay Pfizer and its German biotech partner $1.95 billion to produce 100 million doses of a COVID-19 vaccine with the option of buying an additional 500 million doses, so you do the math they are. So there is no reason U.S. citizens should be paying more than other OECD countries for other drugs that Pfizer makes. That's the whole point of this executive order. The upcharge is absurd. Here to respond is Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri. Senator, you just heard the CEO of Pfizer essentially threatening to move manufacturing overseas because of these executive orders. What does this tell you?"

They routinely charge Americans two and three and four times more for the same drugs that they charge patients in, say, Europe, France. And I know this is true because we have studies them. My home state of Missouri, they are charging people of Missouri three and four and five times more than they're charging folks in France or Germany and Canada. And I'm glad that the president is standing up to them."

And that's fine. That's what they do. But let's not all think this is all just charitable endeavors. It's a business, it's a company, but they have gotten a free ride. And I wanted to ask you, senator, about the president's decision, the administration's decision to give Kodak a boost in order to keep some medical manufacturing in the United States. There are a lot of conservatives out there, free marketeers, who would say we are playing favorites. And to that you say?"

The fact that we manufacture so few drugs any longer, particularly drugs like insulin, we manufactured zero percent in this country. Major pharmaceutical products we've found because of the COVID-19 crisis that we are deeply dependent on foreign supply chains. So I think it is incumbent to look at all the options for bringing those supply chains back, for getting medical production back in this country. And to go back to big pharma, again, I don't have any sympathies for these guys. This big pharma, big government alliance has been great for big pharma.

Heck, even earlier this year he was questioning whether China was really a geostrategic threat. That turned out to be a little bit of a problem for him as we have seen with COVID-19, which is why he doesn't want to talk about those past statements now. But this is a guy who has never stood up to China. In fact, he has been all too eager to roll out the red carpet for China, give them whatever they want, sell out our jobs, sell out our workers. That's the problem. We're still cleaning up from his mess of years ago. And why would we go back to those failed policies? We don't need more appeasement. We need to get tough on China.

Don't ask too many questions, certainly don't ask about Roe. Just trust us. I'm through with that. I want to know, because Roe is absolutely central, Roe is an unbridled act of judicial imperialism.

When you look at data from other countries, it's easy. We just don't have that kind of access here. And if anybody has any doubt that this is the answer, all they have to do is notice that YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook deleted all information about this. When did do a press conference, but we also had six hours of education from physicians explaining exactly why the drug works and going over all the safety and efficacy. They even took down our website. It's incredible. So somebody is really afraid of getting the truth.
