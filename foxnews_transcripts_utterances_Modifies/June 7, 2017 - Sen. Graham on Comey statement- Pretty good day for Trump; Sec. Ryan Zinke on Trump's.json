On top of what the president's personal attorney jumped on there about how James Comey in this testimony that's coming tomorrow, will back up what the president has said all along. That on multiple occasions, the then-FBI Director told the Commander-in-Chief he was \"not under investigation.\" Beyond that, there are other good parts of this testimony for the president as well. For example, a February 14th oval office meeting; infamous now because, remember, this is where the president allegedly, said about General Flynn, come on-to the FBI Director-let this go. Well, Comey also testified as he said, \"I had understood the president to be requesting that we drop any investigation of Flynn in connection with false statements about his conversations with the Russian Ambassador in December. I did not understand the president to be talking about the broader investigation into Russia or possible links to its campaign, about collusion.\" Which by the way Martha, there is still no evidence of that, months and months later, a good point for the president.   On top of that, in terms of that meeting, Comey says he did not tell FBI agents about that oval office meeting because he and FBI leaders \"also conclude that given that it was a one-on-one conversation, there was nothing available to corroborate my account.\" That is clearly the former FBI Director saying, it is going to be a very, very high bar to prove obstruction of justice.

So, I'm convinced that Mueller has looked at the facts, so you'd have to go and tell your side of the story.

What prosecutor, in their right mind, would allow their star witness to go out before the Senate panel of 20 senators and get beat up if he really believed he had a case? So, this is the best evidence yet that in the mind of the Special Counsel, there is no obstruction of justice case to be made against President Trump because he allowed Comey to testify in public and issue a statement. No prosecutor would ever do that if there was a real case here. And secondly, Comey has now told us all that the president is not under investigation as an individual for colluding with Russia. That President Trump is not a target or subject to a criminal investigation or counterintelligence investigation regarding colluding with the Russians.

You know, when you take a look at some of the different pieces of this statement that we got from former FBI Director Comey today, there's a couple things in here that are sort of unusual. And one is that he said: \"we,\" meaning the leadership with FBI, concluded that it made a little sense-and Ed Henry just spoke about this a moment ago-to report it to Attorney General Sessions, who we expected would likely himself from involvement in the Russian-related investigation. He did so, two weeks later.  Now, this is odd to me, because Comey is saying, you know, we figured he was going to recuse himself. Now, keep in mind that this is the middle of February. The story that he had - that Sessions had meetings that he did not recall or didn't report with Kislyak, didn't happen until March 1st. So, why was he keeping things from Sessions when there was no indication yet that Session had any issue to recuse himself?",

There is no way in hell that Jeff Sessions could preside over an investigation of the campaign that he was part of; that was never even a remote possibility.  And if President Trump is listening tonight, Jeff Sessions had no alternative, Mr. President. As a lawyer, he had to get out of the way of the investigation because he was so close to your campaign. The American people would not tolerate somebody part of the campaign investigating the campaign. That was obvious to me. It was equally obvious to me that President Trump, there's no evidence of him colluding with the Russians.

They keep advancing their technology, nuclear weapons, ballistic missiles, so we'll see. But, also, he's also frustrated because he believes that the United States rushed this missile system in there, knowing he was going to take office to succeed the president who's now in jail. As a result of that, he didn't have an opportunity to kind of vote on it himself.  The other thing, publicly what he's saying is that we've never done an environmental test for the two systems that are already there. There's total of six systems, so four are not there, and that's what he's holding off on. Environmental study takes about a year. But here's the other truth that's going on. China does not want this system in South Korea because our radars are so sophisticated they can pick up a lot of activity that China is doing. And China has been putting pressure on this new South Korean president -- China's cut off tourism, and also has put pressure on South Korean companies that are operating in China. So, China has got this president of South Korea's attention. I think, Martha, in the long run, we're in a collision course with China anyway. I know we're waiting for China to do something positive with North Korea. I doubt if they're going to achieve what we would like them to achieve. China is interested in regional hegemony. They want the United States emphasized to be reduced in the region. They're trampling on our interest in the South China Sea.",

The second thing we know is that this young lady was a Bernie supporter, hates Donald Trump, and gave out information that she took illegally, and therefore that's why she's being charged with a federal crime as she should be. People who leak information when they are sworn to secrecy have an obligation under the law not to do it. All of it gets very confusing, Martha, but it ought to be pretty simple. You break the law, pay for it. Russians, they really didn't affect the outcome. Hillary's poor campaign and Donald Trump's good campaign is what made that happen.

For example, a February 14th oval office meeting; infamous now because, remember, this is where the president allegedly, said about General Flynn, come on-to the FBI Director-let this go. Well, Comey also testified as he said, \"I had understood the president to be requesting that we drop any investigation of Flynn in connection with false statements about his conversations with the Russian Ambassador in December. I did not understand the president to be talking about the broader investigation into Russia or possible links to its campaign, about collusion.\" Which by the way Martha, there is still no evidence of that, months and months later, a good point for the president. On top of that, in terms of that meeting, Comey says he did not tell FBI agents about that oval office meeting because he and FBI leaders \"also conclude that given that it was a one-on-one conversation, there was nothing available to corroborate my account.\" That is clearly the former FBI Director saying, it is going to be a very, very high bar to prove obstruction of justice.

That means, in the mind of Special Counselor Mueller, there is no obstruction of justice case to be made. Because if he felt like he had a case, he wouldn't let Comey, his chief and only witness, go out in public and get beat up. So, I'm convinced that Mueller has looked at the facts, so you'd have to go and tell your side of the story. But if he really believed there was an obstruction of justice case to be made against the president, he would not let his star and only witness to go out and do that."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

So, you're saying the fact that he let him go out there at all, and we do know that Robert Mueller cleared, was the word, cleared James Comey to go out and talk, that you think he's already reached the conclusion that there's no crime here. And do you mean with regard to the president or overall?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GRAHAM",
      "utterance": "Obstruction of justice. Well, there's only one witness, that's Comey. And what Comey and I think Mueller's concluded: I don't have an obstruction of justice case here. Probably, they'd be worrying about what Comey said that doesn't raise the level obstruction of justice. What prosecutor, in their right mind, would allow their star witness to go out before the Senate panel of 20 senators and get beat up if he really believed he had a case? So, this is the best evidence yet that in the mind of the Special Counsel, there is no obstruction of justice case to be made against President Trump because he allowed Comey to testify in public and issue a statement. No prosecutor would ever do that if there was a real case here. And secondly, Comey has now told us all that the president is not under investigation as an individual for colluding with Russia. That President Trump is not a target or subject to a criminal investigation or counterintelligence investigation regarding colluding with the Russians. All in all, it's a pretty good day for President Trump."

You know, when you take a look at some of the different pieces of this statement that we got from former FBI Director Comey today, there's a couple things in here that are sort of unusual. And one is that he said: \"we,\" meaning the leadership with FBI, concluded that it made a little sense-and Ed Henry just spoke about this a moment ago-to report it to Attorney General Sessions, who we expected would likely himself from involvement in the Russian-related investigation. He did so, two weeks later. Now, this is odd to me, because Comey is saying, you know, we figured he was going to recuse himself. Now, keep in mind that this is the middle of February. The story that he had - that Sessions had meetings that he did not recall or didn't report with Kislyak, didn't happen until March 1st. So, why was he keeping things from Sessions when there was no indication yet that Session had any issue to recuse himself?"

Jeff Sessions is one of the most decent, honorable men I've ever met. He's very loyal to the president. He loves the law. There is no way in hell that Jeff Sessions could preside over an investigation of the campaign that he was part of; that was never even a remote possibility. And if President Trump is listening tonight, Jeff Sessions had no alternative, Mr. President. As a lawyer, he had to get out of the way of the investigation because he was so close to your campaign. The American people would not tolerate somebody part of the campaign investigating the campaign. That was obvious to me. It was equally obvious to me that President Trump, there's no evidence of him colluding with the Russians.

Because, basically, James Comey said, well, when the president was asking me, you know, could I let this go, essentially or would I get past this? It was my understanding, Jim Comey says, that he only talking about that with regard to Flynn, not with regard to the broader Russia investigation, which I thought that was interesting.

There's enough material here for the Democrats to throw some mud at the president's way tomorrow. And there's enough material here for Republicans, as Lindsey Graham did marvelously with you a few minutes ago, has said there was here, here. Did the president actually obstruct justice? Well, no, because the process of investigating General Flynn is going on. Did he attempt to obstruct justice by saying Flynn's a nice guy; I want you to make this go away?

And at some point, Reince Priebus, sticks his head back in the door, hey, what's going on? Are you guys about done in here? How do you read that?

Well, as others have said before, the innocent way to read all of these things would be that Donald Trump doesn't know - didn't know how the FBI functions, how the Department of Justice functions, what the proper relationships are, all of that stuff. And then ignorant of these things, he just said, hey, I just want to get a side word with you man. Take it easy on my boy, he's a good guy, do what you can. And then he didn't know that he was doing anything wrong. But, obviously, the people around the president were like, Oh boy; this is not what you're supposed to do. And also, knowing that Comey, as sort of this, as the head prefect of the Washington prep school, is going to be feeling very put out about this with a strong letter to follow. And they probably knew that this was a disaster in the making."

He said, James Comey said, I got back in the car and I started to immediately take notes because I wanted to remember everything that the president had said. He said: \"I began to type it on my laptop and then an FBI vehicle outside of Trump Tower. The moment that I walked out of the meeting, creating written records immediately after one-on-one conversations, he goes on to say, with Mr. Trump; was my practice from that point forward, this had not been my practice in the past.\" Your thoughts?"

What you have here, though, is Comey understanding that he has a bombshell on his hands, but also the way that James Comey gets himself into trouble. The way he gets himself into trouble is, he is not a caring sharer. He determined that these things that he thought were so incendiary that he had to make a record of them should not be shared with Jeff Sessions, should not be shared with the acting deputy, should not be shared with all these other people. That he alone, could be the only one who would handle this and he would take the ball himself and not tell anybody else.

They keep advancing their technology, nuclear weapons, ballistic missiles, so we'll see. But, also, he's also frustrated because he believes that the United States rushed this missile system in there, knowing he was going to take office to succeed the president who's now in jail. As a result of that, he didn't have an opportunity to kind of vote on it himself. The other thing, publicly what he's saying is that we've never done an environmental test for the two systems that are already there. There's total of six systems, so four are not there, and that's what he's holding off on. Environmental study takes about a year. But here's the other truth that's going on. China does not want this system in South Korea because our radars are so sophisticated they can pick up a lot of activity that China is doing. And China has been putting pressure on this new South Korean president -- China's cut off tourism, and also has put pressure on South Korean companies that are operating in China. So, China has got this president of South Korea's attention. I think, Martha, in the long run, we're in a collision course with China anyway. I know we're waiting for China to do something positive with North Korea. I doubt if they're going to achieve what we would like them to achieve. China is interested in regional hegemony. They want the United States emphasized to be reduced in the region. They're trampling on our interest in the South China Sea."

But this is all payback because the Iranians are very much involved in Iraq, and they're even more involved in Syria. They propped up that Syrian regime. They've ground forces in there. They've got the Hezbollah who work for them. They got Iraqi-Shia militia in there. They've got Republican Guard forces in there. Their head of that, General -- has been in and out of it. They've lost two generals on the ground there. They got so much troops on the ground, they're more effective now than the Syrian ground army because of their limited capabilities. So ISIS knows this. They're opposed to what the Iranians are trying to achieve in Iraq and Syria, and this is a little payback for them. Noe, they don't have a large presence in Iran. These were likely Iranians who were motivated ISIS. They're probably part of the Sunni minority that lives in Iran. And I don't think that they'll be a major continuing threat for the Iranians. Now, when the Iranians seem aghast by something like this, we've got to remind our viewers that the state of Iran is the world's number one sponsorship of terrorism around the world."

And we can now report that South Korea is saying that the north, the North Koreans has fired surface to ship missiles, this according to a statement coming through that these projectiles were coming off the east coast of North Korea on Thursday. So, as I said, they were believed to be surfaced to ship missiles. Now, we were just talking about the fact that the new president of South Korea is hoping to have a better relationship with North Korea, but now you have the South Korean military reporting something very different from that, yet, another launch of missiles coming off a northeastern coastal town of Wonsan. So we're going to keep a close eye on that as the tensions between North Korea and South Korea appeared to be escalating this evening."

You know, it's interesting when you look back at the discussion at the time, and we have this sound bite that I want to play. This is from then candidate Trump on October 20th, and at the time, I think it's just worth going back to recognize that he was concerned that maybe somebody was trying to mess with the voting machines and that it was going to impact badly on him, perhaps. And he didn't make a speculation about where it was coming from, but here's what he said."

I've talked to them, told him to back off. They're not involved at all. Then right after the election, because Hillary didn't win, suddenly the Russians were totally involved and had hacked the whole thing. The one thing that we know is this. There is no evidence that the Russians had any impact on the outcome of the election. Zero evidence for that. What we do know is they try. The second thing we know is that this young lady was a Bernie supporter, hates Donald Trump, and gave out information that she took illegally, and therefore that's why she's being charged with a federal crime as she should be. People who leak information when they are sworn to secrecy have an obligation under the law not to do it. All of it gets very confusing, Martha, but it ought to be pretty simple. You break the law, pay for it. Russians, they really didn't affect the outcome. Hillary's poor campaign and Donald Trump's good campaign is what made that happen. And now we're learning that Donald Trump really didn't have anything to do with the Russians and he wasn't under personal investigation. Could we not maybe move on at some point?"
