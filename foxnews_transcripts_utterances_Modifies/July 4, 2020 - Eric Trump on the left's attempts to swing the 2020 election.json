      "sentences": "John, it was an amazing sight to see, as you can imagine, for all of those watching at home as we saw those military aircraft from several different generations fly over not only the White House, but also the National Mall, and they can be spotted all over Washington, D.C. We started out with the presidential aircraft, that 747 that's commonly referred to as Air Force One with the Presidents on it, seeing it do that low pass here over the White House was quite a sight to see. I know you're an aviation geek, I am on as well.  And it was of course, followed by that incredible different site of military aircraft that spanned so many different generations. We saw aircraft from the Vietnam War, the Korean War, the Gulf War, and the crowd that was gathered here at the White House really just seemed to be in awe of the moment.  People staying very quiet, cheering as those aircraft would go overhead and President Trump himself with the First Lady kind of just staring up into the sky as those aircraft would make their way.  This is also of course, very similar to what we saw happen last year with the first \"Salute to America.\" The difference being the President deciding to do it here at the White House as opposed to the Lincoln Memorial. Here at the White House, we did see a couple of hundred guests show up here to be invited to watch the festivities for themselves. Of course, the fireworks are still coming up, John, that's going to be in about another 45 minutes to an hour out.  And so what was interesting, though, is that the President also taking the time during the Fourth of July, to hit on so many different topics that have been close to his mind, stuff that he brings up quite often at whether it be campaign events or when he is leaving the South Lawn. But on this Fourth of July, I thought it was very interesting to hear the President talk about the coronavirus pandemic, that of course continues to, you know, rattle this country. The President saying that there is progress being made, not only when it comes to testing, but also in the improvements of ventilators and the production, and how the U.S. has been able to kind of change course in the last couple of months.  The President though also taking name at what he has seen as leftwing mobs, people that he feels are trying to erase American history. The President not mincing words either, with the media saying that he felt that the media was not doing enough to unite the country.   Of course, the critics would argue that it's the President that feels that way, and not necessarily the rest of the country. It'll be interesting to see whether or not there's any pushback for the President using the Fourth of July ceremony to discuss some of his views on that. We also heard the President talk about American heroes. He established an Executive Order just yesterday that we create this Garden of American Heroes, essentially an area where statues would be honoring people like Amelia Earhart, Benjamin Franklin, George Washington, Martin Luther King, Jr. He says he wants this created between now and 2026. This will be a chance to really honor those that he feels that made a significant impact on American history. It will be interesting to also see the reaction from Congress because that just was announced yesterday, and it's still in the works.   The President said, they are still trying to come up with exactly how that is going to work. As though, we have talked about there, the President also wanted to make clear that he still believes America is getting stronger every day from the coronavirus pandemic. We heard that from the Interior Secretary who was also out here speaking about the effort that has gone in not only today, but for the last several months that people have been really trying to do all they can to show their American pride, their American spirit and how strong this country is.  The President once again pointing to that he believes the U.S. remains the greatest country on Earth. And that our symbol of freedom and our symbol of honor and tradition certainly would be remembered not only now, but for generations to come past and present.   Jon, again, as an aircraft guy, I know you would have loved seeing this and it was an incredible seat here on the ground on the South Lawn of the White House -- Jon.",

I wish I was young enough to jump back in one and then pilot one across the skies like they did.  But what really struck me as I think back in my 30 years in the Air Force, having served all over the world is when the President talked about how our Declaration of Independence said created this nation as a free nation.  What struck me was that our Independence Day really marks Independence Day for the rest of the world. Because we've been -- we've been the leader across the planet that has brought freedom and liberty to all the other nations that have adopted similar forms of government. And so, as I traveled the world, I saw great people that looked up to the United States of America, they looked up to obviously our air power, they looked up to us, as leaders and the President highlighted how the Founding Fathers set up a system of government that is the leader across the world, and promotes liberty to everybody.

But the idea that we can go and build new things together, and if you felt left out on some of those monuments that are in D.C. now, the idea that you can be a part of what we build in the future, that's what this country is all about. It's not that we get up every day and get it right is that we get up every day and we try to get it right. We try to make tomorrow better for my kids and their kids and your kids.   And that's exactly the signal that the President Trump is sending with this. And I think it's a brilliant move.  And I would challenge all of those people, if you're spoiled brats or anarchists or honest brokers that have wanted to tear down monuments, I challenge you to be a part of this conversation and to help us build tomorrow and build the monuments for people that deserve to be memorialized for what they've contributed.

He also, you know, touched on the coronavirus efforts and those who want to tear down memorials in this country.

And these are colored actually, so kids love that. Also M-80S. This will give you a little pop. All right this is a little dynamite here, so just be careful with these. Make sure they're out of your hand quickly after you light them. Also black cats. You know, these are loud. These can make you feel like you're old. Rat-tat-tat. Yes. That's going to make you go deaf. You know how those go. Also, bottle rockets. I ran out of ball rockets. I thought I had some. I think I shot too many off last summer. So I'm empty handed. Those are a lot of fun. But these are my most favorite here. These are the Roman candles. So these shoot about and don't aim them at your friends like these guys are doing here in the screen, like I used to do. Just be safe. Be careful. Don't injure yourself and follow the law. That's what I'll try to be doing. That's all for tonight. Everybody stay safe and happy Fourth of July.

      "utterance": "John, it was an amazing sight to see, as you can imagine, for all of those watching at home as we saw those military aircraft from several different generations fly over not only the White House, but also the National Mall, and they can be spotted all over Washington, D.C. We started out with the presidential aircraft, that 747 that's commonly referred to as Air Force One with the Presidents on it, seeing it do that low pass here over the White House was quite a sight to see. I know you're an aviation geek, I am on as well. And it was of course, followed by that incredible different site of military aircraft that spanned so many different generations. We saw aircraft from the Vietnam War, the Korean War, the Gulf War, and the crowd that was gathered here at the White House really just seemed to be in awe of the moment. People staying very quiet, cheering as those aircraft would go overhead and President Trump himself with the First Lady kind of just staring up into the sky as those aircraft would make their way. This is also of course, very similar to what we saw happen last year with the first \"Salute to America.\" The difference being the President deciding to do it here at the White House as opposed to the Lincoln Memorial. Here at the White House, we did see a couple of hundred guests show up here to be invited to watch the festivities for themselves. Of course, the fireworks are still coming up, John, that's going to be in about another 45 minutes to an hour out. And so what was interesting, though, is that the President also taking the time during the Fourth of July, to hit on so many different topics that have been close to his mind, stuff that he brings up quite often at whether it be campaign events or when he is leaving the South Lawn. But on this Fourth of July, I thought it was very interesting to hear the President talk about the coronavirus pandemic, that of course continues to, you know, rattle this country. The President saying that there is progress being made, not only when it comes to testing, but also in the improvements of ventilators and the production, and how the U.S. has been able to kind of change course in the last couple of months. The President though also taking name at what he has seen as leftwing mobs, people that he feels are trying to erase American history. The President not mincing words either, with the media saying that he felt that the media was not doing enough to unite the country. Of course, the critics would argue that it's the President that feels that way, and not necessarily the rest of the country. It'll be interesting to see whether or not there's any pushback for the President using the Fourth of July ceremony to discuss some of his views on that. We also heard the President talk about American heroes. He established an Executive Order just yesterday that we create this Garden of American Heroes, essentially an area where statues would be honoring people like Amelia Earhart, Benjamin Franklin, George Washington, Martin Luther King, Jr. He says he wants this created between now and 2026. This will be a chance to really honor those that he feels that made a significant impact on American history. It will be interesting to also see the reaction from Congress because that just was announced yesterday, and it's still in the works. The President said, they are still trying to come up with exactly how that is going to work. As though, we have talked about there, the President also wanted to make clear that he still believes America is getting stronger every day from the coronavirus pandemic. We heard that from the Interior Secretary who was also out here speaking about the effort that has gone in not only today, but for the last several months that people have been really trying to do all they can to show their American pride, their American spirit and how strong this country is. The President once again pointing to that he believes the U.S. remains the greatest country on Earth. And that our symbol of freedom and our symbol of honor and tradition certainly would be remembered not only now, but for generations to come past and present. Jon, again, as an aircraft guy, I know you would have loved seeing this and it was an incredible seat here on the ground on the South Lawn of the White House -- Jon."

I wish I was young enough to jump back in one and then pilot one across the skies like they did. But what really struck me as I think back in my 30 years in the Air Force, having served all over the world is when the President talked about how our Declaration of Independence said created this nation as a free nation. What struck me was that our Independence Day really marks Independence Day for the rest of the world. Because we've been -- we've been the leader across the planet that has brought freedom and liberty to all the other nations that have adopted similar forms of government. And so, as I traveled the world, I saw great people that looked up to the United States of America, they looked up to obviously our air power, they looked up to us, as leaders and the President highlighted how the Founding Fathers set up a system of government that is the leader across the world, and promotes liberty to everybody.

What's done is done, and we've memorialized some of it to not forget it. But the idea that we can go and build new things together, and if you felt left out on some of those monuments that are in D.C. now, the idea that you can be a part of what we build in the future, that's what this country is all about. It's not that we get up every day and get it right is that we get up every day and we try to get it right. We try to make tomorrow better for my kids and their kids and your kids. And that's exactly the signal that the President Trump is sending with this. And I think it's a brilliant move. And I would challenge all of those people, if you're spoiled brats or anarchists or honest brokers that have wanted to tear down monuments, I challenge you to be a part of this conversation and to help us build tomorrow and build the monuments for people that deserve to be memorialized for what they've contributed. And on the topic of that A-10. That's a favorite of mine, as well as an EOD tech. I had to learn how to take it apart to get to those munitions.

He denounced the Antifa members and the leftwing mob who have been causing so much trouble in this country. He also, you know, touched on the coronavirus efforts and those who want to tear down memorials in this country. It was a wide ranging speech, but Colonel, he also talked about getting Americans to set foot on Mars and he promised that Americans are going to be the ones to do it. It's an interesting goal. And you know, some people shake their heads and say, well, we'll never make that, but a lot of people said the same thing when John Kennedy said, we're going to go to the moon."

I would say it sets us apart from the totalitarian kind of countries and socialist kind of countries that don't have a population of people trying to always succeed and finding solutions to things. So I think the President is right. The spirit of Americans is that we are going to -- we're going to solve that problem when we get there.

She traffics children across state lines. She lured them. She enticed them. She engaged allegedly in sexual acts with these minors with Jeffrey Epstein, sometimes even holding them against their will. This indictment -- this is just from a small span in the 90s. But as you've detailed, she had a very long relationship with Epstein going into the deep 2000s. How wicked was this woman?"

      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "She kept his books. She engaged in a lot of the payments to the women allegedly, and ran his entire affairs. And at this point, how can she be protected? Because we remember what happened to Jeffrey, the most famous person in Federal custody at the time, commit suicide or he dies mysteriously in jail. We have someone like Prince Andrew who has got exposure here. We have politicians with exposure. We have celebrities, billionaires with exposure here. She knows everything. So, is she going to make bail? Is she going to flee the country? Or do you think she's going to sing to the Feds to save herself?"

Whatever information she has on anybody, it is not putting somebody else above her in the organization. That's the problem that she's going to have. That's just a fact that she has to deal with. So I expect as this investigation continues, that it gets expanded and that the indictment probably expands in time and substance. That's what I think we're going to see."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",

So no matter what she tells the Feds, she is still going to do serious time. It can't reduce her sentence that much. You know, all the raids that apparently seized all of the video evidence, the pictures, the surveillance video from the multiple homes of Epstein in Manhattan, in Palm Beach, and in New Mexico, where is that evidence? And did that evidence lead to Ghislaine? Is that evidence ever going to come out? Because, I mean, that should pretty much be everything you need to have more indictments. Am I right?"

      "speaker": "EDWARDS",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Okay, so I'm going to assume from that answer that you're aware of things that are developing and you're not at liberty to say. I totally understand that. So who shouldn't be nervous right now? You know, I don't want to cast aspersions. We broke this with an author a couple of weeks ago, Daniel Halper who said that he had evidence or he had heard from a source that Bill Clinton was romantically involved with Ghislaine Maxwell. I mean, we know Maxwell was in the plane with him. We know she was at his wedding of Chelsea. I'm not indicting the President, but besides him, who do you think would be nervous right now in your professional opinion?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "EDWARDS",

And the fact that many people have been invited to provide the information that they know, people like Bill Clinton, people like Prince Andrew and as of yet, haven't provided that information is still as I said, on your show last time troubling to me. But if there has ever been a time, you would think that the time is right now. Beyond that, again, I don't think that is the responsible thing for me to do to say, hey, look, this person' is coming up next, although I will tell you that the investigation is not over. It's continuing, both from my standpoint and from the standpoint of the prosecutors in New York."

      "utterance": "Okay. You have been on the frontlines of this from a legal perspective. And, you know, we can't say enough for everything that you've done to bring justice to these victims. And it's not just a few victims. As you mentioned in the book, it's probably a couple hundred of minors between 14 and 17, who were alleged victims of not only Epstein, but Ghislaine. And also, you mentioned the last time you came on that you'd ask Bill Clinton to cooperate. He had not voluntarily cooperated. We know that Prince Andrew has not voluntarily cooperated. I think right now, it would behoove everybody that had knowledge of anything illegal going on in this little sick access between these two people to voluntarily come from forward and provide as much information as possible so people can get justice. Bradley, thank you for everything you've done for the book and all of the legal action that you've taken that has exposed a lot of this. We're going to follow it closely and we'll have you back on."

I mean, you know what happened the last time when the candidate didn't go out to swing states and visit them. That's what happened to Hillary. Biden is now doing the same thing. I mean, he's not going to run the show if he get selected. It's going to be AOC and Nancy Pelosi. He doesn't have any bright ideas. He is going to tank the economy. And the enthusiasm gap is about a mile wide. I have always said it's better to vote for someone than against someone that's usually the winning formula. How do you see Joe? KATRINA PIERSON, TRUMP 2020 SENIOR ADVISER: Yes, you know, Jesse, I think you're right. And when you look at the campaign as a whole, you know, going into these last few months, I mean, it's quite clear, you know that the left is going to leave no stone unturned in their efforts to prevent President Trump from being reelected. Democrats are going to continue to politicize every single crisis, but one thing remains clear. Through all of this chaos, Jesse, and that is President Trump is the only one who can renew, rebuild and restore our country after this pandemic.

It's like a rocket ship. And he's got the USMCA, in effect now, July 1st, that went into effect. You've seen massive amounts of manufacturing jobs created. If he can steer this economy through this pandemic, which has been the worst one in a hundred years, I think he'll be rewarded for it. And it'll show that he took charge, took action, and you're going to want to stick with the guy that brought you through this catastrophe. Joe is not trusted on the economy. He is down about double digits on that. And that's going to be the number one issue, the economy, and the President right now is in a good position there."

This is far ahead of the economic projections, which you know, shattered the economists' expectations, beating the prediction by, you know, nearly two million jobs. So people are looking at these numbers. They're watching to see how both candidates are engaging in this process, and it doesn't matter if you're black, white, Hispanic or Asian or veteran, unemployment rates fell across the board. And that is tangible results through real effort, which on the other side, Joe Biden said that the President's unusual approach was xenophobic.

They send out ballots based off voter rolls. These rolls are dirty and outdated, filled with the dead and drifters. So it leaves millions of extra ballots just floating around. And then they get filled out fraudulently and political hacks collect them and bundle them and flip them, you know. They bribe and intimidate people. Just recently in Paterson, New Jersey, four people were busted."

Voting by mail in Texas is generally limited to those with a sickness or physical condition that prevents in-person voting. The Texas Attorney General argued that fear of getting the virus doesn't qualify as a disability under the law. The President recently spoke about mail-in voting with Sean Hannity."

The Heroes Act was supposed to be in response to COVID, it was supposed to be $3 trillion. You would think that the Heroes Act, some of that money would actually go to first responders, right? I mean, as the name implies, they're beautiful marketers. Well, the very things in the Heroes Act were eliminating all voter ID. This was put in by Nancy Pelosi, having all absentee ballots. I mean, they're not even trying to be secretive about this. They're not even trying to put this under covers. They are exposing this for the whole world to see. They're exposing their motives. And I'm, I'm so glad you showed that clip of Nadler in New York where he said, I can show you examples of voter fraud after voter fraud after voter fraud because they want to lead you to believe it doesn't exist. And then you see states like Florida where they found literally cartons of ballots, right, cartons and cartons of ballots on site. You see what's happening with some of the judicial races in Pennsylvania and West Virginia where people have admitted to fraud. Voter fraud is real. And it is absolutely happening every single day and the Democrats don't care and the media wants to ignore it."

They'll report all of these ballots that they found bundled up in mailboxes and then the national media, they will ignore their sister networks on the ground and they'll just lie to the American people because they're on the same side of the Democrats. They want a close race, so they hold back these bundles. And then during these recounts, or at the last minute, oh, we just found 600 votes in a swing state. Flip it blue. So now you've got the Twitter people on board with the scam. How dangerous do you think it is?"

You and I, and every other conservative out there, we've known this has been happening the whole time. I mean, every single kind of outspoken conservative has been shadow banned behind the scenes, there's just no question. I mean, for the longest time, for three years, the only people it was suggesting -- Twitter was suggesting that I follow was Hillary Clinton and Elizabeth Warren. I mean, I kind of find that odd that they popped up at the top of my screen every single time and then you see people getting deleted from your account and you see posts that you literally sent to out that had this many views, and then you come back a little while later and they have half the amount of views. We all know this is a game that Twitter has been playing. They came out publicly, they did it for the first time in public. So everything that we knew was happening, everything that they had been accused of, they came out and they did it in the full transparency of the world. And Jesse, here's the one thing I can tell you, it is going to cost them the election because the one thing that Republicans -- the one thing that Americans don't want to have happen to them is to have their free speech silenced, right? We have the First Amendment protection for a reason. Americans fundamentally, it's ingrained in their DNA, believe in having free speech, and I'm telling you, it's going to backfire on them. Do not take that ability away from Americans and there is no better way -- there is no more surefire way to get Americans out to the polls to vote for Donald Trump, than to stifle their free speech."

And these are colored actually, so kids love that. Also M-80S. This will give you a little pop. All right this is a little dynamite here, so just be careful with these. Make sure they're out of your hand quickly after you light them. Also black cats. You know, these are loud. These can make you feel like you're old. Rat-tat-tat. Yes. That's going to make you go deaf. You know how those go. Also, bottle rockets. I ran out of ball rockets. I thought I had some. I think I shot too many off last summer. So I'm empty handed. Those are a lot of fun. But these are my most favorite here. These are the Roman candles. So these shoot about and don't aim them at your friends like these guys are doing here in the screen, like I used to do. Just be safe. Be careful. Don't injure yourself and follow the law. That's what I'll try to be doing. That's all for tonight. Everybody stay safe and happy Fourth of July.
