I mean, when they made this law, there was only 25,000 people living in Vegas, they thought it was never going to happen.   So, I'm 22 years old, and a pawn license, if someone has one for sale back then, it was $500,000.00, $700,000.00, something like that, and I definitely couldn't afford that. So once I read this law, I'm going, \"It's got to be close to that now for the city proper there.\" And so, I started calling the city statistician once a week and in April of '88, he said, \"Yes, we think it's a quarter of a million.\" So, I'm no longer naive, 22-year-old, I'm a naive 23-year-old. I go to the city business license, it's a quarter of a million, I want my license. They didn't give it to me. But six months later, a judge said, he was the first one there, \"Give him the license.\"",

Little watch companies start popping up around the United States. By 1890, the best watches in the world hands down were American watches. As a matter of fact, they were so good that the Europeans were trying to sell watches with American sounding names. That's why Congress had to pass a law saying the origin of watch has to be printed on the dial. That's because in London, it took 17 different unions to make a watch or they called them guilds. You can make a dial of a watch but you couldn't paint it, okay. There was a separate guild that made the hands, there was a separate guild that made the cases. It's just massive bureaucracy. And in 1890s, they were making in London the same watches they were making in 1820, and that's just one example of capitalism. There's a million examples out there.

I mean, when they made this law, there was only 25,000 people living in Vegas, they thought it was never going to happen. So, I'm 22 years old, and a pawn license, if someone has one for sale back then, it was $500,000.00, $700,000.00, something like that, and I definitely couldn't afford that. So once I read this law, I'm going, \"It's got to be close to that now for the city proper there.\" And so, I started calling the city statistician once a week and in April of '88, he said, \"Yes, we think it's a quarter of a million.\" So, I'm no longer naive, 22-year-old, I'm a naive 23-year-old. I go to the city business license, it's a quarter of a million, I want my license. They didn't give it to me. But six months later, a judge said, he was the first one there, \"Give him the license.\""

Little watch companies start popping up around the United States. By 1890, the best watches in the world hands down were American watches. As a matter of fact, they were so good that the Europeans were trying to sell watches with American sounding names. That's why Congress had to pass a law saying the origin of watch has to be printed on the dial. That's because in London, it took 17 different unions to make a watch or they called them guilds. You can make a dial of a watch but you couldn't paint it, okay. There was a separate guild that made the hands, there was a separate guild that made the cases. It's just massive bureaucracy. And in 1890s, they were making in London the same watches they were making in 1820, and that's just one example of capitalism. There's a million examples out there.

I go talk at troubled high schools, you know, and I try and talk like they talk. I tell these kids, all you guys want to be a baller or you guys want to be like really super cool. Some of you become super cool, be a little bit of a nerd. Get an education, get a job, and wait until have you kids when you're married, okay? Because you do those three things, you've just reduced your chances of being in poverty by 95%. But for some reason, they're not allowed to teach that in school. It's just common sense, and it boggles my mind. I mean, look on some of these news channels, these people supposedly have a college education and they're touting socialism, which to me is just sort of mind- boggling. I mean, obviously, you cheated a lot, but socialism is - it sounds so great, though. That's why people embrace it. The government is going to pay for everything, it sounds great.

In 1936, right when everything was getting better, we had positive GDP growth in 1936, tightened up monetary policy again and created another straight back into the depression. I mean, like in 2000 - right after 9/11, the Fed massively lowered interest rates, which in turn, all the pension funds around the United States. They have a basic model - 6% return, they'll be able to pay the pensions in the end. But now, they can't get yield, so they started chasing the yield, and that's when these collateralized debt obligations - all of these crazy things started happening because if they didn't get the yield, the entire model would collapse."

It's not a perfect world and these things have to happen to have a stable economy. You perpetually prop up - the more you prop up an economy is, the harder it's going to fall. It's like Adam Smith in \"The Wealth of Nations,\" the unseen hand will of - the economy will balance itself out, but when you start getting the government and they are pushing up something really high, eventually it's not going to fall ..."

Untold number of decisions every day about their lives, about their business, about their family, and the invisible hand is that we all interact with each other. We know what we want better than anybody else knows what we want and so forth and so on. So when the government intervenes, basically, it's a relative handful of people with an army of bureaucrats telling us what we want, telling us what we need. How can those handful of people, those masterminds know as much as all the rest of us, and isn't the problem that they can give us a piece of cheese, but to explain how we get a piece of cheese actually requires people to pay attention for about three minutes so you can explain it."
