A number of candidates, including Elizabeth Warren last night, coming out in favor of abolishing of the Electoral College. Getting what of the filibuster, something the president talks a lot about. There are a lot of liberal Democrats who believe that's the only way if a Democrat becomes president to see a progressive agenda come through. You have to get rid of the filibuster. Adding the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico as states. The feeling overall from a lot of Democrats, not just activists, but now people who are running for president is feeling that for years Democrats have played by the rules, Republicans haven't. And they have lost opportunities where Republicans have taken them, and they pointed specifically, of course, to Merrick Garland and the decision not to hold hearings on Merrick Garland. They say we know Michelle Obama told us in the 2016 campaign when they go low, we go high. Well, maybe going high isn't working anymore. So let's not do it.",

The Democratic argument, Bret, is with the Constitution of the United States of America.  And the argument is because the left cannot win its arguments when they present them publicly. So in order to win, they need to change the structure. You heard Mayor Buttigieg right there say, the structural change necessary. What structure are they changing?

They realize they can't change the constitution, so there is a plan that if enough states whose electoral votes total 270 agreed to give their electors to whoever won the popular vote, then that would do it. They're not there yet, so this is not really close to happening.  But it would change our politics completely. Candidates would spend a lot of time trying to run up the score in California. Democrats would, Republicans would try to do the same in Texas. The Electoral College requires a majority of delegates. A popular election would just require a winner. There doesn't have to be two political parties, there could be a lot of different candidates and a plurality candidate could win. Playing with our constitutional order is a really dangerous thing.",

Now it's actually getting a hearing. It's unclear about how long that's going to stay there. One other interesting point, though. The debate over the Electoral College isn't new, and it's not always on one side of the other. Back in 2004, 54 percent of Republicans wanted to get rid of the Electoral College, wanted to see a popular vote winner. And now, says Gallup, that number is down to 19 percent.",

      "utterance": "President Trump in the Rose Garden here at the White House answering a question about increasing the number of justices on the Supreme Court. It is a talking point now for a number of candidates as you look at the list here. Several of them are now talking openly on the campaign trail about Supreme Court reform, as it's called. They talk about it differently, but all say adding more justices in one way or another is something they would consider or want to do. But \"The Washington Post\" has a piece about Senator Michael Bennet, Democrat from Colorado considering getting in the race, \"slammed his head on the table four times when I asked him what he thought about other Democratic presidential contenders embracing the idea of expanding the Supreme Court. Having seen up close just how cynical and how vicious the Tea Party guys and the Freedom Caucus guys and Mitch McConnell had been, the last thing I want to do is be those guys, he said during an interview at a coffee shop.\" We'll start there with the 2020. Back with the panel. Amy, is this catching on?"

      "utterance": "It is really fascinating, Bret, how much process has become part of the Democratic debate within the Democratic presidential candidates, within that field. It's not just the Supreme Court. It's also getting rid of the Electoral College, which is gaining a lot of steam. A number of candidates, including Elizabeth Warren last night, coming out in favor of abolishing of the Electoral College. Getting what of the filibuster, something the president talks a lot about. There are a lot of liberal Democrats who believe that's the only way if a Democrat becomes president to see a progressive agenda come through. You have to get rid of the filibuster. Adding the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico as states. The feeling overall from a lot of Democrats, not just activists, but now people who are running for president is feeling that for years Democrats have played by the rules, Republicans haven't. And they have lost opportunities where Republicans have taken them, and they pointed specifically, of course, to Merrick Garland and the decision not to hold hearings on Merrick Garland. They say we know Michelle Obama told us in the 2016 campaign when they go low, we go high. Well, maybe going high isn't working anymore. So let's not do it."

      "speaker": "CONTINETTI",
      "utterance": "That's right. And the Democratic argument isn't with any single one of these things. It's not only with the Electoral College, it's not only with the 26th Amendment, it's not only with the state of the Supreme Court, it's not only with equal representation of small states in the United States Senate. The Democratic argument, Bret, is with the Constitution of the United States of America. And the argument is because the left cannot win its arguments when they present them publicly. So in order to win, they need to change the structure. You heard Mayor Buttigieg right there say, the structural change necessary. What structure are they changing? They are changing the Constitution of the United States whose structure is there to preserve individual liberty. Barack Obama said he was audacious. This is audacity."

      "utterance": "Byron, Elizabeth Warren made that case about the Electoral College last night, we played the soundbite earlier, saying that every vote needs to count. But Lindsey Graham makes the opposite in a tweet, saying \"The desire to abolish the Electoral College is driven by the idea Democrats want rural America to go away politically.\" And the focus being on the big states that have the most population, and the Iowas and New Hampshires and even the middle of the country would get less say, really."

      "speaker": "YORK",
      "utterance": "Yes, what they'd really plan to do is the end run around the Electoral College. They realize they can't change the constitution, so there is a plan that if enough states whose electoral votes total 270 agreed to give their electors to whoever won the popular vote, then that would do it. They're not there yet, so this is not really close to happening. But it would change our politics completely. Candidates would spend a lot of time trying to run up the score in California. Democrats would, Republicans would try to do the same in Texas. The Electoral College requires a majority of delegates. A popular election would just require a winner. There doesn't have to be two political parties, there could be a lot of different candidates and a plurality candidate could win. Playing with our constitutional order is a really dangerous thing."

    {
      "speaker": "BAIER",
      "utterance": "Amy, just to get back to what you said at the beginning, the process being such a focus. As one candidate talks about it, it seems like they all start to talk about it. And when you have the over/under being 20 voices talking about the same process things, does that hurt Democrats on the trail?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALTER",
      "utterance": "I think they are meeting the activists where they are and the base where the base is. And again, I'm sure all of us here around the table have been in and around politics long enough that we have heard arguments both for and against the Electoral College for a long time, but it never really made its way up to the people that were running for president or potentially could be president. Now it's actually getting a hearing. It's unclear about how long that's going to stay there. One other interesting point, though. The debate over the Electoral College isn't new, and it's not always on one side of the other. Back in 2004, 54 percent of Republicans wanted to get rid of the Electoral College, wanted to see a popular vote winner. And now, says Gallup, that number is down to 19 percent."
