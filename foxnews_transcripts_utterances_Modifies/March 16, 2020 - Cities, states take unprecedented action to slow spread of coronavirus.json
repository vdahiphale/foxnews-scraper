All right, as you can see, we are doing things a little bit differently today and going forward. As much as we love sitting elbow to elbow and we mean that sincerely. We want to set a good example for everyone and practice physical distancing. So here we are. Oh, are we going to see? Like, we're separate - - so Greg and I are here, having to face each other, Juan and Jesse are up there. You can see them. Kennedy, we see you there in the pod, hi, Kennedy. So we're all trying to do the right thing here.  And the reason, of course, is because life in our country is changing by the minute. In an unprecedented effort to help contain this Coronavirus, millions of Americans are working from home. And school closings across the U.S. are impacting more than half of young students in the country. Cities and states closing bars and restaurants with the exception of take-out, Greg's happy about that.",

And last week, toward the end of the week, there were fewer and fewer students who are attending. My girls both went on Friday, and there was almost no one there.  And you really got the sense with the threatened teacher stick out and a couple of the city council people here in New York City that they were going to shut down schools. And for them, it's interesting because they have a ton of work on Google classroom. So they've got everything laid out. But also, it's an interesting period where we get to work as a family figuring out how to deal with the crisis.  And the most important thing you have, and Greg kind of touched on this, is your attitude toward it. So if you face it as a challenge and you work on it together and we figure what we have and what we need, then you can work from there instead of worrying about what you don't have and trying to get as much of that as possible even if you don't necessarily have a need for that. I know the president's addressed that today. And I love the idea that Greg's neighbor reached out to him. And I would say the same thing. If you have older neighbors, make sure that they have everything they need so they don't have to go out and get it.

And, you know, it can be a good thing. You can relax with your loved ones. You can watch THE FIVE. You don't have to go out to the bar. You know, take it easy. But with that said, it is bizarre because usually when there's a challenge facing this country, Americans unite. They come together. And then they overcome.   But this time, in order for us to overcome, we need to separate ourselves from each other. We are almost dividing ourselves in order to unite and in order to defeat this virus. And that is a very counterintuitive thing to do. But you have to do it. And you have to think when this is all over, and it's got to be over within the next couple months.  But when it is, Mother Nature has taught us a lesson. We are going to be more self-reliant. We are going to be less dependent as a country and as individuals on other people and on other countries. And that may be a good thing, because right now this looks like it's impacting the United States of America worse than terrorism. Thirty percent got knocked off the stock market. Whole industries are shut down, schools closing, professional sports. Nothing like this we've ever seen in America.

And then they say we will put you on the milk train that leaves at 9:30, makes every stop in America.   And then the people on the train are like in masks. They are huddled away from each other. Nobody wants to sit next to anybody. And of course, both towns, it looks like a ghost town because the schools are closed so the school buses aren't working. And you go in the restaurants, they are shut. You hope some that of the carry out places are open.  But some of them are shut. So it's kind of puzzling. I mean, to me, we are in a moment where you have to just, you know, stop and trust in each other in a very intimate way. So, you know, to my mind, it's not about distancing. I see neighbors. The neighbors are coming over. They are talking. And I even saw a wonderful clip this weekend where an elderly couple was in a shopping -- outside of a grocery store in the parking lot. And they were shouting, and a lady came over and they were afraid to go in the grocery store. So they gave her 100 bucks so she could go shopping.",

The governors are actually the ones that can make these decisions about closing schools and closing businesses. The president of the United States does not have that legal authority even if he wanted to. The governors are responsible for that. And I saw many of them stepping up today. I really have to say something really positive about Governor Phil Murphy of New Jersey who gave his prepared remarks today, talked about having to close the bars, and then set aside the script and just spoke from the heart.

And so I'm making these decisions because I'm -- my credibility is on the line, because I'm here to -- as an elected leader to try to protect you. And I think you see that across the country. And I believe that there's a lot better cooperation between the federal government and governors that you see may be on Twitter.",

He is not the bottom of the barrel. He is the stuff leaking out of the barrel. When you are booking him, it's a political booking, so let's be clear. Two, people are conflating again with words and deeds. What Trump is doing imperfectly is he initially was trying to address the panic that he saw in the stock market, because he is our nation's cheerleader. Everything's going to be better. We have to get this thing going, because optimism is his blood, all right? As for the virus, that's the experts' turf. Make no mistake. He got out of that way. He let them do that. And let's not forget, Cuomo was slow getting up to speed on this too, because he was doing the same thing Trump was, which was just trying to slow the panic in the economy. So Trump was initially focusing on the psychological effects of panic. While his intention is good, he could've found his voice sooner about the actual concern. But he's -- this is new to him.

My biggest issue was with Bernie Sanders saying that we have a dire lack of medical personnel in this country right now. If you think it is bad now, give every doctor and nurse a 40 percent pay cut, and see what your medical personnel looks like in 10 years when no one is going to medical or nursing school because they won't be able to make a decent living.

Joe Biden had a much better debate last night. He's spoken cleaner sound bites, he was much more eloquent, much more in control. He had a much more soothing voice and he only started getting rattled about 45 minutes in and a lot of people after 45 minutes are looking to watch something else. He was easily pushed over to the left by Bernie Sanders. And that's where Bernie started to make some headway that said, Joe, you have not been leading. You've been behind the curve on gay marriage, on the bankruptcy bill, on Hyde, on war on trade. And Biden got very, very defensive and didn't handle that well.

And you may never know if your overreaction helped. Because -- and the people who under reacted are going to gloat and say, see, it was no big deal at all, even though it was the over reactors that might have helped.

It's not the case. The innate reaction among human beings is to help. You know, if you have a problem carrying something or you can't pick up your kids, someone else is going to do it. And I think that's what we are going to learn here. I would also add a lot of people talk about social distancing. We should be social distancing from social media, because I find that when I'm around and I'm on Twitter a lot. I am filling my brain with a lot of stuff that is unreliable.

And last week, toward the end of the week, there were fewer and fewer students who are attending. My girls both went on Friday, and there was almost no one there. And you really got the sense with the threatened teacher stick out and a couple of the city council people here in New York City that they were going to shut down schools. And for them, it's interesting because they have a ton of work on Google classroom. So they've got everything laid out. But also, it's an interesting period where we get to work as a family figuring out how to deal with the crisis. And the most important thing you have, and Greg kind of touched on this, is your attitude toward it. So if you face it as a challenge and you work on it together and we figure what we have and what we need, then you can work from there instead of worrying about what you don't have and trying to get as much of that as possible even if you don't necessarily have a need for that. I know the president's addressed that today. And I love the idea that Greg's neighbor reached out to him. And I would say the same thing. If you have older neighbors, make sure that they have everything they need so they don't have to go out and get it. And if you're making soup, if you've got extras, freeze some and take it over so they've -- to put their minds at ease and get them whatever they need from the drugstore."

Not two, but at least one week. But I urge all my fellow Americans, no matter where you are, to respect the social distancing urging from the president of the United States. And, you know, it can be a good thing. You can relax with your loved ones. You can watch THE FIVE. You don't have to go out to the bar. You know, take it easy. But with that said, it is bizarre because usually when there's a challenge facing this country, Americans unite. They come together. And then they overcome. But this time, in order for us to overcome, we need to separate ourselves from each other. We are almost dividing ourselves in order to unite and in order to defeat this virus. And that is a very counterintuitive thing to do. But you have to do it. And you have to think when this is all over, and it's got to be over within the next couple months. But when it is, Mother Nature has taught us a lesson. We are going to be more self-reliant. We are going to be less dependent as a country and as individuals on other people and on other countries. And that may be a good thing, because right now this looks like it's impacting the United States of America worse than terrorism. Thirty percent got knocked off the stock market. Whole industries are shut down, schools closing, professional sports. Nothing like this we've ever seen in America. And at the end of the day, we are going to have to find out what happened, why it happened, where it happened, and the lessons will be learned."

Then they say, OK, you can rush and get the 7:50 a.m. train. No, they cancelled all the Acela's that go between New York and D.C. And then they say we will put you on the milk train that leaves at 9:30, makes every stop in America. And then the people on the train are like in masks. They are huddled away from each other. Nobody wants to sit next to anybody. And of course, both towns, it looks like a ghost town because the schools are closed so the school buses aren't working. And you go in the restaurants, they are shut. You hope some that of the carry out places are open. But some of them are shut. So it's kind of puzzling. I mean, to me, we are in a moment where you have to just, you know, stop and trust in each other in a very intimate way. So, you know, to my mind, it's not about distancing. I see neighbors. The neighbors are coming over. They are talking. And I even saw a wonderful clip this weekend where an elderly couple was in a shopping -- outside of a grocery store in the parking lot. And they were shouting, and a lady came over and they were afraid to go in the grocery store. So they gave her 100 bucks so she could go shopping."

And I -- and believe me, all of my money that I make goes into bars and restaurants. I am a walking, like, bailout for downtown. So what you've got to do is you've got to find out how you can pay them now for future goods. That's like the order of gift cards for the restaurants that you like. Join the delivery services, like Seamless or Grubhub or Caviar. These are delivery services and -- where any restaurant that you like can deliver food to you. That way, they can pay the staff. They can pay the cook. They might be able to help out the waitresses.

But everybody gets a choice every single day of how they want to position themselves, what they want to say. Do you want to help? You get to make that choice 100 times a day. I did think that the governors today were doing the right thing. Now remember, the federal government cannot do everything for you. The governors are actually the ones that can make these decisions about closing schools and closing businesses. The president of the United States does not have that legal authority even if he wanted to. The governors are responsible for that. And I saw many of them stepping up today. I really have to say something really positive about Governor Phil Murphy of New Jersey who gave his prepared remarks today, talked about having to close the bars, and then set aside the script and just spoke from the heart. And he said this is on me. And this -- I am doing this because I'm the one that's supposed to be in charge. I'm the one that is supposed lead. And so I'm making these decisions because I'm -- my credibility is on the line, because I'm here to -- as an elected leader to try to protect you. And I think you see that across the country.

All right, number one, number one, Scaramucci, when you were booking Scaramucci to talk about a pandemic, that means seven to eight people turned them down beforehand. He is not the bottom of the barrel. He is the stuff leaking out of the barrel. When you are booking him, it's a political booking, so let's be clear. Two, people are conflating again with words and deeds. What Trump is doing imperfectly is he initially was trying to address the panic that he saw in the stock market, because he is our nation's cheerleader. Everything's going to be better. We have to get this thing going, because optimism is his blood, all right? As for the virus, that's the experts' turf. Make no mistake. He got out of that way. He let them do that. And let's not forget, Cuomo was slow getting up to speed on this too, because he was doing the same thing Trump was, which was just trying to slow the panic in the economy. So Trump was initially focusing on the psychological effects of panic. While his intention is good, he could've found his voice sooner about the actual concern. But he's -- this is new to him. I think he was trying to focus on trying to quell the panic while letting the experts deal with the virus, deeds, words. And right now, you cannot match the deeds of this administration.

Instead, he goes to the debate after Bernie, as Trump -- as Chris Stirewalt said, Biden got foamed like an under-ripe melon in Super Tuesday. There's going to be more elections tomorrow. And we know that Bernie is not going to do well in those either. So instead, Biden goes to this debate.

My biggest issue was with Bernie Sanders saying that we have a dire lack of medical personnel in this country right now. If you think it is bad now, give every doctor and nurse a 40 percent pay cut, and see what your medical personnel looks like in 10 years when no one is going to medical or nursing school because they won't be able to make a decent living. And, you know, I want to go back to what Bernie Sanders also said about big pharmacy. It is the urgency right now that as acting upon these companies and it is the competition they have with each other, in addition to this health crisis, to try and save thousands and potentially millions of lives. And if it is the competition with each other that's going to get us there faster, then I would say that's the best thing that's happening right now and the best thing that will come of this in the future when we're able to fast track other vaccines and biologics for viruses like this."

Joe Biden had a much better debate last night. He's spoken cleaner sound bites, he was much more eloquent, much more in control. He had a much more soothing voice and he only started getting rattled about 45 minutes in and a lot of people after 45 minutes are looking to watch something else. He was easily pushed over to the left by Bernie Sanders. And that's where Bernie started to make some headway that said, Joe, you have not been leading. You've been behind the curve on gay marriage, on the bankruptcy bill, on Hyde, on war on trade. And Biden got very, very defensive and didn't handle that well. But do I think that Bernie landed a knockout punch? Absolutely no. Joe is going to technically win that debate and continue to do well in these next few states."

If you bought three bags of Doritos, you'll eat those when you really only intended to buy one. So I think that the free market is going to -- you'll see these shelves get back to normal pretty soon.

The reason why people are hoarding toilet paper, it's mimetic theory. We desire things according to the desire of others. So when you see some people by X, then more people buy X, and then that creates an escalation as rivals compete. You see this every Black Friday when a group of people are pulling a really crappy shirt because they want the crappy shirt and they don't even know why they want the crappy shirt. So that's what's happening with the toilet paper is that it's pure imitation, psychological imitation.
