It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this according to my rundown is \"The Five.\" President Trump's laser focused on cracking down on illegal immigration. I'm sure you've heard that before. It was a hallmark of his campaign making America safe again. In fact, border crossings are down. Yet, a new report suggests he sent fewer Mexicans back to their country between January, December of this year compared to President Obama did during the same time in 2016. Now, President Trump, as you know, is working hard at keeping Mexicans from crossing over illegally in the first place, he hinted last week he'll make a trip soon to our southern border over to San Diego to look at prototypes for his proposed wall. He's going to ultimately make the choice. They're going to be about 30 feet high. And then we'll see if they're going to do something below, because we have a little tunnel problem. Kennedy.",

I think fewer people are coming here. They've arrested more immigrants, but they have deported fewer back to Mexico, so I think we'll see. When it comes to the wall, though, I do not predict that President Trump will be able to build a wall across the entire border. I think he will find places where he can put up a structure, so he could go take a photo with it, say he's kept his promise, because in some of these places I think the land owners aren't going to want -- aren't going to want to give up their land.

That they don't want border patrol to be on their property, working with border patrol to make sure that people aren't crossing back and forth, but that doesn't necessarily mean they want their ranches divided by a big wall. So, there is going to be a very big battle there.   In terms of the numbers, not all illegal immigrants in this country are Mexicans. In fact, only 50 percent of them are. The rest are other than Mexican. And one of the big problems we have too is the visa overstay. There're 54 million people who come into the country every year, 700,000 of them tend to stay behind. Interior enforcement is an issue. And under Obama, he was called the deporter-in-chief. But the way that they measure that number was you catch people at the border and immediately deport them, and they counted that as a deportation. That's not going in the community and revving people up and deporting them, they were counting people coming across, turning themselves into border patrol and then getting kicked back out as a deportation.

Well, still attracting the very best people in the world to come and work at businesses and help take care of families and participates in the economy. I mean, that's ultimately what you want. So the question is how do we fix immigration to keep bad people out without compromising our civil liberty? And that's a big goal. It's the ultimate goal. But I think, actually, Republicans and Democrats are much closer on that, because people essentially want the same thing. They want the country to be safe. They want the best and brightest people here. And they realize that the system is broken on several ends. You know, visa and visa over-stay that Katie talked about, we have to fix the visa system.

It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this according to my rundown is \"The Five.\" President Trump's laser focused on cracking down on illegal immigration. I'm sure you've heard that before. It was a hallmark of his campaign making America safe again. In fact, border crossings are down. Yet, a new report suggests he sent fewer Mexicans back to their country between January, December of this year compared to President Obama did during the same time in 2016. Now, President Trump, as you know, is working hard at keeping Mexicans from crossing over illegally in the first place, he hinted last week he'll make a trip soon to our southern border over to San Diego to look at prototypes for his proposed wall. He's going to ultimately make the choice. They're going to be about 30 feet high. And then we'll see if they're going to do something below, because we have a little tunnel problem. Kennedy."

And also, it shows that the president has a much bigger heart than President Obama who is absolutely awful about deporting people and ripping families apart. And it's laughable that he reached out to the Latino community the way he did, because he was incredibly heartless with his deportation. And President Trump is actually softened there and look for other ways to try to solve the immigration crisis we've face in this country."

And the second half of the year when we didn't do anything policy wise because congress couldn't get their act together, it picked up again.

      "utterance": "Well, I think we will see how big President Trump's heart is when as we deal with DACA in the New Year. I mean, if we look at 2018 that's the biggest immigration fight we're going to have, I think, pretty early on. The numbers are interesting, I'm not sure exactly what to make of them. I think fewer people are coming here. They've arrested more immigrants, but they have deported fewer back to Mexico, so I think we'll see. When it comes to the wall, though, I do not predict that President Trump will be able to build a wall across the entire border. I think he will find places where he can put up a structure, so he could go take a photo with it, say he's kept his promise, because in some of these places I think the land owners aren't going to want -- aren't going to want to give up their land. You know, they very much don't want the government coming in, in some of these places, and taking their land to build a wall."

      "speaker": "KATIE PAVLICH, GUEST CO-HOST",
      "utterance": "But if you go back, Texas, especially, this is an issue because there are families who are actually property owners, land owners before Texas became a state and part of the United States of America. So there are -- the culture there is a little bit different on how they deal with the issue. However, that does not mean that they don't want border security. That they don't want border patrol to be on their property, working with border patrol to make sure that people aren't crossing back and forth, but that doesn't necessarily mean they want their ranches divided by a big wall. So, there is going to be a very big battle there. In terms of the numbers, not all illegal immigrants in this country are Mexicans. In fact, only 50 percent of them are. The rest are other than Mexican. And one of the big problems we have too is the visa overstay. There're 54 million people who come into the country every year, 700,000 of them tend to stay behind. Interior enforcement is an issue. And under Obama, he was called the deporter-in-chief. But the way that they measure that number was you catch people at the border and immediately deport them, and they counted that as a deportation. That's not going in the community and revving people up and deporting them, they were counting people coming across, turning themselves into border patrol and then getting kicked back out as a deportation. And that's why that number was so high."

Evidently, there's a bipartisan committee in the senate meeting right now that are attacking chain migration because I believe the sentiment on both sides to attack it, the lottery as well, and DACA. You mix it up with border security. Could this be our first joint legislators since the early '20s?"

Well, still attracting the very best people in the world to come and work at businesses and help take care of families and participates in the economy. I mean, that's ultimately what you want. So the question is how do we fix immigration to keep bad people out without compromising our civil liberty? And that's a big goal. It's the ultimate goal. But I think, actually, Republicans and Democrats are much closer on that, because people essentially want the same thing. They want the country to be safe. They want the best and brightest people here. And they realize that the system is broken on several ends. You know, visa and visa over-stay that Katie talked about, we have to fix the visa system.

So, in DACA, of course, the president is saying, listen, I'm kind of interested in getting this done by March.

I think that that was something he got in exchange for being a yes on tax reform or as part of a conversation. Chuck Schumer was part of the gang of 8 who talked about ending chain migration. This is something that Democrats are absolutely opening to talking about. If that's the package that gets put together earlier in the New Year, the closer you get to November, the harder it becomes.

What is the threshold in terms of the timing from when they were brought here, do you get to stay? Sixty six percent of the illegal immigrants in this country have been here for more than ten years, which means the rest of them have only been here for five. That's a lot of people we're going to be looking for some kind form of amnesty. And it ultimately doesn't solve the question of what do we do with people who are here, because they're not all dreamers. And let's not forget that Barack Obama's dreamer policy caused an influx of unaccompanied minors, caused a huge crisis, and that is a potential to happen again if they aren't careful about the way that they debate the legislation."

That is the money that was use under Obama, and that's how he got away with doing it and not going through congress. So, I do think that we have to rethink our priorities, DACA is one that a lot of people can agree on, but there are bigger immigration problems putting Americans first that the president campaign on that I think should be kept first."

And this is where I give people credit for having a more subtle and nuanced conversation about immigration, because they realize it's really heartless to deport people if this is the only home that they've ever known. And that's the basis for the argument for protecting dreamers. But also, at the same time, having said that, then you don't create the influx, you kind of close the door, and that's when you fix the immigration system. And I don't think that you shut down the number of visas. I think you do a better job of vetting people and allow people in who are going -- good people who are going to work hard. What is the metric for that, how do you vet that? I don't know. I don't know if anyone has the answer."

And if their parents are illegal immigrants, which many of them are, because ICE has delivered children to their parents in this country that's been living here illegally for years, what do you do with their families? Do they automatically get amnesty? Do they get to stay? What is their status? And so, that's a very tough question because you can argue if you pass through DACA, the entire family by default gets to stay because we're not a heartless country that deports and breaks up families.

And honestly, it really is lazy journalism for them to throw all of their headlines to focus entire newspapers around tweets, means that they're not actually doing the digging. They're not doing the real investigative work that they need to be doing on big topics. We've seen them really screwing up big reports with anonymous sourcing about major Russia bombs that have repeatedly had to be retracted or corrected. So I think that they need to take a step back.

But China could and should do more he says. Our spy satellite had captured photos of Chinese ships illegally selling oil to North Korean boats, more than two dozen times since October. China has decline to confirm it, but President Trump did today, tweeting, caught red-handed, very disappointed that China is allowing oil to go into North Korea, there will never be a friendly solution to the North Korea problem if this continues to happen. Marie, isn't a lot of the basis of why we can't come to a solution with China on the North Korea problem based on a lack of trust between China and the U.S.?"

Sure, they don't want North Korea to be able to launch nuclear weapons all around the world. But they also don't want war on the peninsula. They don't want it totally imploding North Korea where there's refugees flowing across the Chinese border. They have economic interests as well. So, part of the goal has to be convincing China that our interests are the same and really putting some teeth behind this to get them more onboard, because at the end of the day, sanctions are not going to end North Korea's nuclear program. It is going to take much more pressure from countries like China, like Russia, and others to really get some better solutions."
