Why would President Trump participate in another attempt to impeach him? It didn't work the first time. He was framed. He -- not guilty. And then they want to retry him? Double jeopardy.

The replacement to NAFTA is also another one. And where Trump is smart here politically is the Democratic base likes the union work. They like the infrastructure spending.

How does one get points for a path that's forced on you? Who knows what this loser would have done if he wasn't in jail? Actually, we do know.  In 2015, the traitor says ISIS did a spectacular job. He also endorsed violence to create a caliphate. He knew what ISIS was doing. They were killing people who have been guilty of nothing more than good behavior, every other day they dropped a video of a terrified person about to be beheaded, burned alive or drowned. So while innocent people were killed, he cheered. That's what you call a monster, a monster now free to roam. Unlike CIA Officer Mike Spann who was murdered shortly after interrogating this punk in Afghanistan. Now this could've ended differently. Treason was once punishable by death, back when adults ran this place. But we're better than that now. We're more enlightened. And besides, he looks like a folk singer. So prepare for the second wave of media analysis. He'll be the victim, you'll be the perp. No, actually, he was a political prisoner. They'll be lining up to give him that first interview asking him if he's healed from the trauma of terrorizing people. Then a speaking engagement at Columbia, perhaps a book deal. A yuck up with Bill Ayers or maybe Seth Meyers. And so, as always, America is the land of second chances even for scum who don't deserve a first. So what is the deal with early behavior, Katie? I don't get it. Like, shouldn't early behavior be tested on what you do when given a chance? Not when you're on a box.",

It blew up the meeting, and now she's not delivered on border security and infrastructure. It's her caucus that's out of control. It's her that hasn't delivered for the American people. And it's actually her caucus that's trying to obstruct the investigation into the witch hunt. Think about it honestly for a second, Juan. Why would President Trump participate in another attempt to impeach him? It didn't work the first time. He was framed. He -- not guilty. And then they want to retry him? Double jeopardy. Why would you walk into that trap? After you were cleared, after you were found not guilty, why -- the Democrats are basically saying, ah, we can't impeach him and he's fighting back really hard, so that's why we have to impeach him.

But getting back to the issues that the president was talking about today in terms of trade and China, Chuck Schumer actually agrees with President Trump on China. He's one of the people backing him up and saying we know that there's pain, this is very difficult for the middle of the country, but China has been cheating and we agree with the president, there has to be something long- term that is fix. The replacement to NAFTA is also another one. And where Trump is smart here politically is the Democratic base likes the union work. They like the infrastructure spending. And Trump keeps coming to them with plans, publicly in these press conferences and you can drag them out because it's an event of an announcement or something else, and he's offering it to everyone to see and Democrats are not willing to do that."

All the time he was behind bars, he didn't behead anyone. That's the thing about jail, it's hard to get away with acting like a Taliban killer, which is why I don't understand good behavior. How does one get points for a path that's forced on you? Who knows what this loser would have done if he wasn't in jail? Actually, we do know. In 2015, the traitor says ISIS did a spectacular job. He also endorsed violence to create a caliphate. He knew what ISIS was doing. They were killing people who have been guilty of nothing more than good behavior, every other day they dropped a video of a terrified person about to be beheaded, burned alive or drowned. So while innocent people were killed, he cheered. That's what you call a monster, a monster now free to roam. Unlike CIA Officer Mike Spann who was murdered shortly after interrogating this punk in Afghanistan. Now this could've ended differently. Treason was once punishable by death, back when adults ran this place. But we're better than that now. We're more enlightened. And besides, he looks like a folk singer. So prepare for the second wave of media analysis. He'll be the victim, you'll be the perp. No, actually, he was a political prisoner. They'll be lining up to give him that first interview asking him if he's healed from the trauma of terrorizing people. Then a speaking engagement at Columbia, perhaps a book deal. A yuck up with Bill Ayers or maybe Seth Meyers. And so, as always, America is the land of second chances even for scum who don't deserve a first. So what is the deal with early behavior, Katie? I don't get it. Like, shouldn't early behavior be tested on what you do when given a chance? Not when you're on a box."

I hear this in this conversation, that's not a charge that he was convicted of. He was convicted of violating an executive order that said no contact, no aid to the Taliban. That's all he was convicted of. And so he served his time. So, to my mind, you know, if you want to be angry at somebody, you know, go talk to the prosecutors. But as far as this young man is concerned, I think he's an American, there's about 60 other people in the next five years who have been convicted on terrorist charges who are going to be released.

It eventually got cleaned up after media reports. And rats are taking over here in New York City. The rodent problem is so bad.

They can't fill potholes and they can't plow. So why is that, it's because they need to have conservatives with them you. Can have the Liberals, the Leftist, they provide the ends, but the conservatives, Republicans provide the means. And you separate them, they put the waste in wasteland. I mean this happened when public government advocated the responsibility in dealing with public behavior. So you can sleep on the street, you can urinate on the street, you can do drugs on the street, you can harass tourists. And cities let it happen, because they don't feel they have the moral power to do it. And really what this is about is actually it's having the moral authority to say these people have mental health problems. They need to be taken off the street and put somewhere. Get them well, because a lot of these people are mental ill. There's a lot of people - I have to talk about this, because I live in an area where there are a lot of junkies and hustlers, they're really healthy. They're not going to be benefited by more housing, because they don't have $600, $800 a month for a - it's not about housing either. It's just - it's about government letting it happen."

The corruption is so rampant, because local prosecutors don't ever indict their bosses, because they don't want to upset the fundraising and the gravy trains. They spend all their tax dollars buying off public and political supporters with pork and not distributing it evenly. And then they don't use police departments aggressively. Greg says you can use police departments in a in a smart humane way to clean up misdemeanor action and they have this politically correct mentality, that's permissive and it permeates everything. So it says you can't criminalize behavior. And it allows you know junkies to run wild, homeless people to run wild, because as Greg said, no one wants to be the bad dad. No one wants to come in and get tough and clean stuff up and knock heads together and institutionalize people and clean up the streets, because they can't handle."

I think that when you look at New York City - and by the way with the exception of Katie, all these people live in New York City, yes, and New York City I think they suffered a small decline of population in the last year, which is argued - you know people are arguing by. But the big picture here or the big trend is that from 2010 to 2018, 2.7 percent increase in the population of New York, 9 percent increase in the population of San Francisco, 5.2 percent increase in the population of LA. In other words, people are moving to big cities and oftentimes the homelessness is a result of the fact that with more gentrification, housing prices go up and lots of people get pushed out. Some of them, sadly, like you said, mental issues, but someone for just a matter of money, income inequality end up on the street."

One of the reasons is that the traffic is so bad there's like nobody - people would rather sacrifice having a yard and they would like to live in the city, because, one, there's like the great restaurants, and there's things like that. But also they don't have to spend an hour or more in a car so that there's a problem with governance in terms of long term planning for all of hours of getting around, that's really important, that's why we need an infrastructure plan. Also sanitation is basic, health and safety is basic, law and order is basic, and you watch local elections in the next few years, they will - it will come down to this.

Erdman was a star in the 50s and the 60s in the 70's appearing in Perry Mason, Hogan's Heroes and some Alfred Hitchcock movies. This was I think in 1951 movie \"Cry Danger\".
