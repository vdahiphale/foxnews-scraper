We know this guy, Strzok, anti-Trump guy, ran the Clinton email investigation and ran the Russia-Trump investigation. He was soft on Hillary and he was tough on the Trump people. That's already been established. But, there's a belief now that this guy Strzok took the fake Russian dossier and used the dossier to apply for a FISA warrant that was then used to spy on the Trump campaign. So think about that. And he's stonewalling and won't answer questions about if he used it or not. So fake Russian dirt paid for by Hillary was use to spy on Trump. That's a huge story. And we also learned today, another Department of Justice official has been demoted because he had contacts with the foreign agent who cook up the fake Russia dossier, and had contacts with the founder of the firm that Hillary paid to deliver the fake Russian dossier. And the FBI won't answer questions about it today in public. The DOJ is stonewalling congressional investigators. They're just trying to find out who is the person that applied for the FISA warrant to spy on the Trump team? What information? Was the dossier used as justification to get the warrant to spy on the Trump team? They're not getting answers. So what is the Department of Justice and the FBI hiding? Why are they afraid? And it is, you know, it's a Trump's Justice Department. Why is the Trump's Justice Department un-answering questions from house Republicans? It's very conspiratorial, and I think we're beginning to crack the case.",

You could neglect an inexperienced senator from Illinois who relentlessly expands executive power with a phone and a pen. A radical progressive just a stone's throw from Stalinism, which killed over 100 million people. See how easy this stupid game little game is? So as Obama indulges lazy tropes, he ignores the crushing of ISIS; a free press that's now louder than ever; and a federal government whose reach and size may be shrinking for once.

So they made the decision. So she's saying, there you go. It was nothing hidden. It's not like it came out after he became president of the United States. And quite frankly, Al Franken is lucky because, as Greg said, this could come out earlier. He got to be, you know, in government and work for the people and have this position for quite a long period of time before this information even came out.

He said he came to politics late in life, but he worked very hard and he worked in the tradition of -- you may not know this name, but Paul Wellstone who was a terrific senator from Minnesota, very much a progressive, you know, kind of, you know, farm labor Democrat type of persona that fits into Minnesota. And Al Franken had to scribe to get beyond the image that he was just a comic and to be dismissed as a political neophyte, and he did so and he's a very popular senator both in Minnesota and nationally. So much so that people were talking about Al Franken running for president. So now you come to a day when all of this goes to tatters. And his allies -- I mean, people like Kirsten Gillibrand, Patty Murray, are leading the fight to toss him overboard.

We know this guy, Strzok, anti-Trump guy, ran the Clinton email investigation and ran the Russia-Trump investigation. He was soft on Hillary and he was tough on the Trump people. That's already been established. But, there's a belief now that this guy Strzok took the fake Russian dossier and used the dossier to apply for a FISA warrant that was then used to spy on the Trump campaign. So think about that. And he's stonewalling and won't answer questions about if he used it or not. So fake Russian dirt paid for by Hillary was use to spy on Trump. That's a huge story. And we also learned today, another Department of Justice official has been demoted because he had contacts with the foreign agent who cook up the fake Russia dossier, and had contacts with the founder of the firm that Hillary paid to deliver the fake Russian dossier. And the FBI won't answer questions about it today in public. The DOJ is stonewalling congressional investigators. They're just trying to find out who is the person that applied for the FISA warrant to spy on the Trump team? What information? Was the dossier used as justification to get the warrant to spy on the Trump team? They're not getting answers. So what is the Department of Justice and the FBI hiding? Why are they afraid? And it is, you know, it's a Trump's Justice Department. Why is the Trump's Justice Department un-answering questions from house Republicans? It's very conspiratorial, and I think we're beginning to crack the case."

So you have people like Karl Rove writing on the Wall Street Journal this morning, but others as well saying in the congress don't fire the special counsel. And if you do, there's going to be consequences. So they're trying to put in place laws in congress that would require the president to go through a court and justify a request to fire the special counsel. That's where this story is heading.

I do think though that reporters are going to try with every one of these athletes to get them on the record to talk about President Trump. If I were their representative, I would tell these athletes you don't need to do these interviews. If you want to focus on winning, do that.
