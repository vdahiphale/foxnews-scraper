      "sentences": "Hey, Howie. Yes, center of the storm is getting close to probably the Rhode Island coastline, maybe right around Connecticut as well, over Block Island that is off the eastern tip of Long Island, continuing to pull towards the north. Storm surge is coming in now, especially across near Gan. So bay, that said, high tide is receding or moving towards low tide, so a lot of water is trying to come out of the bay while the water is being pushed into the bay as well. You also notice on the radar, not much rain to the east side of the storm. Most of the rain is off towards the west side of the storm where there's more population as well. Tropical storm warnings are in effect now. The hurricane warning has been eliminated because storm weakened a little bit. It has moved over much colder water. A hurricane needs about 80-degree water temperature in order to sustain itself. Now, it's right here off the coast and water temps are just into the lower 70s and upper 60s, so rapid weakening of the storm. It's going to move up towards the northwest before eventually moving off towards the east. That said we're talking about a really slow process here for about the next 24 hours. It is not very common in the northeast to have a slow-moving storm. This one is going to be moving very slow. Because of that, a much bigger flood threat for us. We're going to be seeing a lot of rain, very heavy rain. Also, because the ground is pretty saturated in the interior sections, because of the remnants of what was last tropical storm Fred that moved through this week, this additional rain and the wind, maybe 40, 50 mile an hour range, it is going to probably knock over some trees and branches and that will cause some power outages across a pretty big area here. But you get the idea areas of the Eastern Pennsylvania all the way up across parts of Vermont and New Hampshire in some sort of flood warnings right now. So that's going to be the immediate concern. The storm surge will subside over the next couple hours, and then we turn into this prolonged rain event. New York City last night in one hour got more rain than they've ever recorded in any one hour period, almost two inches in an hour. And Brooklyn saw over six inches of rain already from this storm and that caused some pretty significant flooding. So, more of that ahead. But that said the winds are now down to 60 miles an hour. That is certainly helpful, especially for some of the trees and maybe that diminish our power outage threat just a little bit. Howie?",

I mean the president said among many other things, we planned for every contingency. I can't imagine how anyone could believe that at this stage. He made other assertions. For example, oh, we couldn't really have seen this coming and then we see some of the evidence in the cables being leaked that perhaps they were warned that this is happening.

U.S. Military officials privately harboured fundamental doubts for the duration of the war that Afghan security forces could ever become competent or shed their dependency on U.S. on money and fire power. One official quoted in 2016, thinking we could build the military this fast and that well was insane. So, over several administrations, was this lying to the public or was itself delusion?",

I was not alive during Vietnam. I've read about Vietnam. You hear stories about Vietnam. I think there are definitely some parallels across multiple administrations where the United States is dug in on a policy for a very long time. The policy is in some ways obviously failing but they have to try to dress it up because there's so much American prestige on the line, their reputation is on the line. They feel like maybe, you know, a corner is going to be turned. And if we're going to put our men and women in harm's way, we have to be completely honest with the American people, because otherwise, you're going to undermine the credibility and the believability of the government in general.

There have been so many examples where it was, as Jennifer Griffin pointed out, you couldn't fact-check quickly enough. I mean, the president said none of his military advisors told him to keep 2,500 troops. She confirmed that back in March that the general -- General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint chiefs, advised to keep troops. He said al-Qaeda is gone from Afghanistan. His secretary of state has said this morning that that is not actually completely true. He said we have no troops in Syria. The Pentagon said we have 900.

You keep them until everybody else, all the vulnerable civilians and other aid workers and government workers are removed and then the military is the last out.

You know, it was just so reminiscent of those World War II movies, it was just horrible. We can report with the tremendous relief that he and his family did get through the checkpoints, the Qataris got them through the checkpoints, got them on the Qatari aircraft and even as we speak they are heading to Doha, the capital of that oil of-rich emirates and we -- presumably a better life awaits.

I just want to -- one quick note, question you had earlier about Taliban compliance to the ceasefire and allowing the evacuation. I told you the misery we had getting through the Taliban lines. We did it successfully. But here is something that encourages me. The Taliban has taken over Afghanistan. They don't have a pot to take a leak in. They don't have any money. The banks are empty. All the financial credit of Afghanistan has been seized by the United States and other international regulators. They have no one picking up the trash, no one making the water run, no one making the lights go on. Very shortly all of those necessary utilities will go by the wayside. The cell phones they treasure will soon not be working because there's no one maintaining the system. I take now, excuse me, there is a rare chance to get the Taliban to comply, certainly to get the evacuations completed. I think that that is very necessary. In terms of the military --",

      "utterance": "Hey, Howie. Yes, center of the storm is getting close to probably the Rhode Island coastline, maybe right around Connecticut as well, over Block Island that is off the eastern tip of Long Island, continuing to pull towards the north. Storm surge is coming in now, especially across near Gan. So bay, that said, high tide is receding or moving towards low tide, so a lot of water is trying to come out of the bay while the water is being pushed into the bay as well. You also notice on the radar, not much rain to the east side of the storm. Most of the rain is off towards the west side of the storm where there's more population as well. Tropical storm warnings are in effect now. The hurricane warning has been eliminated because storm weakened a little bit. It has moved over much colder water. A hurricane needs about 80-degree water temperature in order to sustain itself. Now, it's right here off the coast and water temps are just into the lower 70s and upper 60s, so rapid weakening of the storm. It's going to move up towards the northwest before eventually moving off towards the east. That said we're talking about a really slow process here for about the next 24 hours. It is not very common in the northeast to have a slow-moving storm. This one is going to be moving very slow. Because of that, a much bigger flood threat for us. We're going to be seeing a lot of rain, very heavy rain. Also, because the ground is pretty saturated in the interior sections, because of the remnants of what was last tropical storm Fred that moved through this week, this additional rain and the wind, maybe 40, 50 mile an hour range, it is going to probably knock over some trees and branches and that will cause some power outages across a pretty big area here. But you get the idea areas of the Eastern Pennsylvania all the way up across parts of Vermont and New Hampshire in some sort of flood warnings right now. So that's going to be the immediate concern. The storm surge will subside over the next couple hours, and then we turn into this prolonged rain event. New York City last night in one hour got more rain than they've ever recorded in any one hour period, almost two inches in an hour. And Brooklyn saw over six inches of rain already from this storm and that caused some pretty significant flooding. So, more of that ahead. But that said the winds are now down to 60 miles an hour. That is certainly helpful, especially for some of the trees and maybe that diminish our power outage threat just a little bit. Howie?"

Instead, as we came on the air last Sunday morning, it was over in the blink of a news cycle. I'm Howard Kurtz and this is \"MEDIA BUZZ\" from Los Angeles.

It sounds like no one in the military or -- there were some contrary voices, but the consensus view was that this wouldn't happen and it did happen.

And to have those completely blown up, their predictions, just crushed by the reality, it makes it even harder for them in their P.R. efforts here. I mean the president said among many other things, we planned for every contingency. I can't imagine how anyone could believe that at this stage. He made other assertions. For example, oh, we couldn't really have seen this coming and then we see some of the evidence in the cables being leaked that perhaps they were warned that this is happening. He said there's no al-Qaeda left in Afghanistan. That's patently untrue. He said that Americans who want to get to the airport can get to the airport immediately.

Mara, to the extent that some media liberals are trying to defend President Biden and his team, is that he made the difficult decision to get out, a withdrawal supported by more than 70 percent of the public in poll after poll, then it's that oh, the execution left something to be desired."

Guy, very important story in the Washington Post, let me read a quick excerpt. U.S. Military officials privately harboured fundamental doubts for the duration of the war that Afghan security forces could ever become competent or shed their dependency on U.S. on money and fire power. One official quoted in 2016, thinking we could build the military this fast and that well was insane. So, over several administrations, was this lying to the public or was itself delusion?"

I was not alive during Vietnam. I've read about Vietnam. You hear stories about Vietnam. I think there are definitely some parallels across multiple administrations where the United States is dug in on a policy for a very long time. The policy is in some ways obviously failing but they have to try to dress it up because there's so much American prestige on the line, their reputation is on the line. They feel like maybe, you know, a corner is going to be turned. And if we're going to put our men and women in harm's way, we have to be completely honest with the American people, because otherwise, you're going to undermine the credibility and the believability of the government in general. And if we need to go to war at some time in the future, you're going to have a lot more people, I think, skeptical and asking questions --"

And of course, we found out from later books and research and the Pentagon papers that military officials knew that it was going very badly. Mara, the president doesn't seem to be holding anyone accountable. Guy alluded to earlier a memo unearthed by \"The Wall Street Journal,\" cable sent directly to Secretary of State Tony Blinken, saying that the Taliban could take over very quickly after the August 31st withdrawal deadline. Obviously, it didn't even take that long. Blinken on Fox News Sunday said he got the cable, he acted on it, but the evacuation didn't increase by very much. I think that is part of the -- become very much part of the story line here as well."

I think they truly believed that the Taliban wouldn't work this swiftly. Whether it was the failures before 9/11, to anticipate that, weapons of mass destruction, what happened to those, and now 20 years in Afghanistan with nothing to show for it, that is -- that shakes the foundation of the credibility of the world's foremost super power.

There have been people critical of the idea of negotiating with the Taliban, the way that that went down, the details of the negotiation, some of the spin right now about what it did or did not entail. Of course, to have the current administration, the people actually in charge now trying to pretend like their hands were tied by the previous administration, I think, is (INAUDIBLE). I mean, they have overturned Trump policy on almost every front, but on this one, they had to stick with it even though they had already pushed the deadline back. I think that's where their spin starts to fail. And as for this notion that Trump would have done it better, it would have happened better and more competently under the previous administration, there's no way to prove or disprove that proposition, except to say it's very, very difficult for me to imagine this going any worse than it is under President Biden."

Big majorities of American voters wanted out after 20 years and billions, even trillions of dollars. And also, don't forget, Joe Biden wanted out of Afghanistan before Donald Trump was elected president. He was skeptical of the surge under Obama. He always wanted out. This is about the execution, not the policy itself. I think, as Guy said, t's impossible to prove or disprove whether Donald Trump would have done it better. I think that is completely irrelevant. Right now, Biden owns this. But Afghanistan was a four administration project starting with George W. Bush."

He had invited Taliban leaders to Camp David. There was an uproar that never happened. By the way, Barack Obama released Taliban leaders, much fewer numbers, of course, in exchange for American Bowe Bergdahl, very big uproar at the moment. But is that all ancient history now that we're dealing with the situation where there are still thousands of Americans and tens of thousands of Afghans who want to get out of the country and escape possible reprisals under Taliban rule?"

If your policy is we're going to move forward with whatever it might be, it's on you to get it right. To say that they're not getting it right is a vast understatement. Howie, as you say, thousands of Americans, we don't know how many, but thousands of Americans and tens of thousands of our allies are still stuck in Afghanistan. The administration doesn't know how many of them there are. I saw earlier on TV, the national security advisor came out and said we will have a plan -- the secretary of state -- we will have a plan to get those people to the airport which means they're still trying to formulate a plan."

The rhetoric does not match the reporting that we're getting from people who are witnessing it first- hand. There have been so many examples where it was, as Jennifer Griffin pointed out, you couldn't fact-check quickly enough. I mean, the president said none of his military advisors told him to keep 2,500 troops. She confirmed that back in March that the general -- General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint chiefs, advised to keep troops. He said al-Qaeda is gone from Afghanistan. His secretary of state has said this morning that that is not actually completely true. He said we have no troops in Syria. The Pentagon said we have 900. There have been so many other instances, especially considering when he said there were no problems with Americans getting to the airport and we've just seen image after image of people having trouble getting in."

But if you take a look out here, we actually have some teenagers swimming and this is exactly what officials and the National Hurricane Center are warning not to do because of these dangerous riptides that we see right now. Fire island was actually evacuated yesterday, a voluntary evacuation, because of how high the storm surge would be and they even canceled all of the ferries today just because it would be impossible to get people off of the island because of these winds and of course the waves that we're seeing right here. So, this is exactly what officials are urging people not to do, to stay home. Of course, the roads, many of them are flooded, urging people to stay back if they can. Of course, with supplies.

You keep them until everybody else, all the vulnerable civilians and other aid workers and government workers are removed and then the military is the last out. That's always the way, we've all seen war movies. My goodness, it doesn't take any genius planning in the Pentagon to know the order of evacuation. And this was totally misjudged in my view, it was mishandled, it was misrepresented. I think in many ways will scar the Biden administration, certainly taint the aura of competence that it may have had. We personally at Fox agonized over this, Howie, when our long-time friend and translator who I still will not name was trapped in a hotel there. We couldn't get him through, he and his family through the Taliban checkpoints to the airport. We were just living on pins and needles, worried. The Taliban on the first night particularly that they were in the hotel came by knocking at the doors, knocking the door with their feet saying who is in here, who did you work for, you know, let me see your papers. You know, it was just so reminiscent of those World War II movies, it was just horrible. We can report with the tremendous relief that he and his family did get through the checkpoints, the Qataris got them through the checkpoints, got them on the Qatari aircraft and even as we speak they are heading to Doha, the capital of that oil of-rich emirates and we -- presumably a better life awaits.

To me, that was the end of the war. That was -- we went there to get -- to revenge what happened on 9/11. We didn't go there to rebuild or remake Afghanistan.

Let's take Cuba most recently, we had the people protesting because of the lack of vaccinations and food drying up in Cuba, there were people who wanted the United States to have some military adventure in Cuba. It is bizarre. It is incumbent on those of us who have some kind of prudence and some reasonable experience to pull back on that. We should use the military less, not more. I just want to -- one quick note, question you had earlier about Taliban compliance to the ceasefire and allowing the evacuation. I told you the misery we had getting through the Taliban lines. We did it successfully. But here is something that encourages me. The Taliban has taken over Afghanistan. They don't have a pot to take a leak in. They don't have any money. The banks are empty. All the financial credit of Afghanistan has been seized by the United States and other international regulators. They have no one picking up the trash, no one making the water run, no one making the lights go on. Very shortly all of those necessary utilities will go by the wayside. The cell phones they treasure will soon not be working because there's no one maintaining the system. I take now, excuse me, there is a rare chance to get the Taliban to comply, certainly to get the evacuations completed. I think that that is very necessary. In terms of the military --"

But I take your point that it needs some financial aid from the world and maybe that moderates to behavior. But coming back to this question of, you know, a lot of people, particularly on the right, but also some on the left who, you know, we've got to go into Iraq, weapons of mass destruction, we've got to go into Afghanistan, a very different situation of course in the wake of 9/11 and trying to get Bin Laden. And here we are 20 years later. But isn't it true that most of their kids don't go to war, that it's usually sending people from other families?"

I mean, I was against the war in Vietnam, mainly because I was targeted by the draft, I was one of the millions of people about to be drafted so I snuck into law school in my particular case and then I felt so guilty about it, Howie. I became a war correspondent and then chased wars around the -- around the globe ever, ever since."

Afghanistan is a remote country in the middle of nowhere. You know, now I think about Iran and Pakistan and China and the stands from the old Soviet Union that border Afghanistan, they have their hands full. You know, the job America did in policing this wild and crazy country, now falls to these neighbors. I hope China inherits it. I want China to go broke. I want China to bring in these Muslim, you know, fundamentalists and have them mix with the Chinese Uyghurs, you know, the Muslim population on the western side of China, let's see how that works out for China. Afghanistan is going to have a chance --"

      "utterance": "But of course, Geraldo, -- of course, Geraldo, the argument that some in the media may who are perhaps more sympathetic to using the military -- U.S. military than you are is that we have to fight international terrorism and that Afghanistan under the Taliban could again become a haven for those who want to make violent trouble around the world including the U.S. That's always the argument. And you see the retired general come on the air and say that. And it's not without significance given our history."

You get -- one guy is Abdullah and Abdullah number two, they can, they get $25 worth of ingredients and they have an IED. You know, the B-52 flying at 20,000 feet is not going to stop these two people from making their bomb. Terrorism is a private -- you know, sometimes it needs logistical support like 9/11. Nine-eleven is a bigger deal than they are usually capable of."

      "utterance": "Mike Richards, the new host of Jeopardy, is out after an embarrassing wave of rough media coverage. First, there were a couple lawsuits accusing Richards of treating women unfairly, we told you about that last week. Then the Ringer reported on disparaging remarks Richards made about women's views and others on his podcast seven years ago, such as calling his female co-host a booth slut. The Jeopardy producer already accused of rigging the competition in his favor and clearly with the encouragement of Sony Pictures apologized for the unwanted negative attention that that has come to Jeopardy and said becoming the host would be too much of a distraction for our fans and not the right move for the show. He stays on as producer. What an embarrassment. Now it's back to more celebrity tryouts. After all the critics slammed Chris Cuomo for the role he played in his brother's defense and resignation, the CNN host finally broke his silence and said there are fun filled interviews last year were always meant to be temporary."

Here is part of that exchange."
