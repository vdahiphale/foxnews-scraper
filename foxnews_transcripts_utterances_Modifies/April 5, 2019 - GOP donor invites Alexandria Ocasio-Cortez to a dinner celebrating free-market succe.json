Welcome, everyone. I'm Charles Payne, in for Neil Cavuto, and this is \"Your World.\"  Now to the guy who will lead the Department of Homeland Security's emergency response at the border, Manuel Padilla.  Sir, thank you for joining us.  First, I want to know, what's the first thing that you would like to see happen to stop the surge of illegal immigrants at our southern border?",

Then you have this immediate response that the Secretary Nielsen stood up, taking some bold access to address the current emergency on the border. That's where I come in. I -- we stood up the interagency border emergency coordination cell.  And what that means really is bringing capabilities from across the spectrum of U.S. government agencies, and bringing them to bear on the border to be able to stabilize and secure the border to the extent that we can with this surge.   And then, ultimately, the longer-term solution is Congress.",

And there -- there's an inherent degradation to the border security mission just because of the resources that we have are not limitless.  So that's kind of the situation that we're facing. Mexico has problems with it. Now they're doing a way better job in addressing this migrant flow to the United States. And so what we have on the border is, we want to make sure that we return to the border security mission, because that is closely related to national security, as you well know.

That was what President Trump just said moments ago in this ongoing roundtable discussion with Border Patrol agents and immigration officials here in Calexico. After that is finished, he's going to be coming here to this brand-new section of the border wall.  It's actually replacing an old border wall that was built in the 1990s. It was -- the plans for replacement were put in place during the Obama administration, but it took President Trump assuming office to finally fund it. And so that's why the White House is calling this the first completed section of his border wall. It's about two miles' long. In this roundtable discussion, President Trump just said that, over the next two years, he hopes to build 400 new miles of wall. But there are a lot of legal challenges that he is going to have to confront first. Now, I want to give you guys just a little bit of a sense of why this wall is so necessary right here in Calexico. For starters, Border Patrol agents say that it's necessary to keep their agent safe from rocks and blocks of concrete that are being thrown at them over the shorter older section of the wall, which, as I said, it's just about two miles away. And the latest incident of that happened just two days ago.   And then, second, they say it's needed to try to stem this surge of migrants. From 2017 to 2018, this sector has seen a 97 percent increase in apprehensions of family units. And President Trump just noted another statistic. He said that, from January in February of this year, compared to January and February of last year, there's been a 400 percent increase in family apprehensions here in Calexico, so some huge numbers. Now, in this local border town community, there's been a great deal of concern that President Trump might use this trip to announce that he was shutting down the border. We now know that President Trump is not going to do that, at least for now, because he says that Mexico has really stepped up its border apprehensions over the last few days. In fact, Charles, at this roundtable, he actually thanked Mexico for doing its part. We still don't have the exact hard numbers of -- as in terms of exactly how many migrants and family units that Mexico has turned around, but President Trump, at least publicly, seeming very happy, very positive with what -- with what Mexico is doing.   And he's now giving them one year to continue doing this or do even more, or else he says he's going to slap tariffs on auto imports. And then, if that doesn't work, then he would close down the border  But that would just have a devastating economic toll on this border community and really all over the U.S., Charles.",

That's more than anticipated, but, more importantly, it alleviates recession concerns, after a dismal February that saw only 33,000 jobs created. So, on balance, the U.S. added an average of 180,000 jobs in the first three months of the year.  Yes, that's down from last year's monthly average. But it's actually in line with 2017. Wages continue to rise above 3 percent, which makes Americans feel richer, also encourages more spending, especially with wages going up faster than inflation. And that's important for people earning lower incomes, because they can afford more. So the jobless rates holding near those 49-year lows with close to historically low unemployment rates for African-Americans, Asians and Hispanics. Now, the question is, which sectors were hiring in the month? Well, we saw a big month for health care and the need for hospital workers and ambulance drivers. Professional jobs as well, like engineers and accountants, tech jobs went up as well. So did food and beverage and construction. Manufacturing, though, saw job losses of 6,000, but this is after a blistering 2018, which was the best year for manufacturing jobs in over two decades. But despite the strong month in hiring, President Trump is not satisfied, arguing that the economy would do even better with lower interest rates.",

But there were a lot of minority votes saying, no, don't do this. Well, why? Because, among other things, of privacy interests, of things that didn't need to be revealed in order for the American people to understand, did the president commit perjury? Yes. Did he commit obstruction of justice? Yes. But you don't have to put in unnecessary things. What Bill Barr, very briefly, is doing, as I see it, he's following the law. And he restated that. He wasn't trying to say, here's a summary of the Mueller report. He's doing exactly what the governing regulations, Charles, specifically and expressly require, namely, to inform the Congress, right, not to supply the report. But he's going to go beyond what the regulations, which have been in effect, Charles, for 20 years. Those regulations haven't been changed.

We have done a tremendous job on drugs coming into the country, if you look at some of the numbers. We're having a news conference next week at the White House on the impact that we have had between opioid and all of the other problems we have with drugs, different drugs than we had 10, 15, 20 years ago, much different, but also the drugs coming in through the border.

      "utterance": "Well, Charles -- Charles, President Trump's message to migrants who might be trying to cross the border here in Calexico is, turn around, the system is full, this border sector is full, we cannot take you. That was what President Trump just said moments ago in this ongoing roundtable discussion with Border Patrol agents and immigration officials here in Calexico. After that is finished, he's going to be coming here to this brand-new section of the border wall. It's actually replacing an old border wall that was built in the 1990s. It was -- the plans for replacement were put in place during the Obama administration, but it took President Trump assuming office to finally fund it. And so that's why the White House is calling this the first completed section of his border wall. It's about two miles' long. In this roundtable discussion, President Trump just said that, over the next two years, he hopes to build 400 new miles of wall. But there are a lot of legal challenges that he is going to have to confront first. Now, I want to give you guys just a little bit of a sense of why this wall is so necessary right here in Calexico. For starters, Border Patrol agents say that it's necessary to keep their agent safe from rocks and blocks of concrete that are being thrown at them over the shorter older section of the wall, which, as I said, it's just about two miles away. And the latest incident of that happened just two days ago. And then, second, they say it's needed to try to stem this surge of migrants. From 2017 to 2018, this sector has seen a 97 percent increase in apprehensions of family units. And President Trump just noted another statistic. He said that, from January in February of this year, compared to January and February of last year, there's been a 400 percent increase in family apprehensions here in Calexico, so some huge numbers. Now, in this local border town community, there's been a great deal of concern that President Trump might use this trip to announce that he was shutting down the border. We now know that President Trump is not going to do that, at least for now, because he says that Mexico has really stepped up its border apprehensions over the last few days. In fact, Charles, at this roundtable, he actually thanked Mexico for doing its part. We still don't have the exact hard numbers of -- as in terms of exactly how many migrants and family units that Mexico has turned around, but President Trump, at least publicly, seeming very happy, very positive with what -- with what Mexico is doing. And he's now giving them one year to continue doing this or do even more, or else he says he's going to slap tariffs on auto imports. And then, if that doesn't work, then he would close down the border But that would just have a devastating economic toll on this border community and really all over the U.S., Charles."

    {
      "speaker": "LI",
      "utterance": "So, March payrolls hit almost a perfect pitch for Wall Street. Why, you ask? Well, we saw job growth of 196,000. That's more than anticipated, but, more importantly, it alleviates recession concerns, after a dismal February that saw only 33,000 jobs created. So, on balance, the U.S. added an average of 180,000 jobs in the first three months of the year. Yes, that's down from last year's monthly average. But it's actually in line with 2017. Wages continue to rise above 3 percent, which makes Americans feel richer, also encourages more spending, especially with wages going up faster than inflation. And that's important for people earning lower incomes, because they can afford more. So the jobless rates holding near those 49-year lows with close to historically low unemployment rates for African-Americans, Asians and Hispanics. Now, the question is, which sectors were hiring in the month? Well, we saw a big month for health care and the need for hospital workers and ambulance drivers. Professional jobs as well, like engineers and accountants, tech jobs went up as well. So did food and beverage and construction. Manufacturing, though, saw job losses of 6,000, but this is after a blistering 2018, which was the best year for manufacturing jobs in over two decades. But despite the strong month in hiring, President Trump is not satisfied, arguing that the economy would do even better with lower interest rates."

Charles, that's one step beyond quantitative tightening ending and one step beyond the Federal Reserve taking interest rates back down to the zero-bound. Something tells me that somebody in the administration is looking at the entrails of today's jobs report and what they're seeing is really starting to frighten them, because the bulk of the jobs that are being created are either part-time or in industries that are very low-paying. If you look back to last June to today, we have seen a 43 percent decline in high-paying jobs. And somebody in the administration has got to be taking fright of this, because consumption is what makes our economy go round."

We're this close to making new all-time highs once again. And a full V recovery that's happened every time in history, until it doesn't, would take the distance of that sell-off, add it on to that old high. We'd be looking at about 3400 in the S&P, which is about 17 percent higher. I don't view this as anything negative. I view it as someone just talking the book. They want the best performance out of the stock market they possibly can get. Now, it's intellectually dishonest, though. These are the same people who were looking for interest rate hikes in 2015. So you got to understand what they say and what they do or two different things. It was a bit surprising for the markets, but next week is a big week. We get earnings. And I think, next week, we're probably going to push through and make those new all-time highs once again."

But for what they call nonsupervisory blue-collar workers, it's been eight months in a row. I think the good news is that the Fed is not going to stop that . Finally middle America getting a raise, that says something."

These are indeed blue-collar type of positions. And we have seen the fastest wage gains in that in that segment. And that's why we have seen confidence particularly among this cohort of Americans increase at a much faster pace than that for people who make a little bit more money and/or are in a professional sector. But, again, 40 percent of spending in this country is attributable to the top 20 percent of earners. Sixty percent is attributable to the top 40 percent of earners. We can have the wage gains that you're seeing in the lower-earning segments, Charles, but we have to have everybody spending, including those who make the most."

This was one of his first appearances -- this was his first appearance since the video came out, his apology video came out yesterday. Actually, I think the people that Joe Biden is trying to appeal to aren't so offended by the fact that he's making light of this. He has said his piece. He has said he sorry if anybody feels uncomfortable. He has not yet apologized for what his intention -- for what he actually did. He said his intentions were always pure, he never had mal-intentions."

Then he continues to make jokes about it. And making jokes about consent or people feeling uncomfortable, I don't think is very funny. And I don't think many other people would think that's funny either. So by him coming forward, being interviewed today, saying, I'm not sorry for anything I have ever done, I think that's a very bold statement, which I don't think people are going to be happy about. And then when it comes to people coming forward, saying, Joe Biden, you have made me very uncomfortable, you have touched me in ways that I didn't feel comfortable with, and he's saying that he's not sorry for that, even if that wasn't his intention, he should be sorry, if that's the way he made people feel.

So I would say that, yes, that is still the bigger issue, because while he is by many standards a progressive, the Democratic Party since he has been out of office -- and keep in mind now he's been -- in political time, he's been out of office quite a long time. He has really, I think -- the party has moved in a different direction. He hasn't had to take a stand on a lot of these issues.

We just can't have a system where we have people pouring into take advantage of our country, and then we catch up, and we have DACA. Then we're going to have DACA 2.0, 3.0, DACA for these kids who came on the border -- across the border today? So you have to have a regular, orderly entrance into the United States if you want to have immigration reform. That must be the first step. And the president has fought for his wall. And I think the wall is an effective piece of border security."

So, therefore, they come in less numbers, because they realize they can't get away with it. The other thing, Charles, I do want to add -- and I think this is important -- I wish the president would add one element to his strong language. And that is how much we welcome legal immigrants. I don't think you can say that enough. I think it would help round out some of the president's harder, rougher edges. But it's an important statement about who we are as a country and what the future of our country, is we rely on immigrants. Immigrants replenish us. They're important for our values. Illegal immigrants don't."

Democrats have to support border security. Republicans have to support immigration. That is -- and Republicans have to allow DACA to take place. If you do that, you have got the ingredients for comprehensive immigration reform. I think Republicans are right, though. It does start with border security. Without that, there is no meaningful reform, because we have a broken system."

      "speaker": "KENNETH STARR, FORMER SPECIAL PROSECUTOR",
      "utterance": "Well, welcome to Washington, Charles. Aren't you glad that you're based in New York? Listen, they were right then. We urged the Congress of the United States to be very careful, to be judicious with our report, because it was highly sensitive. And obviously it became a subject of great controversy and criticism, and understandably so, because the fall unredacted report was put on the Internet by the vote, fairly substantial majority. But there were a lot of minority votes saying, no, don't do this. Well, why? Because, among other things, of privacy interests, of things that didn't need to be revealed in order for the American people to understand, did the president commit perjury? Yes. Did he commit obstruction of justice? Yes. But you don't have to put in unnecessary things. What Bill Barr, very briefly, is doing, as I see it, he's following the law. And he restated that. He wasn't trying to say, here's a summary of the Mueller report. He's doing exactly what the governing regulations, Charles, specifically and expressly require, namely, to inform the Congress, right, not to supply the report. But he's going to go beyond what the regulations, which have been in effect, Charles, for 20 years. Those regulations haven't been changed. Congress has allowed the Justice Department to return to the good old- fashioned way of doing things, which is, you don't reveal grand jury information, you don't reveal unnecessarily embarrassing information, and you certainly don't reveal national security information. They were right then."

    {
      "speaker": "STARR",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. The statute under which I was appointed, which has gone away, required us to send a report, a referral, it was called, to refer to the House of Representatives. And that's what we did, not a redacted report, but give us essentially the entire thing. That's what we have walked away from. And who did that? Who changed the rules? Well, Congress did by letting the independent counsel statute expire. That was a good thing. And then Attorney General Janet Reno and the Clinton administration promulgated these new regulations, which were much more sensitive to the legal requirements such as grand jury secrecy."

      "speaker": "PAYNE",
      "utterance": "Real quick, because we got less than a minute. When you hear politicians, in this case the Dems, calling this a cover-up, the way A.G. Barr's going about this, how inflammatory is it? And how difficult does it make future processes like this?"

It further erodes the idea that we are all committed to doing things by the book, to doing things in a lawful way. We say we agree with and abide by the rule of law.
