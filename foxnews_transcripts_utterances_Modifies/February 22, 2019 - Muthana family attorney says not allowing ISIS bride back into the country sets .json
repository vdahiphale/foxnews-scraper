President Trump and China's president now appear much more optimistic that a deal could be struck, as trade talks are extended for at least another couple of days. We're all over it with Kevin Corke at the White House, where the president just met with China's top trade negotiator and vice premier, and FOX Business Network's Ashley Webster on how the markets are reacting.  Let's just say, very nicely, thank you. First to Kevin at the White House -- Kevin.",

The talks in Washington, of course, have been key to de-escalating the trade conflict between the world's largest economies. And, quite honestly, it's been really tough on China. You have seen their economy dramatically slow down. There's also been collateral damage here domestically, particularly in our ag sector.   Now, the president's rosy outlook was not only echoed by China's vice premier. It was also echoed by Steve Mnuchin, the treasury secretary, who today announced that Chinese negotiators would extend their visit to Washington by a couple of days in order to build on the progress that has been made this week. Now, that meeting today in the Oval a very interesting one, wide-ranging comments afterwards. Of course, the president is also looking forward to a trip to Asia for the upcoming summit with Kim Jong-un, their second meeting, the last one over in Singapore, this time over in Vietnam.  Interesting times here at the White House, but again a big trade deal could be soon happening. Fingers crossed, Neil -- back to you.",

      "sentences": "Very nice. Thank you very much, Neil. You're right. So far, in fact, 2019 has been a rip-roaring winner for the U.S. markets. And after a rotten December, the markets have climbed steadily in part because Wall Street believes that eventually the U.S. and China will indeed find a way to seal the trade deal. But, as we saw today, the markets very much headline-driven and the psyche can change quickly, today, very positive. That said, the major indexes are all up at least 11 percent. And consider these numbers. The Dow today hitting the 26000 level for the first time since November.  The Dow and Nasdaq have not had a negative week this year. They finished up nine straight weeks in a row and, by the way, the S&P recording its fourth straight positive weeks.  So what's going on, other than China? Well, we have a much more dovish Federal Reserve. Fears of more interest rate hikes now on the back burner, as job numbers, well, they remain strong and inflation is stable. All good news for the markets. Also, as the rest of the world sees economic growth slowing down, well, the U.S. for the most part continues to roll along. In other words, we are the best game in town. And, lastly, with interest rates still low, high dividend-paying stocks look a lot more attractive.   And as long as these factors are still in place, Neil, investors will be bullish. But I have to say this, it's not all roses. Consider Warren Buffett. His Berkshire Hathaway today took a massive hit the. Shares of Kraft Heinz dived 27 percent of a number of negative reports. That means the Oracle of Omaha has lost more than $4 billion in a single day. Ouch.",

We're 20 percent off those lows from December in the Dow, the S&P and the Nasdaq. So it's been a complete reversal, and there's more upside potential here. Now, I think the catalyst that Ashley referred to, we talked about a couple months back, if you will remember. In the other pit, we were talking about how the markets were forecasting no interest rate hikes in all the 2019.  When that commentary came out, since that time, the market has been in rally mode. If you look at the S&P, the broad market in general, that's our barometer. The S&P had a 600-point drop. If you add that 600 points, if we do get up to the top, we have a full recovery. That target is 3500, which is 30 percent above. So there's still a lot more upside. So odds are that we could do what we have done every time in history where we have sold off and we bounce back and made new highs.",

I think that's interesting, as we talked about interest rates. If the dollar doesn't have any rate hikes, it can't -- it's hard for the dollar to rise. So I think that could be another wind at the market's back. But we have shifted sentiment. We went from wall of worry to now slope of hope, so let's see where we go. And you have seen every time the market sells off even a little bit, it bounces right back. So we have -- we have changed course as far as the mentality of the markets. And look for this to continue.

And then any other country that aligns with him, well, they're in that same position as well, such as Iran and Russia and even Cuba.

I can tell you in other venues we have talked to people and have turned entire situations like this on its head. If we have them and promise them something such as sanctuary or that we're going to allow them to continue to have their units after Maduro leaves, that's important. What I'm concerned about is that Maduro has surrounded himself by Wagner Group people. They belong to an oligarch that's close to Vladimir Putin. We killed a couple hundred of them in Syria last year. So this is something that is unpredictable, plus the fact that the Cubans have gangs that are going to be reinforcements, like the Fedayeen that we faced in early 2003 going into Iraq. The same sorts of tactics are about to take place. Hopefully, the military will not fire upon the aid deliverers, that the people will be able to get what they need. But this is...",

Other averages jumping as well, a good Friday, a good week, a good market. Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto. President Trump and China's president now appear much more optimistic that a deal could be struck, as trade talks are extended for at least another couple of days. We're all over it with Kevin Corke at the White House, where the president just met with China's top trade negotiator and vice premier, and FOX Business Network's Ashley Webster on how the markets are reacting.

We want to make this a deal that's going to last for many, many years and a deal that's going to be good for both countries. But we want to make it meaningful."

The talks in Washington, of course, have been key to de-escalating the trade conflict between the world's largest economies. And, quite honestly, it's been really tough on China. You have seen their economy dramatically slow down. There's also been collateral damage here domestically, particularly in our ag sector. Now, the president's rosy outlook was not only echoed by China's vice premier. It was also echoed by Steve Mnuchin, the treasury secretary, who today announced that Chinese negotiators would extend their visit to Washington by a couple of days in order to build on the progress that has been made this week. Now, that meeting today in the Oval a very interesting one, wide-ranging comments afterwards. Of course, the president is also looking forward to a trip to Asia for the upcoming summit with Kim Jong-un, their second meeting, the last one over in Singapore, this time over in Vietnam. Interesting times here at the White House, but again a big trade deal could be soon happening. Fingers crossed, Neil -- back to you."

      "speaker": "ASHLEY WEBSTER, BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Very nice. Thank you very much, Neil. You're right. So far, in fact, 2019 has been a rip-roaring winner for the U.S. markets. And after a rotten December, the markets have climbed steadily in part because Wall Street believes that eventually the U.S. and China will indeed find a way to seal the trade deal. But, as we saw today, the markets very much headline-driven and the psyche can change quickly, today, very positive. That said, the major indexes are all up at least 11 percent. And consider these numbers. The Dow today hitting the 26000 level for the first time since November. The Dow and Nasdaq have not had a negative week this year. They finished up nine straight weeks in a row and, by the way, the S&P recording its fourth straight positive weeks. So what's going on, other than China? Well, we have a much more dovish Federal Reserve. Fears of more interest rate hikes now on the back burner, as job numbers, well, they remain strong and inflation is stable. All good news for the markets. Also, as the rest of the world sees economic growth slowing down, well, the U.S. for the most part continues to roll along. In other words, we are the best game in town. And, lastly, with interest rates still low, high dividend-paying stocks look a lot more attractive. And as long as these factors are still in place, Neil, investors will be bullish. But I have to say this, it's not all roses. Consider Warren Buffett. His Berkshire Hathaway today took a massive hit the. Shares of Kraft Heinz dived 27 percent of a number of negative reports. That means the Oracle of Omaha has lost more than $4 billion in a single day. Ouch."

Melissa, last time you were here, you were very optimistic about the state of things, despite the volatility, and said that a lot of that volatility was overdone. Do you think that that's still the case?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MELISSA ARMO, THE STOCK SWOOSH",
      "utterance": "Yes. And, look, look, how we rallied. I was right. December 26 was the last time we were near the lows, and really now we're only 3 percent off the high. So the Stock Swoosh tip of the day is follow the trend. We never broke the uptrend, even when we sold off in December. And people got out. And now guess what? If we get a trade deal done any time in 2019, we could make new highs again and hit over that 27000 number, that number that's looming out there that the Dow got close to and didn't get over yet."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, we should point out you're saying the Dow is within 3 percent of those highs reached back in September, the S&P close to that. Alan Knuckman, one of the things that's interesting is looking about the advance early this year, because it's still relatively early in the year, is you have everyone going along for the ride, industrials, the industrial sector up 17 percent year to date, energy up 14 percent, technology 13 percent."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "KNUCKMAN",
      "utterance": "Well, like you say, it is a broad bounce. And I want to build on what you said at the open. It's not only been a good couple of weeks. It has been a good month and a good 2019. We're 20 percent off those lows from December in the Dow, the S&P and the Nasdaq. So it's been a complete reversal, and there's more upside potential here. Now, I think the catalyst that Ashley referred to, we talked about a couple months back, if you will remember. In the other pit, we were talking about how the markets were forecasting no interest rate hikes in all the 2019. When that commentary came out, since that time, the market has been in rally mode. If you look at the S&P, the broad market in general, that's our barometer. The S&P had a 600-point drop. If you add that 600 points, if we do get up to the top, we have a full recovery. That target is 3500, which is 30 percent above. So there's still a lot more upside. So odds are that we could do what we have done every time in history where we have sold off and we bounce back and made new highs."

      "utterance": "Melissa, I am cognizant of what happened to Kraft Heinz losing a quarter of its market value today, very unique circumstances, I understand that, a huge write-down, problems getting the Kraft and Oscar Mayer businesses in synch and all of that. I get that. But does it say anything to you about basic staples and consumer resistance, or is this a Kraft Heinz unique development?"
    },
    {

    },
    {
      "speaker": "ARMO",
      "utterance": "But I will tell -- I will say one thing. When you look at the overall market and you look at the tech sector, which has been leading the way, 2016, 2017, 2018, like Apple, for example, which is one of the strongest stocks in the market, Apple doesn't look that great. So let's just say tech comes and goes and makes new highs and starts to look strong again this year. You're going to see the market take off like a rocket, because really the market right now is what -- the overall market -- I'm saying them market ETFs. I'm saying the SPY, which is the S&P ETF. I'm saying the Diamonds, which is the Dow ETF. Those -- those look stronger than specific stocks, which is very unusual, Neil. It's very unusual."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "That is unusual. No, you're right about that. Another thing that's finally happening, Alan, and I don't know how free you are to talk about some of these specific examples, but the delayed IPOs, initial public offerings from companies that were stymied by the government shutdown, they couldn't be written off by the Securities and Exchange Commission, now they're on again. So you have Pinterest coming to market, Lyft coming to market. These are going to be multi-10s of billions of dollar offerings here and more to come. What do you think?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "KNUCKMAN",
      "utterance": "Yes, and it's all about timing, like everything else. So, sometimes, they get skittish, when the markets are stalled out. Let's see what happens with the dollar. I think that's interesting, as we talked about interest rates. If the dollar doesn't have any rate hikes, it can't -- it's hard for the dollar to rise. So I think that could be another wind at the market's back. But we have shifted sentiment. We went from wall of worry to now slope of hope, so let's see where we go. And you have seen every time the market sells off even a little bit, it bounces right back. So we have -- we have changed course as far as the mentality of the markets. And look for this to continue. We have still got some very, very strong trends, and I think people are starting to appreciate what the fundamentals of the markets are, as opposed to so much politics and policy."

The Democrats, they will -- I have been -- I have been in D.C. for, what, a little less than two months. The Democrats will say, oh, we want border security. They just won't fund it. They say we want to take care of the DACA kids. They just won't do it. So the president doesn't have a choice. We have to secure our border. I was down at the border a little -- a little over a week ago meeting with border security. And they said, we need more people. We need newer technology. Their technology is very old. And we need some barriers to direct people where they should be coming in, so we can make sure we have legal immigration and don't have illegal immigration. So I think the president is in a tough position. But I believe he ought to be using his emergency power to keep us safe."

So, you know, we have to make sure elections are honest, ethical, fair. And we don't want any fraud in them. That's we tried to do to, make sure we did in Florida, made sure that they were free and fair. So, I think this is just one example of an election that didn't seem to work out right. So it appears they're doing the right thing."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

This was, again, the president and a lot of North Carolina officials are saying, in this district, isolated."

The biggest company I ran was a large hospital company. And you wanted to make sure, how do I make sure I had the better -- best pricing, the best patient satisfaction, best outcomes for our patients? And so technology can do that. If you look what's going on right now, it's exciting. Now, we do have to figure out how can we drive down the cost of drugs? We have to figure out how we have a delivery system that works better. We have got to make sure people get health care even if they have a preexisting condition. But it's exciting, what is going on in technology, especially in the health care arena."

Look at what has happened to our economy. I always tell him, he's doing what we did in Florida. He's cut taxes, reduced regulation, and jobs have come back. We added 1.7 million jobs. They have added millions of jobs since President Trump was elected. So, that's the number one thing. And number two is, we got to make sure people are safe. He's trying his best to do that. We're building up the military again. He's working on border security. I think it will be very difficult to beat him in a primary."

And all of this hits the fan again tomorrow, when Juan Guaido -- Guaido, I should say -- the leader we recognize, the opposition leader we get recognize as the due leader of Venezuela, forces the issue and brings thousands of his closest friends to make sure that that aid can get in.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "WEST",
      "utterance": "Well, I think one of the key things, we need to be pushing the United Nations to be ready to send some type of force in there to make sure that people are not being starved to death. This is an international incident that we're looking at today because other countries are involved. The other thing is that Nicolas Maduro has been put any really bad box right now, because if he continues to enact violence against unarmed innocent civilians that are just looking to get food and medical aid, then he does put himself in the position that we all know that he is a socialist dictator and a despot. And then any other country that aligns with him, well, they're in that same position as well, such as Iran and Russia and even Cuba. So I think that you're looking at the international community has to be able to make a response to this, and not just the United States of America, but we need to be prepared to provide whatever support that we can."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right. You reminded me last time we chatted that, you want to know who gets through this process, look who has the military with them. And, right now, Nicolas Maduro does, although, today, another high-ranking former top general, Hugo Carvajal -- I hope I'm pronouncing that correctly -- had indicated that it's high time for Nicolas Maduro to go. He is urging just that, and other military leaders to follow him. Do we need to see a lot more than that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WEST",
      "utterance": "Well, of course you do, because the thing is, these generals are starting to realize that, without a doubt, Nicolas Maduro has a golden parachute. And, as a matter of fact, much of his resources and gold are already being -- maybe being shipped out to Russia or elsewhere. But they're going to be left behind. They're going to be held accountable. And what happens for them? When you look at the rank and file of the military, that the money is starting to dry out, and maybe even their families are the ones that are starving. Those generals are not going to be able to continue to make those soldiers obey their orders which they don't see as being lawful or just anymore."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "What I worry about, Colonel, is what happens when someone calls the order, whether it's from Maduro's office or not, shoot to kill if anyone tries to get their hands on that aid tomorrow?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WEST",
      "utterance": "Well, that's where I think you're going to see a bit of an issue. Are these really soldiers of the Venezuelan army, or could they be some of these Cuban agents that have been sent down there to try to provide some type of protection and also a buffer for Maduro to keep him safe? So I think that's a critical issue. But I don't think the rank-and-file military will want to turn their guns on their own citizens and take their lives. And then the other thing is, you could see Maduro allow this aid to come in, but then he just confiscates it later and tries to control it. And that's what we saw back in Mogadishu, Somalia, with the warlord Mohamed Farrah Aidid."

We will be live with \"Cavuto Live\" tomorrow beginning at 10:00 a.m. Eastern time, monitoring that throughout the show, and how this whole thing goes down. It could be a crucial test of those generals and whether they still stick by a leader who might try to tell them, shoot those who try to get the aid. That will be a very tough call, and that could be a very violent one as well. We will have more after this."

Democratic presidential hopefuls rallied around the actor, you might recall, but they're not exactly backpedaling with the support. They're just being quiet on it right now. Let's get a read on all this and how this could be factoring into the 2020 race. It might be premature for that. But let's get a read from National Review contributor David Bahnsen. We have also got Politico reporter Gabby Orr and Democratic strategist David Burstein. David, end with you, get your thoughts on how this shapes up in one way, politically.

But I think the reality is, this is part of a problem,an emerging of pop culture in our politics, which has been going on for some time. It's front and center. You have to condemn these things. But people should -- as they did at the beginning of this. But they have to be equally outspoken when something like this comes out. This is an atrocious..."

And on this issue in particular, look, I don't think that any voter is going to have this in their mind in November 2020 when they choose which candidate to support. But what this does do right now is, it opens a lot of these Democratic candidates up to charges of political calculation. Jussie Smollett is black. He's gay. He is a member of Hollywood, which tends to skew to the left. So it's obvious why they would have immediately jumped on this and issued the strongest condemnation of his alleged assailants."

They have millions of Twitter followers, and they are now spreading misinformation about something. So I think they have to be careful on how they move forward. One of them who we have seen sort of learn a lesson through this is Kirsten Gillibrand, who said that she wants to wait going forward to issue any statement until she knows the exact facts of this case."

I think that what is happening here, this idea that Mike Pence was to blame for this attack, those things are not going to be forgotten. The idea that there's this entire segment of the American population that is guilty of racism and homophobia every day just because they happen to be conservative Republicans, that's the issue that I think moves elections.

At the same time, his former personal attorney Michael Cohen will be testifying before at least a couple of House committees. Awkward. The Daily Mail's White House correspondent, Francesca Chambers. Wow, timing is everything, but that's your weird timing. What do you think?"

      "speaker": "FRANCESCA CHAMBERS, THE DAILY MAIL",
      "utterance": "Well, the White House says that they're not concerned about that, Neil. I was speaking to Kellyanne Conway a little bit ago and had a chance to ask her how concerned they were, right, because the president and the White House want the focus to be on is nuclear summit with Kim Jong-un. But that will be taking place overnight in the United States. During the day, at least one of those days, we will be hearing directly from Michael Cohen, because while he is testifying three times, two times are behind closed doors, once is in a public hearing before the House Oversight Committee. So we will be seeing that play out. Kellyanne Conway said that it's up to networks where they decide to take a split-screen. However, again, the summit itself will be overnight. And that hearing will be during the day in the United States."

There were reports it was going to be as soon as next week we might get a preliminary report. I don't know how they do this. But now that was shelved and said, no, no, no, it won't be next week. But what are you wearing?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHAMBERS",
      "utterance": "Well, if that report were to come out, that's another item that the president would be getting asked about again during that summit and potentially have a chance to overshadow what he wants the focus to be on. But even speaking to the summit, Neil, the White House has been lowering expectations this entire week. First, it was that there could be some sort of a framework that could come out of it, but now Sarah Sanders saying today that they will just continue to talk at this summit and really saying that that was the expectation of the White House."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, so this whole process, obviously, a report does come out. Democrats in the House can be the first to pick it apart and pursue whatever they want to do from that. But, I mean, is it your sense that whatever is produced might not be the damage that some Republicans, for example, had feared?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHAMBERS",
      "utterance": "Well, you also have to look to the president's comments this week, when he said that it would be up to the attorney general to decide whether a report would come out."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CHAMBERS",
      "utterance": "So he's not signaling -- signaling one way or the other. But the fact that he seems to be saying that he wouldn't mind that it would -- whether it would come out or not, that it's in the attorney general's hands, I think, maybe suggest that they're less worried about it than they may have been a few months ago. And, of course, the president reiterating today there is no collusion, there's no evidence of collusion. So, therefore, he should have nothing to be concerned about."

    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Yes, I hadn't thought of that, the way they were saying this is going to be up to Bill Barr, whatever he wants to do. All right, thank you very, very much, Francesca. Good seeing you again."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "All right, it wasn't that long ago Lieutenant Colonel Bob Maginnis was telling me, when it came to Venezuela, watch the military, watch what happens, and watch who follows orders. Sure enough, it's going to be on tenterhooks tomorrow, after violence today, with a lot of folks trying to get their hands on that aid. Then the soldiers started shooting. And now the candidate who is recognized as the president in our eyes, Juan Guaido, is testing that by bringing thousands of his friends to some of these checkpoints here that have been closed off to get the aid and force the issue. Lieutenant Colonel Bob Maginnis back with us. What do you -- what do you think happens, Bob?"

      "speaker": "LT. COL. BOB MAGINNIS (RET.), U.S. ARMY",
      "utterance": "It all depends, Neil, on what we have done behind the scenes with the six division commanders in that country. I can tell you in other venues we have talked to people and have turned entire situations like this on its head. If we have them and promise them something such as sanctuary or that we're going to allow them to continue to have their units after Maduro leaves, that's important. What I'm concerned about is that Maduro has surrounded himself by Wagner Group people. They belong to an oligarch that's close to Vladimir Putin. We killed a couple hundred of them in Syria last year. So this is something that is unpredictable, plus the fact that the Cubans have gangs that are going to be reinforcements, like the Fedayeen that we faced in early 2003 going into Iraq. The same sorts of tactics are about to take place. Hopefully, the military will not fire upon the aid deliverers, that the people will be able to get what they need. But this is..."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

I cannot imagine -- but you know this stuff better than I -- where they're trying to get that aid, and the soldiers are under orders shoot to kill, if they do."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MAGINNIS",
      "utterance": "Well, that's why I'm saying these outside influencers, China and Russia, and Hezbollah and others, the Cubans, are going to have a role here. But it's behind the scenes. It's backing up Maduro. Now, if we find that Maduro is..."

    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",

    },

      "utterance": "Because some of those guys, those generals, retired and otherwise, they're peeling off, three at the latest count, most of them saying now's the time to look Juan Guaido as the duly deemed head of this country. But you're saying these are other nefarious elements that could block that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MAGINNIS",
      "utterance": "Well, they're the foreigners that are around Maduro. And, once again, you go back to the combatant commanders, the commanders that have the troops with the rifles, Neil. If in fact those are the people that are still loyal to Maduro, then they will fire tomorrow. If they are not loyal, and there's been some sort of deal behind the scenes, and Maduro's family's gone, and he has a plane warmed up on the runway, then he will leave. So these are the types of issues that we won't know about until well after the fact."

All right, we will be following it very, very closely here. Indications are that Juan Guaido has not changed one item of that. He is going to go and force the issue in person with a lot of Venezuelans. We will be on it -- more after this."

And he will participate or says he will participate in this effort to try to get aid that is waiting at checkpoints all around the country into the country. But there aren't a lot of guys like him. There are a lot more soldiers who have guns who will be more poised to do quite the opposite. We will be following that tomorrow at 10:00 a.m. Eastern time, also the fallout from my interview with that lawyer who represents the father of an ISIS bride who wants back in the United States -- all live on \"Cavuto\" tomorrow. It's going to be a busy two hours. I have a feeling it's going to be a very, very busy day. We're there for you. We have got you covered.
