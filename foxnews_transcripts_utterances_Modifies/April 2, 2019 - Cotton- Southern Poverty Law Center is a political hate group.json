      "sentences": "Good evening and welcome to “Tucker Carlson Tonight.” Donald Trump ran on the promise that he would secure our southern border when he ran in 2016. He ran on other things, too -- trade, Obamacare and ending the Iran deal, but it was immigration that resonated. No other candidate was saying anything like it. Voters loved that's why they yelled, \"Build that wall\" at his rallies. More than two years later, we have less control though over immigration into this country than we did the day Trump launched his campaign. Entire populations from Latin American are moving north. In February, authorities apprehended 76,000 arrivals at the Mexican border, but last month that number had ballooned to 100,000.  They are coming because they know that they can come. Our current system can't stop them. If illegal immigrants show up here with children, they are almost certain to be released into the United States. They will never be deported.  Close to 100 percent of children and families detained at the border last year are still here. It's a scam. Before 2013, only one percent of aliens arriving at the U.S. border sought asylum based on credible fear in their home countries. Now, more than 10 percent do. They know the script. Even CNN can't lie about it anymore.  Yesterday, to his credit, one of their anchors went to the border and talked to people trying to cross illegally into the U.S. Watch this conversation. It is the most honest thing that has run on CNN in a long time.",

If you lived in Honduras, you would come here, too. We are begging them to come here. No wonder immigration is out of control. They know that we are happy to give our country away as we are.  Our lawmakers are allowing this to happen. They could close the loopholes that allow it in about an hour, but they haven't done that. They likely won't do it. They show no interest in the effects this invasion is having on normal Americans -- the suppressed wages, the stolen identities, the clogged emergency rooms and failing public schools, the fentanyl crisis. They don't care. The Chamber of Commerce tells us that everything is fine. Just yesterday, they attacked the White House for even suggesting we might have to shut down the border to protect the country. Guacamole prices might rise. Democrats, meanwhile, rejoice in the scale of this disaster. More illegal immigration means more power for them. They are actively for it.

So what we are doing is we have announced that we are sending more migrants back to Mexico to await their immigration proceedings. We are pulling folks from the ports of entry to help interdict those who are choosing to come here illegally. It is a crime, despite what you just showed, sitting senators saying it is a crime to come illegally between ports of entry. To stop them and to provide humanitarian assistance.

We've broken up so called child recycling rings, if you can believe it in the last couple of months which is where smugglers kidnap a child, they give it to an adult to cross the border, present themselves as a family. Once they get in, because as you know, we can only hold families for 20 days. They send the child back and bring the child back with another family -- another fake family, another adult.

And the circumstances that you described, Tucker, of the confluence of the state of our laws and leaving them vulnerable -- our border vulnerable to people who show up claiming asylum, which didn't used to be the case. That wasn't the way it used to work. It used to be, you know, as you pointed out, single men sneaking across the border. Now, it's very different. And the combination of our laws and what the Courts and how the Courts have interpreted them have left us more or less defenseless against this surge of migrants across the border.  And this -- it really is an issue that requires a change in the law, and the Democrats do not want to play along now. Now, they may be awakening to the fact that people are starting to get really upset about this, but they have two reasons. One is ideological, they really do believe many of them that we are this great land that should take care of the downtrodden people of the Earth.

      "utterance": "Good evening and welcome to “Tucker Carlson Tonight.” Donald Trump ran on the promise that he would secure our southern border when he ran in 2016. He ran on other things, too -- trade, Obamacare and ending the Iran deal, but it was immigration that resonated. No other candidate was saying anything like it. Voters loved that's why they yelled, \"Build that wall\" at his rallies. More than two years later, we have less control though over immigration into this country than we did the day Trump launched his campaign. Entire populations from Latin American are moving north. In February, authorities apprehended 76,000 arrivals at the Mexican border, but last month that number had ballooned to 100,000. They are coming because they know that they can come. Our current system can't stop them. If illegal immigrants show up here with children, they are almost certain to be released into the United States. They will never be deported. Close to 100 percent of children and families detained at the border last year are still here. It's a scam. Before 2013, only one percent of aliens arriving at the U.S. border sought asylum based on credible fear in their home countries. Now, more than 10 percent do. They know the script. Even CNN can't lie about it anymore. Yesterday, to his credit, one of their anchors went to the border and talked to people trying to cross illegally into the U.S. Watch this conversation. It is the most honest thing that has run on CNN in a long time."

If you lived in Honduras, you would come here, too. We are begging them to come here. No wonder immigration is out of control. They know that we are happy to give our country away as we are. Our lawmakers are allowing this to happen. They could close the loopholes that allow it in about an hour, but they haven't done that. They likely won't do it. They show no interest in the effects this invasion is having on normal Americans -- the suppressed wages, the stolen identities, the clogged emergency rooms and failing public schools, the fentanyl crisis. They don't care. The Chamber of Commerce tells us that everything is fine. Just yesterday, they attacked the White House for even suggesting we might have to shut down the border to protect the country. Guacamole prices might rise. Democrats, meanwhile, rejoice in the scale of this disaster. More illegal immigration means more power for them. They are actively for it.

He continues to show leadership and to raise the alarm bells. But only now are we starting to see a mainstream press not on this particular channel, but there is a crisis and that's what there is. So what we are doing is we have announced that we are sending more migrants back to Mexico to await their immigration proceedings. We are pulling folks from the ports of entry to help interdict those who are choosing to come here illegally. It is a crime, despite what you just showed, sitting senators saying it is a crime to come illegally between ports of entry. To stop them and to provide humanitarian assistance. By the smugglers, they are coming through remote areas. They are sicker than we have ever seen before."

We have to stop the drugs. We have to stop the smuggling and trafficking and gangs. He is very serious about it, so yes, I think everything is on the table.

    {
      "speaker": "NIELSEN",

We have a lot of, in my opinion, court decisions that do not understand the full situation, the operational realities that that we face every day. But it's also the criminals, and I think you saw that in the clip, too. The smugglers are more active than ever before in advertising how to come into this country with a child. We've broken up so called child recycling rings, if you can believe it in the last couple of months which is where smugglers kidnap a child, they give it to an adult to cross the border, present themselves as a family. Once they get in, because as you know, we can only hold families for 20 days. They send the child back and bring the child back with another family -- another fake family, another adult. So the criminals play a huge part of this. We are working to crackdown on all the transnational criminals, the gangs and smuggling and trafficking, but I cannot be clear and I don't think the President can be any clearer, he will take every action within his authority to stop this flow."

We've announced today that we're now treating this like a massive Cat 5 hurricane disaster. We are bringing all of the interagency together. We're asking everybody to chip in.

That's no small thing, and you heard all the caterwauling that all across town today when he said that. So yes, he's doing what he can. And he's never stopped talking about this issue. There really is a problem, though. As you pointed out, Tucker, the media only now are beginning to wake into the fact that when the President said there was a crisis on the border, an emergency at the border, that he was absolutely right. And the circumstances that you described, Tucker, of the confluence of the state of our laws and leaving them vulnerable -- our border vulnerable to people who show up claiming asylum, which didn't used to be the case. That wasn't the way it used to work. It used to be, you know, as you pointed out, single men sneaking across the border. Now, it's very different. And the combination of our laws and what the Courts and how the Courts have interpreted them have left us more or less defenseless against this surge of migrants across the border. And this -- it really is an issue that requires a change in the law, and the Democrats do not want to play along now. Now, they may be awakening to the fact that people are starting to get really upset about this, but they have two reasons. One is ideological, they really do believe many of them that we are this great land that should take care of the downtrodden people of the Earth. And make no mistake about it, Tucker, these people who come from those Central American countries are among the downtrodden people of the earth."

They believe that these are the kinds of people that you know, if they are the compassionate party that encourages them to be led into the country that they will end up voting Democrat. So for reasons, both ideological and political, they don't want to do much about this. Now, it may be getting so bad now that they'll have to. But so far, that's been the situation."

How could that be?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HUME",
      "utterance": "That's right, that's -- well, it could be for one thing, because you know, they melt away into the interior. And you know, we lose track of them. So we don't know how many are here, people get deported and sneak back in, we don't know how many have crossed the border that we didn't see or catch or didn't come through a port of entry. This current group, of course, is more likely to be able to be counted, because they're not trying to really sneak in, there just trying to get on American soil and give themselves up knowing that they can't be immediately deported. But there's also that -- which gets to the question about the administration that wanted to put on the census form, which is whether you're an American citizen or not."

And every bill that ever comes along, you know that's ever offered, you can't pass one. That every bill that's ever offered has that provision in it to make e-verify universal."

In fact, you know, the most hard headed policy of all, I don't know -- you could never enact it, it would be one where your likelihood of being able to stay would depend on how hard it was for you to get here. Like the Vietnamese people who crossed in those boats after the end of the Vietnam War and became tremendously successful in a generation that made an enormous contribution to this country. And it's not at all clear to me, Tucker that these people who are coming across from Mexico through Central America in that harrowing trip, who show the world what all they do to get here might not end up making excellent citizens, but under the current circumstances, you know, they just melt way into the interior and we lose track of them. And I'm not even sure their prospects are very good under the circumstances. I mean, they remain -- they're living in the shadows."

The \"Washington Post\" said he placed his hands on her shoulders, he was restraining her and then he moved in to -- and his face moved into her hair. It was an intimate action that you would normally reserve for a loved one, a spouse or someone you know and you love. And then after a while, he then slowly kissed the back of her head.

And so in this particular case, of course, we want to be able to have a demonstrative society. And this is not brain surgery, that if -- and it's not about even your own intention. It's that -- why would you -- if you would do something, if someone is recoiling, if you have to restrain them in order to be able to do it, if you're doing it from behind. If you are, of course -- this is what's fascinating with the Democratic Party. There are men who whether it's Harvey Weinstein, which is an issue, of course of rape, and certain issues of just sexual harassment, perhaps in this case with Mr. Biden, and other issues with Mr. Fairfax is that these are men who claim to be the champions for women, who claim to be the, you know, the facilitators like Joe Biden of the Violence Against Women Act. And yet that's the excuse that their defenders use. It's like, look at what they've done for us. And that has kept women from feeling comfortable talking about the nature of what's happened to them.

But that's not an SPLC's only problem right now. It calls itself an anti-hate organization. But in fact the SPLC strongly resembles a racket. They've amassed more than half a billion dollars by calling any enemy of the Democratic Party a racist or an anti-gay bigot or whatever works in an effort to purge them from society. For doing all of that, they get an indirect government support because they are a tax exempt entity. Senator Tom Cotton is a Republican that represents the state of Arkansas, he recently sent a letter to the IRS urging them to investigate the SPLC's tax exempt status. Senator Cotton joins us tonight. Senator, thanks very much for coming on.

They have the so called hate map and they use it to stigmatize their political opponents, you know, respectable center right organizations like the Family Research Council, their Alliance Defending Freedom. It's fine if you don't agree with those organizations.

Many owe hundreds of thousands, some never even received degrees, but they still owe them money. And thanks to an extensive lobbying campaign here in Washington, student loans are the only form of debt that cannot be erased by bankruptcy. Kids are stuck with it for life. Colleges love this deal. They're getting rich from it. There's no risk to them at all. A hundred American universities now have billion dollar endowments. They've doubled their administrative staffs.

So you're rich from it. It's Federally-backed. Students have to live with that debt for the rest of their lives until they pay it off, but you are not on the hook for it.

      "speaker": "GOOLSBEE",
      "utterance": "It's not that you can't co-sign the loan, it's that you would want to take the lowest financial risk if you're signing up financial aid. The University of Chicago does not make the loans, as you know, Tucker."
    },

    },
    {
      "speaker": "GOOLSBEE",
      "utterance": "Tucker, that's -- if you want to make the pay back of loans tied that you would get forgiveness of loans, for example, if you entered a public sector job, or if you took a job where your future income would not be high. I think that's a -- that is a valid point that we should look at."

      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "But why aren't you helping? You're asking taxpayers to help? And by the way, what about that? It's just -- I just have got to ask, I've always wondered this, as you walk out of the University of Chicago into a neighborhood where 40 percent of the people almost live below the poverty line. Do you ever think maybe we should let them eat in the cafeteria? Do they -- can people from the neighborhood eat in the cafeteria at Chicago?"

      "speaker": "CARLSON",

      "speaker": "GOOLSBEE",

    },

      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "I don't want to tax, I just want you to pay your fair share and stop lecturing America about how it is immoral while you get $8.2 billion sitting in a bank account and the neighborhood around you is in poverty."
    },

      "speaker": "GOOLSBEE",

    },

    },

      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Make college affordable, so tuition has risen much faster than inflation. It's $77,000.00 to go to Chicago."

      "speaker": "GOOLSBEE",
      "utterance": "Not at the University of Chicago, but yes."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "University of Chicago is $77,000.00, at least as of today. Why haven't you kept it down to $30,000.00? Since you've got $8.2 billion in your endowment?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GOOLSBEE",
      "utterance": "They have given literally billions of dollars of financial aid for people who have middle and low income so that they don't pay that list price. I don't think that people like you, for example, Tucker, who could afford to pay the full amount should have your children going with a subsidy from the other students. They should use the money from the endowment to pay for low and middle income students, not for --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "It's not just me, it's middle class people who get stuck with that number. You're ripping them off and you know that you are and I hope at least, there is some effort to make the problem that you created a little better, that's all I am asking."

    {
      "speaker": "GOOLSBEE",

      "speaker": "GOOLSBEE",
      "utterance": "That is on average in America."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "Forty percent of flight attendants have college degrees. The median wage is 50 grand a year, tell me that's a good deal for them. It's not. It's a rip off."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GOOLSBEE",
      "utterance": "So I -- you know what, Tucker, I agree with you. Let reinstate that gainful employment rules so that people who can't make back the money to pay off their student loans do not get ripped off by for profit education providers."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CARLSON",
      "utterance": "All right. I appreciate. Austan Goolsbee, we're out of time. I wish we had more time. I'll see you at the cafeteria at Chicago."

We'll be back tomorrow, 8:00 p.m. The show that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and groupthink on the one channel where anchors get to say what they really think, where there is no party line, where we are free, and we're grateful you're watching that channel. Good night from Washington. We have a special surprise for you tonight at 9 o'clock this evening, 18 seconds from now, from New York City, I want to introduce a man we're calling Sean Hannity.
