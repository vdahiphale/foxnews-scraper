I know. Ice, frozen water shaped like cubes. Obviously, we can have this fiend on the Supreme Court. If he treats ice like a weapon, what might he do with a snow cone?  Now, The Times admits the writer of this piece had once, on Twitter, deemed Kavanaugh a threat to society. The Times calls using this writer an error, mostly because they got caught once again.

This amnesia oddly only blocks out stuffs that doesn't fit their desires: Swetnick, Ford's inconsistencies, Feinstein's foul play, Rachel Mitchell's memo. This is what the media has done to America: The only accusations that matter are against conservatives. No burden of proof, no need for a witness. All you need is an accusation and that accuser then becomes the prosecutor. The left accuse then punish for the cause. Something we saw in the Soviet Union and Mao's China. Are we there yet? We aren't, but the press is. Tucker, welcome to the show, very exciting to have you here.",

This amnesia oddly only blocks out stuffs that doesn't fit their desires: Swetnick, Ford's inconsistencies, Feinstein's foul play, Rachel Mitchell's memo. This is what the media has done to America: The only accusations that matter are against conservatives. No burden of proof, no need for a witness. All you need is an accusation and that accuser then becomes the prosecutor. The left accuse then punish for the cause. Something we saw in the Soviet Union and Mao's China. Are we there yet?

These red states, you see Heidi Heitkamp down ten points against her Republican -- she's the Democrat incumbent, against her challenger, ten points. And then, if this turns out that Brett Kavanaugh is confirmed and the senate -- may be the Republicans pick up the cedar too, then the media will spend the next year again traveling around the country asking themselves, how did we miss this?  Once again."
