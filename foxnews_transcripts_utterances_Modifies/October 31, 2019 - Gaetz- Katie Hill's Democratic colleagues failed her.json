Meadows also will tell us about the latest testimony today which he believes is not what the Democrats were hoping it would be. We'll discuss that. And is Adam Schiff dressing as Ken Starr this Halloween? Starr is here to tell us what he thinks of that tonight on THE STORY. Plus, Tom Rogan on what he says is underneath all of this. What is the actual Ukraine policy of the Trump administration and is that what has some in the State Department and the NSC concerned? And Matt Gaetz on the resignation of Katie Hill and more. By the way, we did invite 30 Democrats, they're usually very welcome and come on this show all the time. But we invited 30 Democrats to talk about the impeachment decision today. They said no but they were apparently traveling tonight. That was the response we got for most of them. So, hopefully, they'll be on tomorrow night to talk about with us.

They were trying to have a different narrative, and you know why that is? Is because they know that this is a sham.  Actually, I had to come out of one of those hidden bunkers in the basement of the Capitol where we were having an impeachment inquiry to vote on an impeachment inquiry.

We have people who were on the call who was indicated that what the President's behavior was inappropriate.

President Trump has released this transcript. The American people can view it for what it is.

Something like that. Anyway, that's Katie Porter making an interesting scene today on the House. But our costume of the night award goes to this one -- this little beautiful girl, one of our youngest viewers in Vero Beach, Florida. Little Kinley (Ph) is a package of savory butter rolls and don't you love those squeezy rolls on the arms of hers? She has like extra dinner rolls all the way up and down her arm.

Republican Congressman Mark Meadows has been cut out of this process and he says that Democrats want him and Jim Jordan back in the shadows. Meadows also will tell us about the latest testimony today which he believes is not what the Democrats were hoping it would be. We'll discuss that. And is Adam Schiff dressing as Ken Starr this Halloween? Starr is here to tell us what he thinks of that tonight on THE STORY. Plus, Tom Rogan on what he says is underneath all of this. What is the actual Ukraine policy of the Trump administration and is that what has some in the State Department and the NSC concerned? And Matt Gaetz on the resignation of Katie Hill and more. By the way, we did invite 30 Democrats, they're usually very welcome and come on this show all the time. But we invited 30 Democrats to talk about the impeachment decision today. They said no but they were apparently traveling tonight. That was the response we got for most of them. So, hopefully, they'll be on tomorrow night to talk about with us.

You know, that's just all a mystery to me because on the House floor, just a few feet from where I am right now, earlier today, their whips were going, don't applaud, don't cheer when they get to 218. They were trying to have a different narrative, and you know why that is? Is because they know that this is a sham. Actually, I had to come out of one of those hidden bunkers in the basement of the Capitol where we were having an impeachment inquiry to vote on an impeachment inquiry. You know, this is -- this is all just really a partisan attack on the president of the United States that they've done not once, not twice, not three times, this is the fourth time, Martha."

Not only was there not leverage put forth, but we do know that this particular witness who was in the know, who was really there on the call -- listening to the call and in subsequent meetings, we know that indeed leverage was not provided in terms of the quid pro quo that everybody's talking about. But more importantly that the aid was released without the Ukrainian government doing anything. So, you can't have an impeachable offense if it wasn't a deliverable."

And I think when you do open up this process and you start having these opening hearings, you're going to get a lot more reaction from the rest of America who hasn't been privy to this so far."

However, we will -- we will start to have some public hearings. But her is the interesting thing, Martha when you talk about public opinion, the greatest public opinion happens in November, every four years when we talk about a president. We're 12 months away from our presidential election. Let's have the oversight, let's do proper oversight, but let's not try to take the vote -- a vote away from the American people."

Apparently, we have some new sound from Adam Schiff on CBS, talking about whether or not he thinks the rules have been unfair as you all have been saying. Watch this."

      "speaker": "MEADOWS",
      "utterance": "Well, I can tell you that yesterday, we were asking questions in a deposition -- excuse me, day before yesterday, asking questions in a deposition, and Adam Schiff shut us down. As we started to get more and more closer to evidence that actually would exonerate the president, he shut it all down. In fact, to the point where we've actually had to appeal the ruling of the chair, listen, he's the judge, the juror, the prosecutor, and really the person that is in control of all of this. He's the Ken Starr of this impeachment hearings, and yet, he's just a member of Congress. So, I would strongly disagree with his characterization that it's fair. In fact, it has been so unfair to the president of the United States, the American people of demand and should expect better."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Let me ask you this. You know, this discussion of what went on in there when people -- when Republicans wanted to cross-examine a little bit and ask their own questions. It's been reported that you got into a pretty heated argument with Congressman Swalwell over that. A, can you confirm that? And B, was the line of questioning that they were objecting to having to do with the whistleblower only or was it outside of that as well?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MEADOWS",
      "utterance": "Well, one there's two things. One, the Republicans don't know who the whistleblower is. And so, for us to say that we were asking about the whistleblower, we don't even know the identity of it. So that, that line of argument doesn't work. But I'd say the other thing is as we look at this, I can tell you that I know the rules very well, and so, many times I'll appeal the ruling of the chair. And on this particular occasion, Mr. Swalwell took issue with that. The last time I check, he's not president of the United States and he doesn't have a gavel in his hand. And so, I made the appeal to the proper person which was Adam Schiff in the room."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

      "speaker": "MEADOWS",

So, anything that's under his jurisdiction, he put off- limits and said, look at everything else. It's just not fair, right or even problem."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "All right. Well, now, we're going to get what -- you know, Republicans have said they wanted, which is a more open process, open hearings, and you know, that could start I guess as early as next week. So, we'll be following it. Thank you very much, Congressman Meadows. Always good to have you with us, sir."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "STARR",
      "utterance": "I think, there's a very strong argument. It's not going to happen but that it should happen. Again, the House has total power. You just can't stop the House from doing what it wants to do, whether it's fair, unfair, or whether -- and I think this is something that's a little bit lost in the conversation. The appearance of fairness, what we heard today in the back-and-forth is it's fair, it's unfair, but we need to hear but do the American people, when they see all this, is there the appearance of fairness and even-handedness, which is so -- these are very important and basic values. But his relationships specifically, Martha, with the whistleblower where there seems to be a conflict that he had no relationship, he being the chairman, Chairman Schiff, and then well, maybe he did. And perhaps that whistleblower came in a very disorderly way to the House of Representatives rather than going through the chain of command and going to the Inspector General. That's all very questionable. And if the Chairman was guiding the whistleblower, hey we can help you -- and I'm saying if -- we could have --"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "He says he never spoke with him, that he came to one of his staffers and that they informed him that he had to go to an attorney. I mean, that's what we know. There could be more there but that's what we know."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STARR",
      "utterance": "Well, that hasn't been tested, right? These things where you have allegations, and that's what cross-examination is for, and someone can say hey, the light was red and guess what, it wasn't red, you know, it was green. That's why you have cross-examination. And so yes, let's move to more public phase. But there's such a cruel irony today with the vote on let's open it up -- and there's going to be a real test is that truly going to happen, and at the same time here, are closed testimonies continuing? And so there's -- it's I think been a very disorderly process when they had the roadmap of Henry Hyde and Peter Rodino in the past impeachment hearings."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yes. I think people have a pretty good sort of smell test for these things. And I think you're right. I think the American people are going to look at this, and it's so incumbent upon those who are running this process to give people a sense that it is fair. And I think if they feel like it's not fair, it's not going to sit well with them. And I don't think that any sort of amount of haranguing on either side will be more powerful than people's own gut check on this when they actually start to watch this process. I'm going to be you know sort of watching the meter on that very closely. Dana Milbank at the Washington Post wrote an editorial. He was critical of you and that he says, is there anything Republicans won't say to make impeachment go away. Comes now to Ken Starr responsible more than any other person on earth for the impeachment of President Bill Clinton to tell us what a dreadful thing impeachment is. Do you think that you were more responsible than any person on earth for the impeachment of Bill Clinton?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "STARR",
      "utterance": "No. Bill Clinton was responsible for his committing perjury and obstruction of justice and the other offences. I report it. And the report that we gave was complete and accurate and it was fair. What Dana is doing is a very effective twist to say oh Ken Starr was this instrument of impeachment. I was duty-bound to send to the House. The House was the instrument of impeachment. I have said in my book, I think it would have been valuable for the House of Representatives to have had a conversation about was there something short of impeachment such as a resolution of censure."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",

    {
      "speaker": "STARR",
      "utterance": "Oh I think people can fault his judgment. Why would you raise Joe Biden in this call? I think that's an appropriate thing to talk about to have oversight over. But I don't think my view were nowhere close to treason, bribery, and other high crimes and misdemeanors."

      "utterance": "So speaking of whistleblowers, whistleblower protection is designed to make sure that a person who comes forward does not lose their job or suffer any consequences from their superiors in their work. It protects them from that, but does it protect them from the media. Brit Hume weighed in on this last night. We're going to go further with this question this evening."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "So who is the whistleblower? There are some reports out there that might sound convincing, but the fact is it so far we do not have any official confirmation of his or her name. Now, many Republicans say that the American people deserve to know who the whistleblower is. Their identity could shed light on his or her underlying motivations. Democrats have resisted that pressure so far arguing that lives could be at risk and releasing the name could scare off future whistleblowers. There's also the question of the law pertaining to this. Whistleblowers are protected from government retaliation which means they can't be demoted or fired. They also have a limited right to remain anonymous. Government officials cannot reveal their name. But when it comes to the media, as Britt Hume pointed out last night, all bets are pretty much off."

      "speaker": "BRIT HUME, CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "There's an internal government system designed to protect people inside the government from being retaliated against for reporting wrongdoing by their superiors or by others in their - - in their agencies. It is binding on people inside the government, it is certainly not binding on the news media."

    },
    {
      "speaker": "FOWLER",
      "utterance": "But he's right, we don't have to. If the media finds us out, they can report it. Hopefully, they won't because this person's life is in danger, right? Because he could be subject to threats against him or his family or she could be subject to threats against her or her family. And I think it speaks to largely -- a larger problem that we have is that what whistleblowers do each and every day is they protect against fraud, waste, and abuse. And they've saved the American taxpayers millions and millions and millions of dollars. And the fact that we're focusing on the whistleblower and actually not about the July 25th call is problematic to me because now we don't need the whistleblower complaint anymore. We have people who were on the call who was indicated that what the President's behavior was inappropriate. We have the president's own White House transcript that indicates his behavior was inappropriate. So I think this ideal of the whistleblower is once again attacking the process and actually attacking the facts of the July 25th call."

But look, more broadly, Richard is correct in one sense that there shouldn't be retaliation against whistleblowers. But we're talking about the impeachment of a President of the United States and he plays not just an important but a critical role in how this entire thing got started. What conversations did he have? What were his motivations? What communications, what meetings? When you are being accused of something as high as high crimes and misdemeanors, you have the right to face your accusers, due process.

But I don't know why the woke left wouldn't stand up for our colleague, our co-worker when the only person complaining, the only aggrieved party was Katie Hill's ex who is releasing information to try to ruin her life."

      "utterance": "Yes. I mean, Nancy Pelosi started to speak up on her behalf, you know, sort of when it was too late."

      "speaker": "GAETZ",
      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Do you think that Nancy Pelosi nudged Katie Hill out based on this? I mean, when you look, you know, there's a lot of other stories that, you know, have a similar ring to them and she was sort of cut out of the picture very quickly, do you think Nancy Pelosi encouraged her to leave?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GAETZ",
      "utterance": "I think that there is a dynamic on the left where they want to be able to weaponize the Me Too movement so badly against Republicans that they are willing to sacrifice people like Katie Hill or Al Franken on the altar of political correctness so that they can preserve the sharpest dagger for Republicans that they don't like. And I don't think these issues should be partisan in nature, I think that if someone is trying to destroy one of your co-workers that you should not weaponize the House ethics process against your co-worker, you should sympathize with the fact that the only reason that this information is in the public square is because someone is committing the crime of revenge porn. And I just think that Nancy Pelosi is she held those use should have said them sooner rather than later."

      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Yes. It's surprising in a few ways when you look back at this story. Switching gears here for a moment. Last night you mentioned rule 23 regarding Adam Schiff. You know, do you believe -- and now you've brought an ethics complaint against him, how does all that tie together?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GAETZ",
      "utterance": "Well, rule 23 of the House's says that a member cannot act in a way that brings discredit on the House and I can't think of anything more discrediting than Adam Schiff performing a fake transcript to try to get the American people's minds polluted about a conversation between Trump and Zelensky that never even happened. President Trump has released this transcript. The American people can view it for what it is. My view is that the president is innocent but all of this secrecy is intended to try to make people think that there is something worse than what is actually right before us in plain language."

    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "Are you think you're going to get anywhere with that ethics complaint?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GAETZ",
      "utterance": "I don't know, I wanted to raise the point on the eve of this vote that vested authority in Adam Schiff that has never been vested in the chairman of an intelligence committee. It should be the judiciary committee developing these facts. But because Nancy Pelosi has such little trust in Jerry Nadler and because Democrats lost to Republicans with Mueller's testimony, you see a perverted process to try to frontload an outcome that isn't supported by the evidence."

    {
      "speaker": "MACCALLUM",
      "utterance": "All right. Congressman Matt Gaetz, always good to have you here. Thank you very much."

      "utterance": "So, before we go tonight first up on the Halloween theme, Democratic Congresswoman Katie Porter, that's her today, from California, she graces the halls of Congress today, she was decked out as bat woman. She wants to make it very clear as someone said you're just as batman. She said, no, no, this is absolutely bat woman. That takes courage to dress up like that for work on Capitol Hill. I don't know. Something like that. Anyway, that's Katie Porter making an interesting scene today on the House. But our costume of the night award goes to this one -- this little beautiful girl, one of our youngest viewers in Vero Beach, Florida. Little Kinley (Ph) is a package of savory butter rolls and don't you love those squeezy rolls on the arms of hers? She has like extra dinner rolls all the way up and down her arm. And we love Kinley (Ph). So happy Halloween to her. That is “The Story” of Thursday, October 31st. We will see you back here tomorrow night.
