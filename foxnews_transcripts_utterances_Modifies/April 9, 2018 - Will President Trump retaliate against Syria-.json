But this doesn't make sense to me for two reasons. Number one, Syria can't hide from retribution. So, clearly, if they're responsible, they will be bombed. It's not like they can run to the mountains. We're going to get you. We're going to bomb your airports. You Airforce will be gone. Number two, if you want America to leave, why would you do this? Maybe I'm not that bright, but why would you do this? But, anyway, aside from that, we're still going to retaliate. The reason why we're going to retaliate is because Assad is like O.J Simpson. O.J. didn't get found guilty of his real crimes of killing Nicole and Ron, right? He was found guilty of a later charge for armed robbery and kidnapping.

That's Obama's national Security Council spokesman, Tommy Vietor, who actually just said that himself the other day. And here's why. When Obama was president, there was a big leadership vacuum in the region, and Russian came in to fill it. Now, remember at the beginning of the civil war, the Obama administration spent a half a billion dollars to train five Syrian rebel fighters. So, it was a waste from the jump.  And then you have this incredible gas attack where Obama drew a redline, didn't respond. And Putin had to swoop in and then help President Obama save face, and organized this group to rid Syria of these chemical weapons. And people like John Kerry and Susan Rice bragged about bringing all the chemical weapons out of there. President Obama himself said it was the crowning achievement of his foreign policy legacy. That's obviously in tatters now. And it didn't help, you know, sending, I think, almost $2 billion in cash to the Iranians. So, right now, you have a proxy war, and it's probably just tribal. It brings in the great powers, America and Russia, but you have the Saudis and the Iranians too going at it because there's a major natural gas pipeline which, obviously, I don't understand, but they're trying to reroute it to the European Union.

This time it was his remarks in Ohio last week saying that it's time to get out of Syria, and now they act again. So, it looks like whenever there's a sign from the U.S. government that maybe we're not paying full attention, Assad then sees that as a signal for him to take action. He can do what he wants to do. And, to me, this is very troubling because it opens the door not only to Russia and Iran, but to also Islamic state coming back into the picture. If not Islamic state, than al-Qaeda.

And I am told that the FBI took pretty much everything that they could find that was in the form of paper or electronic communications. Now, we don't know exactly what this has to do with, though in the course of seizing all the documents, it could have just been because they were there as part of it, not necessarily what they were looking for, were documents related to the $130,000 payment that Michael Cohen made in October 2016 to Stephanie Clifford, AKA, Stormy Daniels, as part of her agreeing to the confidentiality agreement that she has been fighting with her attorney, Michael Avenatti, to get out of for some time. We've got a statement from Stephen Ryan, who is Michael Cohen's attorney. The attorney representing the attorney, if you will, who said the U.S. attorney's office for the southern district of New York executed a series of search warrants and seized the privileged communications between my client, Michael Cohen, and his clients. Ryan was advised that, by federal prosecutors, that the New York action was in part due to a referral from the Special Counsel Robert Mueller. So, that's where we now have the tie between what's going on here in Washington and what happened there in New York.  Cohen's attorney, Ryan, goes on to complain about the seizure of privileged documents saying it was completely inappropriate and unnecessary. It resulted in the unnecessary seizure of protected attorney-client communications between a lawyer and his clients. Ryan going on to say there was no reason for them to do this because Cohen provided thousands of non-privileged documents to congress and also separate depositions under oath. Stormy Daniels' attorney couldn't wait to show his glee at this latest development because he and Michael Cohen have been in a cage match over Stormy Daniels trying to get out of her nondisclosure agreement. Michael Avenatti in a statement to Fox News saying, as I predicted last week, CNN and MSNBC, Mr. Cohen has been placed in the cross hairs by Mr. Trump, he's been set up to take the fall. An enormous amount of misplaced faith has been placed on his shoulders. And I do not believe he has the metal to withstand it. If I'm correct, this could end very, very badly for Mr. Trump and others. Again, we do not know the substance of what the FBI was looking for. Only that it came in part from a referral from the special counsel's office and, of course, Robert Mueller has been looking into Russia collusion. He's also been looking into the financial dealings of Paul Manafort and Rick Gates. He's got Michael Flynn on making false statements. He's got George Papadopoulos on making false statements. It would seem logical to assume, Jesse, that somewhere in the course of his investigation, Robert Mueller came upon some information that he thought that the U.S. attorney's office for the southern district of New York would want to know about. The U.S. attorney's office found it was compelling enough that they sent the FBI to Michael Cohen's office, home, and hotel room to pick it all up.",

Now, Loretta Lynch said she wants to see what Comey had to say about why he came out of the last moment and have that long press conference in which he said they were not going to go ahead and file charges against Hillary Clinton. But, here's all the horrible things and the carelessness that she displayed in the use of the private email server. And she says she didn't understand it. It was a surprising way for the attorney general to be told by the FBI director of his decision. And so, I think that she said let's look for the book. Let's see how he explains it.

And they're very smart people, far smarter than me on this, who believe Syria is behind this. Tom Rogan wrote a piece today at the Washington Examiner. And I think Senator McCain. But this doesn't make sense to me for two reasons. Number one, Syria can't hide from retribution. So, clearly, if they're responsible, they will be bombed. It's not like they can run to the mountains. We're going to get you. We're going to bomb your airports. You Airforce will be gone. Number two, if you want America to leave, why would you do this? Maybe I'm not that bright, but why would you do this? But, anyway, aside from that, we're still going to retaliate. The reason why we're going to retaliate is because Assad is like O.J Simpson. O.J. didn't get found guilty of his real crimes of killing Nicole and Ron, right? He was found guilty of a later charge for armed robbery and kidnapping. The fact is, Assad has done enough bad stuff that if he didn't do this, so what?"

And I don't believe that he would do this without Russia's knowledge beforehand. They're the sponsor and they're the puppet master. But Trump was handed a mess in Syria. And that's not my comment. That's Obama's national Security Council spokesman, Tommy Vietor, who actually just said that himself the other day. And here's why. When Obama was president, there was a big leadership vacuum in the region, and Russian came in to fill it. Now, remember at the beginning of the civil war, the Obama administration spent a half a billion dollars to train five Syrian rebel fighters. So, it was a waste from the jump. And then you have this incredible gas attack where Obama drew a redline, didn't respond. And Putin had to swoop in and then help President Obama save face, and organized this group to rid Syria of these chemical weapons. And people like John Kerry and Susan Rice bragged about bringing all the chemical weapons out of there. President Obama himself said it was the crowning achievement of his foreign policy legacy. That's obviously in tatters now. And it didn't help, you know, sending, I think, almost $2 billion in cash to the Iranians. So, right now, you have a proxy war, and it's probably just tribal. It brings in the great powers, America and Russia, but you have the Saudis and the Iranians too going at it because there's a major natural gas pipeline which, obviously, I don't understand, but they're trying to reroute it to the European Union.

And Syria allows the Iranian navy access to the Mediterranean. So, it looks like our side has ascended, the Saudis, the Israelis, and our rebels. And they're getting desperate. And I think Putin is probably hurting from the sanctions, and his oligarch friends are hurting from the sanctions, and energy prices are low, and they're just trying to test our resolve. I believe you can see President Trump seething when he's crossing his arms like that. The last time he crossed his arms like that was the fire and fury comment. So, I think they're going to pay, like he said, a very steep price."

      "utterance": "Juan, every major players is there, the United States and our western allies, Russian, Iran, perhaps North Korea, because we know that North Korea had been helping Syria before with nuclear material and possibly chemical weapons now, but also Israel. And when the attack started happening in Syria last night, the United States quickly said it's not us. And everybody else saying it's not us. Nobody will actually say that it's Israel. But what I notice is that Saudi not complaining that Israel took action."

      "speaker": "WILLIAMS",
      "utterance": "And so, in a sense, Israel acting in a way that would help the United States and allow President Trump more time to decide exactly what is the appropriate action. I think it's very telling though that, you know, it was a year ago that he said Assad was not a priority for him, and that's when Assad did the chemical weapons attack then. This time it was his remarks in Ohio last week saying that it's time to get out of Syria, and now they act again. So, it looks like whenever there's a sign from the U.S. government that maybe we're not paying full attention, Assad then sees that as a signal for him to take action. He can do what he wants to do. And, to me, this is very troubling because it opens the door not only to Russia and Iran, but to also Islamic state coming back into the picture. If not Islamic state, than al-Qaeda. And don't forget the Taliban is right next door."

Really, this guy is just disgusting and outrageous, a lack of any kind of morality or humanity to murder children in this way. Obviously, Israel stepped up to the plate. Like we've said, they have the backing, you know, of the United States. I think that's a significant strategic partnership that really has -- going to be able to change the course of history in that region, which is so fraught with so many problems in terms of just the geo-complexities of that region, politically and otherwise. But, right now, this is going to say a lot, I think, also about, you know, President Trump, his presidency, his handle on foreign affairs and national security. He's shown the strength before and has worked. And I think he's going to respond rather quickly in regards to this."

And you can't --he says to Trump, you can't talk and act to a legitimately elected president in this way.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS",
      "utterance": "Jesse, good afternoon to you. We know now that the FBI raided not only Michael Cohen's business office but also raided his apartment and a hotel room in which he has been staying. And I am told that the FBI took pretty much everything that they could find that was in the form of paper or electronic communications. Now, we don't know exactly what this has to do with, though in the course of seizing all the documents, it could have just been because they were there as part of it, not necessarily what they were looking for, were documents related to the $130,000 payment that Michael Cohen made in October 2016 to Stephanie Clifford, AKA, Stormy Daniels, as part of her agreeing to the confidentiality agreement that she has been fighting with her attorney, Michael Avenatti, to get out of for some time. We've got a statement from Stephen Ryan, who is Michael Cohen's attorney. The attorney representing the attorney, if you will, who said the U.S. attorney's office for the southern district of New York executed a series of search warrants and seized the privileged communications between my client, Michael Cohen, and his clients. Ryan was advised that, by federal prosecutors, that the New York action was in part due to a referral from the Special Counsel Robert Mueller. So, that's where we now have the tie between what's going on here in Washington and what happened there in New York. Cohen's attorney, Ryan, goes on to complain about the seizure of privileged documents saying it was completely inappropriate and unnecessary. It resulted in the unnecessary seizure of protected attorney-client communications between a lawyer and his clients. Ryan going on to say there was no reason for them to do this because Cohen provided thousands of non-privileged documents to congress and also separate depositions under oath. Stormy Daniels' attorney couldn't wait to show his glee at this latest development because he and Michael Cohen have been in a cage match over Stormy Daniels trying to get out of her nondisclosure agreement. Michael Avenatti in a statement to Fox News saying, as I predicted last week, CNN and MSNBC, Mr. Cohen has been placed in the cross hairs by Mr. Trump, he's been set up to take the fall. An enormous amount of misplaced faith has been placed on his shoulders. And I do not believe he has the metal to withstand it. If I'm correct, this could end very, very badly for Mr. Trump and others. Again, we do not know the substance of what the FBI was looking for. Only that it came in part from a referral from the special counsel's office and, of course, Robert Mueller has been looking into Russia collusion. He's also been looking into the financial dealings of Paul Manafort and Rick Gates. He's got Michael Flynn on making false statements. He's got George Papadopoulos on making false statements. It would seem logical to assume, Jesse, that somewhere in the course of his investigation, Robert Mueller came upon some information that he thought that the U.S. attorney's office for the southern district of New York would want to know about. The U.S. attorney's office found it was compelling enough that they sent the FBI to Michael Cohen's office, home, and hotel room to pick it all up."

It's going to be a big deal for the rest of the month. And I'm just curious. Now, Loretta Lynch said she wants to see what Comey had to say about why he came out of the last moment and have that long press conference in which he said they were not going to go ahead and file charges against Hillary Clinton. But, here's all the horrible things and the carelessness that she displayed in the use of the private email server. And she says she didn't understand it. It was a surprising way for the attorney general to be told by the FBI director of his decision. And so, I think that she said let's look for the book. Let's see how he explains it. It will be very interesting."

Anthony Borges was released from the hospital, a teen no one had heard from until now. He saved upwards of 20 students.

He was abusive. Still, none took action. The statement also mentions the PROMISE Program which allows young criminals to avoid arrest. So, the question is, will this messenger receive the same platform and spotlight that others received? It's a sad reality in the world of cable news: We have to move on, other tragedies await. But, Anthony cannot move on, which is why we should press pause and listen to what he's trying to tell us. He cannot move on. The fact that Scott Israel can is a disgrace."

When you have authorities been called 30 different times to Cruz's house and nobody does anything. Like, what else do you want someone to do in terms of getting involved and trying to do something to prevent future harm and violence and massacre? And if you don't learn from this situation, and you just focus just on guns, you're missing the point.

I thought last week, in the shooting at YouTube, you know, easy access to guns. But from his perspective, even if we never settled the gun argument in the country, kids should be able to feel safe in school. And he makes a strong, compelling point. By the way, the sheriff went to visit him at the hospital. So when you hear this from him, don't think this guy is just upset the president -- the sheriff hasn't paid attention.

You know, with all the stuff going on in his community, he's out there hobnobbing with politicians and, you know, raising money and politicking. He just has a lot of misplaced priorities. Like the Promise Program, got to get rid of it. Ideally, so you don't want to arrest a lot of a young black teenagers in high school. That's why the Obama administration came in and pushed it hard. Because it hurts their ability to get into college and things like that. I get that. But it can't be blanket. I mean, this guy, like you said in the monologue, was abusing students in school, was suspended, was violent. This is a guy that had to have been arrested, because that would have triggered the inability to him purchasing a firearm. And then, you know, for -- for CNN to shine a spotlight away from Israel and then towards the NRA, does such a disservice to the country. And they should be shining a spotlight on things like what Marco Rubio is doing. And you and I have talked about it. The -- I think it's something like the gun purchase restraining order. So you're balancing the ability to have the Second Amendment with, at the same time, protecting public safety.

Get those rocks out of your pocket. David and Goliath, you keep throwing these rocks. We're going to take the rocks away from you, young man.\" The reality is, and the thing that really struck me here, was that there are more murders in London then New York City so far in 2018. And that's why the mayor is acting. And by the way, you guys are wrong on stop and search. He, the mayor, is in fact, proposing that the police stop and search people for these knives."

No, Mueller, you can't come in, and whoever lets him in, they're going to be fired.\" I mean, I think the whole thing is just ridiculous. So we already knew that they were biased against him.

And I also think that, you know, you can spend the hour that you have to give on television anyway that you want. I do think that the Democrats have ceded so much policy ground and in talking so much about Russia that they have got to figure out a way to pivot. They're in a perfect position this year, just because the way that the politics are and the math is, that they could actually win back the House. But if they don't start talking about Democratic policies of why it would be better to vote for the Democrat than the Republican in this midterm, they're just wasting their time."
