Now, most of you I'm sure were unable to watch this play out in full, so, we're going to play large portions of it tonight in case you missed it. Now, the President Trump started off the discussion saying border security has to come first in any deal. Yes, and we want the wall.  Take a look.",

      "sentences": "We are here today to advance bipartisan immigration reform that serves the needs of the American families, workers, and taxpayers. It's DACA. We've been talking about DACA for a long time. I've been hearing about it for years, long before I decided to go into this particular line of work. And maybe we can do something. We have a lot of good people in this room. A lot of people that have a great spirit for taking care of the people we represent -- we all represent. For that reason, any legislation on DACA, we feel -- at least a strong part of this group feels -- has to accomplish three vital goals.   And Chairman Goodlatte will be submitting a bill over the next two to three days that will cover many of the things. And, obviously, that will -- if it gets passed, it will go to the Senate and they can negotiate and we'll see how it turns out. But I feel having the Democrats in with us is absolutely vital because it should be a bipartisan bill. It should be a bill of love. Truly, it should be a bill of love, and we can do that. But it also has to be a bill where we're able to secure our border. Drugs are pouring into our country at a record pace and a lot of people are coming in that we can't have. We've greatly stiffened, as you know, and fewer people are trying to come in. But we have tremendous numbers of people and drugs pouring into our country.  So, in order to secure it, we need a wall. We need closing enforcement -- we have to close enforcement loopholes, give immigration officers -- and these are tremendous people, the border security agents, the ICE agents -- we have to give them the equipment they need, we have to close loopholes, and this really does include a very strong amount of different things for border security.   I think everybody in the room would agree to that. I think that we -- it's a question of the amounts. But I think everyone agrees we have to have border security. I don't think there would be anybody that says \"no\". Second, it has to be a bill to end chain migration. Chain migration is bringing in many, many people with one, and often it doesn't work out very well. Those many people are not doing us right. And I think a lot of people in the room -- and I'm not sure I can speak for everybody, but a lot of the people in this room want to see chain migration ended.  And we have a recent case along the West Side Highway, having to do with chain migration, where a man ran over -- killed eight people and many people injured badly. Loss of arms, loss of legs. Horrible thing happened, and then you look at the chain and all of the people that came in because of him. Terrible situation. And the other is: cancel the lottery program. They call it \"visa lottery,\" I just call it \"lottery\". But countries come in and they put names in a hopper. They're not giving you their best names; common sense means they're not giving you their best names. They're giving you people that they don't want.",

No, he was very engaged. He was totally in charge. And being transparent, extremely patient and common sense solutions were being offered. He was giving you, the American people, a rare glimpse into an historic process on the important issue of immigration reform. And just a few hours ago, all the president tweeted: As I made very clear today, our country needs the security of the wall on the southern border, which must be a part of any DACA approval.  The president obviously now refusing to back down on building the border wall. I have been saying this months and years in order for the GOP to be successful, you guys want to win the midterm elections? Build 200 or 300 miles of the border wall. Go down there and cut your commercials. Promise made, promise kept. Voters happy.   The American people need to see tangible results and progress being made on this key promise is key for November. This has to be: fund the wall, build the wall first, because it's always like oh, you get the tax increase, you never get the spending cuts they promise. You always get the consideration, the amnesty, whatever it happens to be, the wall never gets built. We have been down this road. We have seen this rodeo before. You, Republicans, you want to win in November? You’re up for election, not Donald Trump. Put the American people, put their security first and show them that by November, you're keeping your promises. Just smart, good for the country, good politics.  After the president's remarks, Democrats they quickly moved to their debate. All they care is amnesty, DACA, annual necessity and DACA. Take a look.",

And you indicated this would be a first step and then we continue to talk as we are talking today about how we best secure the border. There are differences of opinion within your party and within our party.   So, I would urge that we move forward on protecting the DACA protected individuals. Young people. Young adults as you pointed out in one of your statements who are productive parts of our community. That we protect them and get that done and then, because I think everybody around the table as you pointed out is for security, and then the issue is going to be, how do we best affect that border security? So, I would urge us to move as Senator Durbin has just moved on the DACA students. As a matter of fact, the speaker, I think today but maybe yesterday said we need to solve the DACA issue and we need to solve it in a way that is permanent not temporary.

I think everybody has a point here.  The one thing I don't want to have happen here is what I saw in the past. There were former bills that were passed on border security years ago that never got finished. There are immigration bills passed that were right back on the table with the same problem.  Let's make a commitment to each one and most importantly to the American people, that when we get done and come to an agreement, that we're not back at this problem three, four years from now. That's why yes, we have got to do DACA and I agree with you 100 percent. But if we do not do something with the security, if we do not do something with the chain migration, we are fooling each other that we solved a problem.  You know how difficult this issue is. So, let's collectively, we're here at the table together. I will be the first one to tell you we are all going to have to give a little and I will be the first one willing to.

I guess now that it's politically expedient for the Democratic Party in now opposing the policies they were passionately supporting en masse. Now, FoxNews.com has a great article up today showcasing the Democrats' blatant hypocrisy on immigration. Here's the headline: Dems change tune on border wall after backing barrier oh under Obama. And the reporting points out that five years ago under Barack Obama, the entire Democratic Caucus voted to build 700 miles of fencing along the southern border. It's the same area that President Trump's border wall would cover. They didn't get the job done and it doesn't end there. The bills Democrats supported which was called the Economic Opportunity and Immigration Modernization Act also included $40 billion over a decade to strengthen border security measures and also call the doubling the number - - called for doubling the number of border agents to be hired. It would have been a good idea. Here's what this tells us: Democratic Party and their opposition to what President Trump is asking for is nothing but a total farce. It's about playing politics, identity politics. It has nothing to do with the facts and reality about what is going on at the border. Look, I have personally been reporting from the border at least a dozen times. Horseback, all-terrain vehicle, I have been out there on helicopters, boats, I have done it all. All of it.  I have seen gang members being arrested. A warehouse, the biggest one you have ever seen, floor to ceiling drugs that were confiscated. I have been in a drug smuggling tunnel and much more. The problems down there are real. Human trafficking, drug trafficking, Democrats don't want to address these issues because they would rather try and now score cheap political points. All right. When we come back, we will continue our discussion. Kellyanne Conway is here. She will respond to all of this in a busy news-breaking night on \"Hannity.\"",

A question that maybe leaking out this information in the so-called Trump dossier that unverified information about the president may have led to someone being killed, an intelligence asset who was revealed because of this information that was published. In fact, in the last few moments, the president's personal attorney Michael Cohen has filed two lawsuits involving the dossier over defamation. One for BuzzFeed, which published some of this, the other being actually Fusion GPS, the company that put together the dossier and Glenn Simpson personally the former journalist involved in Fusion GPS. More on that in a minute. As you mentioned, the FBI tonight also facing more scrutiny over anti-Trump text messages on the eve of the 2016 election, specifically what lawmakers on the Hill are looking at back and forth messages between FBI officials, Peter Strzok and Lisa Page. These were particularly messages about a Wall Street Journal story apparently focused on The Clinton Foundation which of course is now the focus of a renewed FBI probe into whether the original review of the foundation was too soft. These texts showing the duo suggesting they knew in advance about the story and then we're going to share it with FBI colleagues and pretend they knew nothing about it, raising questions about whether they leaked sensitive information or whether they and other FBI officials actually leaked classified information. A question that the house intel chairman Devon Nunes will get a chance to ask Strzok and Page since we have also learned that those two FBI officials will be among eight witnesses brought before the house intelligence panel in the next few weeks to get answers about Fusion GPS and alleged wrongdoing among FBI and Justice Department officials. Another key witness is going to be Obama justice department holdover Bruce Ohr. He was just stripped of another title at the Justice Department. Remember, his wife actually worked for Fusion GPS and was a so-called Russia expert. That company's co-founder, Glenn Simpson, under the microscope after, yes, you mentioned Dianne Feinstein released his transcript of his private testimony to a senate committee last summer. She says, Dianne Feinstein, she released the more than 300 pages to set the record straight. But allies of the president say there is no evidence of collusion for the Trump campaign and this transcript actually raises new questions about Fusion's collusion with the Hillary Clinton campaign. The transcript shows Simpson declined to answer several questions about how Fusion was paid. Since then of course, we have learned from Republicans getting bank records that Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign and the DNC paid for this information through Democratic attorney Marc Elias. Now, when Simpson was pressed on whether Fusion GPS was a Democratic-linked firm. He responded that he did not think so despite that money passing hands. As I mentioned at the top, breaking this hour though, about this dossier, the personal attorney for the president, Michael Cohen, longtime ally of the president just filed two suits. In New York State, he has filed a suit against \"Buzz Feed\" for publishing some of the dossier. \"Buzz Feed\" has just put out a statement tonight saying that, quote, the interest to the public is obvious in that dossier and that's why they published it and they will aggressively defend their first amendment rights. And then meanwhile, that's in state court in New York. A federal lawsuit just filed by Michael Cohen, the personal attorney for the president as well, against Glen Simpson and Fusion GPS, this firm that put together the dossier with that former British spy, Christopher Steele. So this is just breaking in the last few moments, Sean, and it shows that the Trump camp is really fighting back here over all of this, Sean.",

After years of broken promises, not getting the job done from members of Congress, it's about time, build the wall.

      "utterance": "We are here today to advance bipartisan immigration reform that serves the needs of the American families, workers, and taxpayers. It's DACA. We've been talking about DACA for a long time. I've been hearing about it for years, long before I decided to go into this particular line of work. And maybe we can do something. We have a lot of good people in this room. A lot of people that have a great spirit for taking care of the people we represent -- we all represent. For that reason, any legislation on DACA, we feel -- at least a strong part of this group feels -- has to accomplish three vital goals. And Chairman Goodlatte will be submitting a bill over the next two to three days that will cover many of the things. And, obviously, that will -- if it gets passed, it will go to the Senate and they can negotiate and we'll see how it turns out. But I feel having the Democrats in with us is absolutely vital because it should be a bipartisan bill. It should be a bill of love. Truly, it should be a bill of love, and we can do that. But it also has to be a bill where we're able to secure our border. Drugs are pouring into our country at a record pace and a lot of people are coming in that we can't have. We've greatly stiffened, as you know, and fewer people are trying to come in. But we have tremendous numbers of people and drugs pouring into our country. So, in order to secure it, we need a wall. We need closing enforcement -- we have to close enforcement loopholes, give immigration officers -- and these are tremendous people, the border security agents, the ICE agents -- we have to give them the equipment they need, we have to close loopholes, and this really does include a very strong amount of different things for border security. I think everybody in the room would agree to that. I think that we -- it's a question of the amounts. But I think everyone agrees we have to have border security. I don't think there would be anybody that says \"no\". Second, it has to be a bill to end chain migration. Chain migration is bringing in many, many people with one, and often it doesn't work out very well. Those many people are not doing us right. And I think a lot of people in the room -- and I'm not sure I can speak for everybody, but a lot of the people in this room want to see chain migration ended. And we have a recent case along the West Side Highway, having to do with chain migration, where a man ran over -- killed eight people and many people injured badly. Loss of arms, loss of legs. Horrible thing happened, and then you look at the chain and all of the people that came in because of him. Terrible situation."

You, Republicans, you want to win in November? You’re up for election, not Donald Trump. Put the American people, put their security first and show them that by November, you're keeping your promises. Just smart, good for the country, good politics.

There are obviously differences, however, Mr. President, on how you affect that you just indicated that yourself. And you indicated this would be a first step and then we continue to talk as we are talking today about how we best secure the border. There are differences of opinion within your party and within our party. So, I would urge that we move forward on protecting the DACA protected individuals. Young people. Young adults as you pointed out in one of your statements who are productive parts of our community. That we protect them and get that done and then, because I think everybody around the table as you pointed out is for security, and then the issue is going to be, how do we best affect that border security? So, I would urge us to move as Senator Durbin has just moved on the DACA students. As a matter of fact, the speaker, I think today but maybe yesterday said we need to solve the DACA issue and we need to solve it in a way that is permanent not temporary.

I think everybody has a point here. The one thing I don't want to have happen here is what I saw in the past. There were former bills that were passed on border security years ago that never got finished. There are immigration bills passed that were right back on the table with the same problem. Let's make a commitment to each one and most importantly to the American people, that when we get done and come to an agreement, that we're not back at this problem three, four years from now. That's why yes, we have got to do DACA and I agree with you 100 percent. But if we do not do something with the security, if we do not do something with the chain migration, we are fooling each other that we solved a problem. You know how difficult this issue is. So, let's collectively, we're here at the table together. I will be the first one to tell you we are all going to have to give a little and I will be the first one willing to. But let's solve the problem. But let's not tell the American public at the end that it is solved when it's not."

Secondly, the security. This president knows his first obligation is to keep us safe and secure in this country. Do that with the wall. The wall, the southern border is 2,000 miles, about 800 or so might be the physical wall. There are mountainous and river areas where you can't put a physical structure but you can put fencing. You can have technology. You can put more agents there. It makes us more safe and secure. People are already not crossing as much as they did illegally because this man is president, because they know walls are being built. Because they know folks are tougher. We don't want the poisonous drugs coming over our border. We don't want people coming in train migration and visa lottery. And finally, the prosperity. Economic security and national security go hand in hand. And you see what's happening with this president. His leadership, his bold actions along with that of the Republicans in Congress, that massive tax cut for the middle class. They are making this country more prosperous. Consumer confidence, unemployment levels down for African-Americans for teens, for Hispanics, for women, for all of America, all of the confidence measures up. National security, economic security go hand in hand. The wall is not negotiable. The Democrats came there today basically saying DACA is not negotiable. Give us a clean DACA bill, the president said no. DACA considered the wall. Also an end to chain migration which accounts for 9.3 million resettled in the population a year. One person comes here and you get about seven family members. Some countries send upwards of 20 family members. It has to stop."

Wow, she should have said that in 2015. She might have made some of the states more competitive although. Anyway, we would have won anyway, but the fact is that what's changed is number one, they have a president who is willing to actually do it.

      "utterance": "Yes. A question that maybe leaking out this information in the so-called Trump dossier that unverified information about the president may have led to someone being killed, an intelligence asset who was revealed because of this information that was published. In fact, in the last few moments, the president's personal attorney Michael Cohen has filed two lawsuits involving the dossier over defamation. One for BuzzFeed, which published some of this, the other being actually Fusion GPS, the company that put together the dossier and Glenn Simpson personally the former journalist involved in Fusion GPS. More on that in a minute. As you mentioned, the FBI tonight also facing more scrutiny over anti-Trump text messages on the eve of the 2016 election, specifically what lawmakers on the Hill are looking at back and forth messages between FBI officials, Peter Strzok and Lisa Page. These were particularly messages about a Wall Street Journal story apparently focused on The Clinton Foundation which of course is now the focus of a renewed FBI probe into whether the original review of the foundation was too soft. These texts showing the duo suggesting they knew in advance about the story and then we're going to share it with FBI colleagues and pretend they knew nothing about it, raising questions about whether they leaked sensitive information or whether they and other FBI officials actually leaked classified information. A question that the house intel chairman Devon Nunes will get a chance to ask Strzok and Page since we have also learned that those two FBI officials will be among eight witnesses brought before the house intelligence panel in the next few weeks to get answers about Fusion GPS and alleged wrongdoing among FBI and Justice Department officials. Another key witness is going to be Obama justice department holdover Bruce Ohr. He was just stripped of another title at the Justice Department. Remember, his wife actually worked for Fusion GPS and was a so-called Russia expert. That company's co-founder, Glenn Simpson, under the microscope after, yes, you mentioned Dianne Feinstein released his transcript of his private testimony to a senate committee last summer. She says, Dianne Feinstein, she released the more than 300 pages to set the record straight. But allies of the president say there is no evidence of collusion for the Trump campaign and this transcript actually raises new questions about Fusion's collusion with the Hillary Clinton campaign. The transcript shows Simpson declined to answer several questions about how Fusion was paid. Since then of course, we have learned from Republicans getting bank records that Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign and the DNC paid for this information through Democratic attorney Marc Elias. Now, when Simpson was pressed on whether Fusion GPS was a Democratic-linked firm. He responded that he did not think so despite that money passing hands. As I mentioned at the top, breaking this hour though, about this dossier, the personal attorney for the president, Michael Cohen, longtime ally of the president just filed two suits. In New York State, he has filed a suit against \"Buzz Feed\" for publishing some of the dossier. \"Buzz Feed\" has just put out a statement tonight saying that, quote, the interest to the public is obvious in that dossier and that's why they published it and they will aggressively defend their first amendment rights. And then meanwhile, that's in state court in New York. A federal lawsuit just filed by Michael Cohen, the personal attorney for the president as well, against Glen Simpson and Fusion GPS, this firm that put together the dossier with that former British spy, Christopher Steele. So this is just breaking in the last few moments, Sean, and it shows that the Trump camp is really fighting back here over all of this, Sean."

Look, I went through all 311 pages of Glenn Simpson's testimony. It's pretty clear this is a guy who trades in rumor, innuendos, suggestions, wild speculations. I think he has read to many Robert Ludlum and Tom Clancy novels. Basically the entire 311 pages is trash because this guy doesn't know anything. The dossier, he is asked as to every specific aspect of the dossier. Did you verify this? Did you verify that? And the answer is no."

When we reported, Sarah, right here on this program that Hillary Clinton and the Fox News Channel reported that five foreign intelligence agencies, 99 percent likelihood that they got all of those 33,000 emails and then some and classified and top secret and special access programs. If James Comey is drafting that in fact, remember the draft, the exoneration before the investigation."

So, that could certainly be true. There could certainly be in people or assets or areas that are compromised now because of those potential access to her server. And even with the dossier right now. I know that people are looking into this. We don't know. We don't know. Look, there were a lot of bad players in Russia. A lot of bad players out there. So people could be killed for many reasons when things like this happen so, but we don't even know what we are hearing here is factual."

We have already seen and he hasn't been in office for a full year and look at what he has done. So, I would love to know if Oprah is who we have to run against in 2020. She is an incredible woman. I think she has many, many accomplishments under her belt. A great television host, but, let's not forget Donald Trump in 2016 defeated 16 incredible GOP candidates and Hillary Clinton."

They never thought he would win. Then he wins. Then they were attacking him. And then Russia collusion not proven. A lot is boomeranging back, but it's hard. How hard has it been on your family?"

      "speaker": "CONCHA",
      "utterance": "Well, that's what you have to look at, Sean, was what's the five biggest issues that voters voted on in 2016, according to most polls. Economy, OK, which you could say things are going excellent as you pointed out before. Jobs, unemployment at 17-year low. ISIS, the caliphate 98 percent of it destroyed. Healthcare, incomplete that didn't work out in 2017. And then obviously immigration, which is being discussed today we're in year two now. So, if four of those five are kept, I don't see Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, those key states where trade and economy were really important. It's hard to see those votes flipping in again. It depends on the Democrats run"

But I think you have a really strong shot to take the prize in the president and his fake news awards.
