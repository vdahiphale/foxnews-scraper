I wonder what Arkansas Republican Congressman Steve Womack thinks of that. He's chairman of the House Budget Committee.  Some of your conservative colleagues -- you might be among them, sir -- have said Republicans have given up the fight for spending and watching spending. What do you think of that?  REP. STEVE WOMACK, R—ARKANSAS: Not at all, Neil.  We -- look, the president's proposed budgets and the legislative branch, the check and balance, will eventually dispose. We're concerned about deficits and debt, probably more so than the markets seem to be reflecting right now. But there's no doubt that the people that I represent on the House Budget Committee are anxious to tackle a budget resolution for this year, even though our counterparts in the Senate may not.  But we are. And it's always our goals to see that we can achieve balance within a 10-year window. And we will continue to proceed in that direction.",
