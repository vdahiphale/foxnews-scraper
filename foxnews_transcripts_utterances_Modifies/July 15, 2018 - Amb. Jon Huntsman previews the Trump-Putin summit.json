But there's a whole lot more that is part of our relationship that has to be discussed too. We can't turn our back to what has happened. We have to learn from it, be informed and be smart going forward. But I think is the president approaches he's looking at arms control, probably the most important issue we have here is nonproliferation. The two countries are 90 percent of the world's nuclear weapons. You have Syria, you have North Korea, you have Ukraine, and a lot of bilateral issues.",

They will stay until there is concrete movement on some of the issues that matter most, namely Ukraine. So, what the president will be looking for, and listen, he's been totally consistent on this since my first conversation with him, he says I want to reduce the risk. I want to take the element of danger such that I can out of the U.S.-Russian relationship.  We are 90 percent of the nuclear weapons. We have overlapping interests in Syria. If we can't fix those, chances are we're going to find ourselves in a very small combat zone which could lead to some very dangerous outcomes. So, I think the key here is this is the first time that President Trump has met across the table with president Putin. If they met on the sidelines of Hamburg G20. They met the APEC summit in Vietnam.  But they haven't had an opportunity to actually sit across the table, get to know each other and actually sort through the issues that really matter.  So, key will be, where do we have overlapping and shared interests? I can tell you where we don't have interest and so can the rest of the world, but where is it where we can actually join forces to make the world somewhat more stable? That's just not happening right now and it's not going to happen until the heads of state deem these to be important.",

The process and investigation are playing out and that's part of holding Russia accountable and responsible for election meddling and malign activity. It's part of getting through our relationship. This is part of it. But let me tell you something else. We've got to at some point quit looking in the rearview mirror. We have to be informed by what we've been through and use that to educate us as we go forward.   But at some point, we have to look forward and around the bend. We have an election coming up in November and if there is meddling in the election this November, like we saw in 2016, we're not going to have much of a relationship left and all of these other issues that we're talking about in trying to find common ground going to be exceedingly difficult to do. So, we have a real world case study that's about to play out in November that's going to be very important in this bilateral relationship.

      "utterance": "Well, I would say that the president is our most experienced negotiator elected president in recent years. Putin similarly is a very experienced negotiator. He's an intelligence operative. That's how he approaches all of his subjects, thinking in terms of an intelligence operation. They're both very experienced and wise to the world. For the president, the challenges are certainly there, but I think he is genuinely looking forward to sitting across the table and trying to reduce the tension in a relationship where our collective blood pressure is off the charts high. And it's not good for the United States and is not good for the world."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "The reason I ask is that you briefed the media before the president left for Europe and here's some of what you had to say: The ball really is in Russia's court on the president will continue to hold Russia accountable for its malign activities. Just to make sure, I looked up malign in a dictionary and as I thought it means evil. What Russian activities do you consider evil?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HUNTSMAN",
      "utterance": "Well, trying to influence other elections, not only our own, but those in Europe, tampering with the Brexit boat, funding nefarious political movements within Europe. The list goes on and on and on. So, when the president looks at the totality of the Russian relationship, this is one piece of it, addressing their malign activity in their election meddling. But there's a whole lot more that is part of our relationship that has to be discussed too. We can't turn our back to what has happened. We have to learn from it, be informed and be smart going forward. But I think is the president approaches he's looking at arms control, probably the most important issue we have here is nonproliferation. The two countries are 90 percent of the world's nuclear weapons. You have Syria, you have North Korea, you have Ukraine, and a lot of bilateral issues."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WALLACE",
      "utterance": "I'm going to get into a few of those issues in a moment, but just generally speaking, what does President Trump want from Putin at the summit in terms of changes in specific policies, and what is he prepared to give him in return?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "HUNTSMAN",
      "utterance": "Well, it's premature to say what anybody is going to get in return because the president is coming into the summit with 460 sanctions against individuals and entities. They will stay until there is concrete movement on some of the issues that matter most, namely Ukraine. So, what the president will be looking for, and listen, he's been totally consistent on this since my first conversation with him, he says I want to reduce the risk. I want to take the element of danger such that I can out of the U.S.-Russian relationship. We are 90 percent of the nuclear weapons. We have overlapping interests in Syria. If we can't fix those, chances are we're going to find ourselves in a very small combat zone which could lead to some very dangerous outcomes. So, I think the key here is this is the first time that President Trump has met across the table with president Putin. If they met on the sidelines of Hamburg G20. They met the APEC summit in Vietnam. But they haven't had an opportunity to actually sit across the table, get to know each other and actually sort through the issues that really matter. So, key will be, where do we have overlapping and shared interests? I can tell you where we don't have interest and so can the rest of the world, but where is it where we can actually join forces to make the world somewhat more stable? That's just not happening right now and it's not going to happen until the heads of state deem these to be important."

Can you assure our viewers, can you assure the American people that the president will not recognize Russia's annexation of Crimea, that he will not pull U.S. troops out of Syria, and that he will do nothing in this meeting to weaken the NATO defense alliance?"

There's no guarantee that this is going to work out, Chris, but you're never going to know until you take that first step. And that first step has not been taken until tomorrow."

You look at eastern Ukraine, the so-called breakaway provinces in Donbass, a violation of international law. Not only for us, but for the Europeans as well. These are very, very serious issues and issues that we have some serious sanctions tied to, by the way. I mentioned the 460 sanctions we have against individual and entities. These sanctions are not going to all of a sudden disappear until there is movement in terms of settling out some of these ongoing issues."

Now, as you well know, the Justice Department announced a new indictment on Friday of 12 Russian military officers for hacking into Democratic computers, stealing information and then releasing it to the American public in the hopes of disrupting the election. Do you have any doubt that the GRU, Russian military intelligence, conducted these operations?"

Those who have followed this issue closely, there's very little doubt in my mind about what we are seeing. The investigation was rolled up almost 30 Russians in total. The process and investigation are playing out and that's part of holding Russia accountable and responsible for election meddling and malign activity. It's part of getting through our relationship. This is part of it. But let me tell you something else. We've got to at some point quit looking in the rearview mirror. We have to be informed by what we've been through and use that to educate us as we go forward. But at some point, we have to look forward and around the bend. We have an election coming up in November and if there is meddling in the election this November, like we saw in 2016, we're not going to have much of a relationship left and all of these other issues that we're talking about in trying to find common ground going to be exceedingly difficult to do. So, we have a real world case study that's about to play out in November that's going to be very important in this bilateral relationship. They know it and we know it and we've brought it up time and time again, and we'll have to see if this is a test ultimately of whether we can get through the months ahead."

Why didn't they do something about it, especially when it was reported that President Obama was informed by the FBI in September before the election?

The very fact that we have our heads of state getting together for this kind of conversation is a big, big deliverable. One thing we have to be mindful of in all of this is every president since the Cold War has done a reset or a redo, heightened expectations, only to have all expectations dashed. You don't want to have that play out all over again. Be informed by history. We have interest, so do they. Put your cards on the table, see where we have overlapping interests where we can problem-solve together to make the Middle East less volatile, to help move North Korea towards denuclearization, to help resolve the sovereignty issue in Ukraine. The world would benefit from that and that that will require the United States and Russia."

Joining me now from Wilmington, Delaware, Democratic Senator Chris Coons, a key member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Senator, in the wake of the indictment of those 12 Russian intelligence officers, the announcement on Friday for alleged interference in the 2016 election, should President Trump canceled the summit with Vladimir Putin?"

He's not meeting with a competitor. He is not meeting with a potential friend. He's meeting with an adversary.

I'm very concerned, and frankly, Chris, as you just brought up in your interview with Ambassador Huntsman, there is a menu of things to be concerned about, that he might withdraw American troops from Syria, that he might cancel military exercises with our regional allies, that he might recognize Russia's annexation with Crimea and you pressed the ambassador whether he could say with confidence he would do none of those things or weaken a NATO alliance, another thing you raised, and he couldn't say that with clarity and confidence. And after President Trump's whiplash performances in Brussels, the United Kingdom and the G7 summit, I will say it's difficult to predict with clarity what president Trump will or won't do with Vladimir Putin. That's what gives me real pause."

So, I think he needs to make it clear that we know that they interfered in our 2016 elections and stop calling this a rigged witch hunt, and he needs to say that the sanctions already passed by Congress, the Countering America's Adversary Sanctions Act that was passed by 98-2, that those sanctions will be more broadly and more vigorously and more thoroughly implemented by the Trump administration unless Russia accepts accountability for their illegal actions and stops meddling in our elections and the elections of our allies."

This is a trend that began under President Obama and President Bush, but it has accelerated and that's a positive. But let me also say I'm worried about the ways in which President Trump undermines our NATO collective security by attacking our allies and through his tariff policies. We just had a striking hear it in the Thursday where, on a bipartisan basis, many senators of both parties question whether the Trump administration's national security-based tariffs against vital NATO allies like Canada or Germany or the U.K. weakens our alliance. These are folks who have suffered combat deaths, more than 1,000 NATO troops have died fighting alongside us in Afghanistan, and I think it's important that we strengthen the alliance and not distract our vital allies from our shared efforts against Russia on security and China on trade."

But I think for our troops to be pulled out, for us to abruptly abandon our Kurdish allies, who were so central to the defeat of ISIS, would be strategically unwise because if we don't have a presence on the ground, we don't have a seat at the table as the resolution of the Assad regime's brutal war against its own people is negotiated. And so, I would certainly hope there wasn't an abrupt withdrawal of an American presence in Syria, since it's vital to protecting the folks who fought alongside us in the war against ISIS."

      "utterance": "Chris, I supported the provision of lethal aid to Ukraine, I visited Ukraine, and they are very nervous about what might happen between President Trump and President Putin. I will remind you that one of the strong steps that President Obama did take was getting our allies to expel Russia from the G8 to reduce it to the G7. And in the recent G7 meeting, President Trump said perhaps Russia should rejoin. I would support our reducing sanctions on Russia, allowing them to rejoin G8 if they took the steps that they must take to withdraw their forces from eastern Ukraine, to undo the illegal annexation of Crimea, but to simply waive that, to say it is somehow all Obama's fault and let's move forward would be to weaken our vital allies in Europe who have joined us in sustaining tough sanctions against Russia. I commend President Trump for the steps he has taken, but to simply waive this off as Obama's fault misses the vital historical context here. President Putin is the first Russian leader since Stalin to expand their territory. We can't allow this to go unchallenged."

You say that you are actually going to wait and listen and talk to him, but you have expressed concerns.

I do think it's my job on the Judiciary Committee respecting Judge Kavanaugh's credentials to better understand his jurisprudence and to understand whether he is in fact in the conservative mainstream, or is that one end of it, and would change our Constitution and our jurisprudence in this country that would affect millions of American lives and undo long settled guarantees of freedoms, rights and liberties."

He just listed Ukraine, Syria, et cetera. But I think separately, publicly, he's made very clear what he thinks the summit's about. He said it's a loose meeting. He wants to basically sit man-to-man and see if he can form a relationship with Vladimir Putin. I know when foreign officials were talking to the White House trying to get information from them about what they were trying to achieve, the answers they found very unsatisfying, the foreign officials. They found them vague and that there seemed to be no real agenda for the summit."

So what he did with Singapore, and there's still debate about how successful that was with Kim Jong-un, is what he's trying to do here. In terms of the specific agenda items, I think there are two big things. One is Syria. The White House seems to believe -- I'm not sure other people believe, but they seem to believe that Russia can be a bit of a partner in Syria and somehow easing the Iranians out of the country and thus making it possible for American forces to leave at some point in time. I think you can ask a lot of questions about that strategy, but it's a theme that John Bolton and Secretary Pompeo have returned to again. Then there's arms control. And in your interview and others, Ambassador Huntsman has signaled that they're looking to extend the New START treaty, which expires in 2021. And President Trump's talked a lot about how he doesn't want an arms race. The issue there is the Russians are now in violation of the INF treaty --"

But along the way he took some real shots at NATO in general and Germany in particular. Was there a strategy there in what the president was doing?

Now, he overstated the success of the summit afterward, saying they've agreed to things they've never agreed to before. And the French leader, Emmanuel Macron, came out and said, no we didn't, we agreed to exactly what we agreed to last time. They are increasing their spending of -- under Trump and the NATO secretary general gives them credit for it. But the allies resent how aggressively President Trump has gone after them, particularly the Germans. He's been very, very brutal with Angela Merkel and the Germans just very, very down on -- on the situation."

They can try to the best extent to forecast it. They've said, you know, he's going to raise election meddling, we're going to discuss arms control, and that does seem to be the one issue President Trump has real, genuine enthusiasm for, nuclear proliferation.

Well, Karl, let me start with you because Brett Kavanaugh survived a photo taken of the two of you while you were working together. You can see how chummy you are here in the Bush White House. President Trump nominated him anyway. While I'm sure that you dismiss the heated rhetoric from the left, isn't it the case that if Judge Kavanaugh becomes Justice Kavanaugh, he will be a strong conservative who will limit access to abortion and Obamacare?"

Mind you, this choice that the president has given to the Democrats is probably the hardest one he could have given them because it's putting a lot of red state senators who are Democrats up for re-election on the spot in terms of whether or not they can afford to vote against the choice of a president whose very popular in their states.

I want to switch now to another big story this week, and that is -- there you see -- the trade war between the U.S. and countries around the world. I want to put up some numbers. This month -- this month alone, President Trump has hit China with tariffs on $34 billion of imports and set in motion tariffs on another $216 billion of Chinese goods. Beijing is retaliating. We've also imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum from Canada, Mexico and the European Union, and they are striking back.

In the case of Paul Ryan, he ought to talk to his governor. It was Governor Walker who complained about the Canadians. And Governor Walker pointed out that the Canadians routinely do everything they can to hurt American dairy farmers and that's where that whole fight started, was in a conversation between the president and Governor Walker. The fact is, we are the largest economy in the world, certainly the largest market in the world. We have enormous leverage. We have not used it very effectively. And that's going to make a lot of people very uncomfortable to have an aggressive president who really wants to change the terms of the agreements."

The fact is this trade war, if the -- our other -- our counterparts in other countries don't back off, is going to cost a lot of jobs. It certainly has roiled the markets. How much heartburn are all of these tariff battles causing four Republicans in Congress who were planning to go into these midterms campaigning on the idea of a strong economy?"

You know, Senator Coons mentioned this bipartisan measure that passed the Senate this week with a majority of Republicans voting for it, trying to basically caution the president against the procedure he used to oppose these aluminum and steel tariffs. You know, it's not clear to me that the Russian meddling is a big voting issue in the midterm election. But if you start costing people jobs and costing consumers more for things like soybeans and motorcycles and Jack Daniel's, this is an issue that could hurt Republicans running and some of these red states. It could help some of the Democratic senators in red states who are in some trouble on other issues, giving them an issue that goes to people's pocketbooks in some of the states that President Trump carried in 2016."

In fact, a lot of Democrats overplayed their hand by hectoring and interrupting. And one of them, Steve Cohen of Tennessee, suggested Strzok deserved a Purple Heart, that he was a wounded warrior. But I was struck by two things in this hearing. One is, first of all, what would -- why were the Democrats so unconcerned about this? What if you substituted the name of a Democratic presidential candidate and had an FBI agent in charge of the investigation displaying such an animus towards that Democrat? And, second of all, you know, Strzok could bare -- you know, bare his teeth and snarl about how the hearing was undermining the credibility of the FBI. Did not that man understand that his animus towards a presidential candidate that he was involved in an investigation of the campaign, didn't he understand that that could undermine credibility of the FBI far more than any kind of a congressional hearing ever could? I don't understand to this day why a man with such particular animus thought he was worthy and -- of being involved in an investigation of somebody against whom he bore such animus who was a candidate for president. He should have recused himself before he ever got to the point where Robert Mueller found out about the texts and immediately fired him. I'm astonished by his performance."
