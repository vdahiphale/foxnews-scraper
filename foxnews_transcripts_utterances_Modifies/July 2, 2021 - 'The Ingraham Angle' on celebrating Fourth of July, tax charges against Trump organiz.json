A bombshell report accusing Kamala Harris of running an abusive office. We'll bring you the juiciest details along with a dramatic reading. Plus, the hacking or hijacking of July 4th, and how we should all be resisting it. And Alan Dershowitz is here on the Britney Spears fight to regain control of her life.  But first, the Trump Organization and its CFO Allen Weisselberg are indicted on tax fraud charges brought against them today by the New York Attorney General and the Manhattan DA. Prosecutors accuse the former president's company of orchestrating a tax avoidance scheme where top executives were compensated with fringe benefits. Weisselberg stands accused of avoiding taxes on $1.7 million worth of off the books income. It's important to note that the former president himself has not been charged. Weisselberg and the Trump Organization say, they are not guilty, in a statement. They're saying \"Make no mistake. This is not about the law; this is all about politics.\"  Joining us now is Eric Trump, Executive Vice President of the Trump Organization. Eric, thanks for being here. The prosecutors claim that your CFO evaded taxes on $1.7 million worth of income. We're talking here about the use of a company car, possible tuition payments for his grandchildren. How concerned are you tonight as vice president of this organization?",

And at the White House, see all those people. And that was when Operation Warp Speed was still underway. Reducing July 4th to a campaign ad, or vaccine victory lap diminishes the importance of this holiday when we need it most. July 4th reminds us of our hard-won liberties, and it marks our independence as a people from a tyrannical overlord. Historically, the British. Beyond cookouts and mattress sales, John Adams wrote a letter to his wife on July 3, 1776, clearly explaining his vision of July 4th. \"It ought to be commemorated, Adams wrote, as the day of deliverance by solemn acts of devotion to God Almighty. It ought to be solemnized with pomp and parade, with shows, games, sports, guns, bells, bonfires, and illuminations, from one end of this continent to the other. I'm well aware of the toil and blood and treasure that it will cost us to maintain this declaration, and support and defend the states. Yet, through all the gloom, I can see the rays of ravishing light and glory.\" What has become those rays of ravishing, lightened glory? Adams would choke on a hot dog if he saw how cavalierly Americans brush off their birthright. A new Fox News poll finds that only 69 percent of Americans now believe the U.S. is the best country in the world to live in. Just six years ago, it was 83 percent. The numbers are even worse among those under 45. The big question is why? Part of the answer lies in the intentional racial division and the trashing of America's past. Last year, people took to the streets literally destroying the markers of our shared history, statues of Lincoln, the great emancipator, Grant, Columbus, even the saints who founded the missions in California were ripped down. The visual memory of these great American lives, once a source of unity and pride, had been physically stricken from public places. Now, in classrooms and in the pop culture, all memory of these lives are being replaced, or reimagined. Young people are taught that America is an irredeemable place, predicated on the sin of slavery and colonization, which continues to this day. Stuffed with deformed history and lukewarm Marxism, the acolytes dutifully repeat their catechism.",

This is not a sober reckoning with American history, but the strafing of it. We owe our children the whole truth, good, bad and ugly. Now, to add asininity to injury, a task force at your National Archives of all places has a new report that the Rotunda, which houses the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution, is itself an example of structural racism. Why, you ask? Because the Rotunda, quote, \"LAUDS wealthy white men in the nation's founding while marginalizing Black, indigenous and other people of color, women and other communities.\"  But the task force has the solution. They would like to reimagine the rotunda, put in place trigger warnings, content advisories to forewarn audiences, and I'm quoting, \"of content that may cause intense physiological and psychological symptoms\". You house historic documents and records. This is not the release of \"Song of the South\" on Disney Plus. We don't need a warning. Additionally, they recommend the creation of safe spaces at every National Archives facility. Thomas Jefferson may need one of those safe spaces as well as the other founding fathers. Can we still use the term Founding Fathers? At the Federal Reserve, you can't. They recently instructed employees to embrace bias-free language, avoiding constructions like founding fathers, man-made and those bothersome personal pronouns. Whatever the intentions, all of this divides. It divides people by sex, race, religion. We don't even agree on a common language anymore. The consequences of this were dramatized vividly by the sad spectacle of Olympic contender Gwen Berry. Last week, she made a big show of disrespecting the flag of the country she competed to represent. Not only did she ignore the anthem, she threw a T-shirt over her head and protest. But this is Gwen Berry in 2015. The first time she qualified for the Olympics. She had no problem waving a flag and representing her country then. What happened between 2015 and 2021? Clearly, Gwen Berry, like many others, were repeatedly told about the gloom of America, focusing on her problems and setbacks and sins. But like the people who make up America, that's not all there is. We are a good, inventive and loving people. And this July 4th, let's rekindle John Adams' rays of ravishing light and glory, and celebrate them, despite our differences as one American people. Joining me now is Dinesh D'Souza, conservative author, filmmaker, host of the Dinesh D'Souza podcast; and Dr. Carol Swain, former Princeton and Vanderbilt.

But he knows he can't do that. He now has a kind of boisterous left that responds even to the anthem, the flag, the founders, all the paraphernalia of the founding as racist. Probably Biden even talked about a cookout, people will say, well, cookouts, whites are disproportionately known to attend cookouts. And so there's such a poisonous rhetoric of foot from the left and Biden is kind of captive to it. So just about the only unifying thing he can think of as well, you know, we're all trying to fight the virus. So maybe if I focus on the virus that will help us find a common ground on July 4th.

So far earlier in this administration there were no leaks. It was very different than it was with the Trump White House when there was basically more leaks than the Iraqi Navy. This White House started to leak on Kamala Harris as soon as the trip started to go south when she was down south, and they started to put some distance between her and them and let the world know that President Biden was certainly entrusted in running again. Kamala Harris' office started to snipe back and say that the bar was higher because she was a woman of color, which of course identity politics is such a major player in why you even get selected for the vice presidential job in this arena after calling the president racist.

There are conflicts of interest all over the place here. And the court has to be sure that they are taking only her interest into account. And when in doubt, let her make her own mistakes.

A bombshell report accusing Kamala Harris of running an abusive office. We'll bring you the juiciest details along with a dramatic reading. Plus, the hacking or hijacking of July 4th, and how we should all be resisting it. And Alan Dershowitz is here on the Britney Spears fight to regain control of her life. But first, the Trump Organization and its CFO Allen Weisselberg are indicted on tax fraud charges brought against them today by the New York Attorney General and the Manhattan DA. Prosecutors accuse the former president's company of orchestrating a tax avoidance scheme where top executives were compensated with fringe benefits. Weisselberg stands accused of avoiding taxes on $1.7 million worth of off the books income. It's important to note that the former president himself has not been charged. Weisselberg and the Trump Organization say, they are not guilty, in a statement. They're saying \"Make no mistake. This is not about the law; this is all about politics.\" Joining us now is Eric Trump, Executive Vice President of the Trump Organization. Eric, thanks for being here. The prosecutors claim that your CFO evaded taxes on $1.7 million worth of income. We're talking here about the use of a company car, possible tuition payments for his grandchildren. How concerned are you tonight as vice president of this organization?"

They care about one person and that's taking down my father. They subpoenaed 3.5 million documents. They've gone through every single tax record that my father has had since 2005. And this is what they have. They have a company car, they have employment perks. Give me a break. They have been on a witch hunt.

And they have an entire district attorney office and Attorney General's office that's focused on $3.5 million to take down a political opponent? I mean, this is what they do. This is New York State for you. This is worse than a banana republic. It's truly horrible. It's truly horrible. And, Raymond, you know this better than anybody. They're afraid that my father is going to run in 2024, and they're afraid that he's going to win. So they don't look at corrupt Hunter Biden, they don't look at the fact that he's taking money from China, and the Ukraine and other countries and he is selling his finger paintings for $500,000 to undisclosed people.

This is - it's really interesting, Raymond, after the financial crisis, right, they didn't go after a single person on Wall Street, despite the fact that these people were literally, they took down the U.S. economy, but they'll go down - they'll go after somebody after fringe employment benefits? Is that really what the DEA is focused on as little girls are getting shot in the middle of Times Square? They'll go after a corporate vehicle and a corporate apartment? Give me a break. And honestly, I have to say the media has actually been very fair about this. The New York Times, so many of the different news outlets, they've literally said, this isn't criminal, this isn't worth 40, 50 investigators, a district attorney's office."

On January 3 or January 4, one of those two days, President Trump talked to the head of DoD, Mr. Miller. And Mr. Miller testified in oversight that President Trump authorized National Guard troops, as many as they needed, to secure the capital of Washington D.C. The day before January 6, January 5th, there was a rally up on Capitol Hill, President Trump called director Miller and told him, did you see the crowd? It's going to be a lot of people out there. Do you have everything you need with the National Guard? I don't know about you. But if you're fomenting an insurrection, why do you make sure that there's enough law enforcement capacity that's going to be in the nation's Capitol on the day, in question?

All Congress would do right now is play politics, which is the last thing that we should be doing with this Select Committee. If Homeland Security and Oversight want to continue holding hearings, we're the relevant committees, let's do that. But Nancy Pelosi understands one thing. They have to keep Donald Trump front and center because they've gotten so accustomed to attacking him all the time that now they don't have to - they don't have anybody to do that with and their agenda is exposed. They can't get anything through the house. Their ideas are bad. The American people know it. And so they have to constantly go back to January 6. It's the only thing they have left to do."

And at the White House, see all those people. And that was when Operation Warp Speed was still underway. Reducing July 4th to a campaign ad, or vaccine victory lap diminishes the importance of this holiday when we need it most. July 4th reminds us of our hard-won liberties, and it marks our independence as a people from a tyrannical overlord. Historically, the British. Beyond cookouts and mattress sales, John Adams wrote a letter to his wife on July 3, 1776, clearly explaining his vision of July 4th. \"It ought to be commemorated, Adams wrote, as the day of deliverance by solemn acts of devotion to God Almighty. It ought to be solemnized with pomp and parade, with shows, games, sports, guns, bells, bonfires, and illuminations, from one end of this continent to the other. I'm well aware of the toil and blood and treasure that it will cost us to maintain this declaration, and support and defend the states. Yet, through all the gloom, I can see the rays of ravishing light and glory.\" What has become those rays of ravishing, lightened glory? Adams would choke on a hot dog if he saw how cavalierly Americans brush off their birthright. A new Fox News poll finds that only 69 percent of Americans now believe the U.S. is the best country in the world to live in. Just six years ago, it was 83 percent. The numbers are even worse among those under 45. The big question is why? Part of the answer lies in the intentional racial division and the trashing of America's past. Last year, people took to the streets literally destroying the markers of our shared history, statues of Lincoln, the great emancipator, Grant, Columbus, even the saints who founded the missions in California were ripped down. The visual memory of these great American lives, once a source of unity and pride, had been physically stricken from public places. Now, in classrooms and in the pop culture, all memory of these lives are being replaced, or reimagined. Young people are taught that America is an irredeemable place, predicated on the sin of slavery and colonization, which continues to this day. Stuffed with deformed history and lukewarm Marxism, the acolytes dutifully repeat their catechism."

This is not a sober reckoning with American history, but the strafing of it. We owe our children the whole truth, good, bad and ugly. Now, to add asininity to injury, a task force at your National Archives of all places has a new report that the Rotunda, which houses the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution, is itself an example of structural racism. Why, you ask? Because the Rotunda, quote, \"LAUDS wealthy white men in the nation's founding while marginalizing Black, indigenous and other people of color, women and other communities.\" But the task force has the solution. They would like to reimagine the rotunda, put in place trigger warnings, content advisories to forewarn audiences, and I'm quoting, \"of content that may cause intense physiological and psychological symptoms\". You house historic documents and records. This is not the release of \"Song of the South\" on Disney Plus. We don't need a warning. Additionally, they recommend the creation of safe spaces at every National Archives facility. Thomas Jefferson may need one of those safe spaces as well as the other founding fathers. Can we still use the term Founding Fathers? At the Federal Reserve, you can't. They recently instructed employees to embrace bias-free language, avoiding constructions like founding fathers, man-made and those bothersome personal pronouns. Whatever the intentions, all of this divides. It divides people by sex, race, religion. We don't even agree on a common language anymore. The consequences of this were dramatized vividly by the sad spectacle of Olympic contender Gwen Berry. Last week, she made a big show of disrespecting the flag of the country she competed to represent. Not only did she ignore the anthem, she threw a T-shirt over her head and protest. But this is Gwen Berry in 2015. The first time she qualified for the Olympics. She had no problem waving a flag and representing her country then. What happened between 2015 and 2021? Clearly, Gwen Berry, like many others, were repeatedly told about the gloom of America, focusing on her problems and setbacks and sins. But like the people who make up America, that's not all there is. We are a good, inventive and loving people. And this July 4th, let's rekindle John Adams' rays of ravishing light and glory, and celebrate them, despite our differences as one American people. Joining me now is Dinesh D'Souza, conservative author, filmmaker, host of the Dinesh D'Souza podcast; and Dr. Carol Swain, former Princeton and Vanderbilt. Professor Carol, I want to start with you, we're all for inclusion in making every citizen a part of this ongoing American experiment. But talk to me about the habit of dividing people along racial, sexual and religious lines and what that does to our unity, particularly now?"

      "utterance": "I can tell you that I find it deeply offensive. And I believe that it is destroying our nation, and it is weakening our nation before the world. The only people who benefit from what has taken place are our foreign enemies. And I think that the American people are rejecting this. The Democratic Party, everything they seem to do seems to be about turn down America instead of building it up. And they are bringing the American people together because across political lines, I believe that we've had enough."

      "utterance": "Dinesh, very quick question. Put your political hat on for me briefly. What do you make a Biden trying to commandeer July 4 as a vaccine victory event? DINESH D'SOUZA, CONSERVATIVE AUTHOR & FILMMAKER: Well, I think that, for Biden, he is in a bit of a trap, because I think there's a part of him that would want to affirm July 4th in traditional patriotic terms. But he knows he can't do that. He now has a kind of boisterous left that responds even to the anthem, the flag, the founders, all the paraphernalia of the founding as racist. Probably Biden even talked about a cookout, people will say, well, cookouts, whites are disproportionately known to attend cookouts. And so there's such a poisonous rhetoric of foot from the left and Biden is kind of captive to it. So just about the only unifying thing he can think of as well, you know, we're all trying to fight the virus. So maybe if I focus on the virus that will help us find a common ground on July 4th. It's a statement of the pathos of the Democratic Party that we are at this point."

      "speaker": "ROGER BENNETT, NBC SPORTS BROADCASTER",
      "utterance": "I grew up in the murk of 1980s England, and hailing everything American that I could lay my hands on. I made the United States my light in my darkness. A place filled with possibility and promise, and for whom the act of becoming an American citizen is the single greatest achievement of my life."

      "speaker": "ARROYO",
      "utterance": "It's actually really beautiful. I think of my father, who is also a naturalized citizen. I was struck by the power of his witnessing to America's ascendent 80s culture, Dinesh. That was the lure for him. Contrast that to where we are today. Very quickly."

    {
      "speaker": "D'SOUZA",
      "utterance": "I think that all immigrants recognize that we have come to a country that was made before we got here. So even though people say America is a country that is built by immigrants, yes, immigrants have contributed to the building of America. But America was invented by its original settlers. They, in a sense orchestrated, set up this country that immigrants subsequently were attracted to. And that is why the denunciation of the original settlers, the people who made America, is offensive to every immigrant, black, white, or brown."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ARROYO",
      "utterance": "That's a great segue. Carol, I want you to react to this. We found something Frederick Douglass wrote the founding fathers, who have been much maligned, as you heard from my intro. He wrote \"The signers of the Declaration of Independence were brave men. They were great men, too. I cannot contemplate their great deeds with less than admiration. They were statesmen, patriots, and heroes. And for the good they did and the principles they contended for, I will unite with you to honor their memory.\" Carol, it's important to note Douglass was an escaped slave, and he has more reverence for the founding fathers than free Americans do today."

    {
      "speaker": "CAROL SWAIN, FORMER VANDERBILT PROFESSOR",
      "utterance": "Yes, and if you think about Dr. Martin Luther King, and others civil rights leaders, we have always believed in America. And the American people, I believe, across racial and ethnic lines, they do not buy into the Democratic Party's radical vision to destroy this nation. And I, as a black American, I love this nation. I see it as the greatest nation in the world, and despite our flaws, I think that we can move beyond this moment, look back at this time, and hopefully learn from it and never let it happen again."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ARROYO",
      "utterance": "That's a great point. And Carol and Dinesh, the amazing thing is while we apologize for America or accent her sins and protest and attack the things that unite us, in China they are celebrating the 100th anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party. It looks like the Olympics opening ceremonies over there with Xi sitting atop the wedding cake. But I'm out of time, we will leave it there. Dinesh and Carol, thank you for being here. There's trouble in Camelot, or should I say Kamala-lot. Not only is the V.P. a political albatross around Biden's neck, her aides are now running to the media to complain about their toxic work environment. We'll reveal the shocking testimonies next. Stay there."

      "speaker": "ARROYO",
      "utterance": "It turns out Vice President Kamala Harris isn't just whiffing when it comes to delivering positive results to the American people. She's now being accused of presiding over a toxic workplace. A bombshell report in \"Politico\" exposes at all. To give you a feel for the atmosphere and the VP's office, we thought a dramatic reading was in order. Cue the music, please. \"Harris' team is experiencing low morale and diminished trust among aides and senior officials, 22 current and former vice presidential aides and other associates describe a tense and at time dour office atmosphere. It all starts at the top, said one of the administration officials. People are thrown under the bus from the very top. There are short fuses and it's an abusive environment, said another. People often feel mistreated. It's a place where people feel treated like --\" Joining me now is Chris Bedford, senior editor at \"The Federalist,\" and Lisa Boothe, FOX News contributor. Chris, is the fact that this story even came out a sign that the Biden team is fed up with Harris and her failures? CHRIS BEDFORD, SENIOR EDITOR, \"THE FEDERALIST\": Yes. So far earlier in this administration there were no leaks. It was very different than it was with the Trump White House when there was basically more leaks than the Iraqi Navy. This White House started to leak on Kamala Harris as soon as the trip started to go south when she was down south, and they started to put some distance between her and them and let the world know that President Biden was certainly entrusted in running again. Kamala Harris' office started to snipe back and say that the bar was higher because she was a woman of color, which of course identity politics is such a major player in why you even get selected for the vice presidential job in this arena after calling the president racist. But I think the Democrats are starting to line up opposition research against each other because they realize that with a doddering president Joe Biden and a politically weak Kamala Harris, the field could be open in four years' time or in three years' time."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ARROYO",
      "utterance": "The ladies over at \"The View,\" Lisa, think that any complaints about working for Harris can be easily explained. Watch. SUNNY HOSTIN, \"THE VIEW\" CO-HOST: I just hate the fact that this is coming from inside our vice president's house. This also has a lot to do with the fact that she is a woman of color and a woman, because we know that things that are acceptable for men are not acceptable for women."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ARROYO",
      "utterance": "And she's not alone. Harris spokesman Symone Sanders said \"We're not making rainbows and bunnies all day. What I hear is that people have hard jobs, and I'm like, welcome to the club.\" Lisa, what do you make of these explanations, and where does it leave Harris politically?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "LISA BOOTHE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR",
      "utterance": "That was also a terrifying bedtime story you read before we came on."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOOTHE",
      "utterance": "But look, I think her staff should consider themselves lucky, lucky that they don't have to work for Amy Klobuchar, who of course berated a staffer who didn't bring her a fork and then proceeded to eat a salad with a comb. So there's that. It could always be worse. But I don't think anyone should be surprised that Kamala Harris is overstaying a toxic work environment. This is the woman who called Joe Biden a racist, who said that he was a sexual harasser, and then proceeded to sign up to be his vice president and then chalked it up to politics. She also led the witch hunt against Brett Kavanaugh that was completely baseless without any evidence. This is not a nice person, this is not a good person. But I think Joe Biden has really walked Democrats off a cliff for 2024, because if she is going to inherit the Democrat nomination, she's a terrible candidate, she's a terrible politician. We're seeing that over the past few months with her as the VP. And then during the 2020 race she ran one of the most expensive and least effective primary races. So I think they're going to be in trouble with her."

Speaking of Joe Biden, though, Lisa, the big question on everyone's mind right now is, how is Biden going to react to these Harris revelations? Here' what he said back in January."

    {
      "speaker": "BEDFORD",
      "utterance": "No, I don't think so at all. And it's worth saying that here she is -- here she is calling people a racist and a sexist for attacking her. She did that first with Republicans. First she did it with Joe Biden. She did that with Republicans. She's since done it with the White House with the president's team when they were leaking on her. And now she's saying it about her own staff, the people who work for her. She says the bar is higher because she's a woman of color. But the reality is the bar is high because she represents the United States. She is the vice president. She has an important role. When she's abroad for her first international trip from this White House, she is representing all of us. And she needs to hold herself to that standard. She hasn't done a very good job. She finished dead last, even behind Amy Klobuchar, probably the most unlikable politician in America, during the primaries. She needs to try and convince Americans that she is worthy of this job because she definitely wants that mantle after President Biden."

      "utterance": "Lisa, very quickly. They say poor Kamala Harris has been thrown these very difficult, intractable problems to solve, and that's why she's got difficulties. She's got immigration, she's got voting rights. It's too much for anybody. You say what?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BOOTHE",
      "utterance": "I think it does raise questions. Is Joe Biden trying to throw her under the bus? You essentially create this immigration crisis by dismantling all of the policies that deter illegal immigration in the first place, and then he set Kamala Harris, you give her that in her portfolio as being the border czar. So it does kind of look like he's maybe throwing her under the bus."

Pop star Britney Spears is fighting to regain control of her life from her conservators. Alan Dershowitz breaks down the latest developments. Stay right there."

    {
      "speaker": "ARROYO",
      "utterance": "Sadly, that wasn't true. In court testimony last week, Britney Spears said \"I've lied and told the whole world I'm OK. It's a lie. I've been in shock. I'm traumatized. I'm so angry, it's insane.\" And she didn't stop there. She added, \"My father and anyone involved in my conservatorship and by management who played a huge role in punishing me when I said no, they should be in jail.\" Today, the company that serves as co-conservator of her estate petitioned the court to withdraw from overseeing her financials. Her father has done no such thing. Joining me now is Alan Dershowitz, Harvard law officer emeritus and author of \"The Case Against The New Censorship.\" Alan, there are actually two conservatorships here, the financial one, and then this odd personal one run by someone named Jodi Montgomery. What is going on here?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ALAN DERSHOWITZ, HARVARD LAW PROFESSOR EMERITUS",
      "utterance": "This is a personal human tragedy, and the law has not proved itself capable of dealing with these terrible human tragedies. The one thing that is clear is that the current situation is unsustainable. She can't continue to be controlled by her father, who she doesn't trust and doesn't like. She can't continue to be controlled by people who she doesn't get along with. In the end, the father will be removed. Remember, she hadn't yet petitioned for removal of guardianship. Her lawyers indicated he will do so in the next few days. And I suspect the court will have no choice but to eliminate the guardianship. But that doesn't mean she will be completely free. The court may try to appoint somebody else to take care of her financial issues. The harder one is the personal one, because she's an adult. She's almost 40 years old. And she has the right to determine her own destiny and to make her own mistakes. And unless they can prove she's so mentally ill that, essentially, she belongs in a mental hospital, the law generally should opt in favor of letting an adult deal with her own problems and make her own mistakes. I think that's the way it will come out."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "ARROYO",
      "utterance": "Yes, this whole conservatorship, I've been told, Alan, from professionals, it's bizarre to have someone who has all their faculties subjected to something like this. So the question is, does the court know something we don't about Britney's well-being, her mental state? Might they be something here we're missing? Remember, she tried twice to remove her father from this spot, or petitioned the court to."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DERSHOWITZ",
      "utterance": "There's probably a lot here that we don't know. A lot of the material is almost certainly confidential. I think two things are very clear. She has problems. She's not just an ordinary entertainer. She's been through all kinds of serious problems. And may continue to have problems. People have exploited her, that's number one. Number two, the current situation is worse than not having a conservatorship at all. So I think in the end, the court will resolve it by removing the current conservators, particularly her father, perhaps trying to find some professional, a professor or a doctor, or somebody who has only her interest in mind who isn't paid -- who doesn't earn money from this, where there is no conflict of interest. There are conflicts of interest all over the place here. And the court has to be sure that they are taking only her interest into account. And when in doubt, let her make her own mistakes. That is the way America works. If you are an adult, you're entitled to make your own mistakes."

    {
      "speaker": "ARROYO",
      "utterance": "Very briefly, because I have to ask you a Trump question first about that indictment. This wealth management company Bessemer Trust, they asked to be removed from the conservatorship. Do you think that is going to happen? They want out. They haven't apparently done anything about her finances since they've been appointed by the court."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DERSHOWITZ",
      "utterance": "Absolutely. Absolutely. She has to have somebody that she has complete trust in and complete faith in. So I think we are going to see a change in the circumstances. But it's not going to be a complete elimination of all conservatorships. I think the court will still maintain some role, but a less intrusive one then they have today."

    {
      "speaker": "ARROYO",
      "utterance": "Alan, I want to turn quickly to the charges brought against the Trump Organization and its CFO. Your legal take on this? Clearly, if they had something on Trump, why would they go after his CFO for a puny $1.7 million? Is this a political prosecution?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "DERSHOWITZ",
      "utterance": "First of all, it's not $1.7. It's a tax on $1.7, which is a small percentage of that. They would never have gone after this guy criminally if he didn't work for Trump, and if Trump weren't possibly running for president. And for the reason they are going after him obviously is to get to Trump. It is the domino theory. It was originated in large part by Rudy Giuliani, his own lawyer, when he was the U.S. attorney."
