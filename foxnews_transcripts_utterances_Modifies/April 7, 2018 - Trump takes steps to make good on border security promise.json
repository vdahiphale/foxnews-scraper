How would you solve the illegal immigration problem at the border?"

    },

      "speaker": "NOORANI",
      "utterance": "That's what I am doing here, yes, so, if you want to spend money on the border to secure a nation, then you invest in ports of entry? That's where you see the majority of drugs, guns, and money being smuggled. Let's spend money at ports of entry and ensure our security there. That's what the real problem here is, Jesse. It is drugs coming into the country."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Okay, listen. I agree that a lot of bad stuff flows across the ports of entry. I agree, drugs, heroin -- it's a big problem and that needs to be addressed. On the other hand, last year 300,000 people crossing the southern border illegally were caught. We don't even know about the ones that weren't caught. So, can't you also address the border as well as the ports of entry?"

      "speaker": "NOORANI",

Those are the smart things that you do on the border. That's what this administration has a chance to do. But if you actually want to solve the drug problem, if you want to solve the drug problem, I mean, last year over 40,000 people died because of opioid addiction. Let's put our prosecutorial resources going after drug crimes. I mean, right now, we are spending so much time and money -- we are spending over 50 percent on federal prosecution on our immigration. Only 14 percent are on opioid addiction. That's killing -- that's literally killing American (inaudible)..."

    {
      "speaker": "NOORANI",

    {
      "speaker": "NOORANI",
      "utterance": "A wall is a beautiful symbol, but I would rather have smart policy in place that balances boots at ports of entry and strategic infrastructure and between the technology. A wall is a great symbol. It makes everybody happy and very angry, but it doesn't actually solve the problem."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "But walls work, and I think that's why a lot of people on the Democratic side don't want them. Walls are very effective and the Border Patrol wants a wall. I think a vast majority of them want a wall because they know that is going to stop the crossings. Let me show you a picture of a wall right now in New Mexico. This is a very old wall that needs to be replaced immediately. I think we have a picture of some people scaling it. This was just the other day we have people on each other's shoulders climbing a 20-foot structure. It's obviously not secure because you can climb and I have been down there, too, and I climbed the same wall."

That's still a lot of money."

      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "And a lot of that is heroin now is what our research is showing."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUDD",
      "utterance": "It is. It is heroin. It's the opioid bases. It's what's killing all these people in the United States. So, we have to secure the border and I have to applaud President Trump for putting the National Guard on the border because that allows us to go after what the actual problem is which is the criminal cartels. Their profits are based upon getting things through the border which includes humans, it includes narcotic, it includes, if you will, even fake Oakleys. They have to get their products across the border. And so, if we secure the border..."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Yes, we've got to crack down on the fake Oakley market. You know, you are right and I said that to Ali, you know, every time a migrant wants to cross the border, he has to pay a coyote, and then the coyote pays the cartel. Whether it's a human, whether it is heroin, whatever goes along that border, the cartel is making a profit and they get a chunk of everything that goes across. So, if you are going to shut down the illegal immigration, what that is going to do is that is going to take a chunk out of the profit of the cartel and that is going to diminish their power and that is going to allow the Mexican government to exert more power over them."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUDD",
      "utterance": "Well, so if you look at it -- so you have to look at the ways that we can in fact secure the border and what Ali said is we need infrastructure -- technical infrastructure. We tried that before. We tried SBInet. It was an absolute and complete failure, but what we have seen is physical barriers."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "What was that that was tried that you said?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUDD",
      "utterance": "It was called SBInet and that was supposed to be all of these radars that were supposed to detect things that come across that were supposed to put us in on it and it didn't work, but what has worked is physical barriers. So, if we put the proper physical barriers in the proper locations, which allows the Border Patrol, me, to dictate where the smugglers bring in their product, I will be a lot more successful. We will be able to put a dent in their profits and hopefully put them out of business."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "So, you're going to be able to kind of funnel the cross-border traffic where you want to it to be strategically based on what you put the fencing. Obviously, you're not going to put a fence on the Rio Grande or over a mountain top, but at the same time, you know the patterns better than anybody. So, you're going to funnel it to your advantage. That makes perfect sense. Last question..."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "... do you get the sense that people don't want the wall because they know the wall works?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUDD",
      "utterance": "Yes. What you want -- you see the left politicizing this issue all the time. We want to stop talking about this issue. We don't want this to be a 2020 debate. We want to once and for all secure the border so that we don't have to continue to stay here and say, \"Well, we need this or we need that.\" We know what we need, give us what we need. Let's get the Republicans behind this President. Give him what he needs. We will secure the border, and it's over."

What do you to those people?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "JUDD",

You don't believe me? Look at how much time was devoted to Stormy Daniels compared to how much time was devoted to the spending bill. The spending bill obviously has much more impact on the lives of Americans than gossip, but maybe CNN is just trying to hold people's attention while they are waiting for their flight at the airport or maybe they are just throwing Hail Mary's because they are in last place.

This is we had to say. Look at this, ready? Let's put this up here. \"We are at a point with all of us where it's beyond trying to see another person's points of view. There are ways you can talk about that, but we are at the point where the things that are happening in our country are so bad, and it comes from Trump. There are so many people who have left this administration. It's a serious thing.\" Now, I mean, he's a terrific actor, Michelle, but I mean, terrible political commentary. There is not a lot of bad things that have come from this President. I mean, ISIS has been pretty much wiped off the map, the caliphate is gone. Manufacturing jobs are way up. Wages are bigger.

They justify their incitements to violence. They justify their hatred in the name of social justice, and I think it's about time that more of them like Robert de Niro drop the pretense and so we can see them for who they truly are.

But when it comes to their fellow Americans, Republicans and Trump voters, they don't have any empathy. They don't have any sympathy. They don't even want to hear. Speaking of people in Hollywood, another guy really sounded off. Now, this guy is a famous director, Joss Whedon or something like that. He did the \"Avengers.\" Listen to what he tweeted. He actually had to delete it. He says this, \"Donald Trump is killing this country. Some of it quickly, some slowly. But he spoils and destroys everything he touches. He emboldens monsters wielding guns, governmental power or just smug double speak, or Russia. My hate and sadness are exhausting. Die, Don, just quietly die.\" First of all, that's just a word salad, Michelle. I can't even make any sense of that, but \"Die, Don, die\" to punctuate it.

I have been subject to it for 25 years and so have you as you have gotten more prominent as well, Jesse. And it just is a part of being conservative that we have to accept, but what we should not accept is the double standards of social media outlets, giants like Facebook and Twitter that will discriminate against conservatives for conducting themselves civilly online while looking at other way at things like this. Even just tonight, you know, we had this fire that happened at Trump Tower and there are verified blue check mark, Twitter liberals who are gloating over this accident here at Trump Tower, even though three firefighters and one civilian were hurt. Shame on these people. You know, it tells you something about -- very important about political theory. There is something called the Overton window, right, it is the window that allows a certain amount of public discourse, and outlets like CNN that are not media, but that are dictators of what is acceptable speech will allow the worst kind of vile behavior and speech by the left and look the other way while they try and gag our speech.

The four-alarm fire broke out in a residence on the 50th floor about three hours ago. The victim is identified as a 51-year-old man. He was unconscious when firefighters arrived. Four firefighters suffered only minor injuries. No members of the First Family were present at the time of the fire. So, far no word on a cause. Meanwhile, 15 people killed and several others injured in a crash involving a bus carrying a youth hockey team in Western Canada. Officials say a semi-trailer slammed into the bus on the highway last night. There were 29 people on board at the time. Among those killed are the team's coach and captain.

Why aren't they giving the strongly requested documents un-redacted to the House Judiciary Committee? Stalling. But for what reason? Not looking good.\" Here with reaction, Florida Congressman Ron DeSantis. So, Congressman, my inclination here is the reason that they are stalling these documents is because these documents probably confirm what was outlined in the Nunes memo, which said pretty clearly that these FISA warrant applications relied almost entirely on this fake dossier from Russian sources that Hillary Clinton paid for.

    },
    {
      "speaker": "BLUMENFELD",
      "utterance": "We are talking about religious pluralism. The school year is founded on the Christian calendar. If I want to take a day off to go to -- do you even know what the holiest day is on the Jewish calendar is?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "No, tell me."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BLUMENFELD",
      "utterance": "And that's a form of Christian privilege. You don't have to know other religions of when our holidays are. It's Yom Kippur, which is the Day of Atonement. And it usually comes..."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Okay, so I have the privilege of not knowing what your most devout holiday is? That's a privilege to not know something?"
    },

      "speaker": "BLUMENFELD",
      "utterance": "Yes. You don't have to know."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "I would think that that would be the opposite. I feel bad that I don't know. I mean, you know, listen there's not a lot of Jewish Americans in the country compared to Christian Americans. I don't know the most of devout Muslim holiday either."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BLUMENFELD",
      "utterance": "Of course. And again, minoritized people have to know of the holidays of Christians for our own survival because it's just self- promoted."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Okay, let's solve this then because I don't want Christian privilege. I just want to be open and I want to know everything about every other person and I don't want to feel privileged. What can I do as a Christian to make myself feel less privileged?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BLUMENFELD",
      "utterance": "I'm not asking you to make yourself less privileged. I am asking you to share your privilege, like as a white man, I don't want to lose my white privilege. I don't want to walk into a store and be tailed, racially profiled. I am not saying I want to lose that. But I am working as a white person so that I share my privilege so that nobody is racially profiled in this country."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "WATTERS",
      "utterance": "Okay, I don't know how to share privilege. I don't know if it would be just like toss it out like that? Privilege here, privilege there. Listen, I am going to have you back on and we're going to talk about how I am going to share privilege. Professor, thank you very much. Up next, \"Last Call.\" Time for \"Last Call.\" Attention shoppers. Yodeling on aisle eight. An 11-year-old boy stunning Walmart goers in his rendition of Hank William's \"Love Sick Blues,\" listen."
