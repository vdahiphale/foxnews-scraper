We know that this is going to reduce the deficit by over a trillion dollars. So you've got a good package, in terms of substance.

BRET BAIER, \"SPECIAL REPORT\" HOST: Welcome to Washington. I'm Bret Baier, and this is a special edition of \"Special Report\", beginning tonight in the Blue Room in the White House, mid-way through what many people are calling the most pivotal week of his presidency so far. We are interviewing President Barack Obama. Mr. President, thank you for the time."
