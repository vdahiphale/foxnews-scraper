      "sentences": "All right. Welcome to “Hannity” on a busy news night. Glad you are with us tonight. As President Trump continues his international trip abroad, look at what is happening at home. America's economy has become the envy of the world. Our economy firing on all cylinders, and for the first time in 75 years, we are energy independent and a net exporter of energy.  Our unemployment rate is at its lowest point since 1969. In fact, we are now seeing record low unemployment for African-Americans, Hispanic- Americans, Asian-Americans, women in the workforce. Youth unemployment, that means kids like me when I was you out of trouble.  And the people that unfairly suffered the most under the Obama-Biden economy, they are now the single biggest beneficiaries of Donald Trump's low taxes, lessening of burdensome regulation and his America-first agenda. Without a doubt, it is an amazing time to be an American, to be looking to advance your life, your career, your standard of living.  But that is not what you'll ever hear from the mainstream media mob. Instead, we get obsessively negative coverage of the president every second, hour, of every day, conspiracy theories, insults, outright lies always lead the news cycle. And for two and half years, the media has historically and breathlessly reported lies, a hoax surrounding Trump and Russia. So, it is a no surprise that we have a brand new Pew Research Poll that shows Americans now see fake news as a bigger problem than terrorism. That is their poll. According to Pew Research Center, this country is more worried about fake news than terrorism, so-called climate change, racism, sexism, even violent crime.  This is a major political victory for President Trump. He has exposed the phony news industry for who they are for the first time in history, and an American president has successfully exposed an abusively biased, corrupt, agenda-driven press for who they really are, with two simple words -- fake news. Now, Trump has branded the men and women who are actively working as an extension of the Democratic Party all while pretending to be journalists, the branding is now permanently tattooed into these so-called news organization. And they will forever be remembered, their lies, their conspiracy theories by the American people. I don't think that they can never recover.  And while Americans are now aware of the threat that is posed by fake information, by lies, conspiracy theories, they still have the rage-filled Trump hating media mob that will never slow down. You think they will admit that they are wrong, make corrections, try and adjust, adapt, and listen to the people that they are supposed to serve? Don't count on it.   During the important trip to read Europe, well, the fake news smear machine in full gear. Get this, according to \"The Hill's\" media reporter Joe Concha, the president has received mostly glowing reviews from the British press. But here at home, a much different picture. As per usual, we have NBC's chief conspiracy theorist Rachel Maddow setting the tone for all of her colleagues -- you know, hateful, baseless coverage of the president's trip. By the way, the ratings are showing it. Take a look.",

You mentioned it before. Most of it has been not so much positive, but at least objective in terms of the president's visit. It does not concentrate on the sizzle, but the steak. It concentrates on, for instance, we're talking about British media, the president's relationship with the queen, his rapport with her.  A television is a very powerful medium, it's a visual medium, and you saw the pictures, the optics coming out of there. It was very good for the president. Almost anybody objective at least can say that. The same goes for his relationship with Theresa May in the press conference he held and so on.  But what we saw from the U.S. media besides the sound bite that you played from the opinion side, the punditry side, was the obsession with the Trump baby blimp. It was almost like watching the O.J. white Bronco in 1984 all over again. Every time you turn on cable news, it was a Michael Avenatti of blimps. You turn it on, you couldn't get away from the blimp, and that's all there was basically being concentrated on. And finally, the obsession with the protests. The protest when Donald Trump went to Britain in 2018 were infinitely bigger, considerably bigger than they were this time around.   And even today, during D-Day, the 75th anniversary that occurs tomorrow, you still had protesters on a day where give it a rest for one day, guys, given the sacrifices that have been 75 years ago in France.",

Now, we told you this would happen. We told you that Joe Biden is not the moderate savior that the media wants him to be, that he would take a hard turn to the left. That's even harder than we thought.  But the problem is, is Joe is kind of out of ideas. So Joe does what he usually does. He steals them, because his campaign remains in damage control tonight after again, apparently plagiarizing direct passages for their new economy killing climate plan, literally ripping entire paragraphs, and not giving attribution. And while the campaign is trying to downplay all of the outrage, claiming it was a series of citation errors, there is a pattern here. Remember another plagiarism scandal, it derailed Joe Biden's 1988 bid for the White House after he literally stole word for word a speech from then British Labour Party leader in Great Britain, Neil Kinnock.

Biden has no core values, no real ideas, no positions. He is in another establishment candidate dying to get the radical left wing on his side, running on a name, not ideas, repeatedly out there lying, telling false stories, changing his views, saying whatever he thinks is going to help him get elected.

And it does sound eerily similar, doesn't it? And a lot like Hillary Clinton 2.0. The only thing that he needs to do now is still the primary from Bernie and the others and then try and rob, well, a general election too and get deep state to help him.

There's no shame and there really are no standards left. So it's up to, we, the people, to take a look at the media since the media won't look at themselves. That wasn't always the case. I wrote down a few things here. Problems with most of the mass media today. Notice I don't call them the Free Press because they don't even understand what a free press is supposed to be or the history of a press because they're destroying a free press. They commingle news and opinion, pseudo events. They manufacture events. We spent three days talking about the word \"nasty.\" How preposterous? They push propaganda for the progressive ideology. AOC is famous not because she is smart, not because she is profound, not because she has accomplished anything, but because they want to promote her and her agenda. Social activism, climate change -- is there any individual at CNN or MSNBC in their newsrooms who don't push climate change? There's no diversity of intellectual thought in these newsrooms. None. They've abandoned the pursuit of objectivity for social activism, progressivism and the Democratic Party agenda and they promote that agenda day in and day out, in fact they lead it. The reason we talk about impeachment today is not because the President committed any impeachable offenses. It is because the media and the Democratic Party want to remove him. The reason we spent two and a half years talking about collusion with Russia, a manufactured story, a pseudo fake event as the President calls it not because there was any evidence, but because this is what the media was pushing day in and day out. They are not defending the right and the First Amendment of freedom of the press. What is the purpose of freedom of the press? Why is it in the First Amendment? It's not in the First Amendment because of CNN or MSNBC or their corporate ownership or any specific so-called journalist. It is in there for the American people. Now why do we have freedom of the press? We have freedom of the press to expand freedom of speech among the American people. The point of news and newsrooms is to give us the information through which we can make decisions about our families, our lives, our government our country, so we can be informed. The best place to find it right now is local TV news. You're not going to find it in the vast majority of news operations at the national level.",

These people who are reporters today, not all of them, there are some exceptions, but unfortunately the general rule, they don't understand the history of freedom of the press.

They are the praetorian guard of big government and if you're somebody from the outside and you want to challenge it, if you're somebody from the outside and you want to limit it, cut it, rearrange it, you're the enemy of the press.

This is a tragic human situation and I feel terribly for those people who are living in tents and defecating on the streets. But the fact is, that a lot of this money is going to people who are making a good living off the poverty of other people and that's how liberalism works.

      "utterance": "All right. Welcome to “Hannity” on a busy news night. Glad you are with us tonight. As President Trump continues his international trip abroad, look at what is happening at home. America's economy has become the envy of the world. Our economy firing on all cylinders, and for the first time in 75 years, we are energy independent and a net exporter of energy. Our unemployment rate is at its lowest point since 1969. In fact, we are now seeing record low unemployment for African-Americans, Hispanic- Americans, Asian-Americans, women in the workforce. Youth unemployment, that means kids like me when I was you out of trouble. And the people that unfairly suffered the most under the Obama-Biden economy, they are now the single biggest beneficiaries of Donald Trump's low taxes, lessening of burdensome regulation and his America-first agenda. Without a doubt, it is an amazing time to be an American, to be looking to advance your life, your career, your standard of living. But that is not what you'll ever hear from the mainstream media mob. Instead, we get obsessively negative coverage of the president every second, hour, of every day, conspiracy theories, insults, outright lies always lead the news cycle. And for two and half years, the media has historically and breathlessly reported lies, a hoax surrounding Trump and Russia. So, it is a no surprise that we have a brand new Pew Research Poll that shows Americans now see fake news as a bigger problem than terrorism. That is their poll. According to Pew Research Center, this country is more worried about fake news than terrorism, so-called climate change, racism, sexism, even violent crime. This is a major political victory for President Trump. He has exposed the phony news industry for who they are for the first time in history, and an American president has successfully exposed an abusively biased, corrupt, agenda-driven press for who they really are, with two simple words -- fake news. Now, Trump has branded the men and women who are actively working as an extension of the Democratic Party all while pretending to be journalists, the branding is now permanently tattooed into these so-called news organization. And they will forever be remembered, their lies, their conspiracy theories by the American people. I don't think that they can never recover. And while Americans are now aware of the threat that is posed by fake information, by lies, conspiracy theories, they still have the rage-filled Trump hating media mob that will never slow down. You think they will admit that they are wrong, make corrections, try and adjust, adapt, and listen to the people that they are supposed to serve? Don't count on it. During the important trip to read Europe, well, the fake news smear machine in full gear. Get this, according to \"The Hill's\" media reporter Joe Concha, the president has received mostly glowing reviews from the British press. But here at home, a much different picture. As per usual, we have NBC's chief conspiracy theorist Rachel Maddow setting the tone for all of her colleagues -- you know, hateful, baseless coverage of the president's trip. By the way, the ratings are showing it. Take a look."

Even according to a CNN poll, the majority of Americans believe that Trump will win reelection. And tonight, more good news for the president, in his reelection campaign. His potential challenger, the sleepy, creepy Uncle Joe Biden is facing a major plagiarism scandal yet again. I'm going to address this in part two of my monologue tonight. First, joining us with more on his analysis of America's fake news epidemic, we have \"The Hill's\" Joe Concha. Joe, great column today, great comparison today, it's all accurate. And they seem to not be able to control this rage or psychosis."

      "speaker": "JOE CONCHA, THE HILL",
      "utterance": "Yes, and in this case, though, at least, Sean, you have another media, the British media in this case, that is quite a juxtaposition of what we are seeing in terms of U.S. media. You mentioned it before. Most of it has been not so much positive, but at least objective in terms of the president's visit. It does not concentrate on the sizzle, but the steak. It concentrates on, for instance, we're talking about British media, the president's relationship with the queen, his rapport with her. A television is a very powerful medium, it's a visual medium, and you saw the pictures, the optics coming out of there. It was very good for the president. Almost anybody objective at least can say that. The same goes for his relationship with Theresa May in the press conference he held and so on. But what we saw from the U.S. media besides the sound bite that you played from the opinion side, the punditry side, was the obsession with the Trump baby blimp. It was almost like watching the O.J. white Bronco in 1984 all over again. Every time you turn on cable news, it was a Michael Avenatti of blimps. You turn it on, you couldn't get away from the blimp, and that's all there was basically being concentrated on. And finally, the obsession with the protests. The protest when Donald Trump went to Britain in 2018 were infinitely bigger, considerably bigger than they were this time around. And even today, during D-Day, the 75th anniversary that occurs tomorrow, you still had protesters on a day where give it a rest for one day, guys, given the sacrifices that have been 75 years ago in France."

And when you take him out of the picture, it is like taking J.R. Ewing off of Dallas, there is no more show. So, yes, unfortunately, if they want to return in credibility, I'm not saying all publications were news channels, but most of them --"

    },
    {
      "speaker": "CONCHA",
      "utterance": "Look, the Mueller report and what that exposed between no collusion between the Trump associates and Russia, that was a death blow to this industry. I'm not saying all of, again, but many in it. You played a clip of Rachel Maddow before. She had her lowest ratings last month and a very busy news month, lowest ratings since Trump's inauguration. A CNN, you see down double digits again last month on top of a 26 percent loss in audience the month before that. That was a watershed moment when that report and all of the promises we got from pendants and even anchors alike that there absolutely was collusion between Donald Trump and the Russians, and when that promise wasn't delivered, people have simply not come back because they don't trust the messenger anymore, Sean."

Now, we told you this would happen. We told you that Joe Biden is not the moderate savior that the media wants him to be, that he would take a hard turn to the left. That's even harder than we thought. But the problem is, is Joe is kind of out of ideas. So Joe does what he usually does. He steals them, because his campaign remains in damage control tonight after again, apparently plagiarizing direct passages for their new economy killing climate plan, literally ripping entire paragraphs, and not giving attribution. And while the campaign is trying to downplay all of the outrage, claiming it was a series of citation errors, there is a pattern here.

Oh, and remember his comments about, quote, predators on our streets when he was talking about the 1994 crime bill. This all sounds like someone in touch with the new Democratic Party? Biden has no core values, no real ideas, no positions. He is in another establishment candidate dying to get the radical left wing on his side, running on a name, not ideas, repeatedly out there lying, telling false stories, changing his views, saying whatever he thinks is going to help him get elected. So ask yourself, why is Biden doing so few events? Why is his own campaign trying to hide him? Remember, he was nowhere to be found at the end of last month. And it does sound eerily similar, doesn't it? And a lot like Hillary Clinton 2.0. The only thing that he needs to do now is still the primary from Bernie and the others and then try and rob, well, a general election too and get deep state to help him. Now, we are here to do the vetting that the anti-Trump media mob will never do. We'll do it all throughout this process, and especially as fake news CNN and others, they're out there spinning and defending his plagiarism. Great news coverage. Take a look."

One is, first of all, I suspect he -- you know, having been utterly humiliated in 1988 and his presidential hopes dashed and it took him 20 years to climb back onto the national stage and become Barack Obama's running mate. I suspect he learned the plagiarism issue. There is something even deeper here. His campaign staff obviously didn't. Nobody paid attention to, are we cribbing stuff out of other people's documents without giving it attribution? Now, maybe some of the staffers were not around, what is it now? Nearly 30 years later? But maybe they weren't around. But it says something about his campaign staff that they did not have the institutional knowledge to say, you know what, we better be very careful about this, because we have had this problem blow up in her face before. What does it take to take a document like that and put it through one of these programs that identifies plagiarized sections? They should've done that at minimum, at minimum, they should have actually had somebody sitting there saying -- hey, remember, we have a problem with our candidates credibility, let's make sure that if we are quoting from somebody, we quote it and footnote it."

What Mueller had done was actually basically put together what he wanted, redacted portions of Dowd's transcripts, portions of his conversation, the voicemail message that he left, making it appear as if Dowd was trying to obstruct justice, giving that illusion. But then when you see the complete transcript, you realize, he did not even one confidential information. This wasn't just about the president, it was about the American people. So then you have to ask yourself what happen with Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, right, and the conversation, the transcripts. The irony here is, Sean, is that the government is trying to protect these highly classified transcripts, highly classified transcripts, but it was government officials, senior government officials that leaked the information to \"The Washington Post,\" David Ignatius, in January of 2017.

There's no shame and there really are no standards left. So it's up to, we, the people, to take a look at the media since the media won't look at themselves. That wasn't always the case. I wrote down a few things here. Problems with most of the mass media today. Notice I don't call them the Free Press because they don't even understand what a free press is supposed to be or the history of a press because they're destroying a free press. They commingle news and opinion, pseudo events. They manufacture events. We spent three days talking about the word \"nasty.\" How preposterous? They push propaganda for the progressive ideology. AOC is famous not because she is smart, not because she is profound, not because she has accomplished anything, but because they want to promote her and her agenda. Social activism, climate change -- is there any individual at CNN or MSNBC in their newsrooms who don't push climate change? There's no diversity of intellectual thought in these newsrooms. None. They've abandoned the pursuit of objectivity for social activism, progressivism and the Democratic Party agenda and they promote that agenda day in and day out, in fact they lead it. The reason we talk about impeachment today is not because the President committed any impeachable offenses. It is because the media and the Democratic Party want to remove him. The reason we spent two and a half years talking about collusion with Russia, a manufactured story, a pseudo fake event as the President calls it not because there was any evidence, but because this is what the media was pushing day in and day out. They are not defending the right and the First Amendment of freedom of the press. What is the purpose of freedom of the press? Why is it in the First Amendment? It's not in the First Amendment because of CNN or MSNBC or their corporate ownership or any specific so-called journalist. It is in there for the American people. Now why do we have freedom of the press? We have freedom of the press to expand freedom of speech among the American people. The point of news and newsrooms is to give us the information through which we can make decisions about our families, our lives, our government our country, so we can be informed. The best place to find it right now is local TV news. You're not going to find it in the vast majority of news operations at the national level."

The difference is, we're transparent. We tell people who we are. We don't pretend to be something that we're not. These people who are reporters today, not all of them, there are some exceptions, but unfortunately the general rule, they don't understand the history of freedom of the press. They don't even understand the value of freedom of the press. Most of them are narcissistic. Most of them draw attention to themselves, want to draw attentions to themselves. I can go down the list -- Acosta and so forth. That's not news. That's not serving the American people. That's not freedom of the press. So the point I want to make to you is this, the President of the United States is their target right now, but overall it's the American people. The difference between the Patriot Press was, they wanted to fundamentally transform government. The press today wants to fundamentally protect it. They are the praetorian guard of big government and if you're somebody from the outside and you want to challenge it, if you're somebody from the outside and you want to limit it, cut it, rearrange it, you're the enemy of the press. They like to talk about the President saying that they're the enemy of the people, but the press has its own enemies. Today, the press wants to fundamentally transform not government, but the American citizen, but the civil society. That's the difference between the Patriot Press and the press today.

      "utterance": "Because she's raising money, lots of it, but it's for the re- election of Democrats and more liberals to be in Congress so they could even put more money on these things. It's an absolute disgrace. The situation there looks worse than it would in communities in Afghanistan and it's the result of when far-left people control the government. This is what we can expect. It's a disaster."

      "utterance": "And also breaking tonight, we have an update on the Jussie Smollett hate crime hoax. The 911 call from the night of the event has been released. Trace Gallagher live from our West Coast newsroom, he has the latest on this development -- Trace."

      "speaker": "TRACE GALLAGHER, CORRESPONDENT",
      "utterance": "Yes, Sean. It appears Jussie Smollett did not want to call the police after he was allegedly attacked. In fact, his creative manager, Frank Gatson finally made the call 22 minutes after the incident and the manager refused to identify Smollett saying only that he was an artist. And when the dispatcher asked why the artist didn't call himself, Frank Gatson said quote, \"He was cool. He didn't want me to call you guys,\" and then Gatson said this, listen."

      "utterance": "They put a noose around his neck. They didn't do anything, but they put it around his neck. That's really [bleep] up to me. Sorry for saying it like that."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "GALLAGHER",
      "utterance": "Then 16 minutes after the first call, Gatson called again to complain that police still had not shown up. He went on to say that he wanted his friend taken care of because he had just been mugged. Police pulled up right as Gatson was ending that second call and of course, Smollett's story of being attacked fell apart when a pair of Nigerian brothers told police Smollett paid them to stage the attack. We should get redacted police videos of the interviews including interviews potentially with the Osundairo brothers, sometime later this week -- Sean."

      "utterance": "Wow. Pretty amazing, and of course, they are on tape buying the things that were used in that incident. Trace Gallagher, thank you. All right, remember we will never be the rage, hate, destroy-Trump media mob. We will always be fair and balanced. Thank you for being with us. Let not your heart be troubled, Laura Ingraham is next.
