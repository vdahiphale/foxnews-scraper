Remember, we have big special counsel ginned up, and the claim was that we had to do this, we had to send wiretaps against a Trump campaign. We had to send human informants against them. We had to break every norm in the book because we really legitimately thought there was collusion with Russia.   If at the end of the day come there is nothing there, the idea that you are going to be able to manage this political process, as Sahil notes, it is a political process, it's a political determination whether you have impeachment. You have a bunch of people in Congress who have signed nondisclosure agreements using taxpayer money who would have to make that case, and a bunch of media organizations that have also signed a bunch of nondisclosure agreements as part of their settlements.

Now, I think what is giving some people pause about this job is that you are essentially going to be a facilitator for a mercurial president who is highly resistant to structures and who is not prone to being controlled by other people. You think of the previous chiefs of staff in other administrations, they had a lot of power. They set up structures that everyone, including the president on some level followed. The other thing is there have been people who have worked for this president who have emerged diminished from that job. Think about Reince Priebus, the former chief of staff, someone like Rex Tillerson, the secretary of state. Jeff Sessions, the outgoing attorney general had a sterling reputation with conservatives.

      "utterance": "It is really amazing that people thought that maybe James Comey had a political bias that affected his investigations, and then you see some coming and saying these completely extreme things. It's also a reminder that we haven't seen a lot of accountability. Remember, we have big special counsel ginned up, and the claim was that we had to do this, we had to send wiretaps against a Trump campaign. We had to send human informants against them. We had to break every norm in the book because we really legitimately thought there was collusion with Russia. If at the end of the day come there is nothing there, the idea that you are going to be able to manage this political process, as Sahil notes, it is a political process, it's a political determination whether you have impeachment. You have a bunch of people in Congress who have signed nondisclosure agreements using taxpayer money who would have to make that case, and a bunch of media organizations that have also signed a bunch of nondisclosure agreements as part of their settlements. So those are the two groups that would have to make that political case, and I don't think they're very well-positioned to do that."

But what the Democrats and a couple of Republicans, namely Susan Collins and Jeff Flake, by the way, Flake is retiring, they want to at least send a message that if the president does take some rash action to remove Mueller, that they will not have his back."

Chris, what if it does come down -- and we always play the what-if game with what we don't know, but what if it does come down to this campaign finance violation and obstruction of justice for the issue on Russia that they are obstructing something that doesn't deliver on the Russia collusion part and it's the campaign finance violation?"

Even if it is salacious, it's not going to be over a campaign finance violation. And it's also not going to be about -- if there was nothing to obstruct, right, if there was no crime, if there's nothing underneath, they are not going to impeach him on a technicality."

But again, we have not had anybody in Congress actually trying to hold people accountable for some of these actions they took that I think a lot of the American people have trouble with. So rather than talking about protecting the Special Counsel, I think a lot of people are wondering, is anyone going to be held responsible for those criminal leaks that ginned up this idea of Russia collusion? If there is no there there, it's a huge problem."

      "utterance": "I've had no conversations in the last 48 hours with the White House. I think this time, anytime that you answer a question without actually hearing the proposal, it would be foolish. It's like answering a question before it's asked. And so at this particular point, I am looking forward to having conversations with the president if he so chooses."

The president has a long list of qualified candidates and I know he'll make the best selection for his administration and for the country.\" Those possible contenders include Meadows, we've heard the treasury secretary is not interested, the OMB director is not interested, Robert Lighthizer, the U.S. trade representative, Acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker, and then you have David Bossie, not on this list, Chris Christie as well being talked about possibly, Sahil."

      "speaker": "KAPUR",
      "utterance": "Right. And with Meadows, I think what's interesting is that one way or another, whether he stays in the House and serves in the minority or whether he is in the White House and takes the job of chief of staff if he is offered, he is going to be one of President Trump's most prominent defenders over the next two years. Now, I think what is giving some people pause about this job is that you are essentially going to be a facilitator for a mercurial president who is highly resistant to structures and who is not prone to being controlled by other people. You think of the previous chiefs of staff in other administrations, they had a lot of power. They set up structures that everyone, including the president on some level followed. The other thing is there have been people who have worked for this president who have emerged diminished from that job. Think about Reince Priebus, the former chief of staff, someone like Rex Tillerson, the secretary of state. Jeff Sessions, the outgoing attorney general had a sterling reputation with conservatives. These are the kinds of things that I think any potential candidate will be thinking about."

He has a secretary, he has a personal secretary who he can use to reach out to people. The White House switchboard can find anybody anywhere in the world whenever he needs to talk to them. This is a guy who handles his own book. He doesn't like to be controlled. Short of his own daughter, I cannot imagine anyone who could do this job in the way that it is traditionally done."
