They have very different reactions to COVID mandates and restrictions and very different policies going forward as to how we deal with that, not only in New York City, if Mr. Sliva gets his way, but nationally if the good doctor has his way. Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto. And this is \"Your World,\" and a busy \"Your World\" at that, amid the push to address spikes and COVID cases all around the country, but growing divisiveness about how we respond to that, and the vaccine mandate debate itself, and how far you can go urging businesses and restaurants to police the issue, to make sure that you have been vaccinated, to make sure you're wearing the mask. They don't want anything to do with that. To Edward Lawrence right now at the White House on how far they're going to push it at the federal level -- Edward.",

So Amazon's latest and the last of America's big tech giants to delay the return to the office for corporate staff, at least. And, as you mentioned, not just by month, but we're talking about for the rest of this year, and that's longer than Apple Alphabet, Microsoft, and Facebook, which are all still targeting a return to work sometime this fall. And it's not just technology. If you look at finance, media and insurance companies also all delaying or mostly delaying their office return. So, BlackRock, the world's biggest money manager, just announcing today that employees will get an extra month to work at home. So they're delaying until October. Same for Wells Fargo, as you mentioned. Then you have Viacom, CBS, Travelers, the insurance group, delaying a return until October, and other companies like job sites Indeed, Roblox, Lyft, Overstock. And they're just kind of like Amazon, pushing out the return to early next year. And Airbnb already said September 2022. So there's also a growing list of companies that will require their workers to get vaccinated before they come back in. So, this week, we had Microsoft saying that all workers and vendors need to be vaccinated before the entered the facilities. Walmart says the corporate staff have until October to get their shots. Disney giving non-hourly staff 60 days to get vaccinated, and all Tyson staff have until November to get their shots. So they're incentivizing as well. Some companies are paying out bonuses or giving time paid or paid time off in order to get those jabs. And that includes Walmart paying $150. You have Kroger's giving out 100 bucks. Tyson is $200 there. And you get paid time off from McDonald's and American Airlines. And, Neil, just today you have Vanguard offering $1,000 to staff if they get vaccinated. Now, even when workers do come back, it's mostly going to be a hybrid work model, meaning a few days in, a few days out. And as you can imagine, the world of work, Neil, is changing rapidly.",

Again, they seem to be sector by sector, group of companies by group of companies, pushing this back a little bit, until we get over this spike situation that's gripping the country right now.

So, of course, if you want to try to keep your employees safe, this may not be a moment to begin to make a change about bringing people back to work, if they can still safely telecommute, which a lot of people have been doing. So, yes, everybody's kind of looking at this with deep concern. The good news is, again, the vaccines work against this spike.

At the present time, in the United States, there is not a reason for people to begin to think about needing a booster.

So, if you're already in that state of having gotten your vaccine -- vaccinations, you're fully covered. But we are watching that, because, of course, the concern is that the level of protection may start to wane over time. In Israel, they are already expressing concern about that and beginning to offer boosters to older people. Our data in the U.S. does not yet require that. But, believe me, people are looking at that, the FDA, the CDC, the NIH. And if the time comes where it's indicated, we will be sure we're ready for it. But, right now, we're in good shape, as long as you're vaccinated. The big push is for the people who haven't yet rolled up their sleeve.

Most vaccines aren't able to do that. We have just been looking really hard in this situation. And notice that the people who have had breakthrough cases, like Senator Graham, have had mild illness almost entirely. If they hadn't been vaccinated, they might be in much worse shape. So, it's still -- although it sounds scary, calling it a breakthrough, a breakthrough in that situation is another indication of how critical the vaccine has been to save those people from the ICU or the morgue.

And it turns out, actually, the virus can get to pretty high levels, if it's Delta, because it's really good. You may not even know that you have it at that point. But you could be at that point spreading it to others who are unprotected, like kids under 12, or like immunocompromised people, or like other unvaccinated. So, stand back from that statement, and then say, OK, let's put 100 people in an indoor space where they're kind of crowded together. If you don't have everybody with a mask on, then the chances that trouble is going to happen goes up, because even those vaccinated people might be the ones in that room who, unknown to them, are spreading the virus to those who could get very sick.

The only thing really it can do is really raise interest rates. And that would not be welcomed to a lot of folks. But let's get the fallout from all of this with my friend Bob Cusack, The Hill editor in chief, an uncanny read of these developments. This inflation thing is sticking. And I think we had sort of telegraphed that a few months ago, when all of it was starting to percolate, and it is sticking around. And to your point, that's what inflation tends to do. It's rarely transitory. But the fact that now you have a prominent Democratic senator saying, do something about it, that shows some urgency. What do you think?",

And then, after this bipartisan bill, then there could be another bill that cost trillions of dollars. We don't know how much it's going to be paid for.

So Amazon's latest and the last of America's big tech giants to delay the return to the office for corporate staff, at least. And, as you mentioned, not just by month, but we're talking about for the rest of this year, and that's longer than Apple Alphabet, Microsoft, and Facebook, which are all still targeting a return to work sometime this fall. And it's not just technology. If you look at finance, media and insurance companies also all delaying or mostly delaying their office return. So, BlackRock, the world's biggest money manager, just announcing today that employees will get an extra month to work at home. So they're delaying until October. Same for Wells Fargo, as you mentioned. Then you have Viacom, CBS, Travelers, the insurance group, delaying a return until October, and other companies like job sites Indeed, Roblox, Lyft, Overstock. And they're just kind of like Amazon, pushing out the return to early next year. And Airbnb already said September 2022. So there's also a growing list of companies that will require their workers to get vaccinated before they come back in. So, this week, we had Microsoft saying that all workers and vendors need to be vaccinated before the entered the facilities. Walmart says the corporate staff have until October to get their shots. Disney giving non-hourly staff 60 days to get vaccinated, and all Tyson staff have until November to get their shots. So they're incentivizing as well. Some companies are paying out bonuses or giving time paid or paid time off in order to get those jabs. And that includes Walmart paying $150. You have Kroger's giving out 100 bucks. Tyson is $200 there. And you get paid time off from McDonald's and American Airlines. And, Neil, just today you have Vanguard offering $1,000 to staff if they get vaccinated. Now, even when workers do come back, it's mostly going to be a hybrid work model, meaning a few days in, a few days out. And as you can imagine, the world of work, Neil, is changing rapidly."

In New York, it's the mayor recommending it. In New York, also, a guy who wants to be the next mayor is condemning it, saying it's one thing for companies to do this of their own volition, but not necessarily being strong-armed by any politician. We will get the read from him and from Dr. Francis Collins, the NIH director. The only thing the good doctor wants is for you to be safe. But how far do you go pushing that? After this."

Again, they seem to be sector by sector, group of companies by group of companies, pushing this back a little bit, until we get over this spike situation that's gripping the country right now. To address that, Dr. Francis Collins, the director of the NIH. Doctor, very good to have you back with us. Do you think these companies are wise to be pushing back the in person return?"

    {
      "speaker": "DR. FRANCIS COLLINS, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH",

We will now probably in the next day or so have the seven-day average go above 100,000 cases a day, which we haven't seen since several months have gone by, back in February maybe. So, of course, if you want to try to keep your employees safe, this may not be a moment to begin to make a change about bringing people back to work, if they can still safely telecommute, which a lot of people have been doing. So, yes, everybody's kind of looking at this with deep concern. The good news is, again, the vaccines work against this spike. So, the best thing these companies could be doing and all of us could be doing is to try to get that sort of last 90 million folks who haven't yet gotten immunized to decide, this is the moment..."

If you're unvaccinated right now, this virus, which is much more contagious than its predecessors, and maybe even more likely to be severe, although that's not absolutely clear, it's looking for you. This is now a pandemic of those 93 million unvaccinated people. They can still protect themselves, but time is getting short here, with this being so rapidly contagious. Look at what's happening across Missouri, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida. And now you can see this also in Kentucky and Tennessee. This is occupying a lot of our country. And that's just the place where the vaccination rates are down in the sort of 30 to 35 to 40 percent, which makes a lot of people vulnerable."

The World Health Organization has recommended against that, trying to save such shots for those who have not yet been vaccinated. Where are you on this?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "COLLINS",
      "utterance": "Well, I'm a scientist and a physician, and looking at this data almost daily. At the present time, in the United States, there is not a reason for people to begin to think about needing a booster. The vaccines, the Moderna, the Pfizer, the J&J, do provide very good protection against severe illness from Delta. So, if you're already in that state of having gotten your vaccine -- vaccinations, you're fully covered. But we are watching that, because, of course, the concern is that the level of protection may start to wane over time. In Israel, they are already expressing concern about that and beginning to offer boosters to older people. Our data in the U.S. does not yet require that. But, believe me, people are looking at that, the FDA, the CDC, the NIH. And if the time comes where it's indicated, we will be sure we're ready for it. But, right now, we're in good shape, as long as you're vaccinated. The big push is for the people who haven't yet rolled up their sleeve. And they're the ones at risk that we hope are beginning to get the sense that it's time to get off the fence and take care of yourself."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "You know, a lot of those unvaccinated, Doctor, take a look at those who have been vaccinated who are contracting the virus. Senator Lindsey Graham comes to mind. There are many others. And I know Senator Graham has said that, if did not have the vaccine, he would be in a lot worse shape. I'm paraphrasing here. But what do you make of that? It's still a small percentage of cases. But no doubt a lot of the unvaccinated are saying, well, this is yet another reason for me not to get vaccinated. I'm still at risk of getting it."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "COLLINS",
      "utterance": "I'm glad you're bringing it up, Neil, because I do think this has confused people. We're not surprised, any of us who have worked on these vaccines for a year-and-a-half, that they would not necessarily completely protect you against a mild case of the sniffles. Most vaccines aren't able to do that. We have just been looking really hard in this situation. And notice that the people who have had breakthrough cases, like Senator Graham, have had mild illness almost entirely. If they hadn't been vaccinated, they might be in much worse shape. So, it's still -- although it sounds scary, calling it a breakthrough, a breakthrough in that situation is another indication of how critical the vaccine has been to save those people from the ICU or the morgue. So, again, look at that data, pay attention to it, but don't use that in any way as an indication that the vaccines aren't working or that you don't want to have one for yourself and your family."

It says that people who are vaccinated, like I am, are still capable of getting the virus in their nose. And it turns out, actually, the virus can get to pretty high levels, if it's Delta, because it's really good. You may not even know that you have it at that point. But you could be at that point spreading it to others who are unprotected, like kids under 12, or like immunocompromised people, or like other unvaccinated. So, stand back from that statement, and then say, OK, let's put 100 people in an indoor space where they're kind of crowded together. If you don't have everybody with a mask on, then the chances that trouble is going to happen goes up, because even those vaccinated people might be the ones in that room who, unknown to them, are spreading the virus to those who could get very sick.

It seems like now the right thing to do. And I know people are sick of this. And I know they wonder, hey, what happened here, and is this just another flip-flop? No. It's we have new data.

But, in following it, it changes the script almost daily, now concerns -- and Dr. Fauci has raised this -- about variations of this Delta virus that could be even worse and Lambda and all these others that could be even worse. And did any of this even come up in initial discussions with President Trump or now with President Biden that there is a possibility this could veer this way or this way? You know what I'm saying?

Basically, what happens, every time the virus gets into somebody's system, it has a chance of making a mistake when it's copying its instruction book. And that's a mutation. And even though this is a virus that's not particularly prone to do that -- it's not like influenza, which is changing its code all the time, or like HIV -- it still does it at a certain level."

And just yesterday, after the announcement by de Blasio, by the way, because he can't deal with the shots that really count in New York City, all of the shots being fired at people and tourists, the lead poisoning you get, not the vaccines, the international auto show decided it was going to cancel its dates in the Jacob Javits Convention Center, which would have sent a signal to everyone, we're back. There's not enough cars, as you have reported, both used cars and new cars. This would have stimulated a lot of tourism and a lot of travel. And now the vendors are not coming. The tourists are not coming. And, as your report mentioned, Amazon putting off opening up its offices until January, others pushing back to October. This will be economically devastating to the city. But it's par for the course for de Blasio, who has taken a Miley Cyrus wrecking ball to the city that we love and destroyed it in so many ways, economically, in terms of crime, quality of life.

And, Neil, there is something even a little more devious than everything that's been announced so far. De Blasio said enforcement would begin of this edict on September 13. The NYPD rightfully said, don't expect us to enforce it. Who's going to enforce it? And if you notice, it's right at the time that my three sons and everyone else in the public school system finally were promised that there would be in-classroom training. And, already, we have seen Randi Weingarten with the national teachers union say, well, maybe not, the UFT, which represents the teachers in New York City, vacillating. I have a feeling this may prevent our children from going back to school. Even President Joe Biden sternly pointed his finger at the camera and said, we have pumped millions of dollars into your public schools throughout America. You have got to get the kids back in the classroom. And I think there's a lot of vacillating here.

All these mayors and governors -- and thank God our Governor Cuomo, who actually abused the executive orders the most, has been rendered impotent by the problems that he has created for himself as to whether he can continue on or not. But Bill de Blasio is starting to sign all these executive orders. Again, they're drunk with power. And I say, where is the evidence? Seventy percent of us are already vaccinated in New York City. The most vulnerable group, those who are 65-plus, 77 are vaccinated. Young people are not at that level. Black and Hispanics are not at that level. Conservatives are not at that level. So, do we stop everything because everyone is not at the herd immunity level? We're getting there very quickly. But we're destroying our economy. And, what, are we going to keep pumping stimulus dollars, keep spending money for those who are not working or getting unemployment? This is -- this is just crushing New York City, which was the city that had never slept 24/7, the economic engine of the world, the epicenter of capitalism. And think about it, Neil. If you were a socialist or you believed in some of the socialist principles, this is putting us on the road to socialism, where it's total government control from the cradle to the grave, in which you have no choice.

I have also coupled this with Chris Cuomo and said, Chris, now is the time you have to speak out to defend the honor of your father, who is no longer with us, and your mother, thankfully, Matilda, who is alive and well at 89.

He will not have to spend a nickel, dime or penny of the $5.5 million that he made on that book to talk about how to handle a crisis in the midst of a pandemic? We are going to be held responsible for all the costs, because the governor has qualified immunity. And yet he's the leader of the pack to strip it from police, who could now be personally sued as a result of actions that they take on our behalf.

I know it's a mug's game here and is hard to quantify, but if you saw the FDA give its stamp of approval, let's say, to the Pfizer vaccine, do you think that will make a material difference in the unvaccinated getting vaccinated?"

There have been very large clinical trials and now data on millions of people who have taken the Pfizer vaccine. So, we have a really good idea about its safety and effectiveness. But this is a process for dotting the I's, crossing the T's, seeing how stable, say, storing a vaccine in a freezer is for many, many months. So, not really emergency questions, but it is very thorough. And so I think that will help. It'll help both individuals who have some hesitancy now, and it may make a difference for some businesses that are trying to take steps to reopen safely and protect their customers."

It might shock you, Doctor, that I like to go to restaurants. But, having said that, it does seem annoying. And I think a lot of vaccinated folks out there are saying, we have done everything we're supposed to do and we're being herded with the same group that doesn't. We're not treated any differently."

So there are a lot of individuals, and mainly people who are unvaccinated, who are transmitting the virus. They're also getting hospitalized. You are seeing like big increases in hospitalizations, including among young, healthy people, even deaths among children who are unvaccinated, because of this increased spread right now. Neil, hopefully this big Delta surge is going to come back down and make it easier for all of us to get the masks off and be able to do the things we like to do.

You don't have to be exposed for as long. There's more virus in the air from people who have an active infection. So it's going to be a big number. But the vaccines we have are really effective. And the best way to prevent further infections and to prevent even worse variants from emerging is to get the vaccination rates up. So I think, Neil, we may not ever fully get rid of COVID. But with high vaccination rates, and not many people can transmit it, it means you may see a few outbreaks. With people who are vaccinated, if they have symptoms at all, they're much more likely to just have flu-like symptoms. It's much, much easier to deal with."

I have got an interesting item in our newsroom right now concerning Joe Manchin now urging the Federal Reserve to address this inflation threat, saying, don't overheat our economy. Now, keep in mind, the only thing the Federal Reserve can do to address that is to raise interest rates. Senator Manchin is saying, essentially, then do that -- after this."

The only thing really it can do is really raise interest rates. And that would not be welcomed to a lot of folks. But let's get the fallout from all of this with my friend Bob Cusack, The Hill editor in chief, an uncanny read of these developments. This inflation thing is sticking. And I think we had sort of telegraphed that a few months ago, when all of it was starting to percolate, and it is sticking around. And to your point, that's what inflation tends to do. It's rarely transitory. But the fact that now you have a prominent Democratic senator saying, do something about it, that shows some urgency. What do you think?"

His numbers have taken a hit. We're seeing COVID cases rise. And, Neil, I mean, this bipartisan bill is not fully paid for that Joe Manchin supports. So that's not going to help inflation. A lot of people think the Fed is being too defensive on the need to address it. And, of course, the markets are watching. And then, after this bipartisan bill, then there could be another bill that cost trillions of dollars. We don't know how much it's going to be paid for.

I want to see if I'm going to be reappointed. And if he were to start raising rates or even been talking of doing so right now, that might explode that. But what do you think of the pressures on him right now?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CUSACK",
      "utterance": "Oh, I think there's enormous pressure. The left is not very fond of Powell, but he has the support of centrist Democrats and a lot of Republicans. And I think he's probably going to be reappointed. But a lot of it depends on what happens between now and early next year, when his term expires. So, yes, he's got a lot of pressures. And I think, if he did raise rates now, the White House would not look kindly on that."

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "You know, in this big infrastructure back-and-forth between Democrats and Republicans, there's talk that Joe Biden might be open to something akin to a mileage tax, to something that would be, to hear almost any economist put it, would be a very regressive tax, because it would go at the very people the president has promised he wouldn't go after or raise taxes. What do you think of this?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CUSACK",
      "utterance": "Well, it's interesting. The bill, the bipartisan bill, has a pilot project on this that would raise taxes. It's a pilot project, so it's not going to be implemented."
    },

      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "Right."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CUSACK",
      "utterance": "But, Neil, you know with the Highway Trust Fund. I mean, we're moving towards electrical vehicles. So, the Highway Trust Fund is funded by the gas tax, and we're going to be using less gas in future years. This is a huge problem for policy-makers, where they have got to make -- they got to find money to support fixing highways."

      "utterance": "Exactly."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CAVUTO",
      "utterance": "But that is going to be a comeuppance for him, though, because people said, you said you wouldn't raise taxes on people earning less than 400 grand. That changes things."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CUSACK",
      "utterance": "That would violate his pledge. And that's why the White House has pushed back."
