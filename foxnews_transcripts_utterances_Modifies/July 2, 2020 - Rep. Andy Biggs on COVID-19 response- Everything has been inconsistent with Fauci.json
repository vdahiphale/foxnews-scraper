We have had -- we have the highest number, perhaps, on a per capita basis of new cases. Those are mostly coming in the age 20-to-44 bracket. We also have had over the last three weeks a reduction in the rate of hospitalizations by 50 percent -- excuse me -- almost 100 percent, from 11.5 percent down to 5.6 percent today. If you also take a look at the fatality, case fatality rate, we have moved from over 4 percent just about 30 days ago now to right at 2.2 percent. We have seen that transpire. If you take a look at the 5,300 people that have been discharged from hospitals in the last 30 days, and you look in the last eight days, Neil, what you would see is, every day, we have had an increase in the number of discharges. We have actually had a reduction in the last two days in the ICU bed usage. If you take a look at the ICU bed usage, you will see that..."

All I’m saying to you is, you are now recommending that the president get rid of his health care commission, his coronavirus commission, because you don’t like what either Dr. Birx is saying or you don’t like what Dr. Fauci is saying. They have no political agenda, last time I thought. They’re worried doctors, and they think that people can get a little cavalier. I don’t think that means they’re anti-the president’s agenda. They’re pro-keeping people alive agenda, right?"

I think that Birx and Fauci have gone well past their -- their -- they have -- they have expired, that their time of usefulness has expired. What they do is, when the president comes out and makes a policy, because he is the president and he is the policy-maker, when they come out, and they make these statements that they make, they engender panic and hysteria and undermine what the president’s doing. That’s what I think is critical. And get back to the ICU bed usage and the..."
