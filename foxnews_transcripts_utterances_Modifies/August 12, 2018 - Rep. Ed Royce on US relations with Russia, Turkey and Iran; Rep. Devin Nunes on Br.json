The president praising Mexico, but telling Canada to wait, as negotiations for a new NAFTA deal intensify.  And House Republicans make a move to get more information about that salacious, but unsubstantiated Steele dossier.  Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. Welcome to \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" Russia is upping the ante this morning in a showdown with the United States, after Washington punishes the Kremlin for coordinating a nerve agent attack on British soil.  House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce on what Vladimir Putin has in store now and how the U.S. should respond. Should President Trump declassify more of the Justice Department and FBI documents? House Republicans are looking for? The president signaling and we may have to -- quote -- \"get involved.\"  House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes here. He sure hopes he does. He will join me live this morning, as well as former Attorney General Michael Mukasey, as we pose the question, what's the downside risk of declassifying?   And will we see NAFTA 2.0? New negotiations intensify, as Mexico gets a thumbs up from the president. But Canada? Not so much. All that and a lot more right now, as we look ahead on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" The Trump administration announcing new sanctions against Russia over the use of a military-grade nerve agents on U.K. soil.   And new information this morning: Moscow is upping the anti -- ante in the response. Moscow says it will cut holdings of U.S. securities. Let's bring in California Congressman Ed Royce, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Mr. Chairman, good to see you this morning. Thanks so much for being here.",

The British have films that show the Russian perpetrators. And so, with that evidence and with these new sanctions, on top of the sanctions we have already placed on Russia because of their ongoing efforts around the world, not only to engage in undermining democracy, including here in the United States, but also their actions in Syria, now, this -- this represents considerable leverage right now on Putin.  We are sending the message to Putin, the administration is sending the message, you will pay a steep price for your continued intervention in our elections and for your other actions, such as this attack on British soil.",

So, today, went out there. Now, after 10 years, it's amazing what's happened. The area has basically didn't depopulated. You have the Russians building small bases across this Northern Georgia region. Just a -- just a pure sign of aggression. And it was probably a mistake on behalf of the West. We should have been -- we should have acted swiftly at that time. And we didn't. But the Georgians did. One of the things that they realized after that happened, you know, they couldn't -- they are a country of four million people. They couldn't take on the Russian bear. So what they did is, they were totally reliant on Russian gas. What they did is, they worked with their neighbors in Azerbaijan to bring gas from the Caspian Sea. Well, now there's a push to get -- to move that gas, not just through the Black Sea, but actually build a pipeline all the way through Turkey and Greece and Italy. One of the challenges that we're having is the Russian propaganda machine is actually working in Italy. The last holdup right now is to bring the pipeline ashore in Italy.

A lot of this information wasn't shared with the FISA court, especially the fact that Christopher Steele was desperate that Donald Trump not become president. After that happened, Bruce Ohr, one of the top lawyers in the Department of Justice, kept continually meeting and providing information from Christopher Steele to who? The FBI. This is just madness. The American people need to know it. And I will tell you, like I said in the last segment, the fact that the media is ignoring this is even more of a reason that we're going to have to have more information than usual declassified. We're going to have to have, I think, an unprecedented amount of information declassified because the media is just not covering this topic. And I'll just kind of close it with this. Don't forget that Bruce Ohr's wife, Nellie Ohr, who also will have to be interviewed soon, she also was working for Fusion GPS, working for the Clinton campaign. So here you have information flowing from the Clinton campaign from the Russians, likely, likely, I believe was handed directly from Russian propaganda arms to the Clinton campaign, fed into the top levels of the FBI and Department of Justice to open up a counter-intelligence investigation into a political campaign that has now polluted nearly every top official at the DoJ and FBI over the course of the last couple years.

And when people say that that's a risk, I think we have to sit up and pay attention. On the other hand, there's a lot here that really begs for disclosure, particularly when you consider that the FISA warrant that the Department of Justice obtained on Carter Page, because he was a U.S. citizen, they had to show not only that there was probable cause to think that he was an agent of a foreign power, i.e. Russia, but also probable cause to believe that he was involved in the commission of a crime. Oddly, Carter Page is one person who hasn't been accused of a crime, hasn't been prosecuted for a crime, hasn't been arrested for a crime. And yet that was the basis for getting the FISA warrant. So you start to suspect that the information underlying that warrant was really questionable. Add to that the fact that Steele, who was mentioned by the chairman, was avid in his opposition to now-President Trump. And he was the source of a lot of this information. But he was not the initial source. He was simply the secondary source. They relied on his credibility in a prior case and yet, he was passing on secondary information. They then said that he had been fired, had been excluded from any further involvement because he violated Justice Department policy on talking to the press. What they didn't tell the FISA court is he also lied about whether he had spoken to the press, which is far more important than simply violating policy. In addition, as the chairman pointed out, he then continued to be a source, which they didn't disclose, to the FISA court, through Bruce Ohr.",

And at the same time as the administration makes its case -- and they were right to move forward on these sanctions -- they're pointing out that the Russians in this case were caught red-handed. The British have films that show the Russian perpetrators. And so, with that evidence and with these new sanctions, on top of the sanctions we have already placed on Russia because of their ongoing efforts around the world, not only to engage in undermining democracy, including here in the United States, but also their actions in Syria, now, this -- this represents considerable leverage right now on Putin. We are sending the message to Putin, the administration is sending the message, you will pay a steep price for your continued intervention in our elections and for your other actions, such as this attack on British soil."

This needs to be addressed. And one of the things we were trying to do was to get the other partners in the agreement -- and I think we were -- the British and the French were being helpful.

Now if we were able to with our most immediate trading partners, which is really important to my home state, Arizona, an agreement with Mexico -- but if you started to bring the world together, saying we're lowering barriers, we're protecting our intellectual property, now the world needs to deal with China, who is the bad actor on the world stage."

But it looks like we're actually making progress with our European allies, now hopefully with Mexico, and hopefully Canada will come in and being an honest negotiator. But if we can accomplish this, if we can sort of bring the world together to deal with the overcapacity, the stealing, the other things that China is the great sinner of, I think you need a world vs. China to actually make everyone, shall we say, operate fair in a world trade system."

    {
      "speaker": "NUNES",
      "utterance": "Well, thank you, Maria. And today is actually the 10th anniversary of Russia's real first aggression since the Cold War. It was 10 years ago today that there was a cease-fire, after five days of fighting, when the Russians actually invaded, occupied part of Northern Georgia. It's called the South Ossetia region. So, today, went out there. Now, after 10 years, it's amazing what's happened. The area has basically didn't depopulated. You have the Russians building small bases across this Northern Georgia region. Just a -- just a pure sign of aggression. And it was probably a mistake on behalf of the West. We should have been -- we should have acted swiftly at that time. And we didn't. But the Georgians did. One of the things that they realized after that happened, you know, they couldn't -- they are a country of four million people. They couldn't take on the Russian bear. So what they did is, they were totally reliant on Russian gas. What they did is, they worked with their neighbors in Azerbaijan to bring gas from the Caspian Sea. Well, now there's a push to get -- to move that gas, not just through the Black Sea, but actually build a pipeline all the way through Turkey and Greece and Italy. One of the challenges that we're having is the Russian propaganda machine is actually working in Italy. The last holdup right now is to bring the pipeline ashore in Italy. And, believe it or not, you have Russia propaganda working in Italy. The Italians haven't been able to sign off..."

If we can begin to move more gas, LNG, to Western Europe, and if you could move gas along the southern route, this Trans-Caspian gas line into Italy, you now have two solid sources of gas into Europe, which then I think really puts the pressure on Germany to not be solely reliant on Russian gas and continue to feed money into the Russian bear."

    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Are there any other potential additional alternatives, say, from Africa, to Europe? I mean, I understand the big picture, what you're trying to do. And we see the pipeline transfer on this map, but any other alternatives that you feel you would need?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "NUNES",
      "utterance": "Well, those -- those would be -- those are two big ones that are both reliable and both could be done in a short amount of time. There are other potential opportunities, but they become more complicated because, as you know, North -- North Africa is a complicated place, not all that safe. So it's a little more -- a little more challenging. I would like to just reiterate, though, that this propaganda arm and how they're blocking the Italians from -- or they're essentially using propaganda. The Italians themselves are stopping themselves from permitting this pipeline. It's very similar to the reports that we have seen out of the United States. People forget this. But everybody's worried about Russia-gate and what Russia did in the election, but people forget the reports that are out there of the Russians involving themselves in some of these extreme environmental groups that have actually stopped oil drilling and gas drilling in the United States. That's all part of this effort on behalf of Russia to promote these kind of fake green policies, so that they could be the world's -- one of the world's largest suppliers of gas."

Let me switch gears and ask you about the latest on your investigation into the State Department and what has taken place in the FBI and the DOJ.

I think it all gets back to the big picture here, which is there -- there clearly was shenanigans going on in this, in how you open up a counterintelligence investigation into a political campaign with no intelligence. It looks completely abnormal, to say the least. You've got -- we've seen these -- these documents and we want them released to the public. Because we -- the public needs to understand that -- and make a decision whether or not we're going to continue to operate and abuse (ph) our counterintelligence capabilities to target political campaigns.

      "utterance": "Welcome back. We're back with the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Devin Nunes is in the country of Georgia this weekend. He's joining us on the telephone. And, Mr. Chairman, you were just talking about Bruce Ohr. And I want to get right to that because he becomes the central figure now in this investigation. Your colleagues over on the Judiciary Committee have now subpoenaed him and we have a date. He's going to testify in front of Judiciary on August 28th. Why is he so central to this story?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "NUNES",
      "utterance": "Well, because what has come out now, Maria, is that he has been the go-between Christopher Steele. So once Christopher Steele was terminated as a source for doing all things like talking to the media, at the behest the Glenn Simpson, so remember, he was working for Glenn Simpson, Fusion GPS, who were working for the Clinton campaign, Christopher Steele was fired. A lot of this information wasn't shared with the FISA court, especially the fact that Christopher Steele was desperate that Donald Trump not become president. After that happened, Bruce Ohr, one of the top lawyers in the Department of Justice, kept continually meeting and providing information from Christopher Steele to who? The FBI. This is just madness. The American people need to know it. And I will tell you, like I said in the last segment, the fact that the media is ignoring this is even more of a reason that we're going to have to have more information than usual declassified. We're going to have to have, I think, an unprecedented amount of information declassified because the media is just not covering this topic. And I'll just kind of close it with this. Don't forget that Bruce Ohr's wife, Nellie Ohr, who also will have to be interviewed soon, she also was working for Fusion GPS, working for the Clinton campaign. So here you have information flowing from the Clinton campaign from the Russians, likely, likely, I believe was handed directly from Russian propaganda arms to the Clinton campaign, fed into the top levels of the FBI and Department of Justice to open up a counter-intelligence investigation into a political campaign that has now polluted nearly every top official at the DoJ and FBI over the course of the last couple years. It is absolutely amazing."

And that just can't be. We have to have a strong Department of Justice and a strong FBI that stays out of politics. And if we don't get that soon, I think it's just going to continue to deteriorate. And I think it's like the speaker of the house, Paul Ryan, said several months ago, the Department of Justice and the FBI need to decide whether or not they want to be part of the clean-up crew or the cover-up crew. And so right now, I just want to be clear, they are providing, slowly, but they are providing documentation. But we're going to have to have all of this information declassified. And, really, we need an investigation into these top level people as to how somebody concocted the idea that it's OK to take information from one political campaign and use it to open up an investigation on the other political -- on somebody else's opposing political party."

There was no evidence. It was all based on that unverified dossier. Real quick, I'll go one step further in terms of trusting the FBI and the DoJ again. That's not going to happen until there is accountability. Will there be accountability? Will we see prosecutions?"

And it deals with full and complete transparencies, full sunlight on as many of the documents that don't endanger national security, which, you know, from our -- from our committee members, we've sent a letter to the president, we don't believe that they're going to jeopardize any sources or methods. And I think people, I have said many times, are going to be shocked as to what went into a FISA warrant against Carter Page, and even more importantly, what did not go into the FISA application, that was not presented to the court involving the information that they had on Carter Page."

      "utterance": "Thank you so much for joining us, once again. First question, what is the downside risk of the president declassifying all of these documents so everybody can see and putting a light on exactly what took place?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MUKASEY",
      "utterance": "Well, the downside risk is the same as the downside risk of declassifying any classified document, which is that you could disclose methods and sources of intelligence. And when people say that that's a risk, I think we have to sit up and pay attention. On the other hand, there's a lot here that really begs for disclosure, particularly when you consider that the FISA warrant that the Department of Justice obtained on Carter Page, because he was a U.S. citizen, they had to show not only that there was probable cause to think that he was an agent of a foreign power, i.e. Russia, but also probable cause to believe that he was involved in the commission of a crime. Oddly, Carter Page is one person who hasn't been accused of a crime, hasn't been prosecuted for a crime, hasn't been arrested for a crime. And yet that was the basis for getting the FISA warrant. So you start to suspect that the information underlying that warrant was really questionable. Add to that the fact that Steele, who was mentioned by the chairman, was avid in his opposition to now-President Trump. And he was the source of a lot of this information. But he was not the initial source. He was simply the secondary source. They relied on his credibility in a prior case and yet, he was passing on secondary information. They then said that he had been fired, had been excluded from any further involvement because he violated Justice Department policy on talking to the press. What they didn't tell the FISA court is he also lied about whether he had spoken to the press, which is far more important than simply violating policy. In addition, as the chairman pointed out, he then continued to be a source, which they didn't disclose, to the FISA court, through Bruce Ohr."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "I want to talk to you about all of this, what you just said is just compelling. Carter Page was wiretapped for over a year on an unverified dossier. And he's still walking around no charges. Where is the crime? We'll be right back, more with Michael Mukasey next."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Welcome back. I am back with former U.S. Attorney General Michael Mukasey. And a moment ago, Judge, you just said in terms of Bruce Ohr, he's testifying on August 28th. What would you expect from that?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MUKASEY",
      "utterance": "Well, I would expect for him to explain his relationship with Steele, his conversations with Steele, what he obtained on a thumb drive or information stick that he got -- he emailed somebody that he had gotten this from Steele, and whether he was in fact feeding information to the FBI from Steele, notwithstanding that the FISA court had been told that Steele was not any longer a source of information in connection with the investigation."

    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "Has the president read, do you know, the un-redacted documents? Because when Devin Nunes joined us two weeks ago, he said, if you look at these un-redacted documents, and it's all blacked out, you wouldn't believe it, it's worse than what has taken place."

One of the text messages between the anti-Trump FBI agent, Peter Strzok, and his girlfriend Lisa Page, was something that is really not talked about. And I want to go through that text. Let's talk about that and why you see this as particularly troubling for that side."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "MUKASEY",
      "utterance": "OK. The night that now-President Trump got the nomination, Lisa Page sent a message to Peter Strzok: \"Can you believe that Trump got the nomination? This is incredible.\" And Strzok messages back: \"Yes, it is,\" this increases the pressure to end -- \"this is going to increase the pressure to end MYE.\" MYE was the initials..."

      "speaker": "MUKASEY",
      "utterance": "Mid-Year Exam, which is the code name for the Hillary Clinton investigation. Now, why does Donald Trump, getting a nomination, increase the pressure to end that investigation? They kept saying, when Strzok testified that he had a right to express his opinions, and of course, he did, but this wasn't just a matter of political opinion. This was a matter of doing your job, how you do your job, and how investigations were being conducted. If he believed that the nomination of Donald Trump increased the pressure and on the FBI agents to terminate that investigation, it certainly would be interesting to know why and whether they did, and whether they then started Crossfire Hurricane which was the code name for the Donald Trump investigation."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "BARTIROMO",
      "utterance": "So this is more evidence. It suggests to me that Hillary Clinton was not investigated, let's face it, she was not investigated even though she deleted emails, she was grossly negligent with her use of classified information, no investigation or little investigation. And they were cooking up something around Donald Trump to stop him."

    {
      "speaker": "MUKASEY",
      "utterance": "I certainly hope so. I hope that - and then at a minimum, accountability being punishing people, that to me is secondary. I think what I'd like to see is a disclosure of information and get it laid out methodically so that people can see what happened. Who gets punished and who doesn't is - is to me a secondary question (ph)."

And James Freeman, Assistant Editor at the Wall Street Journal editorial page, also a Fox News contributor. Good to see you both, got a lot of topics on the discussion today. We just heard from Devin Nunes and Congressman Schweikert. We talked about a NAFTA (ph), you think we're close on a deal, James, or no?"

I think investors, really everyone was cheering when the president seemed to strike a truce with the E.U. but that was because he said we're moving toward lower barriers. If he forces the deal here where it's more sand in the gears of trade with Mexico and Canada, a sunset provision, make it harder to resolve disputes, that's not going to be good for his plan to get to 5 percent growth."
    },

So that certainly has some impact. Where it is today is the specials are not relevant to what happens in November. We have 87 days to go and a lot is going to happen. You're going to have a president who's going to be very aggressive and be out there campaigning very hard. And I think it's who gets their base out and who gets that swing vote. You need about 10 percent of that swing vote to win. And, you know, nobody can predict what that is today."

So my sense is the key is a plurality of voters are independents, the independents have got to make the difference. And you need about 10 or 15 percent of those independents to make the difference."

And this is why I think he needs to stop fighting with our friends Canada and Mexico, our two biggest export markets. He has largely solved the competitiveness problem of the U.S. economy with the tax cuts and the deregulation initiative. So I think talking about that and letting that work is really both a political and policy strategy for him."
